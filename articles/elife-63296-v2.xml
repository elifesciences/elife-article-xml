However, the mechanisms for local antigen capture and presentation remain unclear. By two-photon microscopy of the mouse lung, we established that soluble antigens in the bronchial airway lumen were efficiently captured and presented by a population of CD11c<sup>+</sup> interstitial macrophages with high CX3CR1-GFP and MHC class II expression. We refer to these cells as Bronchus-Associated Macrophages (BAMs) based on their localization underneath the bronchial epithelium. BAMs were enriched in collagen-rich regions near some airway branchpoints, where inhaled antigens are likely to deposit. BAMs engaged in extended interactions with effector Th2 cells and promoted Th2 cytokine production. BAMs were also often in contact with dendritic cells (DCs). After exposure to inflammatory stimuli, DCs migrated to draining lymph nodes, whereas BAMs remained lung resident. We propose that BAMs act as local antigen presenting cells in the lung and also transfer antigen to DCs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>antigen presenting cell</kwd><kwd>macrophage</kwd><kwd>dendritic cell</kwd><kwd>lung</kwd><kwd>bronchial epithelium</kwd><kwd>th2 cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP2HL117752</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Allen</surname><given-names>Christopher D C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21AI130495</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Allen</surname><given-names>Christopher D C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>UCSF Cardiovascular Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Allen</surname><given-names>Christopher D C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>UCSF Sandler Asthma Basic Research Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Allen</surname><given-names>Christopher D C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001348</institution-id><institution>Agency for Science, Technology and Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tang</surname><given-names>Xin-Zi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32AI007334-31</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kreuk</surname><given-names>Lieselotte S M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>UCSF Program for Breakthrough Biomedical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Allen</surname><given-names>Christopher D C</given-names></name><name><surname>Metzger</surname><given-names>Ross J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32HL007731-28</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kreuk</surname><given-names>Lieselotte S M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Lung interstitial macrophages are strategically positioned underneath the bronchial airway epithelium and enriched at airway bifurcations for immunosurveillance of the conducting airway lumen and the initiation of adaptive immune responses.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Immune surveillance of barrier surfaces is essential for the maintenance of tissue homeostasis and defense against pathogens. Within the lung, the conducting bronchial airways represent one of the first sites of exposure to inhaled substances and infectious agents. In allergic asthma, the inhalation of harmless environmental allergens leads to peribronchial inflammation, in which the local activation of type 2 helper T cells (Th2 cells) results in effector cytokine production that promotes pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Holgate, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lambrecht et al., 2019</xref>). The Th2 cells are activated by antigen presenting cells (APCs) that survey the epithelial barrier and capture and present antigen. However, the types of APCs contributing to surveillance of the conducting airways are not fully characterized, and the anatomical organization that couples antigen capture to Th2 cell activation remains unclear.</p><p>The lung tissue regions around the conducting airways may be ideal sites for antigen surveillance and the initiation of immune responses. Unlike alveolar spaces, the conducting airways do not participate in gaseous exchange but serve to conduct and filter air. As inspired air passes through airway branchpoints, changes in the direction of airflow promote the deposition of particulates and the dissolution of soluble substances in the overlying mucus layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carvalho et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clarke and Yeates, 1994</xref>). In allergic asthma, eosinophils and lymphocytes are recruited to regions around the conducting airways, resulting in peribronchial inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jeffery, 1992</xref>). In several mouse models of airway infections, T and B cells accumulate in organized foci near the airways, forming induced Bronchus-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (BALT) structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fleige and Förster, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Randall, 2010</xref>). The accumulation of immune cells in tissue regions near the conducting airways may allow streamlined access to inhaled antigens that have become deposited.</p><p>The mechanism by which antigen capture and immune activation occurs at the airways is unclear. Most studies have focused on the potential contributions of dendritic cells (DCs) to allergic inflammation in the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wikstrom and Stumbles, 2007</xref>), based initially on observations that MHC-II<sup>+</sup> cells with dendritic morphology were abundant along both human and rodent airways at baseline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Demedts et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huh et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lambrecht et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">von Garnier et al., 2007</xref>). Flow cytometric analysis of lung-draining lymph nodes, dissociated lung tissue enriched for the conducting airways, and the trachea also showed that DCs, gated as CD11c<sup>+</sup> MHC-II<sup>+</sup> cells, were able to capture, process, and present fluorescent ovalbumin (OVA) administered via the airways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">del Rio et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fear et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hammad et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huh et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">von Garnier et al., 2007</xref>). The uptake of OVA by CD11c<sup>+</sup> MHC-II<sup>+</sup> cells throughout the lung has also been observed by confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hoffmann et al., 2018</xref>) however, two-photon microscopy studies of CD11c-YFP reporter mice found that DCs near the conducting airways did not detectably capture soluble antigens (OVA or dextran), or particulate antigens in the form of beads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Thornton et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Veres et al., 2011</xref>). CD11c-YFP<sup>+</sup> DCs were reported to capture beads at the alveoli in a mouse model of asthma, and then were proposed to migrate to tissue regions proximal to the bronchial airways, where T cells are activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Thornton et al., 2012</xref>). This mechanism might be relevant for the uptake and presentation of particulate antigens that reach the alveoli, but whether soluble antigen can be directly captured and presented by APCs at the conducting airways remains unclear. The presentation of soluble antigens is pertinent because it was reported that individuals allergic to aeroallergens had an increased frequency of Th2 cells that preferentially recognized soluble antigen components of aeroallergens, whereas regulatory T cells preferentially recognized particulate antigen components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bacher et al., 2016</xref>). Developing a better understanding of the uptake and presentation of soluble antigens may therefore be of significant relevance to Th2 cell responses in asthma.</p><p>In the intestine, soluble antigen in the lumen is efficiently captured by CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> macrophages in the lamina propria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Farache et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Farache et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mazzini et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schulz et al., 2009</xref>). These intestinal macrophages were found to be distinct from conventional DCs (cDCs) based on functional and behavioral differences and were reported to contribute to local intestinal immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hadis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mazzini et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schreiber et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schulz et al., 2009</xref>). Recent gene expression and microscopy studies of the lung have identified CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> interstitial macrophages (IMs) that are distinct from alveolar macrophages (AMs). Notably, subpopulation(s) of these IMs express many of the surface markers previously thought to be exclusive to DCs, such as MHC-II and CD11c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chakarov et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gautier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gibbings et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sabatel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schlitzer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schyns et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ural et al., 2020</xref>). While most studies on resident tissue macrophages have focused on comparing various macrophage populations to each other, how lung DCs and IMs compare in their behaviors and functions is yet unclear.</p><p>Here, we show that in the steady state in naïve mice, lung myeloid APCs are primarily positioned underneath the bronchial airway epithelium and are strategically enriched near some airway branchpoints where inhaled allergens are likely to deposit. We found that at these regions, the majority of inhaled soluble antigens were captured by CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> CD11c<sup>+</sup> MHC-II<sup>+</sup> IMs rather than DCs. We observed frequent contacts between CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> CD11c<sup>+</sup> MHC-II<sup>+</sup> IMs and DCs, suggesting the possibility of antigen transfer to DCs. Yet CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> CD11c<sup>+</sup> MHC-II<sup>+</sup> IMs themselves were capable of antigen processing and presentation, activated T cells in vitro, and interacted with T cells recruited to the airways in an asthma model. Unlike DCs, CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> CD11c<sup>+</sup> MHC-II<sup>+</sup> IMs did not migrate to the draining lymph node and remained lung resident. We therefore propose that CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> CD11c<sup>+</sup> MHC-II<sup>+</sup> IMs located near the bronchial airways are tissue-resident sentinel APCs that are able to drive local allergic inflammation, whereas DCs may be more critical for priming T cell responses in lymph nodes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Myeloid cells are enriched near bifurcating airways prior to the induction of inflammation</title><p>Peribronchial inflammation is a hallmark of asthma that is recapitulated in mouse models of allergic airway disease. Foci of leukocytes can be observed near the bronchi that include numerous eosinophils. In our own studies of mouse models of allergic airway disease, such as in a classical model with OVA as an allergen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Daubeuf and Frossard, 2013</xref>), we observed in thin cryosections that these foci were not evenly distributed along the airway, but rather were typically located near airway branchpoints and associated with large blood vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These areas were further visualized in 3D in agarose-inflated, thick lung sections that were precision cut with a vibratome and imaged by two-photon laser scanning microscopy (hereafter referred to as two-photon microscopy). Bronchial airway epithelial cells were revealed by GFP expression when we crossed Sonic hedgehog (Shh)-Cre mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harfe et al., 2004</xref>) to ROSA26-mTmG reporter mice, in which Cre-mediated recombination leads to the expression of membrane-bound GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Muzumdar et al., 2007</xref>). Alveolar epithelial cells also express GFP in these mice, with alveolar type II cells appearing more prominently due to their cuboidal shape, whereas all other cells express membrane-bound tdTomato. Collagen was detected by second harmonic generation. Our imaging revealed regions near some airway branchpoints with dense accumulations of collagen surrounding blood vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). These regions likely represent bronchovascular bundles which are known to contain bronchi and arteries in a common adventitial sheath (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Townsley, 2012</xref>). Bifurcating blood vessels, visualized by membrane-bound tdTomato, were also visible at some collagen-rich sites in which the airways appeared to undergo planar bifurcation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Metzger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Myeloid cells are strategically positioned for surveillance of the airways.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative immunofluorescence staining of thin cryostat sections of the lung from wild-type mice sensitized and challenged with OVA in a classical OVA model of allergic airway disease.

To visualize myeloid cell infiltration, we imaged thick lung sections from mice expressing the MacGreen (CSF1R-GFP) reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sasmono et al., 2003</xref>) by two-photon microscopy. In MacGreen mice, we had previously observed that most myeloid cells including macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, and CD11b<sup>+</sup> DCs brightly expressed the GFP reporter, although eosinophils exhibited much lower GFP expression (data not shown). As some B cells were also found to express GFP in these mice (unpublished observations), we had crossed the MacGreen mice to B-cell-deficient μMT mice so that GFP expression was restricted to myeloid cells. At the collagen-rich regions near some bifurcating airways, we observed dense accumulations of myeloid cells in both OVA and house dust mite (HDM) models of allergic airway disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). Interestingly, in naïve mice, a sparse population of MacGreen<sup>+</sup> cells was also observed at these collagen-rich regions near bifurcating airways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), suggesting that myeloid cells may localize to these areas prior to the formation of foci of leukocytes during inflammation. Notably, these myeloid cells were best visualized in naïve mice in thick lung sections by two-photon microscopy, because in thin cryosections the very low density of cells made it difficult to discern their distribution.</p><p>To further evaluate the types of myeloid cells located at these sites in the steady state, we imaged IMs and DCs using the CX3CR1-GFP and CD11c-YFP reporters, respectively, in thick lung sections by two-photon microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gibbings et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jung et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lindquist et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rodero et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Thornton et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Veres et al., 2011</xref>). In order to specifically visualize IMs and DCs, our analysis focused on cells with bright expression of these fluorescent reporters using limiting laser power, as other cell types have weaker expression of these fluorescent reporters. For example, AMs, which express high amounts of surface CD11c protein, are known to have low expression of the CD11c-YFP transgene in naïve mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rodero et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Thornton et al., 2012</xref>).

In naïve mice, we observed clusters of bright CX3CR1-GFP<sup>+</sup> IMs and CD11c-YFP<sup>+</sup> DCs at some airway bifurcations in collagen-rich regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and H</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Videos 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">3</xref>). Scattered bright CX3CR1-GFP<sup>+</sup> IMs were also observed underneath the entire bronchial airway epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). Bright CX3CR1-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells were more abundant at the airways than at the alveoli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), and bright CD11c-YFP<sup>+</sup> DCs were only rarely observed at the alveoli in naïve mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Taken together, these findings indicate that in the steady-state in the absence of inflammation, both IMs and DCs are located near bronchial airways and may be particularly enriched in collagen-rich regions near bifurcations. These regions correspond to the sites where eosinophils and other leukocytes accumulate in allergic airway disease, suggesting a potential role for these IMs and/or DCs in the initiation of the local inflammatory response.</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" id="video2" xlink:href="elife-63296-video2.mp4"><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>CX3CR1-GFP<sup>bright</sup> IMs are positioned under the bronchial airway epithelium and are enriched at collagen-rich regions near branchpoints.</title><p>The video is a 3D rendering of the image depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> (left panel), showing branching airways and blood vessels (BV) in the lung of a naïve mouse expressing CX3CR1-GFP (green) to visualize IMs, together with E-cadherin-mCFP (blue) to visualize epithelial cells.

In addition, the distribution of CX3CR1-GFP<sup>+</sup> IMs underneath the entire bronchial airway epithelium suggests that these cells may generally be involved in surveillance of the airways. We next considered whether inhaled soluble antigens could be directly captured by the CX3CR1-GFP<sup>+</sup> IMs and CD11c-YFP<sup>+</sup> DCs located near the bronchial airways. In order to visualize the uptake of soluble protein antigens from the airway lumen, we instilled fluorescent OVA intranasally and prepared precision-cut lung slices 1–2 hr later for imaging by two-photon microscopy.

To confirm preferential uptake in CX3CR1-GFP<sup>+</sup> IMs rather than CD11c-YFP<sup>+</sup> DCs, we administered fluorescent OVA intranasally to mice simultaneously expressing both CX3CR1-GFP and CD11c-YFP reporters. This combination of fluorescent reporters has been helpful in the intestine to distinguish DC and macrophage subsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Farache et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McDole et al., 2012</xref>), and we optimized methodology to minimize the spectral overlap of GFP and YFP by two-photon microscopy (see Methods section for details). Our imaging of dual reporter mice confirmed that OVA was preferentially captured by bright CX3CR1-GFP<sup>+</sup> IMs rather than bright CD11c-YFP<sup>+</sup> DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Quantification of OVA uptake indicated that CD11c-YFP<sup>+</sup> DCs captured much smaller amounts of OVA than CX3CR1-GFP<sup>+</sup> IMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We also observed preferential uptake of fluorescently labelled extracts from HDM, a relevant aeroallergen, by bright CX3CR1-GFP<sup>+</sup> IMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Our imaging also confirmed that bright CX3CR1-GFP<sup>+</sup> and bright CD11c-YFP<sup>+</sup> cells were largely non-overlapping populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and F</xref>). When we increased the image contrast, we observed that some of the bright CX3CR1-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells did have dim expression of CD11c-YFP, and vice versa, as expected from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jung et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Occasionally, we also observed rare cells that were bright for both the CX3CR1-GFP and CD11c-YFP reporters, yet the majority of cells in the naïve state appeared to be bright for only one of these reporters suggesting they were distinct cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Indeed, CX3CR1-GFP<sup>+</sup> IMs had a dendritic morphology as we had noted above, whereas CD11c-YFP<sup>+</sup> DCs were rounder and did not appear to extend long processes. We quantified these morphologic features by measuring sphericity as well as the length of the longest axis of each cell to characterize the dendritic projections. CX3CR1-GFP<sup>+</sup> IMs had lower sphericity values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) and increased mean lengths of their longest axes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>) compared to CD11c-YFP<sup>+</sup> DCs. The disparity in morphology and antigen uptake capacity suggests that CX3CR1-GFP<sup>+</sup> IMs and CD11c-YFP<sup>+</sup> DCs are two distinct cell populations present in airway-adjacent areas in the steady state, and that CX3CR1-GFP<sup>+</sup> IMs are the primary antigen capturing cell type at the airways.</p><p>We confirmed these microscopy observations by flow cytometric analysis of CX3CR1-GFP versus CD11c-YFP reporter mice after instillation of fluorescent OVA. This analysis confirmed that the average intensity of fluorescent OVA was over three-fold brighter in CX3CR1-GFP<sup>bright</sup> IMs compared with CD11c-YFP<sup>bright</sup> DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A and B</xref>). Microscopy detects a comparably narrower dynamic range of fluorescent signals than flow cytometry, and thus we most likely only visualized CX3CR1-GFP<sup>bright</sup> IMs that carried the most OVA. Indeed, when we gated specifically on OVA<sup>bright</sup> MHC-II<sup>+</sup> cells by flow cytometry, the majority of cells were CX3CR1-GFP<sup>bright</sup> but not CD11c-YFP<sup>bright</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C and D</xref>). Therefore, our results show that DCs also take up soluble antigen from the bronchial airway lumen, but that the majority of antigen is taken up by a distinct population of CX3CR1-GFP<sup>+</sup> IMs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>CX3CR1-GFP<sup>bright</sup> antigen capturing cells are Bronchus-Associated Macrophages (BAMs)</title><p>We next evaluated whether the CX3CR1-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells that captured soluble inhaled antigen expressed MHC-II and confirmed their macrophage identity by flow cytometry. This was important given that CX3CR1-GFP is also expressed in other cell types, such as monocytes, a subset of DCs, and some lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jung et al., 2000</xref>). For this analysis, we excluded AMs using the marker Siglec-F, as these cells often confound the gating of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells by flow cytometry due to their autofluorescence, yet based on their round morphology and alveolar localization were clearly distinct from the antigen-capturing CX3CR1-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells near the airways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). After administering fluorescent OVA intranasally and then isolating and enzymatically digesting the lungs, our flow cytometric analysis showed that the CX3CR1-GFP<sup>bright</sup> OVA<sup>bright</sup> cells were predominantly MHC-II<sup>hi</sup> and CD11c<sup>mid</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The presence of these cells in naïve mice and high MHC-II expression suggested they were not derived from inflammatory monocytes. The CX3CR1-GFP<sup>bright</sup> OVA<sup>bright</sup> cells also predominantly expressed the macrophage markers CD64 and MerTK, and had relatively low to undetectable staining for the cDC marker CD24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>), consistent with surface markers previously established for IMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gautier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guilliams et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schlitzer et al., 2013</xref>). Conversely, the majority of the CD11c-YFP<sup>bright</sup> cells were MHC-II<sup>+</sup>, CD11c<sup>mid-hi</sup> and CD24<sup>hi</sup> but did not express CD64 and MerTK, thus representing cDCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). Notably, CD64<sup>+</sup> OVA<sup>bright</sup> cells were largely CD11c-YFP<sup>–</sup> but did express surface CD11c by antibody staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), albeit with reduced abundance compared to cDCs, indicating the expression of the CD11c-YFP transgene is more restricted to DCs than the CD11c protein, consistent with a prior study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rodero et al., 2015</xref>). The small fraction of CD64<sup>+</sup> OVA<sup>bright</sup> cells that were also CD11c-YFP<sup>bright</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) may correspond to the rare cells we had observed by microscopy that were bright for both CX3CR1-GFP and CD11c-YFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). We found that monocytes, which resolve into two subsets based on CX3CR1-GFP expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Geissmann et al., 2003</xref>), and the CX3CR1-GFP<sup>+</sup> subset of cDC2s, all had lower CX3CR1-GFP expression than the MHC-II<sup>+</sup> CD64<sup>+</sup> MerTK<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), consistent with our imaging data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Again, as microscopy has a more limited dynamic range than flow cytometry and we had focused our imaging on bright cells using limiting laser power, this likely favored our specific visualization of CX3CR1-GFP<sup>bright</sup> cells. To indeed verify that the CX3CR1-GFP<sup>bright</sup> cells we had observed near the bronchial airway epithelium by microscopy were represented by the CX3CR1-GFP<sup>bright</sup> CD64<sup>+</sup> MHC-II<sup>+</sup> IMs identified by flow cytometry, we stained precision-cut thick lung slices from CX3CR1-GFP or CD11c-YFP mice with antibodies against CD64 and MHC-II. By two-photon microscopy, we confirmed that the CX3CR1-GFP<sup>bright</sup> cells located near the bronchial airways were CD64<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). In contrast, the CD11c-YFP<sup>bright</sup> cells were CD64-negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

One recent study defined a subset of IMs as nerve and airway associated macrophages (NAMs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ural et al., 2020</xref>). However, this population of NAMs was notable for very high CD169 expression, yet our flow cytometric and scRNAseq analyses suggested the antigen-capturing BAMs near the airways were low to negative for CD169 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

In order to activate T cells, APCs need to process antigen and present antigen peptides on MHC-II on their cell surface. We used the Y-Ae antibody to test whether BAMs were able to process and present antigen. The Y-Ae antibody specifically recognizes the Eα peptide, a peptide fragment of the I-E MHC-II molecule, presented on the I-A<sup>b</sup> MHC-II molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Murphy et al., 1992</xref>). C57BL/6 mice do not express I-E and thus Eα represents a foreign peptide. The Eα peptide was fused to OVA, administered intranasally together with fluorescent OVA to label antigen-capturing cells, and then OVA<sup>+</sup> lung APCs were analyzed 17–18 hr later to allow time for antigen processing and presentation. Both BAMs and cDC2s stained with the Y-Ae antibody by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), demonstrating that BAMs processed and presented antigen, like DCs, rather than simply degrading it. Minimal Y-Ae staining was observed 15 min after OVA-Eα was administered, confirming that antigen processing and presentation were needed for detection of MHC-II:Eα complexes on the cell surface (data not shown). Brighter Y-Ae staining was observed on BAMs compared with cDC2s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), consistent with the superior soluble antigen uptake we had observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). AMs, with low MHC-II expression and a high degradative capacity, showed negligible Y-Ae staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), confirming these are not the relevant APCs for CD4 T cells. We also tested whether BAMs could provide the necessary co-stimulatory signals for T cell activation and found that BAMs had higher surface expression of the co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 compared to cDC2s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). To determine whether BAMs were able to activate CD4 T cells, BAMs were sorted by FACS and co-cultured with OT-II TCR transgenic T cells, which respond to an OVA peptide presented on I-A<sup>b</sup> by APCs. As a positive control for APC function in cell culture, cDC2s were sorted and co-cultured with OT-II T cells. When cultured in the presence of OVA peptide, BAMs induced the robust proliferation of naïve OT-II T cells, albeit somewhat less efficiently than cDC2s, as expected, given the high efficiency of naïve T cell activation by DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Interestingly, BAMs and cDC2s equivalently induced IL-13 production when co-cultured with Th2 polarized, effector OT-II cells and OVA peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).

Naïve OT-II T cells expressing CFP (β-actin CFP) or tdTomato (CD4-Cre Ai14) were adoptively transferred into CX3CR1-GFP X CD11c-YFP mice and then primed in vivo, which resulted in expansion and recruitment to the lungs.

However, in other studies, cells with similar markers as BAMs, referred to as monocyte-derived DCs, had been observed in the draining lymph node harboring antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Plantinga et al., 2013</xref>). We therefore tested whether BAMs were able to migrate to the right posterior mediastinal lymph node that drains the lung. We first considered the expression of the chemokine receptor CCR7, which is necessary for migration to lymph nodes and is upregulated following exposure to inflammatory stimuli. We analyzed the cell surface expression of CCR7 on DCs and BAMs after administering LPS or HDM as inflammatory stimuli. After 4 hr, we found that CCR7 was upregulated on a significant proportion of DCs in a dose-dependent manner, but not on BAMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E–F</xref>). We also tested whether OVA, which does not have intrinsic inflammatory properties, would induce CCR7 upregulation in previously sensitized mice in which OVA-specific effector/memory T cells could induce maturation of the APCs. Indeed, after OVA challenge, DCs upregulated CCR7 expression in previously sensitized mice but not in naïve mice exposed to OVA for the first time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>). Conversely, BAMs did not upregulate CCR7 in either sensitized or naïve mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>). As such, the expression of CCR7 only on the DCs, but not BAMs, would likely allow DCs to selectively migrate to the lymph node. To further assess whether DCs or BAMs entered and migrated in lymphatic vessels within the lung by two-photon microscopy, we visualized lymphatics by breeding Prox1-tdTomato transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Truman et al., 2012</xref>) to CD11c-YFP or CX3CR1-GFP mice. After intranasal instillation of HDM or LPS, we frequently observed CD11c-YFP<sup>+</sup> cells, but not CX3CR1-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells, migrating within lung lymphatics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">Videos 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video9">9</xref>). To determine which cells carried antigen into the lymph node, we intranasally instilled PE. With a molecular weight of 240 kDa, PE is too large to enter the conduit system of the lymph node (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roozendaal et al., 2009</xref>) and thus can only reach the lymph node parenchyma when carried by APCs. As an inflammatory stimulus to promote APC trafficking to the lymph node, we administered HDM extract together with the PE. This led to the recruitment of a population of CD64<sup>+</sup> MHC-II<sup>+</sup> cells that were Ly6C<sup>+</sup> to the draining mediastinal lymph node 1 d later. However, these CD64<sup>+</sup> MHC-II<sup>+</sup> Ly6C<sup>+</sup> cells were PE<sup>–</sup>, whereas we were readily able to identify a fraction of DCs that were PE<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I–J</xref>). Thus, the CD64<sup>+</sup> MHC-II<sup>+</sup> Ly6C<sup>+</sup> cells were not transporting PE from the lung to the lymph node. The high surface expression of Ly6C on the CD64<sup>+</sup> MHC-II<sup>+</sup> cells also suggests that they were not BAMs, which have low to moderate surface expression of Ly6C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Instead, the high expression of Ly6C suggests that the CD64<sup>+</sup> MHC-II<sup>+</sup> cells were derived from monocytes that were recruited to the lymph node from the bloodstream and had upregulated CD64 and MHC-II in response to the inflammatory conditions. Taken together, these findings indicate that BAMs capture antigen at the airways but do not migrate to the draining lymph node. In contrast, DCs are induced to migrate to the draining LN in response to inflammatory stimuli or in the context of adaptive immune responses.</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" id="video8" xlink:href="elife-63296-video8.mp4"><label>Video 8.</label><caption><title>Some DCs enter lymphatics.</title><p>The video is a time-lapse image sequence showing CD11c-YFP<sup>bright</sup> DCs (green) migrating within a Prox1-tdTomato<sup>+</sup> lymphatic vessel (red).

Our analysis of APCs at the airways revealed an abundant population of MHC-II<sup>hi</sup> IMs positioned under the bronchial airway epithelium that sampled soluble luminal antigen, which we term BAMs. We found that BAMs were particularly enriched in collagen-rich regions near some airway branchpoints and engaged in extensive interactions with DCs. In addition, we demonstrated that BAMs were capable of antigen presentation to T cells and interacted with recruited T cells near the airways in an allergic airway disease model. While DCs migrated to the draining lymph node, BAMs remained resident in the lung after antigen capture, even in the presence of inflammatory stimuli. These findings support a model in which BAMs may locally activate effector/memory T cells recruited to the lung, whereas migratory DCs are likely critical for T cell priming in lymph nodes.</p><p>In characterizing the localization of lung cDCs and BAMs, we found that in naïve mice, both cell types were positioned around the conducting airways, and were especially enriched at some airway branchpoints in collagen-rich regions. This positioning likely facilitates the uptake of antigens that have deposited at airway branchpoints, where airflow changes directions, leading to the activation of adaptive immune responses at these locations. We found that these sites corresponded to the regions where inflammatory clusters form in allergic airway disease models. BALT has also been observed near airway bifurcations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bienenstock and McDermott, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Randall, 2010</xref>). Our observation that BAMs and DCs were enriched near airway branchpoints in the steady state, prior to immunization, suggests that airway branchpoints are ideal sites for continuous immunosurveillance of the bronchial airway lumen, enabling the rapid local activation of antigen-specific T cells and the generation of an inflammatory response. While most of the lung is filled with alveolar space to support gaseous exchange, these collagen-rich adventitial regions of connective tissue and interstitial space in the bronchovascular bundles represent a site where immune cells may be recruited. Recent work indicates that similar interstitial spaces may be found in other organs and that the adventitial ‘cuff’ regions may generally be important sites for tissue immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benias et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dahlgren and Molofsky, 2019</xref>).</p><p>While both BAMs and DCs are strategically positioned in the lung for immunosurveillance, they differ substantially in the efficiency of antigen uptake in the steady state. Consistent with previous imaging studies of CD11c-YFP mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Thornton et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Veres et al., 2011</xref>), we observed minimal fluorescent antigen uptake by CD11c-YFP<sup>+</sup> DCs near the airways by microscopy. Our quantitative analysis of microscope images and flow cytometry revealed that CD11c-YFP<sup>+</sup> DCs were nevertheless taking up low amounts of soluble antigen. In contrast, BAMs took up higher amounts of antigen that were readily visible by imaging. In a similar manner, IMs are superior at capturing soluble antigen from the intestinal lumen compared to DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mazzini et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schulz et al., 2009</xref>). Although one group reported equivalent uptake of antigen by DCs and IMs in the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hoffmann et al., 2018</xref>), this was likely due to contamination of their DC population, which was defined as CD11c<sup>+</sup> MHC-II<sup>+</sup> cells, by BAMs. We have shown here that BAMs express surface CD11c and MHC-II, yet BAMs exhibit distinct antigen uptake, morphology, and motility characteristics compared with cDCs. Considering that BAMs look more dendritic than lung cDCs and are MHC-II<sup>hi</sup>, it is likely that the MHC-II<sup>+</sup> dendritiform cells identified in rodent airways in earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fear et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huh et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">von Garnier et al., 2007</xref>) were actually BAMs rather than DCs. The stellate shape of BAMs is reminiscent of recent imaging studies of IMs in other tissues, such as in the kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stamatiades et al., 2016</xref>), and may facilitate antigen sampling.</p><p>We observed that BAMs engaged in frequent, extensive interactions with DCs. The punctate localization of CD169 at the interacting surface between BAMs and DCs suggests this cell contact has biological significance, given precedent for a role for CD169 in antigen transfer from macrophages to DCs in the spleen and lymph nodes that contributed to cross-presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">van Dinther et al., 2018</xref>). Phagocytosed antigen could potentially be passed from BAMs to DCs, similar to intestinal macrophages which have been shown to pass antigen to DCs through gap junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mazzini et al., 2014</xref>). Peptide-MHC complexes could also potentially exchange from BAMs to DCs through trogocytosis. BAMs could thus play an important role in immunosurveillance, both directly and through antigen transfer to DCs.</p><p>During inflammatory exposures, BAMs stay resident near the bronchial airways, whereas some DCs migrate to the draining lymph node. Consequently, BAMs may play an important role in the local activation of effector/memory T cells recruited to the lung. After initial sensitization, effector T cells were recruited to the airway interstitium where BAMs were abundant as early as 4–6 hr after allergen challenge and formed long interactions with BAMs, reminiscent of activating interactions previously observed between T cells and DCs in the lymph node (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mempel et al., 2004</xref>). These interactions may lead to the production of chemotactic factors that recruit additional cells to these sites forming inflammatory foci. Thus, the recruitment and activation of T cells at the bronchial airway interstitium, where BAMs display captured antigen, would provide a basis for the initiation of allergic inflammation during allergen re-exposure in sensitized individuals. In the intestine and adipose tissue, resident macrophages were also reported to activate effector T cells and shape local immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cho et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kamada et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schreiber et al., 2013</xref>); BAMs may be the functional equivalent of these macrophages at the airways.</p><p>Here we reported the rapid and efficient uptake of soluble antigen across a range of sizes by BAMs, with the magnitude of antigen uptake inversely proportional to antigen size. We did not readily observe dendrite extension through the epithelial barrier by live microscopy, making this unlikely to account for the widespread antigen uptake by BAMs, and therefore suggesting that BAMs capture soluble antigens by alternative mechanism(s). Soluble antigens may instead be captured after diffusing across the airway epithelial barrier. This model may account for the reduced uptake of larger molecular weight antigens, which would be less effective at diffusing across the epithelium. In the intestine, it was reported that low molecular weight soluble antigens passed through goblet cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McDole et al., 2012</xref>). Although few goblet cells are present in the murine lung in the steady state, whether soluble antigens could also pass through the more abundant club cells remains to be determined. The increase in goblet cells that occurs in allergic airway disease might also facilitate the passage of soluble antigens and thus further promote the inflammatory response. At sites of BALT formation, the follicle-associated epithelium containing microfold (M) cells has also been reported to facilitate the uptake of soluble antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bienenstock and Befus, 1984</xref>). Alternatively, soluble antigen may pass through gaps in the airway epithelium, such as tri-junctional complexes located where three epithelial cells meet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Patton, 1992</xref>). The 200 nm bead particles that we tested would be too large to pass through the gaps in tri-junctional complexes that average 27 nm, consistent with our observation of minimal bead uptake around the airways by either BAMs or DCs. Interestingly, one study reported that very small 20 nm beads were captured by some MHC-II<sup>+</sup> cells underneath the tracheal epithelium, although the majority of beads of a range of sizes were captured by AMs in the lung parenchyma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blank et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, we also observed that 200 nm beads were primarily captured within the alveolar spaces by AMs. Another study observed the uptake of 1000 nm beads by DCs located at the alveoli, but not by DCs located near the conducting airways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Thornton et al., 2012</xref>). In that study, previously sensitized mice were rechallenged with antigen while beads were administered, creating an inflammatory state in which monocyte-derived cells and DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jenkins and Hume, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rodero et al., 2015</xref>) likely were recruited to the alveolar regions and captured beads. In the steady state, DCs are largely restricted to the regions near bronchial airways, yet monocytes have also been reported to patrol the alveoli and capture beads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rodero et al., 2015</xref>). Overall, our work reveals that at the bronchial interstitium, small soluble antigens are preferentially captured by BAMs.</p><p>The form and size of an antigen was recently reported to affect the type of T cell responses induced, as type 2 allergic responses were primarily directed to small soluble antigens whereas regulatory T cell responses were primarily directed to particulate antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bacher et al., 2016</xref>), though the mechanism was not explored. Our finding that soluble and particulate antigens are preferentially captured in different regions of the lung leads us to propose that the anatomic location of antigen uptake ultimately influences the final T cell response. The tissue signals inherent in different anatomic environments may prime divergent immune responses. In the alveoli, the abundant AMs have been proposed in several studies to dampen allergic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mathias et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zasłona et al., 2014</xref>). Macrophages that were earlier found in the alveolar interstitium were also reported to produce IL-10 and reduce inflammation in allergic airway disease models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bedoret et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kawano et al., 2016</xref>). The tissue environment at the alveoli thus appears to favor reduced inflammation in the delicate alveolar tissue, in the absence of overt infection in this region. Instead, the airways may be more permissive to the induction of inflammation as indicated by the concentration of immune responses at airway adjacent regions. Future work on the functional capacities and/or cytokine profiles of BAMs would further inform our understanding of the inflammatory milieu at the airway microenvironment.</p><p>We propose that BAMs represent a subset of IMs specialized for sampling the bronchial airway lumen. This work extends the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gibbings et al., 2017</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rodero et al., 2015</xref> who first observed CX3CR1-GFP<sup>+</sup> IMs localized near the bronchial airways. IM populations near the alveoli have also been reported in microscopy studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bedoret et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schyns et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tan and Krasnow, 2016</xref>). Multiple subsets of IMs have also been described based on different combinations of surface markers by flow cytometric analysis, as well as distinct transcriptional profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chakarov et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gibbings et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sabatel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schyns et al., 2019</xref>). There is a lack of consensus on the identification and localization of the IM subsets, and it seems likely that diverse pathogen exposures in different mouse facilities may affect baseline inflammation and the relative abundance of different subsets. This may explain, for example, why we observed few CD169<sup>bright</sup> macrophages near the airways and nerves, whereas another group found these were abundant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ural et al., 2020</xref>). Of note, most of our mice for this study were bred in a ‘super-barrier’ mouse facility that excludes additional pathogens compared to standard SPF facilities. Here we have focused specifically on the subpopulation of IMs localized near the bronchial airway epithelium that we found readily captures soluble inhaled antigens in naïve mice. We propose that the field consider referring to these macrophages as BAMs based on their anatomic localization near the bronchial airways, much as it has been useful to classify AMs based on their anatomic location. We found that BAMs expressed high amounts of MHC-II; were efficient at antigen capture, processing and presentation; and interacted with effector T cells in vivo; suggesting that BAMs serve as APCs near the bronchial airways. Our finding that BAMs expressed high amounts of surface MHC-II differs from a recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schyns et al., 2019</xref>, which reported MHC-II<sup>+</sup> CX3CR1-GFP<sup>+</sup> IMs were primarily localized near the alveoli. This difference is likely due to technical differences in our imaging approaches. We imaged native GFP fluorescence in unfixed tissue allowing us to preferentially visualize CX3CR1-GFP<sup>bright</sup> BAMs, whereas Schyns et al. used anti-GFP antibody amplification of CX3CR1-GFP signal in fixed tissue, which would have likely resulted in the visualization of a much larger population of cells with varying expression of CX3CR1-GFP, including monocytes and DCs. We also imaged thick tissue vibratome sections by two-photon microscopy whereas Schyns et al. imaged thin cryosections by confocal microscopy. We found the analysis of thick sections to be particularly useful to try to discern the cellular distribution of BAMs in unimmunized mice, whereas in thin sections the cells were too sparse.</p><p>Emerging data from microarray and RNAseq analyses have highlighted the distinct gene expression patterns of IMs, AMs and DCs in the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chakarov et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gautier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gibbings et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schlitzer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schyns et al., 2019</xref>), which we have further elaborated here by our scRNAseq analysis of CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells. Functional studies in other tissues such as the intestine have revealed distinct contributions of macrophages and DCs to immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kamada et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mazzini et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schreiber et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schulz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shaw et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we have shown that BAMs, as a subset of IMs, are distinct from lung cDCs in morphology, antigen uptake capacity and the ability to migrate to the draining lymph node. It is important to note that under inflammatory conditions, including in mouse models of allergic airway disease, monocytes rapidly enter lung tissue and differentiate into monocyte-derived cells that express surface markers that bear some resemblance to resident DCs and macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guilliams et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jakubzick et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Plantinga et al., 2013</xref>). Although the MAR-1 antibody to FcεRI was thought to be a marker of these monocyte-derived cells, we recently established that this antibody also binds to CD64 and FcγRIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tang et al., 2019</xref>), and thus would also detect resident CD64<sup>+</sup> macrophages. Recent studies of respiratory viral infection have also revealed the recruitment of a subpopulation of cDCs to the lung that stain with MAR-1 and express CD64 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bosteels et al., 2020</xref>), further confounding the use of these markers to distinguish macrophages and cDCs in the context of inflammation. One microscopy study of the lungs of mice administered HDM reported an increase in the abundance of CD64<sup>+</sup> “DCs” identified by CD11c and MHC-II expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hoffmann et al., 2018</xref>), which likely consisted of a heterogeneous mixture of cDCs, resident BAMs and monocyte-derived cells. Another study used an extensive analysis of the ratio of expression of CX3CR1-GFP and CD11c-mCherry reporters to determine the relative differentiation state of infiltrating monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sen et al., 2016</xref>). This paper showed an increase in the abundance of cells with high expression of both CX3CR1-GFP and CD11c-mCherry reporters in allergic airway inflammation models. These cells were proposed to represent differentiated monocyte-derived cells, and we speculate that the rare cells we observed that were bright for CX3CR1-GFP and CD11c-YFP reporters in naïve mice may also represent cells that had recently differentiated from monocytes. One challenge, however, in relating this study to our findings presented here is that the high expression of CX3CR1-GFP in resident BAMs versus the lower expression in monocytes was not considered in the analysis of the ratio of CX3CR1-GFP to CD11c-mCherry expression, which formed the basis of the monocyte differentiation model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sen et al., 2016</xref>). Similar to BAMs and DCs, monocyte-derived cells have been reported to activate T cells and drive allergic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Plantinga et al., 2013</xref>). Conversely, monocyte-derived cells and IMs have also been reported to promote tolerance and dampen inflammation in the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bedoret et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kawano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sabatel et al., 2017</xref>). Although all these APCs may exhibit some overlap in their ability to activate T cells, it seems likely that these different cell types may skew T cell responses at the airways in distinct ways. Further studies with selective tools for manipulation will be needed to elucidate the specific contributions of BAMs, DCs, and monocyte-derived cells to lung immunity. While we have focused on the potential role of BAMs as APCs in immune surveillance of the bronchial airways, our findings do not exclude other potential functions of these cells. The association of some BAMs with nerves at bronchovascular bundles is likely of significance to tissue function and/or immunity. BAMs might also be involved in the clearance of epithelial cells or in the production of molecules involved in tissue homeostasis. It will be interesting for future studies to resolve the potential distinctions and functions of the various subsets of IMs recently defined in the lung.</p><p>In summary, our study demonstrates that the bronchial airways are a major site of soluble antigen capture where BAMs serve as resident sentinel immune cells. Compared to DCs, BAMs exhibited distinct morphology and enhanced soluble antigen uptake from the airways. BAMs also closely interacted with cDCs, suggesting the potential for antigen transfer between these cell types. In addition, DCs migrated to the draining lymph nodes whereas BAMs remained resident near the airways. This disparity in migratory behavior suggests a division of labor where migratory cDCs may prime naïve T cells in the lymph nodes while BAMs mediate local airway immunity. Our data demonstrate that BAMs are able to activate effector Th2 cells and interact with CD4 T cells recruited to the airways in mouse models of allergic airway disease. We propose that BAMs may play a similar role in the local activation of T cells in context of infection. Overall, BAMs are strategically positioned as sentinel APCs underlying the bronchial airway epithelium. BAMs were enriched at collagen-rich regions near some airway branchpoints, which may ultimately develop inflammatory foci when an adaptive immune response is initiated.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice and chimeras</title><p>C57BL/6 J (B6/J; 000664), μMT (002288; B6.129S2-<italic>Ighm<sup>tm1Cgn</sup></italic>/J), CX3CR1-GFP (005582; B6.129P-<italic>Cx3cr1<sup>tm1Litt</sup></italic>/J), CD4-Cre (022071; B6.Cg-Tg(Cd4-cre)<sup>1Cwi/Bflu</sup>/J), Shh-Cre (005622; B6.Cg-<italic>Shh<sup>tm1(EGFP/cre)Cjt</sup></italic>/J), Ai14 (007914; B6.Cg-Gt(<italic>ROSA)26</italic>Sor<italic><sup>tm14(CAG-tdTomato)Hze</sup></italic>/J), E-cadherin-mCFP (016933; B6.129P2(Cg)-<italic>Cdh1<sup>tm1Cle</sup></italic>/J), MacBlue (026051; STOCK Tg(Csf1r*-GAL4/VP16,UAS-ECFP)<sup>1Hume</sup>/J), ROSA26-mTmG (007676; B6.129(Cg)-<italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm4(ACTB-tdTomato,-EGFP)Luo</sup></italic>/J), Prox1-tdTomato (022766; C57BL/6-Tg(Prox1-tdTomato)12<italic><sup>Nrud</sup></italic>/J), Thy1.1 (000406; B6.PL-<italic>Thy1</italic><sup>a</sup>/CyJ) and Zbtb46-GFP (018534; 129S-<italic>Zbtb46<sup>tm1.1Kmm</sup></italic>/J) mice were originally from The Jackson Laboratories.

Smaller volumes were found to somewhat favor labeling at the larger airways rather than at the alveoli, but also led to a more heterogeneous distribution of antigen throughout the lung. To produce HDM conjugated to Texas Red or OVA conjugated to TAMRA, 100 μg of HDM or OVA were reconstituted in PBS with 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate at 1 mg/ml and mixed with 18 μg Texas Red-succinimidyl ester or 36 μg 5,(6)-TAMRA-succinimidyl ester (Life Technologies), respectively. Excess free Texas Red or TAMRA were removed with Bio-spin 6 kDa size exclusion columns (Bio-Rad Laboratories) equilibrated with PBS according to manufacturer’s instructions. We noted that Texas Red-labeled antigens bound nonspecifically to dead epithelial cells at the cut site of the vibratome sections, but this was not observed with TAMRA- or Alexa 647-labeled antigens.

Sequential laser excitation at different wavelengths was used to enhance the spectral separation of fluorophores, similar to our previous approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sullivan et al., 2011</xref>) with CFP and YFP. Samples were imaged with multiple tracks, with rapid line or frame switching of laser emissions by acousto-optical modulators in order to separate the excitation and detection of different fluorophores and for second harmonic generation. For example, in order to improve the separation of CFP and GFP from YFP: in the first track, one laser was tuned to 850–870 nm to excite CFP and GFP with minimal excitation of YFP; and then in the second track, the other laser was tuned to 1020–1040 nm to strongly excite YFP with minimal excitation of CFP and GFP. In some cases, a third track was added with the OPO tuned to 1100–1200 nm to strongly excite PE and/or Alexa 647 with minimal excitation of CFP/GFP/YFP. Second harmonic generation results in an emission at half the incident laser wavelength and the signal was collected in various filters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>); the separation of the second harmonic from fluorophore emissions was assisted by tuning lasers to particular wavelengths and the use of multiple tracks.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Bronchus-associated macrophages efficiently capture and present soluble inhaled antigens for local Th2 cell activation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The study here presented interesting evidence on the nature of a cell population responsible for antigen uptake and presentation in the airway and how this cell population could stimulate a Th2 response locally. Authors used various transgenic mice models to selectively deplete DC or macrophages and performed multi photon imaging of live tissue or 3D reconstruction of thick lung sections from these mouse models. However, all the reviewers concluded that the results presented here were too preliminary and lacking substantial argument on the novelty of the characterised population (overlap with lung IM? no RNA-seq characterisation) as well as the quantitative aspect of the data reported here by imaging and finally the claim on the local Th2 cell activation performed by this population. We all discussed these matters and estimated that too many additional experiments would be necessary to further address these very important questions. Please find below the comments of the reviewers that we hope that you will find helpful.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors address the question of antigen uptake focusing on the bronchus, with the rational that it represents the main site of antigen deposit. They challenge the idea that contrariwise to the alveolar space a specialized subset of bronchus-associated macrophages BAM but not the DC are the main subset involved in Ag-uptake in the conducting airways. They re-evaluate the contribution of DC in the initiation of inflammation in an experimental model of allergic airway disease. The authors conduct a very nice set of experiments with different transgenic mice models to selectively deplete DC or macrophages and multi photon imaging of live tissue or 3D reconstruction of thick lung sections.</p><p>The authors bring evidence that BAM are potent phagocyte of soluble Ag in specific regions of the lung. Although they show that BAM mediates eosinophil recruitment in a model of allergic reaction, the experiment performed do not support convincingly their contribution to T cell activation.</p><p>I raised different points below.</p><p>1. One limitation of the study is that the phenotype of BAMs by flow cytometry overlaps with all IM of the lungs, vascular-, nerve associated and pleural macrophages. It is thus difficult to address specifically the function of BAM in the initiation of allergic inflammation as the depletion strategies are not specific of BAM.</p><p>The authors focus their imaging study at the branchpoint regions, in collagen rich structure where they observe accumulation of BAM, eosinophils and numerous other CSF1R+ cells.</p><p>It is unclear whether the author suggest that these regions represent a more specific route of Ag uptake compared to other regions of the bronchial epithelium. The images of OVA uptake are very convincing but lack quantification to address this point.</p><p>The authors could provide a quantification from their imaging study showing the relative proportion of EGFP+ cells with OVA uptake in different regions (branchpoints, airway epithelium and pleura).</p><p>The authors claim that soluble Ag is preferentially captured by BAMs but they excluded AM from the flow experiment quantification. As it is important to compare Ag uptake between DC and IM it is also important to see the contribution of AM. The authors should add in figure 4A B the contribution of siglecF+ AM.</p><p>2. Eosinophilia is used as the major read out of the macrophage depletion experiments at the beginning of the manuscript and the authors conclude on a non-necessary role of DC to drive allergic recall response and that other subsets may activate T cells. Eosinophil recruitment might be mediated by macrophages but T cell activation mediated by DC. A direct link between effector T cell activation and eosinophilia should be presented at the very beginning to draw such conclusion or maybe postpone this conclusion only after the OT2 experiments. However, the DC compartment is not fully depleted, considering the strong ability of DC to activate T cells compared to macrophages as showed Figure 6, even a small fraction of DC could maintain allergic response.</p><p>3. Figure 6C. Proliferation of OT2 cells can be easily reached in the presence of the OVA peptide even with nonprofessional APC. OVA peptide addition is a good control but the stimulation of OT2 cells by freshly purified APC from OVA-sensitized mice and/or with APC loaded with OVA protein is necessary.</p><p>4. During live imaging, many cell behaviors can be recorded, the authors need to provide proper quantification of cell interactions in order to identify an overall tendency. What is the proportion of OT2 interacting with EGFP+ cells compared to YFP+? Is the interaction OVA-dependent?</p><p>5. Percentages do not prove efficient depletion of cell in DTR system. Lower % could be biased by increased % of another subset. To compare the depletion of the AM in CD11c and CD169 DTR systems the authors should show the absolute number of AM as done for IM Figure 3.</p><p>6. Figure 4 There is a significant fraction of CD24+ CD64+ subset. In panel 3C the CD24dimerCD64+ subset is excluded from gating but in Figure 4A it is included in the macrophages. What is this subset exactly?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In allergic asthma, parabronchial inflammation occurs within the lung upon inhalation of allergens and activation of Th2 leading to cytokine productions promoting pathogenesis. The study of Tang et al. aimed to identify the cell population responsible for antigen uptake and presentation in the airway and to characterize how this cell population can stimulate a Th2 response locally. The study is based in large parts on usage of two photon microscopy analysis of lungs from a collection of genetically engineered mice to follow myeloid cells at the level of airways in the steady state or after antigen inhalation. The authors found that a population of interstitial macrophages referred to as Bronchus-Associate Macrophages (BAMs) are very efficient for capture and presentation of soluble antigens. These BAMs are located in the steady state at airway bifurcation/branchpoint underneath the epithelium together with Dendritic cells (DCs essentially DC2) and collagen. Interestingly, this corresponds to location where inhaled antigens are likely to be deposited. Accordingly, the authors show that the BAMs exhibit a better ability to uptake inhaled antigens than the DCs. In addition, upon local sensitization, DCs but not BAMs, upregulate CCR7 and migrate to LN while BAMs remain lung resident where they can locally induce allergic inflammation.</p><p>The study is well conducted with some elegant experiments and represents a large body of work. The conclusions are of interest. The fact that this population has been missed before due to its intermediate expression of CD11c is very well documented.</p><p>I have two main concerns:</p><p>1) The authors claim that they have identified a new population of macrophages and try to compare it with the abundant literature on myeloid mouse subsets in their 10 page long discussion. I guess the best way to clearly define a new population for which they have a nice phenotype would be to purify these cells and RNAseq them. This would allow the authors and the readers to actually compare this population to the ones identified in previous studies. RNAseq in bulk is relatively cheap and does not need a lot of cells nowadays.</p><p>2) Many nice observations by two photon microscopy are provided without any quantification or performed with too few experimental points to be convincing. &quot;Representative images&quot; that are presented cannot be taken as results since some of the most important conclusions of the study rely on these images. For instance, in Figure 2 there is no quantification of the images of antigen uptake, OVA and HDM (Figure 2D and E). The same holds true for almost all the images presented. I understand that 2 photons microscopy is difficult and time consuming but for some experiments it should be done like the authors did in Figure 1G and H.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this report, Tang and colleagues have used two-photo microscopy to assess in detail the localization and the behavior of CX3CR1-GFP+CD11c+ MHC-II high interstitial macrophages (IM) in vivo. They convincingly identified areas rich in CX3CR1-GFP+ IMs and CD11c-YFP+ DCs in the steady-state lung, particularly in collagen-rich regions near some bifurcating airways. They called the CX3CR1-GFP+ IMs of those areas &quot;Bronchus-Associated Macrophages (BAMs)&quot;, and importantly showed that BAMs have a dendritic morphology and can take up soluble antigens more importantly than DCs. BAMs remain lung-resident, are able to process and present soluble antigens, activate T cells in vitro and interact with T cells in an OVA-induced asthma model. These findings are consistent with the idea that BAMs may have previously been overlooked as antigen-presenting cells in the lung. Thus, the title claims that &quot;Bronchus-associated macrophages efficiently capture and present soluble antigens&quot;, and such claim is fully supported by the data and well demonstrated. The experiments related to that part are sound, and the report is of great interest and adds to our understanding of lung interstitial macrophage biology by showing that MHC-II high IMs can act as antigen-presenting cells in vivo, as previously suggested in vitro (Chakarov et al., Science, 2019). This part of the work warrants publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The concern is related to the second claim of the title, &quot;… for local Th2 cell activation&quot;. In my opinion, experimental evidence for that is very weak, and, more globally, the paradigm-shifting idea that BAMs, but not DCs, are necessary for &quot;allergic recall responses in the lung&quot; should, in my opinion, be removed from this report (data related to Figure 3). Indeed, unambiguously demonstrating this would require a huge amount of additional experiments and should be the scope of another entire paper. The main issues related to this part are summarized below:</p><p>– No evidence for local Th2 activation has been shown in vivo. Only some data showing that BAMs can trigger T cell proliferation and IL-13 are shown ex vivo, using Th2 polarized effector T cells. A previous report (Chakarov et al., Science, 2019) has shown that CX3CR1high MHChigh IM subpopulations could induce Foxp3+ Tregs ex vivo. Additional intracellular stainings for transcription factors (Foxp3, Gata-3, T-bet, Rorgt) and cytokines (IL-4, IFN-g, IL-17), co-culture experiments with unpolarized naïve, or polarized memory or effector T cells should help deciphering differences in the ability of cDCs vs. BAMs to regulate T cell responses ex vivo. However, additional in vivo proof would also be required.</p><p>– The authors employed DT-induced cell depletion in several transgenic animals, in combination with a mouse model of OVA/alum-induced eosinophilia, to support the claim that BAMs, rather than DCs, can serve as antigen-presenting cells to activate local Th2 cell responses in the lung. Weaknesses of this set of experiments are:</p><p>1) the paucity of read-outs: only BAL eosinophilia has been measured, while many cardinal features of allergic asthma should have been assessed: peribronchial and perivascular inflammation, mucus production, local Th2 cell recruitment and activation, antigen-specific humoral responses.</p><p>2) relevance of the model: most of the recent studies aiming at deciphering the contribution of cDCs in type 2-allergic asthma have used another more relevant model of allergic asthma based on exposure to house dust mite extracts (HDM), a major allergen source in humans. This model should have been used to validate the findings in the OVA/alum &quot;artificial&quot; model. Using a model based on HDM would also allow to decipher the contribution of cDCs vs. BAM in the sensitization phase vs. the recall response.</p><p>3) while it seems indeed that BAMs are depleted in CD11c-DTR mice, but not in zDC-DTR mice, while cDCs are depleted in both models, the unambiguous demonstration of the role of cDCs vs. BAM in triggering Th2-cell-mediated allergic responses (either during the sensitization or the challenge phase) would require adoptive transfer of cDCs vs. BAM in DT-treated CD11c-DTR or zDC-DTR animals, to see if that transfer can restore the phenotype affected by DT treatment.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63296.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: The authors appealed the original decision. What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><p>We thank the reviewers and editors for their consideration of our manuscript and constructive feedback. Based on this feedback, we made revisions to the manuscript as outlined below.</p><p>We first copy here some key comments from reviewer #3, which we believe captured sentiments shared by the other reviewers:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“Thus, the title claims that &quot;Bronchus-associated macrophages efficiently capture and present soluble antigens&quot;, and such claim is fully supported by the data and well demonstrated.

Indeed, unambiguously demonstrating this would require a huge amount of additional experiments and should be the scope of another entire paper.”</p></disp-quote><p>Based on these comments, we felt that the strength of our manuscript was the characterization of antigen capture and presentation by the BAMs versus DCs and their strategic positioning near the airways. However, clearly a weakness of the manuscript was that the data did not convincingly demonstrate that BAMs rather than DCs promoted local Th2 cell activation in the lung. We agree with this assessment. Due to limitations of depletion strategies, which have relatively poor specificity and limited efficacy, it would be very difficult to definitively establish that DCs are not involved in antigen presentation to Th2 cells in the lung. Indeed, we had never intended to exclude this possibility, but rather to show that BAMs are efficient at capturing and presenting antigen, are capable of activating Th2 cells, and remain lung resident. We note that we had included in our manuscript (lines 418-420, formerly 430-432) the following text: “These observations suggest that both BAMs and DCs can serve as APCs for the local activation of effector T cells in lung peribronchial regions.” In the revised manuscript, we have modified the latter part of the title to state that BAMs “are capable of local Th2 cell activation.” Specifically testing the functional role of BAMs has been difficult due to the limited ability to target this population versus other macrophage populations and DCs as well as the replenishment of depleted BAMs by monocytes. We agree with Reviewer #3 that such investigations would require a large amount of additional experiments and would be the scope of a different paper, and at present such a study may not even be feasible until better tools are developed.</p><p>Accordingly, given the concerns voiced by both Reviewers 1 and 3 regarding the functional data in an asthma model, we have removed Figure 3 (with the different DTR mice) and the associated supplementary figures from the manuscript, and modified the text accordingly. We have also refocused the manuscript on further characterization of the BAMs and comparison to DCs. Some highlights of what we have added to the manuscript include:</p><p>Another concern raised by the reviewers was that insufficient quantification was provided for imaging data. We appreciate this concern and the value of quantitative data. It also must be recognized that for such quantifications to be done in a robust manner with large 3D image stacks collected by two-photon microscopy requires an extensive, concerted effort with careful image analysis to avoid artifacts. We have therefore focused on adding quantification specifically regarding key findings in the manuscript. Specifically, we have added:</p><p>Figure 2 – We had added new data on fluorescent OVA uptake per individual cell (comparing BAMs to DCs) and then the geometric mean fluorescence intensity per cell type in each imaging field (Figure 2E). We have also added data on individual cell shapes (sphericity and length of longest axis) in Figure 2G/H in addition to the existing median/mean data per imaging field.</p><p>Figure 7 – We have added an analysis of the interaction times of individual OT-II T cells with BAMs in Figure 7G.</p><p>We also recognize that two-photon microscopy, while a very powerful technique, still gives a limited window into specific regions of the lung that are being imaged. Significant variability exists in the distribution of inhaled antigen throughout the lung airways, as well as the appearance of different lung regions. We nonetheless feel confident by imaging these regions and cell types for over a decade that the image examples we have provided here are representative of what can be observed using this approach. We also note that our extensive flow cytometric analyses quantify many of the characteristics of BAMs in terms of antigen uptake and processing as well as marker expression, which complements our findings by microscopy.</p><p>We believe that the above revisions address most of the comments of the reviewers. Some additional specific responses to reviewer comments are noted below:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1: As it is important to compare Ag uptake between DC and IM it is also important to see the contribution of AM.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that AMs take up substantial amounts (in fact most) of the antigen that is inhaled. However, AMs are (1) located at a different site (alveoli) rather than near the bronchial airways where inflammation occurs in asthma, and (2) have been shown in previous studies to poorly stimulate CD4 T cells. We confirmed that peptide-MHC-II complexes were undetectable on AMs (Figure 7A). We thus think that while AMs may have a very important phagocytic role in the lung, effectively ‘cleaning’ up the airspaces in the alveoli, that the role we have identified here for BAMs in antigen capture and presentation is important in the context of T cell activation. Accordingly, our analyses have been focused on BAMs and DCs which are located proximal to the airways and process and present antigen peptides on MHC-II.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1: Figure 6C. Proliferation of OT2 cells can be easily reached in the presence of the OVA peptide even with nonprofessional APC. OVA peptide addition is a good control but the stimulation of OT2 cells by freshly purified APC from OVA-sensitized mice and/or with APC loaded with OVA protein is necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>We chose to use OVA peptide for these sorting experiments because it was difficult to get adequate T cell activation for our analysis with OVA protein taken up in vivo after enzymatic lung digestion and cell sorting of APCs (this was true of any APC subset including DCs). Given the number of steps (and hours) required to isolate these cells to high purity, we felt this was a technical limitation of the assay. This is why we separately confirmed that BAMs present peptide-MHC-II complexes on their cell surface derived from inhaled antigens and express costimulatory molecule (Figures 7A,B). We still think these cell sorting data are valuable to show that BAMs are capable of activating Th2 cells in vitro.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1: During live imaging, many cell behaviors can be recorded, the authors need to provide proper quantification of cell interactions in order to identify an overall tendency. What is the proportion of OT2 interacting with EGFP+ cells compared to YFP+? Is the interaction OVA-dependent?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion. We have focused on the quantification of interactions of OT-II cells with BAMs given the revised nature of the manuscript, and showed that the interactions are indeed dependent on inhaled OVA as shown in Figure 7G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1: Figure 4 There is a significant fraction of CD24+ CD64+ subset. In panel 3C the CD24dimerCD64+ subset is excluded from gating but in Figure 4A it is included in the macrophages. What is this subset exactly?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that there is variation in CD24 expression among CD64+ cells, but we also note that CD24 expression is lower in these cells compared with DCs which have high CD24 expression. The inclusion of these markers has been helpful to gate cDCs versus IMs in past studies and accordingly were included here. We also note that CD64 expression correlated with MerTK, as expected from past studies of macrophages. The nature of this variation in CD24 expression in CD64+ cells is unclear, but is beyond the scope of our manuscript. The former Figure 3C was removed from the manuscript. Our microscopy data confirm that CD64 is a relevant marker distinguishing BAMs from DCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1: The statement &quot;Microscopy detects a comparably narrower dynamic range of fluorescent signals than flow cytometry, and thus we most likely only visualized CX3CR1-GFPbright IMs that carried the most OVA&quot; is somehow incorrect. Each pixel of an image is indeed scaled on a narrower band of resolution but the image quantification should be considered at the scale of the object. Figure 2A and E shows that free or very small vesicules containing OVA-FL and HDM-FL can be detected suggesting that even YFP+ cells with small amount of antigen should be seen on the images. This point should be considered for image quantification.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up the important issue of quantifying the uptake of fluorescent antigen. First to clarify our comments here, there is a difference between the size of a region containing a fluorescent signal, versus the absolute intensity of the fluorescence signal. The absolute intensity of the signal by two-photon microscopy is affected by several factors including laser power, detector gain, and tissue scattering of light. These properties are all quite different than the analysis of single cells by flow cytometry. In our experience, there is a much more limited range of what can be visualized by two-photon microscopy than by flow cytometry and again this depends on the settings of the microscope. There is also a limitation to what can be visualized when looking at an image by eye, which depends on the display range of the image. To indeed illustrate how different linear adjustments can lead to different conclusions of whether signal is present or absent, we show in Figure 2—figure supplement 2 two different adjustments to the same image. Our statement above was meant to indicate how based on our typical settings, we most likely only visualized CX3CR1-GFP<sup>bright</sup> IMs that carried the most OVA. Related to the reviewer’s comment, we recognize that image quantification is not the same as visualization by eye. We have therefore added a careful quantification of OVA uptake in BAMs versus DCs (quantified as the sum of fluorescence intensity per cell) from our microscope images in Figure 2E in the revised manuscript. These data confirm that weak OVA fluorescence signal was detected by microscopy in CD11c-YFP+ DCs, and are in line with our observations by flow cytometry.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1: &quot;Alveolar macrophages, with low MHC-II expression and a high degradative capacity, showed negligible Y-Ae staining (Figure 6—figure supplement 1), confirming these are not the relevant APCs for CD4 T cells&quot; Indeed it is unlikely that AM are good APC but the absence of detectable Y-Ae staining cannot preclude antigen presentation capacity. Ag presentation assay of AM sorted from OVA-sensitized mice with OT2 for instance could confirm.</p></disp-quote><p>Respectfully, to our knowledge, an essential feature of APCs for CD4 T cells is the presentation of peptide complexes on MHC-II. Since (1) AMs have low MHC-II expression, (2) are known to be highly degradative, and (3) had undetectable peptide-MHC-II complexes on their cell surface with the well-characterized Y-Ae antibody, whereas we could detect these peptide-MHC-II complexes on BAMs and DCs, we believe our conclusion is reasonable. Please see above for other notes on why we have not focused on AMs in this study. We also note that other studies have indicated that AMs may have a suppressive effect on the immune response.</p><p>We agree with this comment and provided new images which give more information about MHC-II and CD64 expression around the airway. This is now Figure 3C.</p><p>In summary, we believe the revisions to the manuscript address the requests in the decision letter from the editors:</p></body></sub-article></article>
