Examples include secretion of small RNAs within exosomes in response to pathogenic fungal infection in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai et al., 2018</xref>), virus-like proteins with their coding mRNAs in developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashley et al., 2018</xref>) and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Pastuzyn et al., 2018</xref>), microRNAs from adipose tissue in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Thomou et al., 2017</xref>) and small RNAs from the epididymis in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sharma et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Conine et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sharma et al., 2018</xref>). Such extracellular RNAs have also been detected in humans, but their roles in gene regulation remain unclear despite their use as diagnostic markers for diseases (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Das et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, the recent development of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-based drugs (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Setten et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mullard, 2022</xref>) that can silence genes of matching sequence through RNA interference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fire et al., 1998</xref>) has heightened interest in understanding the import of dsRNA into cells. A conserved dsRNA-selective importer, SID-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Winston et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Feinberg and Hunter, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Shih et al., 2009</xref>), is required for the import of extracellular dsRNA into the cytosol of any cell in the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. This entry into the cytosol is distinct from the uptake of dsRNA into cells, which can rely on other receptors (e.g. SID-2 for uptake from the intestinal lumen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Winston et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">McEwan et al., 2012</xref>). SID-1 has two homologs in mammals – SIDT1 and SIDT2. Although similar cytosolic entry of dsRNA using these mammalian homologs of SID-1 is supported by studies in mice reporting entry of viral dsRNA through SIDT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nguyen et al., 2017</xref>), enhanced dsRNA uptake when SIDT1 is overexpressed in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nguyen et al., 2019</xref>), and uptake of ingested dsRNA into cells through SIDT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2021</xref>), alternative roles for SIDT1 and/or SIDT2 in the uptake of cholesterol have also been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Méndez-Acevedo et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Secretion of dsRNA from <italic>C. elegans</italic> tissues expressing dsRNA from transgenes has been inferred based upon the SID-1-dependent silencing of matching genes in other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Winston et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jose et al., 2009</xref>). Secreted dsRNA from neurons can silence genes of matching sequence in most somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Ravikumar et al., 2019</xref>) and within the germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Devanapally et al., 2015</xref>). Extracellular dsRNA delivered into parental circulation by injection or ingestion also enters the germline and can cause silencing of matching genes in progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fire et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Timmons and Fire, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grishok et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Marré et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Wang and Hunter, 2017</xref>). In every case, the entry of dsRNA into the cytosol dictates when and where the processing of extracellular dsRNA can begin. Such intergenerational transport of RNA is an attractive mechanism for explaining endogenous, gene-specific effects in progeny that could occur in response to changes in somatic tissues of parents. However, which conditions induce transport of dsRNA into the germline, when during development this transport occurs, and what regulatory consequences ensue in progeny upon uptake of extracellular dsRNA from parents are all unknown. Despite this lack of knowledge, the analysis of transgenerational gene silencing triggered by dsRNA has revealed that a class of small RNAs called 22G RNA made using the mRNA targeted by dsRNA and bound by Argonaute proteins in the germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buckley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Xu et al., 2018</xref>) is necessary for observing silencing in every generation.</p><p>Timed dsRNA injection into animals or timed dsRNA ingestion by animals has been the only way to study mechanisms of dsRNA transport throughout <italic>C. elegans</italic> development since no tools to induce dsRNA secretion from cells have been developed. Injection of dsRNA into adult <italic>sid-1(-)</italic> animals demonstrated that extracellular dsRNA can be directly transmitted to progeny without entry into the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Marré et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Wang and Hunter, 2017</xref>). This intergenerational transmission of dsRNA in <italic>sid-1(-)</italic> adult animals requires the yolk receptor RME-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grant and Hirsh, 1999</xref>) and is independent of parental 22G RNA production because dsRNA cannot enter the cytosol in the parent. In further support of the initial intergenerational transport of extracellular dsRNA or dsRNA-derived signals not requiring 22G RNAs, <italic>gfp</italic>-dsRNA from parents that lack <italic>gfp</italic> sequences are transported to progeny (Figure 1E in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Marré et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the silencing signals transported from parent to progeny include the extracellular dsRNA and its derived silencing signals, independent of 22G RNAs. However, 22G RNAs are required for silencing and they may be used for intergenerational transport in subsequent generations.</p><p>All dsRNAs, regardless of length, have been assumed to be equivalent substrates for entry into the cytosol. This assumption is supported by the uptake of a variety of dsRNA substrates when <italic>C. elegans</italic> SID-1 is overexpressed in heterologous <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Shih et al., 2009</xref>). Yet, two key observations suggest that dsRNA can take multiple routes in vivo before SID-1-dependent entry into the cytosol. One, even in the presence of SID-1, dsRNA ingested during early adulthood requires RME-2 to cause silencing in progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Marré et al., 2016</xref>). Two, 50 bp fluorescently labeled dsRNA requires RME-2 for entry from parental circulation into oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Marré et al., 2016</xref>). Establishing the contexts for the use of different modes of dsRNA transport is crucial for understanding the processes regulated by endogenous extracellular dsRNA.</p><p>Here, we dissect the intergenerational transport of extracellular dsRNA and discover a role for this mechanism in modulating RNA regulation within the germline. Extracellular dsRNA is transported with developmental and substrate specificity from parental circulation to progeny, and its release from neurons can be enhanced using light-induced oxidative damage. Blocking dsRNA import into the cytosol of all cells revealed heritable changes in gene expression and led to the identification of <bold><italic>s</italic></bold><italic>id-1</italic>-<bold>d</bold>ependent <bold>g</bold>ene-1 (<italic>sdg-1</italic>). The <italic>sdg-1</italic> coding sequence is located within a retrotransposon that is targeted by RNA silencing in the germline. Yet, the SDG-1 protein colocalizes with regulators of RNA silencing in perinuclear granules within the germline and dynamically enters the nucleus in proximal oocytes and in cells of developing embryos. Measurements of <italic>sdg-1</italic> expression using native mRNA, a translational reporter, or a transcriptional reporter reveal that expression is easily perturbed in different mutants that impact dsRNA-mediated gene regulation. Expression varies between the two gonad arms of wild-type animals, and different mutant isolates can show an increase or decrease in expression, indicative of a loss of buffered gene expression within the germline. However, consistent with an overall role for SDG-1 (and potentially other SDGs) in promoting RNA silencing, either loss of SID-1 or overexpression of SDG-1 enhances piRNA-mediated silencing within the germline initiated by mating. Therefore, we propose that the import of extracellular dsRNA into the germline tunes intracellular pathways that cause heritable RNA silencing.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Requirements for the entry of extracellular dsRNA into the germline change during development</title><p>A convenient method for the delivery of extracellular dsRNA into <italic>C. elegans</italic> at various times during larval development is the expression of dsRNA in the bacteria that the animals ingest as food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Timmons and Fire, 1998</xref>). To determine when ingested dsRNA can enter the germline and cause silencing, we exposed developing animals with a ubiquitously expressed protein (GTBP-1) tagged with GFP to bacteria that express <italic>gfp</italic>-dsRNA. Silencing was detectable within the germline from the second larval stage (L2) onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), but either exposure to ingested dsRNA beyond the fourth larval stage (L4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) or injection of dsRNA into the 1-day-old adult germline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) was required to observe silencing in the germline of 3-day-old adults. Combined with the need for exposure to dsRNA after the L4 stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Marré et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Wang and Hunter, 2017</xref>) for silencing in progeny, even for just 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), these observations suggest that detectable silencing within the germline is possible during early development without initiating heritable RNA silencing. One possible explanation for this observation could be that both RNAs derived from the imported dsRNA and downstream silencing signals are continually diluted by the proliferation of germ cells. Heritable silencing by dsRNA ingested from the L4 stage to the first day of adulthood likely relies on entry of dsRNA into the proximal germline because silencing of a somatic gene in progeny after parental ingestion of dsRNA during this period required RME-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), which is enriched in the proximal germline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grant and Hirsh, 1999</xref>), and some <italic>gtbp-1::gfp</italic> animals exposed to <italic>gfp</italic>-dsRNA up to the first day of adulthood showed more silencing in the proximal germline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Gene silencing by ingested dsRNA during larval development can fail to persist into adulthood.</title><p>Silencing in the germline was measured after exposure of <italic>gtbp-1::gfp</italic> animals to bacteria expressing dsRNA by imaging separate cohorts at indicated stages (<bold>A</bold>) or day 3 of adulthood (<bold>B</bold>).

However, the extent of such secretion throughout development is unpredictable. To modulate the secretion of dsRNA from somatic cells into parental circulation during development, we adapted an optogenetic approach for damaging somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Xu and Chisholm, 2016</xref>). Specifically, we generated animals that express the mini singlet oxygen generator (miniSOG) protein in neurons and exposed them to blue light. While animals expressing miniSOG from a single-copy transgene did not show an appreciable defect when compared with wild-type animals, those expressing miniSOG from a multi-copy transgene were paralyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>, <italic>top</italic>) and had visibly damaged neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <italic>bottom</italic>). Using this system, we induced oxidative damage in the neurons of animals that expressed dsRNA under the control of a neuronal promoter and evaluated silencing of target genes with matching sequence expressed in other tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). By exposing animals to blue light for 60 min at different times during development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), we observed SID-1-dependent enhancement in the silencing of the hypodermal gene <italic>bli-1</italic> at the adult stage by neuronal <italic>bli-1</italic>-dsRNA, with maximal silencing when oxidative damage occurred during mid-to-late larval development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>, light exposure every 6 hr from 42 to 66 hr post L4-stage of parent; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>, ~two-fold increase from 14.9% to 29.1% in a background with <bold>e</bold>nhanced <bold>R</bold>NA <bold>i</bold>nterference (<italic>eri-1(-)</italic>) and ~six-fold increase from ~1.6% to ~9.8% in a wild-type background).

Efficient silencing in response to added dsRNA requires nuclear Argonaute proteins: NRDE-3 in somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guang et al., 2008</xref>) and HRDE-1 in the germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buckley et al., 2012</xref>). Both 50 bp dsRNA and mixed dsRNA relied on HRDE-1 for silencing within the germline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A and C</xref>) and could silence independent of NRDE-3 in somatic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A and C</xref>). In addition to the diversity of RNA lengths observed in mixed dsRNA, another known feature that could distinguish dsRNA transcribed in bacteria or in vitro from synthesized 50 bp dsRNA is the presence of 5’ triphosphates on the transcribed dsRNA species instead of the 5’ OH present in synthesized 50 bp dsRNA. In support of the impact of 5’ phosphates on transport and/or silencing, addition of 5’ monophosphates to synthesized 50 bp dsRNA injected into parental circulation reduced the dependence on RME-2 for silencing in progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>), potentially by enhancing the ability of synthesized dsRNA to be imported by other dsRNA importers (e.g. SID-1) in the absence of RME-2. Thus, the requirements for dsRNA entry into the germline and subsequent silencing vary for different lengths and/or chemical forms of dsRNA (see summary in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Summary of constraints on intergenerational transport of extracellular dsRNA.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Stage of exposure</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">dsRNA type</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic requirement for germline entry</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Heritability</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">L1 to L3</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">mixed, ingested</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">none tested</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">not heritable</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="2">early L4</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">mixed, ingested</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>rme-2</italic> required</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">no persistent silencing in P0 adults, heritable to F1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">mixed, injected</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>rme-2</italic> not required</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">heritable to F1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="2">early adult</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">mixed, ingested</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>rme-2</italic> required</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">partial silencing in P0 adults, heritable to F1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">mixed, injected</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>rme-2</italic> not required</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">heritable to F1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="4">late adult</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">mixed, ingested</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>rme-2</italic> not required</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">persistent silencing in P0 adults, heritable to F1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">mixed, injected</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>sid-1</italic> or <italic>rme-2</italic> required</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">heritable to F1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">synthesized 50 bp, injected</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>sid-1</italic> and <italic>rme-2</italic> required</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">heritable to F1 with partial silencing</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Synthesized 50 bp with 5’-phosphate, injected</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>rme-2</italic> is partially required</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">heritable to F1</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Fluorescently labeled 50 bp dsRNA delivered into parental circulation localized within intestinal cells in progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <italic>top left</italic>), as has been observed for vitellogenin proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sharrock, 1983</xref>) and fluorescent dyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bossinger and Schierenberg, 1996</xref>). Accumulation of fluorescently labeled dsRNA was also detected at the apical membrane of the intestine, which could reflect exocytosis of dsRNA into the lumen of developing intestinal cells. However, separation of the fluorescent label from dsRNA catalyzed by cellular enzymes cannot be excluded. Therefore, to dissect differences, if any, between the transport of unlabeled short dsRNA (synthesized 50 bp with 5’OH) and mixed dsRNA (mixture transcribed in vitro using ~1 kb DNA template) we injected <italic>unc-22</italic>-dsRNA into animals with mutations in genes that play roles in the import of dsRNA. We found that maternal SID-1 was required for silencing by short dsRNA in progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <italic>bottom</italic>, left bars), suggesting that the SID-1-dependent entry of short dsRNA into the cytosol likely occurs in the injected parent or during early development in progeny. Uptake of dsRNA from the intestinal lumen requires SID-2, a transmembrane protein located in the apical membranes of intestinal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Winston et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">McEwan et al., 2012</xref>). We found that SID-2 was not required for most silencing in progeny by short or mixed dsRNA injected into parental circulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <italic>top right</italic> and <italic>bottom</italic>). Exit of dsRNA from intracellular vesicles requires SID-5, a transmembrane protein located in endolysosomal membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hinas et al., 2012</xref>). Silencing in wild-type animals was comparable to silencing in <italic>sid-5(-)</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <italic>top right</italic>). However, when animals that lacked SID-1 were injected, SID-5 was required in progeny for silencing by mixed dsRNA from parental circulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <italic>bottom</italic>, right bars; as also reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Wang and Hunter, 2017</xref>). Since dsRNA is expected to be present in vesicles upon entry through RME-2 in the absence of SID-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Marré et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Wang and Hunter, 2017</xref>), this observation suggests that SID-5 is required for the release of mixed dsRNA from inherited vesicles in progeny.</p><p>In summary, injected extracellular dsRNA can enter the germline in parents and be transmitted to progeny through two routes with different substrate selectivity. One route is preferentially used by short dsRNA and relies on RME-2-mediated endocytosis of dsRNA into oocytes, where early exit from vesicles is required for silencing in progeny as evidenced by the need for maternal SID-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, blue). The other route appears to exclude short dsRNA but allows mixed dsRNA entry into the cytosol in the parental germline through SID-1 and exit from inherited vesicles in progeny through a process that requires both zygotic SID-1 and SID-5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, grey; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Wang and Hunter, 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Expression of SID-1 is consistent with a role in the intergenerational transport of extracellular dsRNA</title><p>All routes of dsRNA transport deduced using the experimental addition of dsRNA ultimately require SID-1 for entry into the cytosol.

These observations support the idea that appropriate regulation of <italic>sdg-1</italic> RNA requires both piRNA-mediated processes that act via germ granule components such as DEPS-1 and dsRNA-mediated processes that use SID-1 and RDE-4.</p><p>In summary, the levels of <italic>sdg-1</italic> RNA are detectably regulated by the dsRNA-selective importer SID-1, the dsRNA-binding protein RDE-4, and the piRNA-binding Argonaute PRG-1. Presence of dsRNA-mediated regulation or loss of piRNA-mediated regulation enhances MUT-16-dependent production of secondary small RNAs that bind the secondary Argonaute HRDE-1/WAGO-9. Consistent with downregulation of these <italic>sid-1</italic>-dependent transcripts by SID-1, disruption of many components of germ granules results in opposite effects on these transcripts and <italic>sid-1</italic> RNA. Intriguingly, a search of protein interaction studies revealed that the SDG-1 protein is among the interactors of two germ granule components: PID-2 by immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Placentino et al., 2021</xref>; also known as ZSP-1, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Wan et al., 2021</xref>) and DEPS-1 by proximity labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Price et al., 2021</xref>). This interaction raises the possibility that the <italic>sdg-1</italic> gene is not only regulated by germ granule components, but also that its protein product associates with one or more components of germ granules.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Regulation of <italic>sdg-1</italic> RNA is susceptible to epigenetic changes that last for many generations</title><p>Given these observations on the regulation of <italic>sdg-1</italic> and the potential for the SDG-1 protein to be a regulator of RNA silencing, we focus here on the analysis of this gene. The <italic>sdg-1</italic> gene is located within a retrotransposon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>) that is within a duplicated ~40 kb region and has two recognizable paralogs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, there are no detectable SDG-1 homologs in species other than <italic>C. elegans</italic>, suggesting that it is a recently evolved gene. Potentially because of this lack of conservation, AlphaFold is unable to predict a confident structure for SDG-1 (CELE_F07B7.2 on the Database; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Varadi et al., 2022</xref>). To facilitate analysis of SDG-1 expression, we tagged both loci that encode SDG-1 with <italic>mCherry</italic> coding sequences lacking piRNA-binding sites (<italic>mCherry∆pi</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Devanapally et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). This tagging resulted in the expression of <italic>sdg-1::mCherry∆pi</italic> mRNA being ~16-fold higher than <italic>sdg-1</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>), potentially because of the reduction in the overall density of piRNA-binding sites per transcript, the additional introns included in <italic>mCherry∆pi</italic> (based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Okkema et al., 1993</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crane et al., 2019</xref>), and/or other unknown factors. Fluorescence from SDG-1::mCherry was observed in the germline of adult animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). However, animals showed variation in SDG-1::mCherry expression between their two gonad arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <italic>middle</italic> shows bright anterior [20% of animals] and <italic>right</italic> shows bright posterior [6% of animals]). A contributing feature for the observed stochasticity could be the location of <italic>sdg-1</italic> within a duplicated region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>), as suggested by similar stochastic RNA silencing of multi-copy transgenes but not single-copy transgenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Le et al., 2016</xref>). Despite this variation, unbiased passaging of self-progeny for more than 18 generations continuously preserved SDG-1::mCherry expression in an otherwise wild-type background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In contrast, mating, which can perturb RNA regulation within the germline in cross progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Devanapally et al., 2021</xref>), caused dramatic changes in <italic>sdg-1</italic> expression that persisted in descendants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Mating animals that express SDG-1::mCherry with wild-type animals resulted in heritable changes along lineages that express <italic>sdg-1::mCherry∆pi</italic> mRNA or that express <italic>sdg-1</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). This discovery of mating-induced perturbation in gene expression raises caution in interpreting past studies (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>) where changes in multiple independent isolates were not examined.

Use of this approach to mutate a control gene with no known roles in RNA regulation within the germline resulted in similar levels of SDG-1::mCherry fluorescence in multiple isolates of animals with and without the mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In contrast, mutating <italic>sid-1</italic> using Cas9-mediated genome editing caused a range of expression levels in different isolates when compared with <italic>sid-1(+)</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> - 6 isolates lower, 2 isolates comparable, and 1 isolate higher), which differs from the increase in <italic>sdg-1</italic> mRNA observed upon SID-1 loss in the single isolate examined earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Mutating <italic>sid-3</italic> also lowered the levels of SDG-1::mCherry in one isolate, but caused no detectable change in another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). While both isolates with loss of RDE-1 showed lower levels of SDG-1::mCherry, both isolates with loss of the germ granule component DEPS-1 showed higher levels of SDG-1::mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). These experiments also reveal that in most isolates of animals expected to have reduced levels of intracellular dsRNA (<italic>sid-3(-)</italic>, <italic>sid-1(-)</italic>) or reduced processing of intracellular dsRNA (<italic>rde-1(-)</italic>), SDG-1::mCherry fluorescence is reduced. In contrast, isolates lacking DEPS-1 showed increased expression of SDG-1::mCherry.</p><p>Collectively, the observations on SDG-1 expression using mutants suggest that the uptake and processing of intracellular dsRNA (influenced by SID-1, SID-2, SID-3, SID-5, RDE-1, and ERI-1) and the function of germ granules (influenced by MUT-16 and DEPS-1) are both necessary to maintain intermediate levels of SDG-1 expression across generations. Once the levels of SDG-1::mCherry were reduced upon loss of SID-1, downregulation persisted across generations even after restoration of wild-type SID-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>), just as the upregulation of untagged <italic>sdg-1</italic> mRNA also persisted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Despite &gt;100 generations of such persistent silencing, the expression of SDG-1::mCherry could be restored by mutating <italic>deps-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>), implicating small RNA-based regulation and germ granules in the maintenance of the new epigenetic states established upon loss of SID-1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>SID-1-dependent genes, including SDG-1, could alter RNA-mediated regulation in the germline</title><p>Since SDG-1 interacts with regulators of RNA silencing (ZSP-1/PID-2, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Placentino et al., 2021</xref>) and DEPS-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Price et al., 2021</xref>), loss of SID-1 could both block the entry of extracellular dsRNA into the cytosol and change intracellular RNA regulation through SID-1-dependent genes such as <italic>sdg-1</italic>. In support of this possibility, intracellular delivery of dsRNA through injection into the syncytial germline of <italic>sid-1(-)</italic> animals showed a weak defect in silencing (Figure 2D in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Marré et al., 2016</xref> and Figure 1 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Wang and Hunter, 2017</xref>). To examine if changes in the levels of SDG-1 alone could account for such a defect in silencing by intracellular dsRNA in the germline, we exposed independently-generated <italic>sdg-1</italic> deletion animals and animals that overexpress <italic>sdg-1</italic> (i.e. with <italic>sdg-1::mCherry∆pi)</italic> to dsRNA matching the germline gene <italic>pos-1</italic> for ~16 hr.

Alternatively, the previously described defect in silencing by intracellular dsRNA in <italic>sid-1(-)</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Marré et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Wang and Hunter, 2017</xref>) could be through the promotion of competing piRNA-mediated gene regulation in the absence of SID-1. This notion that dsRNA-mediated and piRNA-mediated gene regulation compete in the germline is supported by a study that demonstrated that loss of PRG-1 enhances heritable RNA silencing by dsRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Shukla et al., 2021</xref>). To test if loss of SID-1 or a <italic>sid-1</italic>-dependent gene enhances piRNA-mediated silencing, we used an experimental system which initiates piRNA-mediated silencing of the two-gene operon described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> through mating, independent of externally provided dsRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Devanapally et al., 2021</xref>).

SDG-1::mCherry was enriched in perinuclear foci in many animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, <italic>top</italic>; 7 of 9 animals) and these sites of enrichment overlapped with the Z-granule marker GFP::ZNFX-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ishidate et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, <italic>bottom</italic>; 100% colocalized in 10 of 12 animals with enrichment). However, given the resolution of our imaging, we cannot distinguish between a specific interaction with one of the many Z granule components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Zhao et al., 2024</xref>) and an interaction with components of the many other nearby perinuclear granules that continue to be reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang et al., 2024</xref>). Therefore, we conservatively conclude that SDG-1::mCherry colocalizes with perinuclear germ granules. Time-course imaging revealed re-localization of SDG-1::mCherry into the nucleus from the cytoplasm in the –1 oocyte, which will be the first to be fertilized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, <italic>left</italic> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>), along with subsequent exclusion from the nucleus before the maternal and paternal pronuclei meet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, <italic>right</italic> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). Such dynamic entry into the nucleus followed by exclusion from the nucleus also occurred during early cell divisions in the developing embryo (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Videos 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">4</xref>). The timing of nuclear entry of SDG-1::mCherry coincides with the nuclear envelope breakdown events that occur during fertilization and early development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huelgas-Morales and Greenstein, 2018</xref>). The <italic>sdg-1</italic> coding sequence was required for regulated nuclear entry because deletion of the <italic>sdg-1</italic> open reading frame in <italic>sdg-1::mCherry∆pi</italic> animals resulted in mCherry expression throughout the germline in both the cytoplasm and nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Nuclear localization of the SDG-1 protein in the –1 oocyte is like that of the essential Argonaute CSR-1b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Charlesworth et al., 2021</xref>), thought to play a role in protecting transcripts from silencing.

These results suggest that while the <italic>sdg-1</italic> open reading frame is required for exclusion from germline nuclei, it is not required for the response of the <italic>sdg-1</italic> gene to changes in intracellular dsRNA. Together, these observations on the levels and localizations of SDG-1 raise the possibility that this protein is actively regulated by extracellular and intracellular dsRNA with a role in heritable RNA silencing, potentially with perinuclear germ granules, and additional cell-cycle coupled roles during early development, potentially through nucleocytoplasmic shuttling.</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-99149-video1.mp4" id="video1"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Animals expressing SDG-1::mCherry (black) showing nuclear localization in –1 oocytes, but cytoplasmic localization in other oocytes and in the distal germline.</title></caption></media><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-99149-video2.mp4" id="video2"><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>Animals expressing SDG-1::mCherry (black) showing dynamic entry of SDG-1::mCherry into the nucleus in a zygote in utero after the maternal and paternal pronuclei meet.</title></caption></media><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-99149-video3.mp4" id="video3"><label>Video 3.</label><caption><title>Animals expressing SDG-1::mCherry (black) showing nuclear localization in –1 oocytes and in an early-staged embryo in utero during cell divisions.</title></caption></media><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-99149-video4.mp4" id="video4"><label>Video 4.</label><caption><title>Animals expressing SDG-1::mCherry (black) showing nuclear localization in oocytes during fertilization and in embryos in utero during cell divisions.</title></caption></media></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our analyses suggest a model for the impact of dsRNA from parental circulation on descendants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). Extracellular dsRNA can accumulate in parental circulation through regulated secretion from neurons (e.g. oxidative damage promotes accumulation) and potentially other tissues. Uptake into the germline is RME-2-dependent for some forms of dsRNA (blue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>), but RME-2-independent for other forms of dsRNA (grey in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). While all forms of dsRNA require SID-1 for the entry of dsRNA into the cytosol in progeny, RME-2-dependent dsRNA also require SID-5. Such dsRNA from parental circulation along with other intracellular dsRNA are processed with the help of the dsRNA-binding protein RDE-4 in progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>, <italic>bottom</italic>). This processing of dsRNA regulates the SID-1-dependent gene <italic>sdg-1</italic> by reducing variation between animals in the levels of <italic>sdg-1</italic> mRNA, although the dsRNA sequences likely need not match <italic>sdg-1</italic> because no such dsRNA was reported in the published dsRNAome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Whipple et al., 2015</xref>) and because this regulation can occur in the absence of the <italic>sdg-1</italic> open reading frame. The <italic>sdg-1</italic> gene is located within a retrotransposon that is also targeted by heritable RNA silencing, but the SDG-1 protein is enriched near perinuclear germ granules (observed using the Z granule component ZNFX-1), which are required for heritable RNA silencing. Consistent with the SDG-1 protein promoting heritable RNA silencing, the <italic>sdg-1::mCherry∆pi</italic> gene is highly susceptible to mating-induced silencing, potentially owing to the ~16-fold higher levels of SDG-1::mCherry compared with that of SDG-1 in wild-type animals. In agreement with this proposal, SID-1 limits heritable RNA silencing because loss of SID-1 enhances mating-induced silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, <italic>top</italic>). Since the <italic>sdg-1</italic> gene is located within a retrotransposon that is targeted by heritable RNA silencing, this mechanism for regulating the regulators of heritable RNA silencing such as SDG-1 (and potentially other SDGs) reveals a strategy for tuning an autoregulatory loop for heritable RNA silencing by using competing dsRNA processing. Intriguingly, SDG-1 becomes enriched within nuclei upon nuclear envelope breakdown during fertilization and during early cell divisions in embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>, bottom right) with active exclusion from nuclei after each reformation of the nuclear envelope, suggestive of additional roles for this retrotransposon-encoded protein.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Import of extracellular dsRNA</title><p>The temporal and/or spatial preferences observed for silencing by both ingested dsRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and neuronal dsRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) could be because of unknown characteristics of the exported neuronal dsRNA or ingested dsRNA expressed from bacteria (e.g. modifications, lengths, structures, etc.) that influence import or subsequent silencing. This hypothesis is supported by the different genetic requirements reported for silencing by neuronal <italic>gfp</italic>-dsRNA compared to other sources of <italic>gfp</italic>-dsRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Ravikumar et al., 2019</xref>). Alternatively, these preferences could reflect universal constraints for silencing using any extracellular dsRNA (e.g. expression patterns of factors that promote the import or processing of dsRNA). Furthermore, for both neuronal and ingested dsRNA it is unknown if additional extracellular molecules impact the uptake of dsRNA into cells. Regardless of the presence of such unknown molecules that could be released from neurons to a different degree upon oxidative damage, the gene regulatory effects of the released neuronal dsRNA provide convenient readouts that can be analyzed to understand neuronal damage and its consequences in animals. Pathologies of the central nervous system in humans, including cancer, stroke, multiple sclerosis, neurodegenerative disease, and brain injury, have been associated with extracellular RNAs detected in circulation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Tielking et al., 2019</xref>), although their origins and regulatory consequences, if any, remain unknown. While the physiological conditions that promote secretion of dsRNA from <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons are not known, the discovery that oxidative damage of neurons can enhance the secretion of dsRNA suggests that disruption of cell structures by oxidative damage (e.g. membrane integrity) or initiation of cellular processes that repair oxidative damage (e.g. through ejection of damaged macromolecules; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Melentijevic et al., 2017</xref>) also promote the release of dsRNA.</p><p>The trafficking of extracellular dsRNA from parent to progeny has spatial specificity, as evidenced by more silencing within the proximal germline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), temporal specificity, as evidenced by the need for dsRNA beyond the fourth larval stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Marré et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Wang and Hunter, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), and substrate specificity, as evidenced by the differential requirements for 50 bp dsRNA with 5’ OH versus a mix of longer dsRNAs with 5’ triphosphates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The observed difference in the extent of silencing by these dsRNAs delivered into parental circulation cannot be attributed to differential engagement of the nuclear Argonautes HRDE-1 and NRDE-3 in progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), but rather could be the result of differences in the ability of each type of dsRNA to bind to upstream factors in the RNA interference pathway (e.g. RDE-4), differences in the stability of each type of dsRNA, and/or differences in the intergenerational transport of each type of dsRNA. Drivers of temporal specificity during development include changes in the uptake of dsRNA into the intestine, distribution of dsRNA to other tissues from the intestine, import of dsRNA into the germline, and availability of RNA silencing factors within the germline. Proteins mediating dsRNA transport or subsequent silencing also differ in their availability during development and in their affinities for different substrates. For example, SID-1 was not detectable in the developing larval germline but was detected in the adult germline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and has an extracellular domain that binds dsRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Li et al., 2015</xref>) but could prefer dsRNA molecules with 5’ phosphates and/or long dsRNA. Another consideration for substrate specificity is the composition of ‘mixed dsRNAs’ generated through in vitro transcription versus defined short dsRNAs. In addition to a variety of lengths, mixed dsRNAs could also include a variety of undefined secondary structures. Such structures could recruit or titrate away RNA-binding proteins in addition to the dsRNA structures engaging the canonical RNAi pathway, resulting in mixed mechanisms of silencing. Additionally, although the selectivity uncovered here could apply to all dsRNA delivered into the extracellular space of <italic>C. elegans</italic> from any source (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> for constraints on intergenerational dsRNA transport), the chemistry of the delivered dsRNA could be modified by yet unidentified enzymes in vivo to overcome these requirements. Tracking labeled dsRNA with diverse chemistries from parental circulation to progeny could allow correlation of differences observed in progeny silencing to differences in intergenerational trafficking.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Physiological role(s) of SID-1</title><p>The germline is a major site of dsRNA import in <italic>C. elegans</italic> as evidenced by three key observations: the expression of SID-1 in the germline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), heritable misregulation of germline genes in <italic>sid-1(-)</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>), and accumulation of fluorescently labeled dsRNA from the extracellular space in the germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Marré et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Wang and Hunter, 2017</xref>).

RNA-seq experiments in this study and comparisons to those of previous studies suggest that genetic background-dependent changes can obscure genuine <italic>sid-1</italic>-dependent changes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> and <italic>Technical comments</italic> in Materials and methods), raising caution in the interpretation of putative <italic>sid-1</italic>-dependent defects. Comparing multiple <italic>sid-1</italic> mutants generated using genome editing with animals in which the mutated sequence has been reverted to wild-type sequence in the same genetic background could provide a firmer basis for the identification of additional <italic>sid-1</italic>-dependent processes while avoiding the potential for mating-induced changes in gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Devanapally et al., 2021</xref>) that can result when genetic crosses are used instead of genome editing.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Retrotransposon-encoded protein regulators</title><p>Genes expressed within the germline are likely regulated by positive feedback loops that are required to continually produce factors for maintaining germline immortality and for preserving form and function across generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jose, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chey and Jose, 2022</xref>). Thus, germline genes could be particularly vulnerable to heritable epigenetic changes, where deviations in the expression levels of a gene that is regulated by or is part of such feedback loops has the potential to become permanent in descendants. Prior data on <italic>sdg-1</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>) and the SDG-1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Placentino et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Price et al., 2021</xref>) suggested the hypothesis that reduction of <italic>sdg-1</italic> RNA via SID-1 alters the amount of SDG-1 protein, which could interact with components of germ granules to mediate RNA regulation within the germline of wild-type animals. Our analysis of <italic>sdg-1</italic> expression suggests that it is part of a regulatory architecture that is susceptible to heritable epigenetic changes through the perturbation of RNA regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). Such architectures within the germline could be exploited by ‘selfish’ genetic elements such as retrotransposons to persist across evolution if one of these elements also include genes encoding a regulator. In support of a wider use of such a strategy, a paralog of SDG-1, ZK262.8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>), is also encoded by a gene located within a retrotransposon and its loss along with that of the miRNA-associated Argonaute ALG-2 was reported to be synthetic lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Tops et al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Buffering of heritable epigenetic change by extracellular dsRNA</title><p>Loss of SID-1 weakly inhibits silencing by intracellular dsRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Marré et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Wang and Hunter, 2017</xref>) but enhances the initiation of mating-induced silencing within the germline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). However, loss of SDG-1 alone does not account for these effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>), suggesting that additional SID-1-dependent genes could be involved. Furthermore, the ultimate consequence of SID-1 loss could be different in different isolates as exemplified by the differential changes in <italic>cls-3</italic> in <italic>sid-1(jam80[nonsense])</italic> and <italic>sid-1(jam113[deletion])</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Indeed, the levels of SDG-1 also vary in different isolates of <italic>sid-1(-</italic>) animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), suggesting that in the absence of SID-1 the <italic>sdg-1</italic> gene becomes prone to heritable epigenetic changes, resulting in either high or low expression states being stabilized in different isolates. Together these observations suggest that SID-1-dependent import of extracellular dsRNA could play a role in buffering against heritable epigenetic changes in the germline. Such buffering could be necessary to maintain levels of gene expression within a particular range for each regulatory context. Given the enrichment of SDG-1 protein with perinuclear germ granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) and the maintenance of heritable changes in <italic>sdg-1::mCherry∆pi</italic> expression by a DEPS-1-dependent process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>), buffering against changes in gene expression could involve both RNA- and protein-based regulation that tunes the function of perinuclear germ granules. We therefore speculate that one role for extracellular RNAs that enter germ cells in other systems (e.g. tRNA fragments in mammals; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sharma et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sharma et al., 2018</xref>) could be to similarly buffer against heritable changes in gene expression.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and oligonucleotides</title><p>All strains (listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>) were cultured on Nematode Growth Medium (NGM) plates seeded with 100 μl of OP50 <italic>E. coli</italic> at 20 °C and strains made through mating were generated using standard methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brenner, 1974</xref>).

RNA concentration was measured and 1 μg of total RNA was used as input for reverse transcription using 50 U SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) (+RT) or no reverse transcriptase as a negative control (-RT) (RT primers: <italic>tbb-2</italic> (P98), <italic>sid-1</italic> (P101), <italic>W09B7.2/F07B7.2</italic> (P104), <italic>Y102A5C.36</italic> (P107)). For qPCR, each +RT biological replicate was assayed in technical triplicate for each gene target, along with a single -RT sample for each corresponding biological replicate using 2 μl cDNA and a no template control (NTC) with the LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master kit (Roche). Ct values were measured with the Bio-Rad C1000 CFX96 Real-Time System and Bio-Rad CFX Software (qPCR primers: <italic>tbb-2</italic> (P99 and P100), <italic>sid-1</italic> (P102 and P103), <italic>W09B7.2/F07B7.2</italic> (P105 and P106), <italic>Y102A5C.36</italic> (P108 and P109)). To calculate relative change in mRNA abundance compared to wild type, we calculated log<sub>2</sub>(2<sup>(-(gene Ct – tbb-2 Ct))</sup>) using the median of technical replicates for the biological triplicates of each genotype. Ct values were only used if they were lower than corresponding -RT and NTC Ct values. The median value of wild-type biological replicates was then subtracted from the value for each sample to plot calculated values with respect to wild-type levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>BLAST searches and protein alignment</title><p>BLAST (NCBI) searches were performed using the W09B7.2/F07B7.2 (SDG-1) amino acid sequence with default parameters and any homologs identified were aligned to SDG-1 using Clustal Omega (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Madeira et al., 2019</xref>) with default parameters.

When using multi-copy transgenes to express a SID-1 fusion protein tagged at the C-terminus with DsRed or GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>) under the control of a promoter that drives expression within body-wall muscles, we observed intracellular localization of SID-1::DsRed or SID-1::GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>) along with rescue of gene silencing by ingested dsRNA in body-wall muscles by both arrays (for SID-1::DsRed – silencing in wild type = 100% (n=10), <italic>sid-1(qt9)</italic>=0% (n=11), <italic>sid-1(qt9); jamIs2[myo-3p::sid-1(+)::DsRed]</italic>=100% (n=6); for SID-1::GFP – silencing in wild type = 100% (n=50), <italic>sid-1(qt9); jamEx193[myo-3p::sid-1(+)::gfp]</italic>=100% [n=60]). However, similar tagging to express SID-1 fusion proteins from either a single-copy transgene expressed in the germline (SID-1::DsRed) or the endogenous locus (SID-1::wrmScarlet) did not enable gene silencing by ingested dsRNA (for evaluating function of <italic>mex-5p::sid-1(+)::DsRed::sid-1 3’ UTR (jamSi12)</italic>: silencing of <italic>pos-1</italic> in wild-type=100% (n=7), <italic>sid-1(qt9)</italic>=0% (n=7), <italic>jamSi12; sid-1(qt9)</italic>=0% (n=15); for evaluating function of <italic>sid-1::wrmScarlet(jam117)</italic>: silencing of <italic>pos-1</italic> in wild-type=100% (n=8), <italic>sid-1(jam80)</italic>=0% (n=8), <italic>sid-1(jam117)</italic>=0% [n=8]), suggesting that the C-terminal fusions of SID-1 were likely non-functional and that apparent function when using multi-copy transgenes reflects production of untagged variants. In support of our rationale, a recent prediction of SID-1 structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Varadi et al., 2022</xref>) suggests that the C-terminus is sequestered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), a feature that may be disrupted by the addition of C-terminal fluorophores, potentially leading to misfolded proteins that are degraded.

Entry of dsRNA into the germline can initiate transgenerational RNA silencing of some but not all genes.

Spatial selectivity of dsRNA import and/or subsequent silencing was inferred based on differences in the frequency of patterns of silencing within the germline. Substrate selectivity of dsRNA transport pathways was probed using genetic mutants and dsRNA of different lengths and 5’ chemistry. Diversity of dsRNAs made in bacteria and upon in vitro transcription was visualized using Northern blotting. Analysis of <italic>sid-1</italic> mutants generated from the same wild-type cohort and a revertant was used for better control of genetic background, aiding in the identification of <bold><italic>s</italic></bold><italic>id-1</italic>-<bold>d</bold>ependent <bold>g</bold>enes (<italic>sdg</italic>). Separate measurement of <italic>sdg-1</italic> expression in descendants of independently edited isolates, along different lineages after perturbations, and in different gonads within single animals demonstrated stochasticity in gene expression and revealed establishment of different heritable epigenetic states. Co-localization of SDG-1::mCherry in perinuclear foci with the Z-granule marker GFP::ZNFX-1, its reported association with the Z-granule component ZSP-1/PID-2 and DEPS-1, changes in its levels in response to loss of SID-1 or the dsRNA-binding protein RDE-4 and its dynamic nuclear localization similar to CSR-1b was used to propose that SDG-1 plays a role in small RNA regulation while also being modulated by the activity of SID-1 and RDE-4.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-99149-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data are available on figshare (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.25036142.v1">https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.25036142.v1</ext-link>).

The specific mechanistic pathways how RNA travels between cells and progeny remains an open question. Here, Shugarts, et al. use molecular genetics, imaging, and genomics methods to dissect specific RNA transport and regulatory pathways in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> model system. Larvae ingesting double-stranded RNA is noted to not cause continuous gene silencing throughout adulthood. Damage of neuronal cells expressing double-stranded target RNA is observed to repress target gene expression in the germline. Exogenous short or long double-stranded RNA required different genes for entry into progeny. It was observed that the SID-1 double-stranded RNA transporter showed different expression over animal development. Removal of the sid-1 gene caused upregulation of two genes, the newly described sid-1-dependent gene sdg-1 and sdg-2. Both genes were observed to be negatively regulated by other small RNA regulatory pathways. Strikingly, loss then gain of sid-1 through breeding still caused variability of sdg-1 expression for many, many generations. SDG-2 protein co-localizes with germ granules, intracellular sites for heritable RNA silencing machinery. Collectively, sdg-1 presents a model to study how extracellular RNAs can buffer gene expression in germ cells and other tissues.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) Very cleaver molecular genetic methods and genomic analyses, paired with thorough genetics, were employed to discover insights into RNA transport, sdg-1 and sdg-2 as sid-1-dependent genes, and sdg-1's molecular phenotype.</p><p>(2) The manuscript is well cited, and figures reasonably designed.</p><p>(3) The discovery of the sdg genes being responsive to the extracellular RNA cell import machinery provides a model to study how exogenous somatic RNA is used to regulate gene expression in progeny. The discovery of genes within retrotransposons stimulates tantalizing models how regulatory loops may actually permit the genetic survival of harmful elements.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The manuscript is broad, making it challenging to read and consider the data presented.

The specific mechanistic pathways how RNA travels between cells and progeny remains an open question. Here, Shugarts, et al. use molecular genetics, imaging, and genomics methods to dissect specific RNA transport and regulatory pathways in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> model system. Larvae ingesting double-stranded RNA is noted to not cause continuous gene silencing throughout adulthood. Damage of neuronal cells expressing double-stranded target RNA is observed to repress target gene expression in the germline. Exogenous short or long double-stranded RNA required different genes for entry into progeny. It was observed that the SID-1 double-stranded RNA transporter showed different expression over animal development. Removal of the sid-1 gene caused upregulation of two genes, the newly described sid-1-dependent gene sdg-1 and sdg-2. Both genes were observed to be negatively regulated by other small RNA regulatory pathways. Strikingly, loss then gain of sid-1 through breeding still caused variability of sdg-1 expression for many, many generations.

They induce oxidative damage in worms, blocking dsRNA import into cells (and potentially affecting the worms in other ways). Oxidative stress inhibits dsRNA import and the associated heritable regulation of gene expression in the adult germline (Fig. 2). The authors identify a novel gene, sid-1-dependent gene-1 (sdg-1), which is induced upon inhibition of SID-1 (Fig. 3). Both transient inhibition and genetic depletion of SID-1 lead to the upregulation of sdg-1 and a second gene, sdg-2 (Fig. 5). The expression of SDG-1 is variable, potentially indicating buffering regulation. While the expression of Sdg-1 could be consistent with a role in intergenerational transport of dsRNA, neither its overexpression nor loss-of-function impacts dsRNA-mediated silencing (Fig. 7) in the germline. It would be interesting to test if sdg-2 functions redundantly.</p><p>In summary, the authors have identified a novel worm-specific protein (sdg-1) that is induced upon loss of dsRNA import via SID-1, but is not required to mediate SID-1 RNA regulatory effects.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting our findings on SDG-1. We found that oxidative damage in neurons enhanced dsRNA transport into the germline and/or subsequent silencing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Remaining Questions:</p><p>• The authors use an experimental system that induces oxidative damage specifically in neurons to release dsRNAs into the circulation. Would the same effect be observed if oxidative damage were induced in other cell types?</p></disp-quote><p>It is possible that oxidative damage of other tissues using miniSOG (as demonstrated in Xu and Chisholm, 2016) could also enhance the release of dsRNA into the circulation from those tissues. However, future experiments would be needed to test this empirically because it is also possible that the release of dsRNA depends on physiological properties (e.g., the molecular machinery promoting specific secretion) that are particularly active in neurons. We chose to use neurons as the source of dsRNA because by expressing dsRNA in a variety of tissues, neurons appeared to be the most efficient at the export of dsRNA as measured using SID-1-dependent silencing in other tissues (Jose et al., PNAS, 2009).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Besides dsRNA, which other RNAs and cellular products (macromolecules and small signalling molecules) are released into the circulation that could affect the observed changes in germ cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We do not yet know all the factors that could be released either in naive animals or upon oxidative damage of neurons that influence the uptake of dsRNA into other tissues. The dependence on SID-1 for the observed enhancement of silencing (Fig. 2) shows that dsRNA is necessary for silencing within the germline. Whether this import of dsRNA occurs in conjunction with other factors (e.g., the uptake of short dsRNA along with yolk into oocytes [Marré et al., PNAS, 2016]) before silencing within the germline will require further study. A possible approach could be the isolation of extracellular fluid (Banse and Hunter, J Vis Exp., 2012) followed by characterization of its contents. However, the limited material available using this approach and the difficulty in avoiding contamination from cellular damage by the needle used for isolating the material make it challenging.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• SID-1 modifies RNA regulation within the germline (Fig. 7) and upregulates sdg-1 and sdg-2 (Fig. 5). However, SID-1's effects do not appear to be mediated via sdg-1. Testing the role of sdg-2 would be intriguing.</p></disp-quote><p>We observe the accumulation of <italic>sdg-1</italic> and <italic>sdg-2</italic> RNA in two different mutants lacking SID-1, which led us to conservatively focus on the analysis of one of these proteins for this initial paper. We expect that more sensitive analyses of the RNA-seq data will likely reveal additional genes regulated by SID-1. With the ability to perform multiplexed genome-editing, we hope in future work to generate strains that have mutations in many SID-1-dependent genes to recapitulate the defects observed in <italic>sid-1(-)</italic> animals.

Consistent with the location of the <italic>sdg-1</italic> gene within a <italic>Cer9</italic> retrotransposon that appears to have integrated only within the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome, sequence conservation between the genomes of related species is only observed outside the region of the retrotransposon (see Author response image 1, screenshot from UCSC browser). There were no obvious defects detected in animals lacking <italic>sdg-1</italic> (Fig. 7) or in animals lacking <italic>sdg-2</italic> (data not shown). It is possible that further exploration of both mutants and mutant combinations lacking additional SID-1-dependent genes would reveal defects. We also plan to examine these mutants in sensitized genetic backgrounds where one or more members of the RNA silencing pathway have been compromised.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-99149-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Clarification for Readability:</p><p>To enhance readability and avoid misunderstandings, it is crucial to specify the model organism and its specific dsRNA pathways that are not conserved in vertebrates:</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and thank the reviewer for the specific suggestions provided below.

Especially in dsRNA biology, specifying the model organism is essential to avoid confusion about potential effects in humans.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with most statements made by the reviewer, although whether dsRNA is exclusively recognized as a foreign threat by all vertebrates of all stages remains controversial.

This concern is exemplified in the model figure, that requires two diagrams to summarize the claims made by the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>RNA interference (RNAi) by dsRNA is an organismal response where the delivery of dsRNA into the cytosol of some cell precedes the processing and ultimate silencing of the target gene within that cell. These two major steps are often not separately considered when explaining observations. Yet, the interpretation of every RNAi experiment is affected by both steps. To make the details that we have revealed in this work for both steps clearer, we presented the two models separated by scale - organismal vs. intracellular. We agree that this integrative manuscript appears very broad when the many different findings are each considered separately. The overall model revealed here forms the necessary foundation for the deep analysis of individual aspects in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The large scope of the manuscript denies space to further probe some of the ideas proposed. The first part of the manuscript, particularly Figures 1 and 2, presents data that can be caused by multiple mechanisms, some of which the authors describe in the results but do not test further. Thus, portions of the results text come across as claims that are not supported by the data presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that one of the consequences of addressing the joint roles of transport and subsequent silencing during RNAi is that the scope of the manuscript appears large. We had suggested multiple interpretations for specific observations in keeping with the need for further work. To avoid any misunderstandings that our listing of possible interpretations be taken as claims by the reader, we have followed the instructions of the reviewer (see below) and moved some of the potential explanations we raised to the discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The manuscript focuses on the genetics of SDGs but not the proteins themselves. Few descriptions of the SDGs functions are provided nor is it clarified why only SDG-1 was pursued in imaging and genetic experiments. Additionally, the SDG-1 imaging experiments could use additional localization controls.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that more work on the SDG proteins will likely be informative, but are beyond the scope of this already expansive paper. We began with the analysis of SDG-1 because it had the most support as a regulator of RNA silencing (Fig. 5f). Indeed, in other work (Lalit and Jose, bioRxiv, 2024), we find that AlphaFold 2 predicts the SDG-1 protein to be a regulator of RNA silencing that directly interacts with the dsRNA-editing enzyme ADR-2 and the endonuclease RDE-8. Furthermore, we expect that more sensitive analyses of the RNA-seq data are likely to reveal additional genes regulated by SID-1. Using multiplexed genome editing, we hope to generate mutant combinations lacking multiple <italic>sdg</italic> genes to reveal their function(s).</p><p>We agree that given the recent discovery of many components of germ granules, our imaging data does not have sufficient resolution to discriminate between them. We have modified our statements and our model regarding the colocalization of SDG-1 with Z-granules to indicate that the overlapping enrichment of SDG-1 and ZNFX-1 in the perinuclear region is consistent with interactions with other nearby granule components.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Major</p><p>(1) As presented, the manuscript is almost two manuscripts combined into one. This point is highlighted in Figure 7h, which basically presents two separate models. The key questions addressed in the manuscript starts at Figure 3. Figures 1 and 2 are interesting observations but require more experiments to define further. For example, as the Results text describes for Figure 1, &quot;These differences in the entry of ingested dsRNA into cells and/or subsequent silencing could be driven by a variety of changes during development. These include changes in the uptake of dsRNA into the intestine, distribution of dsRNA to other tissues from the intestine, import of dsRNA into the germline, and availability of RNA silencing factors within the germline.&quot; Presenting these (reasonable) mechanistic ideas detracted from the heritable RNA epigenetic mechanism explored in the later portion of the manuscript. There are many ways to address this issue, one being moving Figures 1 and 2 to the Supplement to focus on SID-1 related pathways.</p></disp-quote><p>Since this manuscript addresses the interaction between intercellular transport of dsRNA and heritable epigenetic changes, it was necessary to establish the possible route(s) that dsRNA could take to the germline before any inference could be made regarding heritable epigenetic changes. As suggested below (pt. 2), we have now moved the alternatives we enumerated as possible explanations for some experimental results (e.g., for the differences quoted here) to the discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The manuscript includes detailed potential interpretations in the Results, making them seem like claims. Here is an example:</p><p>&quot;Thus, one possibility suggested by these observations is that reduction of sdg-1 RNA via SID-1 alters the amount of SDG-1 protein, which could interact with components of germ granules to mediate RNA regulation within the germline of wild-type animals.&quot;</p><p>This mechanism is a possibility, but placing these ideas in the citable results makes it seem like an overinterpretation of imaging data. This text and others should be in the Discussion, where speculation is encouraged. Results sections like this example and others should be moved to the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rephrased motivating connections between experiments like the one quoted above and also moved such text to the discussion section wherever possible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) A paragraph describing the SDG proteins will be helpful. Homologs? Conserved protein domains? mRNA and/or protein expression pattern across worm, not just the germline? Conservation across Caenorhabditis sp? These descriptions may help establish context why SDG-1 localizes to Z-granules.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added information about the conservation of the sdg-1 gene in the manuscript. AlphaFold predicts domains with low confidence for the SDG-1 protein, consistent with the lack of conservation of this protein (AlphaFold requires multiple sequence alignments to predict confidently). In the adult animal, the SDG-1 protein was only detectable in the germline. Future work focused on SDG-1, SDG-2 and other SDG proteins will further examine possible expression in other tissues and functional domains if any. Unfortunately, in multiple attempts of single-molecule FISH experiments using probes against the sdg-1 open reading frame, we were unable to detect a specific signal above background (data not shown). Additional experiments are needed for the sensitive detection of sdg-1 expression outside the germline, if any.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Based on the images shown, SDG-1 could be in other nearby granules, such as P granules or mutator foci. Additional imaging controls to rule out these granules/condensates will greatly strengthen the argument that SDG-1 protein localizes to Z-granules specifically.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the final model to indicate that the perinuclear colocalization is with germ granules broadly and we agree that we do not have the resolution to claim that the observed overlap of SDG-1::mCherry with GFP::ZNFX-1 that we detect using Airyscan microscopy is specifically with Z granules. Our initial emphasis of Z-granule was based on the prior report of SDG-1 being co-immunoprecipitated with the Z-granule surface protein PID-2/ZSP-1. However, through other work predicting possible direct interactions using AlphaFold (Lalit and Jose, bioRxiv, 2024), we were unable to detect any direct interactions between PID-2 and SDG-1. Indeed, many additional granules have been recently reported (Chen et al., Nat. Commun., 2024; Huang et al., bioRxiv 2024), making it possible that SDG-1 has specific interactions with a component of one of the other granules (P, Z, M, S, E, or D) or adjacent P bodies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor</p><p>(1) &quot;This entry into the cytosol is distinct from and can follow the uptake of dsRNA into cells, which can rely on other receptors.&quot; Awkard sentence.
