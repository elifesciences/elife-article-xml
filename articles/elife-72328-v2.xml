Damaged organelles are recognized by a dedicated surveillance machinery, leading to the assembly of an autophagosome around the damaged organelle, prior to fusion with the degradative lysosomal compartment. Lysosomes themselves are also prone to damage and are degraded through the process of lysophagy. While early steps involve recognition of ruptured lysosomal membranes by glycan-binding galectins and ubiquitylation of transmembrane lysosomal proteins, many steps in the process, and their interrelationships, remain poorly understood, including the role and identity of cargo receptors required for completion of lysophagy. Here, we employ quantitative organelle capture and proximity biotinylation proteomics of autophagy adaptors, cargo receptors, and galectins in response to acute lysosomal damage, thereby revealing the landscape of lysosome-associated proteome remodeling during lysophagy. Among the proteins dynamically recruited to damaged lysosomes were ubiquitin-binding autophagic cargo receptors. Using newly developed lysophagic flux reporters including Lyso-Keima, we demonstrate that TAX1BP1, together with its associated kinase TBK1, are both necessary and sufficient to promote lysophagic flux in both HeLa cells and induced neurons (iNeurons). While the related receptor Optineurin (OPTN) can drive damage-dependent lysophagy when overexpressed, cells lacking either OPTN or CALCOCO2 still maintain significant lysophagic flux in HeLa cells. Mechanistically, TAX1BP1-driven lysophagy requires its N-terminal SKICH domain, which binds both TBK1 and the autophagy regulatory factor RB1CC1, and requires upstream ubiquitylation events for efficient recruitment and lysophagic flux. These results identify TAX1BP1 as a central component in the lysophagy pathway and provide a proteomic resource for future studies of the lysophagy process.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>autophagy</kwd><kwd>cargo receptors</kwd><kwd>lysosome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Aligning Science Across Parkinsons (ASAP)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ASAP-000282</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harper</surname><given-names>J Wade</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS083524</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harper</surname><given-names>J Wade</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS110395</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harper</surname><given-names>J Wade</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK098285</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Paulo</surname><given-names>Joao A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001033</institution-id><institution>Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hoyer</surname><given-names>Melissa J</given-names></name><name><surname>Eapen</surname><given-names>Vinay V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Swarup</surname><given-names>Sharan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ned Goodnow Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harper</surname><given-names>J Wade</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A combination of spatial proteomic and autophagic flux approaches was used to reveal the landscape of turnover of damaged lysosomes, demonstrating a key role for the autophagy receptor TAX1BP1 and its associated kinase TBK1 in both HeLa cells and iNeurons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The lysosome—a membrane-bound compartment containing proteolytic enzymes—has several indispensable functions in eukaryotic cells, including a central role in protein homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Perera and Zoncu, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Saftig and Puertollano, 2021</xref>). First, lysosomes play key roles in the degradation and recycling of proteins delivered from the endocytic, phagocytic, and secretory/biosynthetic pathways. Second, lysosomes are the terminal receptacle for a form of protein and organelle turnover called autophagy. In this process, double membrane structures called autophagosomes are built around cargo through a multistep process, culminating in the closure of the autophagosome around the cargo. Closed autophagosomes then fuse with lysosomes, thereby delivering their cargo to the lysosomal lumen for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yim and Mizushima, 2020</xref>). Third, the lysosome serves as a platform for sensing intracellular (cytosolic and intralysosomal) amino acid availability through regulation of the MTOR–MLST8–RPTOR complex by the Ragulator complex on the lysosomal membrane, including amino acids from both endocytic and autophagic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Saxton and Sabatini, 2017</xref>). A central element in lysosomal function is the acidification of the organelle during maturation, which promotes the activation of luminal proteolytic enzymes. Processes that lead to damaged lysosomal membranes—including physiological and pathophysiological pathways—can promote loss of the appropriate pH gradient and defective proteostasis. As such, mechanisms have evolved to both repair specific types of membrane damage or in some circumstances promote degradation of the damaged organelle by a process referred to as lysophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maejima et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Papadopoulos and Meyer, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Papadopoulos et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yim and Mizushima, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Several mechanisms for recognition of damaged membrane-bound organelles for selective autophagy have been identified. These processes—referred to as organellophagy—generally fall into two classes—ubiquitin (Ub)-dependent and Ub-independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anding and Baehrecke, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Khaminets et al., 2016</xref>). In Ub-independent forms of organellophagy (e.g. ER-phagy), receptor proteins typically embedded in the cognate membrane are directly recognized by the autophagic machinery to facilitate engulfment in response to regulatory signals. These cargo receptors employ LC3-interacting region (LIR) motifs to associate with the LIR-docking site (LDS) in one or more of six ATG8 adaptor proteins that are located in the growing autophagosomal membrane by virtue of attachment to phosphatidylethanolamine via their C-terminal glycine residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gubas and Dikic, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Johansen and Lamark, 2020</xref>). In contrast, Ub-dependent forms of organellophagy frequently employ a multistep process involving: (1) sensing of organelle damage, (2) ubiquitylation of one or more proteins associated with the membrane of the damaged organelle, (3) recruitment of one or more Ub-binding autophagy receptors containing LIR or other motifs that recruit autophagic machinery, and (4) expansion of the autophagic membrane around the organelle, thereby facilitating delivery to the lysosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gubas and Dikic, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Johansen and Lamark, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Khaminets et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lamark and Johansen, 2021</xref>). This pathway is perhaps best understood in the context of damaged mitochondria, where the Parkin Ub ligase catalyzes ubiquitylation of mitochondrial outer membrane proteins, followed by recruitment of multiple Ub-binding autophagy receptors including Optineurin (OPTN), CALCOCO2 (also called NDP52), SQSTM1 (also called p62), TAX1BP1, and NBR1 to the outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harper et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lazarou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Moore and Holzbaur, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ordureau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ordureau et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ordureau et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pickrell and Youle, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Richter et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wong and Holzbaur, 2014</xref>). However, available data suggest that only OPTN and to a lesser extent CALCOCO2 are necessary for ultimate delivery of damaged mitochondria to lysosomes in the majority of cell types examined thus far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lazarou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Evans and Holzbaur, 2020</xref>). The mechanistic basis for the utilization of distinct Ub-binding autophagy receptors for specific types of organellophagy is largely unknown, but a common feature appears to be a role for TBK1-dependent phosphorylation of the receptor and/or other components at the ‘synapse’ between the autophagosome and target organelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harding et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Moore and Holzbaur, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Richter et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wild et al., 2011</xref>). In the case of OPTN, its phosphorylation by TBK1 promotes association with Ub chains in the context of mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Richter et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have begun to map out pathways by which damaged lysosomes are selected for lysophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In response to rupture of the lysosomal membrane, specific galectins (principally LGALS3 and LGALS8, but LGALS1 and LGALS9 have also been shown to be recruited) bind to glycosylated luminal domains of lysosomal transmembrane proteins, while ubiquitylation of lysosomal membrane proteins occurs with kinetics similar to that of galectin recruitment to initiate lysophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aits et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maejima et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jia et al., 2018</xref>). Multiple steps in the ubiquitylation process that have been proposed include: (1) assembly of K63-linked and subsequently K48-linked Ub chains on lysosomal proteins, and (2) removal of K48-linked conjugates by the p97 (also called VCP) AAA<sup>+</sup> ATPase in combination with the deubiquitylating enzyme YOD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Papadopoulos et al., 2017</xref>). Depletion of the E2 Ub-conjugating enzyme UBE2QL1 dramatically reduces the extent of K48 Ub chain synthesis and impairs K63 Ub chain synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koerver et al., 2019</xref>). Multiple E3 Ub ligases have been proposed to ubiquitylate the lysosomal surface, including SCF<sup>FBXO27</sup> and the LGALS3-binding TRIM16 RING E3, but precisely how these E3s promote the pathway is poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chauhan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yoshida et al., 2017</xref>). Some aspects of this pathway have parallels with xenophagy, the process by which intracellular bacteria is removed by autophagy, including early ubiquitylation steps and recruitment of LGALS8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Thurston et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Thurston et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, multiple Ub-binding cargo receptors including OPTN, CALCOCO2, and TAX1BP1 are recruited to ubiquitylated bacteria and are required for efficient xenophagy in various contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Thurston et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Thurston et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tumbarello et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wild et al., 2011</xref>). While multiple cargo receptors have been reported to be recruited to damaged lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bussi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koerver et al., 2019</xref>), the underlying mechanisms for recruitment, the identity of the receptors critical for lysophagic flux, and the reasons for the diversity of receptors that are recruited remain unknown.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Quantitative analysis of the lysosomal proteome in response to damage.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme depicting major steps in lysophagy and the approaches employed to elucidate components of the pathway.

Using lysosomal immunoprecipitation (Lyso-IP) in the context of lysosomal membrane damage, we identified several Ub-binding cargo receptors and ATG8 proteins that are rapidly recruited to these organelles, and verified that LGALS1, LGALS3, and LGALS8 are recruited as well. Parallel APEX2-driven proximity biotinylation experiments using ATG8 proteins and specific galectins identified a cohort of lysosomal proteins, ESCRT III complex members, and autophagy regulatory proteins that are dramatically enriched during lysophagic flux, including specific Ub-binding cargo receptors. In order to assess the functional roles of various components in lysophagy, we developed LGALS3-based fluorescent flux reporters that monitor delivery of damaged lysosomes to healthy lysosomes via autophagy. We systematically examined the requirement of cargo receptors that are recruited to damaged lysosomes in HeLa cells, and found that while cells lacking TAX1BP1 were completely deficient for lysophagy, cells lacking OPTN, CALCOCO2, or SQSTM1 still maintained significant lysophagic flux, indicating that TAX1BP1 plays a critical nonredundant function. Similarly, human embryonic stem (ES) cell-derived induced neurons (iNeurons) lacking TAX1BP1 are also defective for lysophagic flux. Lysophagic flux via TAX1BP1 required its N-terminal SKICH domain, as well as Ala-114 within the SKICH domain, which is known to function in the recruitment of both the TBK1 protein kinase via the NAP1 adaptor and the RB1CC1 subunit of the ULK1 kinase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ohnstad et al., 2020</xref>). Consistent with a role for TBK1, cells lacking TBK1 or addition of a small molecular inhibitor of TBK1 blocks lysophagic flux. Additional experiments indicate that recruitment of TAX1BP1 and OPTN to damaged lysosomes is promoted by an upstream Ub signal. These data provide a resource for factors involved in lysophagy and reveal a unique role for TAX1BP1 in the removal of damaged lysosomes that appear to be distinct from the mechanisms used for removal of mitochondria downstream of Parkin, which relies primarily on OPTN and CALCOCO2.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Quantitative lysosomal proteomics during lysophagy</title><p>Previous studies have revealed that lysosomal membrane damage can result in increased ubiquitylation of lysosomal proteins as well as the recruitment of specific galectins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aits et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jia et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jia et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jia et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maejima et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yoshida et al., 2017</xref>).

To facilitate quantitative identification of candidates, we merged the Lyso-IP approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abu-Remaileh et al., 2017</xref>) with Tandem Mass Tagging (TMT)-based proteomics via synchronous precursor selection (SPS) and quantification of reporter ions using MS<sup>3</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McAlister et al., 2014</xref>).

This resulted in the identification of several proteins that were enriched on ruptured lysosomes at one or more time points post-GPN, including multiple ATG8 proteins (MAP1LC3B, GABARAPL1, and GABARAPL2), galectins (LGALS1, LGALS3, and LGALS8), and the Ub-binding cargo receptors (CALCOCO2 and SQSTM1) with Log<sub>2</sub> fold change (FC) &gt;0.5 (p-value &lt;0.05) for at least one time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

Consistent with this, we observed transient enrichment of ESCRT-III components CHMP1B, CHMP5, CHMP6, and PCDC6IP by Lyso-IP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We also observed a reduction in the abundance of the MTORC1 complex (MLST8, RPTOR, and MTOR) post-damage, consistent with previous reports that lysosomal damage leads to loss of this kinase complex from the lysosomal surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, E and F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jia et al., 2018</xref>).

To initially check for fusion protein function, cells stably expressing FLAG-APEX2 fusions with GABARAPL2 (WT or LDS mutant Y49A/L50A) or MAP1LC3B (WT or LDS mutant K51A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mizushima, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) were treated for 1 hr with LLOMe prior to immunostaining to examine recruitment of the FLAG-tagged APEX2 protein to lysosomes marked with α-LAMP1 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Both WT constructs formed more numerous and larger puncta than the LDS mutants, consistent with enhanced lysosomal recruitment.

As such, we systematically examined recruitment of cargo receptor proteins to damaged lysosomes using immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–E</xref>). As expected, LGALS3 was recruited to LAMP1-positive lysosomes, a subset of which were also positive for MAP1LC3B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

As an independent approach to examine recruitment of cargo receptors to lysosomes, we employed proximity biotinylation of CALCOCO2, TAX1BP1, SQSTM1, and OPTN, and each APEX2-fusion protein was shown to associate with a subset of lysosomes upon damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B-D</xref>).

We therefore systematically probed cargo receptor involvement in lysophagy. We first developed a tool for the quantitative assessment of lysophagic flux by employing monomeric mKeima (referred to here as Keima) fused with LGALS3, which we term Lyso-Keima (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Keima is a pH-responsive reporter that undergoes a chromophore resting charge-state change upon trafficking to the lysosome (pH of ~4.5) and is stable within the lysosome, allowing flux measurements by flow cytometry or microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Katayama et al., 2011</xref>). The Keima protein itself is also stable to lysosomal proteases, and the appearance of a ‘processed’ Keima protein by immunoblotting therefore reveals lysosomal trafficking of the Keima fusion protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">An and Harper, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Katayama et al., 2011</xref>). HeLa cells expressing Keima-LGALS3 were treated with LLOMe (1 hr) and then chased with fresh media for the indicated time prior to analysis by imaging, flow cytometry, or immunoblotting for ‘processed’ Keima (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–G</xref>). Under basal conditions, Keima-LGALS3 was diffusely cytosolic with signal observed only in the 442 nm excitation channel (neutral pH) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). However, after the LLOMe chase (1 hr LLOMe treated and 4–12 hr washout), we observed a dramatic relocalization of the reporter into puncta in the 442 nm channel, consistent with recruitment to damaged lysosomes. Importantly, a large fraction of these puncta displayed a signal ratio greater than one when comparing the 561 nm/442 nm ratio at 12 hr washout, indicative of trafficking of damaged lysosomes into an acidic compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref>). The presence of acidic Keima-LGALS3 puncta was completely blocked by the addition of Bafilomycin A1 (a lysosomal acidification inhibitor, BafA) during the washout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–D</xref>). This ratio shift in LLOMe chased Keima-LGALS3 cells could also be measured using flow cytometry analysis; the 561 nm/488 nm excitation ratio was increased approximately twofold 1 hr after LLOMe and washout (12 hr) in biological triplicate assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). This increase was completely blocked by incubation of cells with BafA during the LLOMe washout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that damaged Keima-positive lysosomes are trafficked to healthy lysosomes, potentially including those newly generated via the TFEB-mediated transcriptional response, for elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nakamura et al., 2020</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>TBK1 is required for lysophagic flux.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme depicting measurement of lysophagic flux using Lyso-Keima (Keima-LGALS3).

First, as observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nozawa et al., 2020</xref>), we found that phosphorylation of TBK1 on Serine 172 (pS172, referred to as pTBK1) previously linked with activation of its kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kishore et al., 2002</xref>) is evident after 1 hr of LLOMe and is maintained from 6-8 hr post-washout, returning to baseline by 12 hr in HeLa cells expressing the Keima-LGALS3 reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Similarly, pTBK1 was detected on LGALS3-positive puncta after 1 hr LLOMe treatment and at 4 hr after 1 hr LLOMe treatment by immunofluorescence (mean MOC 0.1–0.3), indicating that the activated kinase is recruited to a subset of damaged lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Thus, TBK1 activation and engagement of damaged lysosomes precede the earliest signs of lysophagic flux.</p><p>We next examined whether TBK1 was required for lysophagic flux. First, we found that a small molecule TBK1 inhibitor (MRT60821, referred to as TBK1i) added at the time of LLOMe washout, blocked Keima-LGALS3 flux by imaging analysis of acidic puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–D</xref>), by flow cytometry assays performed in biological triplicate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), and immunoblotting of processed Keima (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>) to an extent similar to that observed with BafA. Moreover, TBK1<sup>−/−</sup> HeLa cells were equally defective in Keima-LGALS3 flux as ATG5<sup>−/−</sup> cells by flow cytometry assays performed in biological triplicate, consistent with a major requirement for TBK1 in this process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). Interestingly, while pTBK1 was reduced to basal levels 12 hr post-LLOMe, pTBK1 remained fully elevated at this time in the presence of BafA or TBK1i (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>), suggesting that loss of pTBK1 could reflect autophagic degradation of the activated pool.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Selectivity of Ub-binding autophagy receptors in lysophagic flux</title><p>Based on proteomic, immunofluorescence, and immunoblotting experiments described previously, multiple Ub- and TBK1-binding autophagy receptors (OPTN, CALCOCO2, and TAX1BP1) are rapidly recruited to damaged lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, the contribution of the various autophagy receptors to actual lysophagic flux is unknown. To address this question, we first expressed Keima-LGALS3 in HeLa cells previously engineered to lack OPTN, CALCOCO2, and TAX1BP1 (referred to as triple knockout [TKO] cells; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heo et al., 2015</xref>) and measured lysophagic flux by flow cytometry in biological triplicate. The TKO mutant cells were as defective in LLOMe-stimulated lysophagic flux as cells lacking ATG5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). In order to examine the extent to which each individual receptor is capable of promoting flux, we then reconstituted TKO cells expressing the Keima-LGALS3 reporters with EGFP-tagged OPTN, CALCOCO2, or TAX1BP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>). While EGFP-TAX1BP1 and EGFP-OPTN rescued lysophagic flux, EGFP-CALCOCO2 was ineffective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>). To further examine receptor specificity, we used gene editing to created mKeima-LGALS3 reporter cells lacking individual receptors (OPTN, TAX1BP1, CALCOCO2, or SQSTM1), as well as ATG7 as a control for canonical autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A-E</xref>). We found that cells lacking TAX1BP1 have the most severe block to lysophagic flux, phenotypically similar to cells lacking ATG7 examined in parallel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Cells lacking SQSTM1 or OPTN had essentially wild-type lysophagic flux whereas CALCOCO2<sup>−/−</sup> cells had a partial reduction in lysophagic flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Consistent with a block in flux, TAX1BP1<sup>−/−</sup> cells – but not OPTN<sup>−/−</sup> or CALCOCO2<sup>−/−</sup> cells – displayed extensive LGALS3-positive puncta 10 hr post-washout after LLOMe treatment, as assessed using endogenous αLGALS3 staining by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). The defect in TAX1BP1<sup>−/−</sup> cells was rescued by expression of EGFP-TAX1BP1, which also associated with LAMP1-positive puncta in LLOMe-treated cells, but expression of EGFP alone as a negative control failed to rescue clearance of, or associate with, damaged lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that in HeLa cells, TAX1BP1 can drive lysophagic flux and that, among cargo receptors, TAX1BP1 is both necessary and sufficient for lysophagy. Moreover, overexpression of OPTN on its own can also promote lysophagy in cells lacking OPTN, TAX1BP1, and CALCOCO2, but is not required in HeLa cells. Interestingly, in our cell system, we were unable to validate the previous report based on RNAi that SQSTM1 is required for lysophagic flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Papadopoulos et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Role for Ub-binding autophagy receptors in lysophagy.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Triplicate WT; ATG5<sup>−/−</sup>; or OPTN<sup>−/−</sup>; TAX1BP1<sup>−/−</sup>; CALCOCO2<sup>−/−</sup> (TKO) HeLa cells expressing Keima-LGALS3 were either left untreated or treated for 1 hr followed by washout (12 hr) prior to flow cytometry to measure the 561 nm/488 nm ratio.

As an initial step toward defining the mechanisms underlying removal of damaged lysosomes in neurons, we created a genetically tractable system for functional analysis of lysophagic flux.

We used PiggyBac transposase to create cells expressing RFP-EGFP-LGALS3 as a tandem reporter of lysophagic flux.

These cells also contained RFP-positive puncta that colocalize with LAMP1-positive puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

In addition, TAX1BP1 also contains an N-terminal SKICH domain, which interacts with the TBK1-binding adaptor protein NAP1, to facilitate TBK1 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fu et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, TAX1BP1 has also been recently shown to bind RB1CC1—a component of the ULK1 kinase complex required for autophagy—in a manner that requires Alanine 114 within the SKICH domain and a LGALS8-binding element located between residues 632 and 639 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bell et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ohnstad et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). In order to probe the activities of these functional elements in lysophagy, we stably expressed various TAX1BP1 mutants in HeLa TKO cells and measured lysophagic flux by flow cytometry in biological triplicate after lysosomal damage with LLOMe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C and D</xref>). Consistent with a recent report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ohnstad et al., 2020</xref>), we found that this collection of TAX1BP1 mutants displayed differential levels of expression, with several mutants including 632–639Δ displaying elevated levels compared to WT TAX1BP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). In addition, although the antibody employed does not react with the CC2Δ mutant, we demonstrated that the expression level of this mutant is equivalent to that of CC1Δ and CC3Δ based on EGFP fluorescence measured by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We found that various TAX1BP1 mutations display varying levels of activity. First, deletion of the SKICH domain (1–140Δ) resulted in the complete inhibition of lysophagic flux, comparable to that observed in the TKO mutant, despite being expressed at a level higher than WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C and D</xref>). Consistent with this, expression of the A114Q mutant also severely blocked lysophagic flux. In contrast, mutations that affect LGALS8 binding (Y635A, N637A, and 632–639Δ) or removal of any of the CC domains had little or no impact on lysophagic flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). The V192S mutation that affects binding to ATG8 proteins reduced activity by ~40% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Finally, mutation of TAX1BP1’s C-terminal ZnF domain resulted in a partial (~50%) reduction in activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), but still retained the ability to be recruited to damaged lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, previous studies have shown that this mutation has residual Ub-binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tumbarello et al., 2015</xref>), potentially accounting for residual activity. Therefore, to examine a direct role for Ub in TAX1BP1 recruitment, we treated cells with E1i before LLOMe treatment and during a 4hr washout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

In parallel, the D474N Ub-binding mutant of OPTN was tested and did not rescue the TKO phenotype to promote lysophagy while the TBK1 phosphoresistant mutants of OPTN expressed in the TKO background did rescue lysophagic flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E and F</xref>).

These results are consistent with prior observations that LGALS8 regulates the autophagic response after lysosomal damage and suggest that LGALS8 is a key regulatory node for lysophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jia et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Prior observations have indicated that the selective autophagy receptors, SQSTM1 and TAX1BP1, are recruited to damaged lysosomes, and SQSTM1 has been reported to be required for lysophagy in HeLa cells using siRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Papadopoulos et al., 2017</xref>). Our proteomics data clearly demonstrate that SQSTM1, CALCOCO2, OPTN, and TAX1BP1 are recruited to the lysosome within 30 min post-damage, raising questions about the actual identity of the relevant receptors. Are all recruited receptors necessary for lysophagy, perhaps playing distinct roles or are some receptors recruited but not required? To address this question, we developed a lysophagic flux assay—Lyso-Keima—and demonstrated in HeLa cells that deletion of TAX1BP1 was sufficient to eliminate lysophagic flux. Reduced lysophagic flux was also found in iNeurons lacking TAX1BP1. In HeLa cells lacking TAX1BP1, OPTN, and CALCOCO2, TAX1BP1 and to a lesser extent OPTN, but not CALCOCO2, can rescue lysophagy. In iNeurons, the phenotype of TAX1BP1<sup>-/-</sup>; OPTN<sup>-/-</sup> double mutants was similar to TAX1BP1 deletion alone, suggesting that OPTN does not play a supporting role in this process in this context. The dramatic reduction in lysophagic flux in HeLa cells or iNeurons solely lacking TAX1BP1 also indicates that SQSTM1 is not sufficient to support flux in these cells under the conditions employed here. These results, together with the results of prior studies on other types of selective autophagy, indicate distinct receptor requirements for individual cargo. For example, in HeLa cells, Parkin-dependent mitophagic flux requires primarily OPTN and CALCOCO2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wong and Holzbaur, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lazarou et al., 2015</xref>), in addition to TBK1 and xenophagy require CALCOCO2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ravenhill et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, our results indicate that the apparent strength of receptor recruitment to damaged organelles is not a surrogate for a functional role.</p><p>Overall, our data support the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>. Lysosome rupture leads to two apparently independent pathways, one resulting in the ubiquitylation of lysosomal proteins and the other reflecting association of galectins with glycosylated luminal domains in lysosomal membrane proteins. Recruitment of LGALS3 or LGALS8 does not require the Ub pathway downstream of UBE2QL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koerver et al., 2019</xref>), and likewise, the activation of the ubiquitylation arm of the pathway does not require LGALS3 or LGALS8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jia et al., 2020a</xref>) However, it has been reported that depletion of LGALS9 leads to reduced lysosomal ubiquitylation indicating some level of cross-talk between the two pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jia et al., 2020a</xref>). Precisely which ubiquitylation systems are involved and how they mechanistically are linked with LGALS9 remains unknown. Our results indicate that the Ub arm of the pathway is critical for recruitment of TAX1BP1 and OPTN. First, inhibition of the UBA1 E1-activating enzyme blocks TAX1BP1 recruitment to damaged lysosomes and point mutatations in TAX1BP1’s C-terminal ZnF domain that reduce, but do not eliminate Ub-binding, displayed reduced lysophagic flux in response to LLOMe. Interestingly, inhibition of p97 or TBK1 did not block TAX1BP1 recruitment to damaged lysosomes, although both inhibitors blocked flux and therefore p97 and TBK1 presumably have roles downstream of TAX1BP1 recruitment. Second, mutation of OPTN’s Ub-binding UBAN domain abolishes recruitment to damaged lysosomes and blocks flux in the context of rescue of the TAX1BP1/OPTN/CALCOCO2 triple mutant HeLa cells. Given that TAX1BP1 can also interact with overexpressed LGALS8 independent of lysosomal damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bell et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huttlin et al., 2021</xref>), it is formally possible that recruitment can occur via both Ub-dependent and -independent pathways under some conditions.</p><p>Both TAX1BP1 and OPTN associate with the TBK1 protein kinase, albeit through distinct structural motifs. Several findings link TBK1 with lysophagy. First, small molecular inhibitors of TBK1 block lysophagic flux in HeLa cells and iNeurons, and deletion of TBK1 blocks lysophagy in HeLa cells. Second, deletion of the SKICH domain of TAX1BP1 or mutation of A114 which is required for TBK1–NAP1 association results in loss of activity in lysophagic flux assays. Third, while reintroduction of WT TAX1BP1 into TAX1BP1<sup>–/–</sup> HeLa cells activates TBK1 phosphorylation in response to LLOMe, removal or mutation of the SKICH domain abolishes TBK1 activation in TKO cells, indicating that TBK1 activation depends on its association with TAX1BP1. The targets of TBK1 in this context remain to be identified, but we note that the cargo adaptors themselves are substrates of TBK1 in other types of selective autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Richter et al., 2016</xref>), and RAB7 is a substrate of TBK1 in response to signals that induce mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heo et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The observation that TAX1BP1 is a major receptor for lysophagy extends recent work identifying roles for the protein in various selective autophagic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gubas and Dikic, 2021</xref>). TAX1BP1 likely plays a dual role, as it interacts with both TBK1 and the RB1CC1–ULK1–ATG13 complex through its SKICH domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>). This may allow TAX1BP1 to orchestrate signaling via both of these kinase complexes, and could possibly promote autophagosome formation directly via recruitment of ULK1 to cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ravenhill et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Turco et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vargas et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, TAX1BP1 appears to have diverse cargo, ranging from membranous organelles as shown here to ubiquitylated protein aggregates as recently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sarraf et al., 2020</xref>). TBK1, OPTN, p97, and other factors involved in selective autophagy are mutated in a variety of neurological disorders such as ALS and FTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cirulli et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Freischmidt et al., 2015</xref>). Further elucidation of the mechanisms used by these proteins and their relationship to other components such as TAX1BP1 will assist in the development of therapeutic approaches.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Briefly, cells were plated onto 35-mm glass bottom dish (No. 1.5, 14-mm glass diameter, MatTek). Live cells were imaged at 37°C in prewarmed Fluorobrite supplemented with 10% FBS. For all immunofluorescence experiments, cells were first fixed at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde plus in PBS, solubilized in 0.1% Triton-X in PBS blocked with 1% BSA/0.1% Triton-X in PBS and then immunostained. Primary antibodies were used at 1:500 and AlexaFluor-conjugated antibodies (Thermo Fisher) were used at 1:300. Images of fixed cells were captured at room temperature. Cells were imaged using a Yokogawa CSU-X1 spinning disk confocal on a Nikon Ti-E inverted microscope at the Nikon Imaging Center in Harvard Medical School. Nikon Perfect Focus System was used to maintain cell focus over time. The microscope equipped with a Nikon Plan Apo 40×/1.30 N.A. or 100x/1.40 N.A. objective lens and 445 nm (75 mW), 488 nm (100 mW), 561 nm (100 mW), and 642 nm (100 mW) laser lines controlled by AOTF. Pairs of images for ratiometric analysis of mKeima fluorescence were collected sequentially using 100 mW 442 nm and 100 mW 561 solid-state lasers and emission collected with a 620/60 nm filter (Chroma Technologies). All images were collected with a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER cooled CCD camera (6.45 µm<sup>2</sup> photodiode) with MetaMorph image acquisition software.

Image analysis was performed using both Fiji and Cell Profiler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McQuin et al., 2018</xref>). Mander’s Overlap Correlation (MOC) in lysosomes was performed in Cell Profiler. Each field of view for every unique condition was thresholded in the same way with a consistent pipeline. The ‘identify primary objects’ tool was used to find puncta for both the lysosome channel and for the respective receptor or p-TBK1 stain. The ‘measure colocalization’ module was used to compare the fluorescence intensities within the areas defined by the threshold. The MOC with Costes was reported for each field of view.</p><p>The LGALS3 puncta detected by immunofluorescence in HeLa cells and the RFP-GFP-LGALS3 puncta detected in the iN system upon LLOMe treatment and subsequent washout were all identified using Cell Profiler and the following protocols available on protocols.io at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bx8pprvn">dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bx8pprvn</ext-link> (for HeLa cells LGALS3) and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bx48pqzw">dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bx48pqzw</ext-link> (for iN RFP-GFP-LGALS3).

The resuspend cells were filtered through cell strainer caps into FACS tubes (Corning, 352235) and placed on ice. The cells (~10,000 per replicate) were then analyzed by flow cytometry on a BD FACSymphony flow cytometer and the data were exported into Flowjo. After gating for live, single cells and Keima-positive cells, the 561 nm (acidic) to 488 nm (neutral) excitation ratio was calculated in Flowjo by diving the mean values of 561 nm excited cells to those excited at 488 nm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-4"><title>Imaging</title><p>Analysis of acidic Keima-LGALS3 puncta at 12hr washout was done in Cell Profiler using a consistent pipeline for each condition.

The acidic puncta in the resulting image were marked using the ‘identify primary objects’ tool by applying an Otsu threshold for puncta 5–20 pixels in diameter. Each resulting punctum was matched to its respective cell and counted. The ‘image math’ image was exported, and a ‘Fire’look up table in Fiji was applied to show the acidic signal (561 nm/442 nm) hotspots.

Lysosomal immunoprecipitation was carried out as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wyant et al., 2018</xref> with a few modifications. Briefly, cells endogenously tagged with TMEM192<sup>HA</sup> were seeded in 15-cm plates. All buffers were supplemented with protease inhibitors. At 80% confluency the cells were harvested on ice by scraping and washed once with PBS containing protease inhibitors (Roche). The cells were pelleted at 300 g for 5 min at 4<sup>o</sup>C and were washed once with KPBS buffer (136 mM KCl, 10 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 50 mM sucrose, pH 7.2). The cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml KPBS and lysed using 30 strokes in a 2-ml Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. The lysed cells were spun down at 1000 g for 5 min at 4°C. The pellet was discarded and the protein concentration of the lysate was determined by Bradford assay. After normalizing the protein concentration to be equal across all replicates, 5% of the input sample was saved and 50–100 μl of anti-HA magnetic beads was added the remainder of the sample. This mixture was placed on gentle rotation for 20 min, and beads were separated from the lysate using a magnetic stand. The beads were washed twice with KPBS containing 300 mM NaCl and once with KPBS buffer. The samples were then eluted either by boiling the beads with 100 μl 2× Laemmeli buffer (for western blot) for 10 min or with 100 μl KPBS containing 0.5% NP-40 in thermo mixer at 30°C for 20 min (for mass spectrometry).

TCA was added to eluates at final concentration of 20% and placed on ice at 4<sup>o</sup>C for at least an hour. Precipitates were pelleted for 30 min at maximum speed at 4<sup>o</sup>C, and then the pellets were washed three times using ice cold methanol. Dried pellets were then resuspended in in 50 μl, 200 mM EPPS, pH 8.0. Peptide digestion was carried out using LysC (Wako cat. # 129‐02541, 0.25 μg) for 2 h at 37<sup>o</sup>C followed by trypsin (0.5 μg) overnight. Digested peptides were then labelled with 4 μl of TMT reagent (at 20 μg/μl stock) for 1 hr and the reaction was quenched using hydroxylamine at a final concentration of 0.5 % (wt/vol) for 20 min. The samples were the combined and dried in a vacuum centrifuge.

To induce proximity labeling in live cells, cells were incubated with 500 μM biotin phenol (LS-3500.0250, Iris Biotech) for 1 hr and treated with 1 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 1 min, and the reaction was quenched with 1× PBS supplemented with 5 mM Trolox, 10 mM sodium ascorbate, and 10 mM sodium azide. Cells were then harvested, and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (supplemented with 5 mM Trolox, 10 mM sodium ascorbate, and 10 mM sodium azide). To enrich biotinylated proteins, an identical amount of cleared lysates in each cell was subjected to affinity purification by incubating with the streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (catalog no. 88817, Pierce) for 1 hr at room temperature. Beads were subsequently washed twice with RIPA buffer, once with 1 M KCl, once with 0.1 M NaCO<sub>3</sub>, once with 2 M urea, twice with RIPA buffer, and three times with PBS.</p><p>For proteomics, biotinylated protein bound to the beads was digested with trypsin in 0.1 M EPPS [4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinepropanesulfonic acid, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-1-propanesulfonic acid, <italic>N</italic>-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-<italic>N</italic>′-(3-propanesulfonic acid)] (pH 8.5) overnight at 37°C.

Peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) were adjusted to a 1% false discovery rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Elias and Gygi, 2007</xref>). PSM filtering was performed using a linear discriminant analysis, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huttlin et al., 2010</xref>). To quantify the TMT-based reporter ions in the datasets, the summed signal-to-noise (S:N) ratio for each TMT channel was obtained and found the closest matching centroid to the expected mass of the TMT reporter ion (integration tolerance of 0.003 Da).

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, including Ivan Dikic as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Geoffrey Hesketh (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This paper will be of significant interest to cell biologists studying lysophagy and selective autophagy more generally. It presents an extensive proteomic dataset, provides novel biological insight, and offers new reagents that will be of great value to the community. The data are of high quality and the conclusions are well supported.</p><p>Comments for authors to consider:</p><p>1) It is interesting that TBK1 seems to be essential for maintaining lysophagy flux in lyso-Keima assays. Did the authors find TBK1 in any of proximity biotinylation studies of the damaged lysosome? It seems to be minorly (&lt;0.5 log2fold change) enriched in APEX-LC3B interactome in Figure 2C.</p><p>2) Is the Flow cytometry Keima-LGALS3 assay in Figure 8C similar when TAX1BP KO cells are used instead of triple KOs? This would indicate that lysophagy flux is strongly dependent on the SKICH domain of TAX1BP1 with very little contribution from CALCOCO1 and OPTN1. Does deletion of SKICH domain affect lysosomal localisation of TAX1BP1?</p><p>3) Authors suggest that lysosomes recover by fusion with healthy lysosomes. Is this due to an increase in lysosomal biogenesis which is triggered after Llome treatment? Since all the flux measurements are taken at 10-12h after Llome removal, lysosomal biogenesis (through TFEB) may be important in this case. The authors can discuss such possibilities in the Discussion section.</p><p>4) The authors adapted a LysoIP system in which endogenous TMEM192 is fused to a 3xHA tag, allowing affinity purification and subsequent mass spectrometric analysis of lysosomes under different cellular conditions. They also explored the lysosomal proteome by performing proximity-dependent biotinylation and mass spectrometry experiments using APEX2 – a peroxidase-based enzyme – fused to proteins that are recruited to damaged lysosomes. Using these proteomic tools in the context of lysosomal damage – induced by treatment with either GPN or LLoMe – the authors comprehensively explored the differential recruitment of proteins to damaged lysosomes, producing what they refer to as the &quot;lysophagy proteome landscape&quot;. While of undeniable quality and value as a dataset, the authors did not specifically highlight novel proteins or potential mechanisms that their dataset revealed. Instead, subsequent functional analysis was focused on proteins with known roles in selective autophagy and / or lysophagy. In fact, the autophagy receptors that were investigated functionally were not particularly highly enriched in their &quot;lysophagy proteome landscape&quot; relative to many other proteins. Although not a major weakness, some specific discussion of potentially novel observations, if any, within the proteomic dataset would have been welcome.

The manuscript is a rich resource of proteomic data and identifies the different molecular players that are instrumental in recovery of lysosomes after Llome mediated damage. The authors nicely show the importance of TAX1BP1 and TBK1 in measuring lysophagy flux using the lyso-Keima reporter system and suggest that lysosomes recover from damage by autophagosomal fusion of damaged organelles with intact healthy lysosomes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this paper, Eapen et al., investigate the molecular underpinnings of lysophagy – the clearance of damaged lysosomes through selective autophagy. The paper is split into two major parts. First, the authors perform a comprehensive series of proteomics experiments to investigate the differential recruitment of proteins to the lysosome upon damage. Next the authors undertake a detailed investigation of the functional requirement for different autophagy receptors in the process of lysophagy. Functional studies are carried out in HeLa cells, as well as preliminary investigations in induced Neurons (iNeurons). In addition to the creation of a valuable proteomic dataset that will fuel future studies into lysophagy, the authors demonstrate a specific function for the autophagy receptor TAXBP1 in lysophagy, and further define some of the molecular features of TAXBP1 that underlie its role in this process. Broadly speaking this study is extremely comprehensive, the data are of high quality, and the conclusions are well supported by the data. The proteomic dataset, the newly developed reagents and assays, and the mechanistic insights uncovered in the paper make important contributions to the selective autophagy field.</p><p>Key achievements in the paper are further summarized below.</p><p>1) The authors adapted a system previously developed in the Sabatini lab (which they call Lyso-IP) in which endogenous TMEM192 is fused to a 3xHA tag, allowing affinity purification and subsequent mass spectrometric analysis of lysosomes under different cellular conditions. They also explored the lysosomal proteome by performing proximity-dependent biotinylation and mass spectrometry experiments using APEX2 – a peroxidase-based enzyme – fused to proteins that are recruited to damaged lysosomes. Using these proteomic tools in the context of lysosomal damage – induced by treatment with either GPN or LLoMe – the authors comprehensively explored the differential recruitment of proteins to damaged lysosomes, producing what they refer to as the &quot;lysophagy proteome landscape&quot;. While of undeniable quality and value as a dataset, the authors did not specifically highlight novel proteins or potential mechanisms that their dataset revealed. Instead, subsequent functional analysis was focused on proteins with known roles in selective autophagy and / or lysophagy. In fact, the autophagy receptors that were investigated functionally were not particularly highly enriched in their &quot;lysophagy proteome landscape&quot; relative to many other proteins. Although not a major weakness, some specific discussion of potentially novel observations, if any, within the proteomic dataset would have been welcomed. Nonetheless, despite not being a clear extension of the proteomic data, the subsequent functional analysis is of very high quality.</p><p>2) The authors systematically investigated the contributions of autophagy receptors and their regulation to the process of lysophagy induced by lysosomal damaging agents. They first developed a very nice reagent they call Lyso-Keima – a fusion between the galectin LGALS3 and the fluorophore mKeima, which when recruited to damaged lysosomes by LGALS3 undergoes an acidic pH-dependent spectral shift – to monitor lysophagic flux using different readouts: microscopy, flow cytometry, or Western blotting. Using the Lyso-Keima reagent in HeLa cell lines in which a variety of genetic perturbations and / or reconstitutions have been made, the authors demonstrated that the autophagy receptor TAXBP1 is both necessary and sufficient in lysophagy, with additional functional contribution from OPTN – though OPTN appears to be partially sufficient but not necessary. They also demonstrated a functional requirement for regulation through the kinase TBK1, although the critical substrates in lysophagy were not identified. More detailed analysis revealed a specific requirement for the TAXBP1 N-terminal SKICH domain in regulation of lysophagy, as well as a requirement for upstream ubiquitylation signals to induce TAXBP1 recruitment to damaged lysosomes.</p><p>3) Another nice feature of this paper is that the authors extended their observations made in HeLa cells to an induced neuron model system – iNeurons. Here they again showed a requirement for TBK1 and TAXBP1 in lysophagy. Their development of a lysophagy assay in iNeurons will be highly valuable for future studies investigating a potential role for lysophagy in cell-based models of neurodegenerative diseases.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72328.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comments for authors to consider:</p><p>1) It is interesting that TBK1 seems to be essential for maintaining lysophagy flux in lyso-Keima assays.

Given that multiple TBK1-associated cargo adaptors are undergoing basal autophagic flux, there is already a pool of TBK1 associated with the lysosome. Since we are not detecting peptides specific to pTBK1 in the proteomics, we wouldn’t necessarily expect a clear increase in total TBK1 in the proteomics, given how small the pool of pTBK1 is. We have demonstrated for mitophagy that less than 1% of TBK1 is phosphorylated at ~1h of depolarization, so we think it would be hard to visualize this by proteomics examining the total protein. This is why having the pTBK1 immunofluorescence data in the paper is so important. We hope that addresses the reviewer’s comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Is the Flow cytometry Keima-LGALS3 assay in Figure 8C similar when TAX1BP KO cells are used instead of triple KOs?

We performed the rescue experiment using the TKO background given the previous observation that physical interactions between cargo receptors (OPTN, CALCOCO2, and TAX1BP1) can occur under various conditions (both basally and under stimulation). As such, we felt that looking at these TAX1BP1 mutants without contributions of other interacting receptors would be the best way to look at the functions of the TAX1BP1 SKICH domain in isolation, for example.</p><p>In terms of the role of the SKICH domain in recruitment, we looked at the localization of the δ SKICH TAX1BP1 mutant and A114Q mutant and found that they both form punctate structures near or are in close proximity to damaged lysosomes. We have added the GFP-deltaSKICH and A114Q localization experiment to supplemental Figure S8. These results indicate that translocation per se of these mutants is not sufficient to explain their defect in lysophagic flux. Rather, the inability of this mutant to stimulate TBK1 activity and/or recruit the RB1CC1 complex at the lysosome likely explains the core defect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Authors suggest that lysosomes recover by fusion with healthy lysosomes.

We fully accept the point that we didn’t specifically follow up on the candidates that were generated in our lysophagy proteome landscape. We are hoping to prioritize these candidates with a subsequent CRISPR screen using our Lyso-Keima reagent. While some discussion of the potential novel candidates identified would be interesting, we feel that it would be premature to hypothesize their mechanism of action in the absence of any supporting data in the literature. However, we do agree that proteins with known roles in lysosomal/autophagy biology could be highlighted and discussed-we have tried to update our discussion to reflect these points. As to the point regarding the enrichment of known receptors in the datasets- it is well taken. We routinely do see some (CALCOCO2/SQSTM1) being significantly enriched in almost every proteome dataset, while others (TAX1BP1/OPTN) are usually enriched to a lower extent. This could be due to several reasons. (1) The stochastic nature of mass-spectrometry and also because peptides corresponding to some of these proteins (such as OPTN) may not fly well in the Mass-Spec. (2) Many selective autophagy receptors are being basally delivered to the lysosome for degradation therefore any “enrichment” at the lysosome might not be significant using our measurements. (3) The enrichment of specific receptors via mass spec in various forms of selective autophagy (for eg: mitophagy) does not always track with their relative importance in the pathway – SQSTM1 is always the most enriched protein in Mito preps but has no functional role in mitophagy. We think that more abundant Ub binding receptors may mask the effects of other similar proteins, but the results also emphasize the discordance between recruitment and functional importance, a point we now make in the discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
