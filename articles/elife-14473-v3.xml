alpha-dystroglycan, as mutations in the encoding genes cause congenital/limb-girdle muscular dystrophies. Here we elucidate further the structure of an <italic>O</italic>-mannose-initiated glycan on alpha-dystroglycan that is required to generate its extracellular matrix-binding polysaccharide. This functional glycan contains a novel ribitol structure that links a phosphotrisaccharide to xylose. ISPD is a CDP-ribitol (ribose) pyrophosphorylase that generates the reduced sugar nucleotide for the insertion of ribitol in a phosphodiester linkage to the glycoprotein. TMEM5 is a UDP-xylosyl transferase that elaborates the structure. We demonstrate in a zebrafish model as well as in a human patient that defects in TMEM5 result in muscular dystrophy in combination with abnormal brain development. Thus, we propose a novel structure—a ribitol in a phosphodiester linkage—for the moiety on which TMEM5, B4GAT1, and LARGE act to generate the functional receptor for ECM proteins having LG domains.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14473.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14473.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

proposed that alpha-dystroglycan (α-DG) played a major role in bridging the extracellular matrix to the muscle plasma membrane and actin cytoskeleton as a component of the multi-protein dystrophin glycoprotein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ervasti et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yoshida and Ozawa, 1990</xref>). Defects in the proper formation of this complex have been shown to be causal for various forms of muscular dystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carmignac and Durbeej, 2012</xref>). However, to date, only 3 patients have been found that have primary defects in the coding sequence of α-DG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hara et al., 2011</xref>). Over fifteen years ago, it was suggested that defects in the glycosyltransferases needed for proper glycosylation of α-DG were causal for a subset of muscular dystrophies, the so-called secondary dystroglycanopathies that can range in severity from mild Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy (LGMD) to severe Walker-Warburg syndrome (WWS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chiba et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Holt et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wells, 2013</xref>). In the early 2000’s, it became clear that the defects causal for disease involved enzymes that initiated and elaborated the extended <italic>O</italic>-mannose (<italic>O</italic>-Man) glycan structures covalently attached to Ser/Thr residues of α-DG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beltrán-Valero de Bernabé et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Michele et al., 2002</xref>). Since then, steady progress has been made in elucidating the subset of mammalian <italic>O</italic>-Man structures that directly interact with extracellular matrix components and the candidate genes necessary for the functional glycosylation of α-DG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Praissman and Wells, 2014</xref>). These include the identification of a subset of phosphorylated <italic>O</italic>-Man structures containing extended, LARGE-dependent, repeating disaccharide polymers, structures that have been recently termed matriglycan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yoshida-Moriguchi and Campbell, 2015</xref>).</p><p><italic>O</italic>-Mannosylation begins in the endoplasmic reticulum (recently reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dobson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Endo, 2015</xref>). The addition of <italic>O</italic>-Man in an alpha linkage to serine and threonine residues of a select set of mammalian glycoproteins is catalyzed by the POMT1/2 complex using dolichol-phosphomannose as the donor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beltrán-Valero de Bernabé et al., 2002</xref>). At this point, by mechanisms that have yet to be fully elucidated, there is a divergence in elaboration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The vast majority of <italic>O</italic>-Man sites are extended in the Golgi in a beta-1,2 linkage with N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) by POMGNT1 that can then be further branched by GlcNAc and/or elaborated by galactose, fucose, and sialic acid to generate the M1 and M2 glycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Praissman and Wells, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yoshida et al., 2001</xref>). A small subset of O-Man modified sites, apparently exclusively on α-DG, are extended in the endoplasmic reticulum by a GlcNAc in a beta-1,4 linkage by POMGNT2 to generate the M3 glycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Manzini et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yoshida-Moriguchi et al., 2013</xref>). This is further elaborated into a trisaccharide by the action of a beta-1,3-N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) transferase, B3GALNT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yoshida-Moriguchi et al., 2013</xref>). This trisaccharide is a substrate for POMK that phosphorylates the initiating <italic>O</italic>-Man residue at the 6-position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yoshida-Moriguchi et al., 2013</xref>). After unknown elaboration of the phosphotrisaccharide in a phosphodiester linkage, presumably by one or more of the as-yet to be assigned CMD-causing gene products (ISPD, TMEM5, Fukutin, and FKRP), B4GAT1 adds a glucuronic acid (GlcA) in a beta-1,4 linkage to an underlying beta-linked xylose (Xyl) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Praissman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Willer et al., 2014</xref>). The addition of the xylose by an unspecified enzyme followed by the action of B4GAT1 serves as a primer for LARGE to synthesize the repeating Xyl-GlcA disaccharide, matriglycan, that serves as the binding site for several extracellular matrix proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Praissman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Willer et al., 2014</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14473.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The 3 subclasses of the O-Mannosylation pathway.</title><p>Following addition of Man to serine/threonine residues on protein substrates by POMT1/2 there is a divergence in elaboration.

We also wanted to confirm the open ring structure enforced by the addition of ribitol, a reduced sugar. In such a linear structure, mild periodate treatment would be expected to cleave vicinal diols and release matriglycan from the polypeptide. Thus, we performed mild periodate cleavage of the purified α-DG-340 protein and demonstrated a loss of reactivity with the IIH6 antibody that recognizes functional LARGE-modified glycoprotein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Furthermore, following tryptic cleavage, we examined the resulting α-DG peptides by tandem mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We were able to identify multiple glycopeptides where Thr317 (a known site for M3 glycans) was modified to indicate a cleaved ribitol fragment on the phosphotrisaccharide. We observed pairs of essentially identical glycopeptides that showed cleavage between C2 and C3 or between C3 and C4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We also observed peptides with an additional phosphate suggesting that there can be 2 phosphates on the trisaccharide of which at least one is in a phosphodiester linkage to ribitol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Thus, the ribitol appears most likely to be connected at C1 to the oxygen of a phosphate group on the M3 glycopeptide and at the C5 to xylose (note that ribitol C1 and C5 are indistinguishable due to the nature of the reduced sugar and thus nomenclature for closed-ring standard sugar nucleotides is being used to describe linkage).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14473.008</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Mild periodate cleavage reveals that ribitol is connected to the M3 glycan.</title><p>Following treatment of purified α-DG-340 under mild periodate conditions, the protein was reduced, alkylated, and digested with trypsin.

Furthermore, we noticed the presence of a second phosphate on some phosphoglycopeptides. The 12 peptides observed are grouped by having the same number of additional Hex and HexNAc glycans (2,3 or 3,3 or 2,4).

Using ~69K SNPs that overlapped between the two platforms, homozygosity-by-descent (HBD) analysis was performed.

The first pregnancy (P1) went to term with the child passing away at 4 months of age. The second pregnancy was terminated at 18 weeks (P2); a quadriceps skeletal muscle sample utilized in our studies was obtained after termination. Severe dystrophic features were noted in cryosections of the muscle, and immunofluorescence studies showed an abnormal pattern of dystrophin-glycoprotein complex expression characteristic of a severe dystroglycanopathy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>Although patients with <italic>TMEM5</italic> mutations have been reported before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vuillaumier-Barrot et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jae et al., 2013</xref>) the α-DG glycosylation status in these patients has not been investigated. Immunofluorescence and western blot analysis of skeletal muscle from the 18 week fetus (P2) showed an α-DG glycosylation defect similar to previously described glycosylation-deficient WWS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Willer et al., 2012</xref>) with complete loss of both functional glycosylation and laminin binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>).

We previously identified the M3 phosphotrisaccharide glycan structure following aqueous HF treatment and assigned its sites of modification on the α-DG polypeptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yoshida-Moriguchi et al., 2010</xref>). In the present study we examined the structure of the glycan released from polypeptide upon HF cleavage of the phosphodiester linkage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). To simplify the analysis, the length of the LARGE-dependent repeat was reduced by overexpression of a small IIH6-reactive fragment of α-DG (28 amino acids) containing only one M3 site (TPT, 317–319) as a fusion protein in HEK293F cells, which express low levels of LARGE. Following HF release, we were able to identify pentitol-Xyl-GlcA by tandem mass spectrometry, as well as further extended versions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>We were somewhat surprised to find pentitol (a reduced sugar polyol) attached to the xylose. Assuming that this reduced sugar was likely transferred as an activated sugar nucleotide, we attempted to identify a mammalian CDP-ribitol pyrophosphorylase. ISPD was a reasonable candidate since, as a putative cytosolic nucleotidyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vuillaumier-Barrot et al., 2012</xref>), it is mutated in a subset of CMD and LGMD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Willer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cirak et al., 2013</xref>), and bacterial homologs participate in the synthesis of CDP activated alcohols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baur et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Richard et al., 2001</xref>). Purified recombinant enzyme was able to synthesize CDP-ribitol from ribitol-phosphate and CTP demonstrating that it is indeed a CDP-ribitol pyrophosphorylase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). During the preparation of our manuscript, a study was published demonstrating that CDP-ribose, CDP-ribitol, and CDP-ribulose could all be generated by mammalian ISPD consistent with our present results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Riemersma et al., 2015</xref>). These findings also lend themselves to considering the source of ribitol-P in mammals that likely is generated from ribose-5-phosphate, from the pentose phosphate pathway, by the action of aldose reductase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Perl et al., 2011</xref>). Alternatively, given that ISPD can act on ribitol-phosphate and ribose-phosphate, it is possible that the reduction occurs after the formation of the sugar nucleotide CDP-ribose to form CDP-ribitol. Further investigation of kinetic constants and cellular abundances need to be pursued to determine the order of events. Furthermore, no CDP-ribitol transporter into the secretory pathway has been identified yet. Given the facts that mutations in SLC35A1, a proposed CMP-sialic acid transporter, have been implicated in decreased functional glycosylation of α-DG that is independent from sialic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jae et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Riemersma et al., 2015</xref>) and that sugar nucleotide transporters often have higher selectivity for the nucleotide than the sugar, it is inviting to speculate that SLC35A1 is a CDP-ribitol transporter though this remains to be formally tested.</p><p>Given that ISPD could generate CDP-ribose and CDP-ribitol we wanted to confirm that it was ribitol and not ribose that was transferred into the functional <italic>O</italic>-Man glycan on α-DG. Further, we wanted complementary experimental evidence that would be consistent with the phosphodiester cleavage study that the ribitol was connected directly to the phosphotrisaccharide of α-DG. Both reduced and non-reduced glycans are susceptible to cleavage by mild periodate treatment between vicinal diols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Collins et al., 1997</xref>). If ribitol was indeed inserted between the phosphotrisaccharide and the priming xylose, one would expect loss of IIH6 reactivity from the α-DG-340 fusion protein as we observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Furthermore, mass spectrometry analysis of the resulting peptides revealed cleavage between carbons 2–3 and between 3–4 of the ribitol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We also observed phosphotrisaccharide glycopeptides with an additional phosphate moiety suggesting that the M3 trisaccharide can have 2 phosphates connected directly to it (one is at the 6-position of Man and the other we could not resolve). These data are highly suggestive that an M3 phosphate oxygen is connected to the C1 carbon while the xylose is connected to the C5 carbon of the ribitol (note that given the structure of ribitol, C1 and C5 are equivalent and thus we have chosen to use a numbering system that is most consistent with other sugar nucleotides) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>Based on our proposed structure, we also predicted a xylose transferase to further elongate the structure and serve as a substrate for B4GAT1 extension with GlcA as a primer for LARGE addition of matriglycan. Given that mutations in <italic>TMEM5</italic> have recently been described as being causal for CMD and that the putative enzyme shows sequence homology to glycosyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vuillaumier-Barrot et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jae et al., 2013</xref>), we explored the possibility that TMEM5 was a xylose transferase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We were able to confirm that recombinant TMEM5 was able to hydrolyze UDP-Xyl but not other UDP-sugars. We also observed that while ribitol and ribitol-5-P were not acceptors in vitro that CDP-ribitol was an acceptor for TMEM5 catalyzed transfer of Xyl from UDP-Xyl likely due to mimicking the phosphodiester linkage of the ribitol in the glycopeptide structure. Further, recombinant TMEM5 was able to transfer radiolabeled Xyl from UDP-Xyl to α-DG-Fc340 expressed in a CMD patient cell line with a homozygous mutation in <italic>TMEM5</italic> but was not able to effectively transfer to α-DG-340 when the putative M3 sites (TPT, 317–319, converted to APA) were eliminated. This data taken together strongly suggests that TMEM5 adds Xyl to ribitol when the ribitol is in a phosphodiester linkage. Given the scarcity of studies on TMEM5, we further characterized the functional relevance of TMEM5 in a zebrafish knockdown model and observed a severe CMD phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Further, we identified a novel p.G333R TMEM5 mutation in a consanguineous family with 2 children affected by WWS. We demonstrated that wildtype TMEM5 but not the p.G333R TMEM5 mutant construct could complement the mutation in the patient cell line with regards to functional α-DG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,C</xref>). Subcellular localization studies showed normal expression and localization of the mutant protein, suggesting that the p.G333R missense mutation in the predicted catalytic site likely interferes with enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Thus, we propose that TMEM5 modifies the ribitol in a phosodiester linkage with a xylose and B4GAT1 then extends the structure with a GlcA to serve as a primer for LARGE extension with the repeating Xyl-GlcA disaccharide, matriglycan.</p><p>In summary, it appears that synthesis of the functional glycan on α-DG requires nearly a dozen enzymes, many of which presumably are exclusively used on a select set of sites on α-DG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). While we have further elucidated a functional glycan structure required for interaction with extracellular matrix proteins, several questions remain. For instance, while we have postulated that FKRP and/or Fukutin are involved in the transfer of ribitol using CDP-ribitol as the donor, we have not formally tested this activity due primarily to technical difficulties with expressing these two proteins. Also, while we have confirmed that TMEM5 is a xylose transferase that can add to a ribitol that is in a phosphodiester linkage, we have not experimentally validated its transfer to a ribitol-phosphotrisaccharide modified peptide for the same reasons as above. Furthermore, the generation of the functional glycan in quantities necessary to assign anomeric configurations and confirm linkages in the structure is still required. During the revision of this manuscript, a manuscript was published that addresses many of our outstanding questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kanagawa et al., 2016</xref>). In particular, Toda and colleagues were able to establish that Fukutin acts to add a ribitol-P in a phosphodiester linkage to the GalNAc of the phosphotrisaccharide that is then extended with an additional ribitol-P by FKRP before elaboration with Xyl by an unknown enzyme (shown here to be TMEM5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kanagawa et al., 2016</xref>). All of our data presented here is completely consistent with the structure proposed by Toda and colleagues.</p><p>In future studies, we would like to determine if there are other sites of functional glycosylation beyond the 317/319 and 379/381 sites on α-DG that we have previously identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yoshida-Moriguchi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yoshida-Moriguchi et al., 2010</xref>). It is also puzzling that while many sites on α-DG and even on other proteins, such as cadherins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vester-Christensen et al., 2013</xref>), are <italic>O</italic>-Man modified, only a select few sites on α-DG appear to become modified with M3 glycans containing matriglycan for interaction with ECM proteins. The evolution of such a complex biosynthetic pathway for a few sites on a single protein is an enigma. Understanding this exclusivity as well as the role of M1 and M2 glycans in biology is a major future challenge. In closing, we have defined the role of additional enzymes in the <italic>O</italic>-Mannosylation pathway and further elucidated a functional glycan structure on α-DG for binding to ECM proteins that is lacking in many secondary and tertiary dystroglycanopathies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials</title><p>Chemical reagents were primarily purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) at reagent grade or better.

The HBD analysis simply searches for long stretches of homozygous calls within each individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2008</xref>). A conservative error rate of 1% was used to allow the algorithm to tolerate possible genotyping errors. Intervals over 10 cM with stretches of homozygous genotypes are indications that the individual is a descendent of a consanguineous marriage. To evaluate the sharing between the siblings, SNP positions where the genotypes were not only homozygous in each individual but also the same allele were noted as shared.</p></sec><sec id="s4-33"><title>Capture array design and targeted sequencing</title><p>Regions over 3 cM that were homozygous in each sample were identified and pairwise comparisons were performed to find subset of the regions where the two affected individuals, TR and 02243-a, were homozygous with the same allele and the unaffected individual, 02243-b, was heterozygous or homozygous with an alternate allele. All coding exon regions within those regions were retrieved using six different exon/gene prediction models (RefSeq (refGene), UCSC (knownGene), Vertebrate Genome Annotation genes (vegaGene), Ensembl genes (ensGene), consensus coding sequence (ccdsGene), and Mammalian Gene Collection genes (mgcGene). In total, 6647 coding exons plus the regions extending 10 bp on each side of each exon across 4 intervals were subject to capture probe design using Agilent eArray (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.agilent.com">www.agilent.com</ext-link>). Agilent custom CGH array platform was chosen, requiring the probes to have the melting temperature (Tm) around 80°C (default) with probe trimming allowed.

The reference genome downloaded from the GATK (The Genome Analysis Toolkit) resource bundle (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsa/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsa/wiki/index.php/Main_Page</ext-link>) in November, 2010 was indexed using novoindex (–k 14 –s 3). The output format was set to SAM and default options for alignment were applied except for the adaptor stripping option (-a) and base quality calibration option (-k). Using SAMtools (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://samtools.sourceforge.net/">http://samtools.sourceforge.net/</ext-link>) version 0.1.15, the SAM file of each sample was converted to BAM file and sorted, and potential PCR duplicates were removed (rmdup) using Picard (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://picard.sourceforge.net/">http://picard.sourceforge.net/</ext-link>). Local realignment was performed using GATK ‘IndelRealigner’ tool per sample. First, the ‘RealignerTargetCreator’ tool was used to determine the locations that are potentially in need of realignment. The post-rmdup bam file and the known SNP positions (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) in dbSNP132 were included as inputs and ‘--mismatchFraction 0.10’ and ‘--realignReadsWithBadMates’ options were used. Using the intervals created, reads were realigned and the mates were fixed using Picard’s ‘FixMateInformation’ tool. Base qualities were recalibrated using GATK ‘TableRecalibration’ tool by analyzing the covariates for the reported base quality score of a base (QualityScoreCovariate), the combination of a base and the previous base (DinucCovariate) and the machine cycle for a base (CycleCovariate).</p></sec><sec id="s4-35"><title>Variant calling</title><p>Variants were called using GATK ‘Unified Genotyper’ tool simultaneously for all 8 samples. Small indels were called with the ‘-glm DINDEL’ option. The dbSNP132 file downloaded from the GATK resource bundle was used so that the known SNP positions are annotated in the output VCF (variant call format) file. Variants with phred-scale Qscore of 50.0 or greater were reported as ‘PASS’-ed calls and those with Qscore of 10.0 or greater and less than 50.0 were reported as ‘Low Qual’ calls. Variants with Qscore less than 10.0 were not reported. Only the variants found within the protein coding regions of the captured exons were reported by using the –L option. The interval file used is available as Source code. Using GATK ‘VariantFiltrationWalker’ tool, both the SNPs and INDELs were hard-filtered to filter out low quality variants. The following parameters were used as suggested by GATK as standard filtration: 1) clusterWindowSize 10; 2) MAPQ0 (mapping quality of zero) &gt;40; 3) QD (Quality-by-depth) &lt; 5.0; 4) SB (Strand Bias) &gt; -0.10.</p></sec><sec id="s4-36"><title>Variant annotation</title><p>The ‘PASS’-ed variants that are not found at dbSNP132 positions were annotated using SeattleSeqAnnotation version 6.16 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://snp.gs.washington.edu/SeattleSeqAnnotation131/">http://snp.gs.washington.edu/SeattleSeqAnnotation131/</ext-link>), separately for SNPs and INDELs. Both NCBI full genes and CCDS 2010 gene models were used for the annotation. For variants with multiple annotations, if the ‘functionGVS’ (Genome Variation Server class of function) was different while the ‘genelist’ value was same, the one with protein level change was retained. Variants present in the 1000 Genomes database (March 2010 release) or dbSNP131 as well as those resulting in coding-synonymous changes or found outside the coding region were removed from further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-37"><title>Sanger sequencing</title><p>Genomic DNA was extracted from dermal fibroblast cell lines using a Qiagen (Hilden, Germany) DNeasy Blood &amp; Tissue Kit.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Ivan Dikic as Senior editor and three reviewers, one of whom, Amy Wagers, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript describes new insights into a glycan on α-dystroglycan (α-DG) required for the binding of ECM ligands like laminin. Previous work from the Campbell and Wells labs has reported structural characterization of the O-mannose glycans on the mucin domain of α-DG, and the glycan generated by LARGE, termed matriglycan. The experiments described here propose that ribitol-Xyl-GlcA is the link from the phosphate on O-Mannose to matriglycan. The authors also propose that two genes implicated in CMDs, ISPD and TMEM5, encode a CDP-ribitol pyrophosphorylase and a xylosyltransferase, respectively. They also identify a new mutation in TMEM5 that may be the basis of WWS in a consanguineous family. The work has many strengths, including a comprehensive approach that combines biochemical and structural evaluations, use of in vivo vertebrate (zebrafish) models, and genetic characterization and phenotypic rescue studies in human WWS patients and patient-derived cells, and overall, represents an extremely high quality contribution to our understanding of the assembly of the glycans that modify α-dystroglycan, and how these enable binding of α-dystroglycan to ECM proteins. However, there are also a number of 'loose ends', some of which are outlined at the end of the Discussion. Unfortunately, these preclude many of the definitive statements made throughout the manuscript. These issues should be addressed through the essential revisions outlined below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> show MS and MS/MS spectra that are annotated with glycans for which there is no evidence except m/z. The linkages must be removed from the proposed structures. Are any other sugar combinations consistent with the data? If so, they should be presented. Since no data in the manuscript addresses linkage, linkages in the proposed structure should be removed from every figure.</p><p>2) TMEM5 hydrolyzes UDP-Xyl but not UDP-GlcNAc or UDP-GlcA. However, UDP-GalNAc, UDP-Gal and UDP-Glc should also be tested since conclusions re structures were made solely from m/z.</p><p>3) The authors show that purified hTMEM5 transfers label from UDP-<sup>14</sup>C-Xyl to α-DG but not to α-DG APA from patient's cells lacking TMEM5. However, no product characterization was performed. This is important because very small numbers of DPM were obtained and the <sup>14</sup>C-Xyl could have been transferred to something other than ribitol on the secreted α-DG substrate. The authors should treat the product with periodate and show that <sup>14</sup>C-Xyl is released. They should also show that if unlabeled Xyl is transferred from UDP-Xyl, it precludes the subsequent addition of <sup>14</sup>C-Xyl from UDP-<sup>14</sup>C-Xyl. Finally, they should show that mutant <italic>TMEM5</italic> G333R has reduced UDP-Xyl transferase activity. Transferase activity should be given as specific activity, and the assay more completely described in Methods, so it could be reproduced.</p><p>4) The fact that TMEM5 corrects patient cells with a TMEM5 mutation does not in itself prove that TMEM5 is the complementing gene. The authors have previously shown that overexpression of LARGE complements several different non-LARGE genes that cause CMD. <italic>TMEM5</italic> G333R should be compared to wild type in the complementation assay. This is an easy experiment because the authors have done this for the WT TMEM5, and makes one wonder why it was not done with the <italic>TMEM5</italic> G333R mutant.</p><p>5) The authors show that purified ISPD can form CDP-ribose or CDP-ribitol from CTP and ribose-P or ribitol-P. They note in the Discussion that these results were published in 2015 by another group. They should mention the published results up front in the Results section and clarify that the relationship of their approaches to this other report, including those that confirm the prior study.</p><p>6) Several abbreviations are used in the Abstract without definition (ISPD, B4GAT, LARGE, ECM). A non-expert reader likely will not understand much of this abstract, and may decide to not to read the paper (which would be too bad, since the paper is outstanding). As much as possible, these abbreviations should be defined and/or eliminated in favor of using the full word(s).</p><p>7) Throughout the manuscript, the authors need to base their conclusions and their statements firmly on their empirical data. The present text should be extensively revised to eliminate overstatements and definitive conclusions. The authors have obtained nice data that in sum are consistent with their proposed structure, but they have presented the data in many places as definitive, and even included linkages for which no data are provided. The text should make the tentative nature of their conclusions abundantly clear. Final proof will only come when the transfer of ribitol, xylose, GlcA and matriglycan can be demonstrated in vitro, using purified enzymes, and fully characterized substrates and products. Until then, statements such as &quot;Here we elucidate the structure&quot; in the Abstract and &quot;Here we define a fully functional glycan structure&quot; are unacceptable. There remain many possibilities for the roles of FKTN and FKRP as well as other mysteries to explain, including why MEB disease arises from mutation of POMGNT1, which is apparently not part of the M3 core glycan.</p><p>8) The authors should be sure to report numbers of experimental replicates and n values for <italic>all</italic> of their figures; some (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>) show single examples, and so it is important to indicate how many times such outcomes were observed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14473.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Essential revisions:</p><p><italic>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> show MS and MS/MS spectra that are annotated with glycans for which there is no evidence except m/z.

We have included these results in the updated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>.</p><p><italic>3) The authors show that purified hTMEM5 transfers label from UDP-<sup>14</sup>C-Xyl to α-DG but not to α-DG APA from patient's cells lacking TMEM5. However, no product characterization was performed. This is important because very small numbers of DPM were obtained and the <sup>14</sup>C-Xyl could have been transferred to something other than ribitol on the secreted α-DG substrate. The authors should treat the product with periodate and show that <sup>14</sup>C-Xyl is released. They should also show that if unlabeled Xyl is transferred from UDP-Xyl, it precludes the subsequent addition of <sup>14</sup>C-Xyl from UDP-<sup>14</sup>C-Xyl. Finally, they should show that mutant TMEM5 G333R has reduced UDP-Xyl transferase activity. Transferase activity should be given as specific activity, and the assay more completely described in the Methods, so it could be reproduced.</italic> </p><p>While we did not pursue characterization of the radiolabeled product, we did expand upon our work in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> to include transfer of Xyl from UDP-Xyl as a purified enzyme. We were able to show that TMEM5 does not transfer efficiently in vitro to ribitol or ribitol-5-P but does transfer to CDP-ribitol suggesting that the phosphate of the acceptor likely needs to be a phosphodiester linkage. We also address the mutant in new complementation data discussed in point #4 below.</p><p><italic>4) The fact that TMEM5 corrects patient cells with a TMEM5 mutation does not in itself prove that TMEM5 is the complementing gene. The authors have previously shown that overexpression of LARGE complements several different non-LARGE genes that cause CMD. TMEM5 G333R should be compared to wild type in the complementation assay. This is an easy experiment because the authors have done this for the WT TMEM5, and makes one wonder why it was not done with the TMEM5 G333R mutant.</italic> </p><p>We have performed complementation assays in patient fibroblasts with WT TMEM5 and demonstrated that <italic>TMEM5</italic>-G333R is not able to complement (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p><p><italic>5) The authors show that purified ISPD can form CDP-ribose or CDP-ribitol from CTP and ribose-P or ribitol-P. They note in the Discussion that these results were published in 2015 by another group. They should mention the published results up front in the Results section and clarify that the relationship of their approaches to this other report, including those that confirm the prior study.</italic></p><p>In addition to the Discussion we now cite the manuscript in the Results section as well and clarify that both their and our data are in complete agreement.</p><p><italic>6) Several abbreviations are used in the Abstract without definition (ISPD, B4GAT, LARGE, ECM. A non-expert reader likely will not understand much of this abstract, and may decide to not to read the paper (which would be too bad, since the paper is outstanding). As much as possible, these abbreviations should be defined and/or eliminated in favor of using the full word(s).</italic></p><p>We have attempted to improve this while staying within the word limit confines.</p><p><italic>7) Throughout the manuscript, the authors need to base their conclusions and their statements firmly on their empirical data. The present text should be extensively revised to eliminate overstatements and definitive conclusions. The authors have obtained nice data that in sum are consistent with their proposed structure, but they have presented the data in many places as definitive, and even included linkages for which no data are provided. The text should make the tentative nature of their conclusions abundantly clear. Final proof will only come when the transfer of ribitol, xylose, GlcA and matriglycan can be demonstrated in vitro, using purified enzymes, and fully characterized substrates and products. Until then, statements such as &quot;Here we elucidate the structure&quot; in the Abstract and &quot;Here we define a fully functional glycan structure&quot; are unacceptable. There remain many possibilities for the roles of FKTN and FKRP as well as other mysteries to explain, including why MEB disease arises from mutation of POMGNT1, which is apparently not part of the M3 core glycan.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this important point and have significantly altered the text and figures to reflect the findings of our empirical data. Further, careful analysis of our data has revealed that HF can generate glycopeptides with 2 phosphates and thus we have not assigned the position of the ribitol-Xyl-GlcA-(Xyl-GlcA)<sub>n</sub> to the phosphotrisaccharide though the recent publication by Toda and colleagues puts the structure in a phosphodiester linkage to the GalNAc residue.</p><p><italic>8) The authors should be sure to report numbers of experimental replicates and n values for all of their figures; some (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>) show single examples, and so it is important to indicate how many times such outcomes were observed.</italic></p><p>We have added n values and defined error bars where appropriate.</p></body></sub-article></article>
