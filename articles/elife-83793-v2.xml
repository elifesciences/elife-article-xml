adhesion and migration, as well as failure to undergo epidermal to mesenchymal transition. However, the primary molecular role of kazrin, which might contribute to all these functions, has not been elucidated yet. We previously identified one of its isoforms, kazrin C, as a protein that potently inhibits clathrin-mediated endocytosis when overexpressed. We now generated kazrin knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts to investigate its endocytic function. We found that kazrin depletion delays juxtanuclear enrichment of internalized material, indicating a role in endocytic traffic from early to recycling endosomes. Consistently, we found that the C-terminal domain of kazrin C, predicted to be an intrinsically disordered region, directly interacts with several early endosome (EE) components, and that kazrin depletion impairs retrograde motility of these organelles. Further, we noticed that the N-terminus of kazrin C shares homology with dynein/dynactin adaptors and that it directly interacts with the dynactin complex and the dynein light intermediate chain 1. Altogether, the data indicate that one of the primary kazrin functions is to facilitate endocytic recycling by promoting dynein/dynactin-dependent transport of EEs or EE-derived transport intermediates to the recycling endosomes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>endosome</kwd><kwd>dynein/dynactin</kwd><kwd>mouse embryonic fibroblast</kwd><kwd>kazrin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011033</institution-id><institution>Agencia Estatal de Investigación</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BFU2017-82959-P</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Geli</surname><given-names>María Isabel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011033</institution-id><institution>Agencia Estatal de Investigación</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PID2020-120053GB-I00</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Geli</surname><given-names>María Isabel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014440</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EQC2018-004541 EU FeDer</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rebollo</surname><given-names>Elena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003339</institution-id><institution>Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CSIC1501/18</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rebollo</surname><given-names>Elena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014440</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BES-2015-071691 BES-2012-053341</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hernandez-Perez</surname><given-names>Ines</given-names></name><name><surname>Baumann</surname><given-names>Adrian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Kazrin, a protein widely expressed in vertebrates whose depletion causes defects in cell adhesion and migration, is recruited to early endosomes and promotes dynein/dynactin-dependent traffic of endocytosed cargo to the recycling endosomes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Kazrin is a highly conserved and broadly expressed vertebrate protein, which was first identified as a transcript present in the human brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nagase et al., 1999</xref>). The human kazrin gene is located on chromosome 1 (1p36.21) and encodes at least seven isoforms (A-F and K), generated by alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Groot et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nachat et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). From those, kazrin C is the shorter isoform that constitutes the core of all other versions, which bear N or C-terminal extensions. Since its discovery, several laboratories have reported a broad range of roles for the different kazrin isoforms in a myriad of experimental model systems. Thus, in humans, kazrin participates in structuring the skin-cornified envelope and it promotes keratinocyte terminal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Groot et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sevilla et al., 2008a</xref>). In U373MG human astrocytoma cells, kazrin depletion leads to caspase activation and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). In <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos instead, kazrin depletion causes ectoderm blisters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sevilla et al., 2008b</xref>), as well as craniofacial development defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cho et al., 2011</xref>), linked to altered cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sevilla et al., 2008b</xref>), impaired epidermal to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and defective migration of neural crest cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cho et al., 2011</xref>). The subcellular localization of kazrin recapitulates its functional diversity. Depending on the isoform and cell type under analysis, kazrin associates with desmosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Groot et al., 2004</xref>), <italic>adherens</italic> junction components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cho et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sevilla et al., 2008a</xref>), the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Groot et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sevilla et al., 2008a</xref>), or the microtubule cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nachat et al., 2009</xref>). At the molecular level, the N-terminus of kazrin, predicted to form a coiled-coil, directly interacts with several p120-catenin family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sevilla et al., 2008b</xref>), as well as with the desmosomal component periplakin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Groot et al., 2004</xref>), and it directly or indirectly regulates RhoA activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Groot et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sevilla et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cho et al., 2010</xref>). How kazrin orchestrates such many cellular functions at the molecular level is far from being understood.</p><p>We previously identified human kazrin C as a protein that potently inhibits clathrin-mediated endocytosis when overexpressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schmelzl and Geli, 2002</xref>). In the present work, we generated kazrin knock out (kazKO) Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs) to analyze its role in endocytic traffic in detail. We found that depletion of kazrin caused accumulation of peripheral EEs and delayed transfer of endocytosed transferrin (Tfn) to the pericentriolar juxtanuclear region, where the recycling endosomes (REs) usually concentrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Granger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tang and Marshall, 2012</xref>). Consequently, cellular functions requiring intact endosomal traffic through the REs, such as cell migration and cytokinetic abscission, were also altered in kazKO cells. Consistent with its role in endocytic traffic, we found that the kazrin C C-terminal portion predicted to be an intrinsically disordered region (IDR), interacted with different components of the EEs, it was required to form <italic>foci</italic> on these organelles and it was necessary to sustain efficient transport of internalized Tfn to the juxtanuclear region. Further, the N-terminus of kazrin C shared considerable homology with dynein/dynactin activating adaptors, and kazrin directly interacted with the dynactin complex and the dynein light intermediate 1 (LIC1). The data thus suggested that kazrin facilitates the transfer of endocytosed material to the pericentriolar REs by promoting retrograde dynein/dynactin-dependent transport of EEs or EE-derived transport intermediates.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Kazrin depletion impairs endosomal traffic</title><p>We originally identified kazrin C as a human brain cDNA, whose overexpression causes accumulation of the transferrin receptor (TfnR) at the plasma membrane (PM) in Cos7 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schmelzl and Geli, 2002</xref>), suggesting that kazrin might be involved in clathrin-mediated endocytic uptake from the PM. However, treatment of Cos7 cells with an shRNA directed against kazrin (sh<italic>Kzrn</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) did not inhibit endocytic internalization but it rather increased the intracellular signal of Alexa 647-Tfn (A647-Tfn) upon a 2 hr incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>), indicating that depletion of kazrin either exacerbated endocytic uptake or inhibited endocytic recycling. The distribution of A647-Tfn labeled endosomes was also altered in the sh<italic>Kzrn</italic> treated cells, as compared with that of untreated cells or cells transfected with a control shRNA (shCTR). In wild-type (WT) and shCTR-treated cells, A647-Tfn accumulated in the juxtanuclear region, where the RE is usually located (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Granger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sheff et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Shen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tang and Marshall, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Yamashiro et al., 1984</xref>). In contrast, TxR-Tfn labeled endosomes appeared more scattered toward the cell periphery in sh<italic>Kzrn</italic> treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). The accumulation of endocytosed material at the periphery suggested that kazrin plays a post-internalization role in the endocytic pathway, possibly in the transport of material toward the juxtanuclear RE.</p><p>shRNA transfection in Cos7 cells did not achieve complete kazrin depletion in a reproducible manner and it hampered complementation. To overcome these problems, we generated kazrin knockout MEFs (kazKO MEFs) using the CRISPR-Cas9 technology and we used a lentiviral system to subsequently create two cell lines that expressed GFP or GFP-kazrin C upon doxycycline induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that the expression level of GFP-kazrin C in the absence of doxycycline or upon a short overnight (up to 12 hr) incubation was similar to that of the endogenous kazrin (low expression, 1–4 times the endogenous kazrin expression level) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Under these conditions, the GFP-kazrin C was barely detectable by fluorescence microscopy. This might explain why none of the commercially available or home-made anti-kazrin antibodies detected a specific signal in WT MEFs. Doxycycline incubation for longer periods (up to 24 hr induction) resulted in moderate expression (4–8 times the endogenous kazrin expression levels) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>), but allowed us to clearly visualize its localization by microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p><p>To better discern on the possible effects of kazrin depletion on endocytic uptake or in subsequent trafficking events, WT and kazKO cells were exposed to a short, 10 min incubation pulse with Texas Red-Tfn (TxR-Tfn), fixed, and analyzed. In WT cells, TxRed-Tfn accumulated in a pericentriolar region adjacent to the nucleus, similar to Cos7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). No differences in the amount of internalized TxR-Tfn were observed between WT and kazKO MEF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), suggesting that kazrin did not play a relevant role in the formation of endocytic vesicles from the PM, but it might rather work downstream in the pathway. In agreement with this view, and similar to the sh<italic>Kzrn</italic> Cos7, kazKO MEFs accumulated TxR-Tfn in the cell periphery, as compared with WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Juxtanuclear accumulation of TxR-Tfn was restored in kazKO MEF by low, physiological expression of GFP-kazrin C but not GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>), indicating a direct role of kazrin in the process. No significant difference between the kazKO and the kazKO GFP-expressing cells could be detected in these experiments. Therefore, in order to simplify the experimental design, further assays were normalized to the closest isogenic kazKO background, namely the kazKO cells when compared to the WT, and the kazKO GFP expressing cells when compared to kazKO MEF expressing GFP-kazrin C.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Kazrin depletion impairs endosomal traffic.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Confocal images of wild-type (WT) and kazKO MEF or kazKO MEF expressing low levels (See Materials and methods (M &amp; M)) of GFP or GFP-kazrin C, incubated with Texas Red-Tfn (TxR-Tfn) at 16 °C and chased at 37 °C for 10 min.

The gRNA was designed to recognize a sequence at the beginning of exon 2 of the mouse Kazn gene, after the initiation codon of kazrin C, and followed by a PAM site. The Cas9 nuclease gene was transfected in a plasmid into the cells, together with the gRNA. Cas9 cleavage often leads to a frameshift mutation that impedes the expression of the gene. The plasmid encoding the gRNA and the Cas9 also encodes GFP, which allows sorting and isolation of transfected cells by FACS. The resulting clones were analyzed by immunoblot, and those with no kazrin expression were selected. One of them was used as the base for another three cell lines in which genes encoding GFP or GFP-kazrin C were inserted in the genome. The inserted constructs were preceded by a tetracycline-response element. This was achieved by lentiviral transduction and selection by FACS. Thus, none of these cell lines have endogenous kazrin expression but express GFP or GFP-kazrin C upon doxycycline addition.

We observed that kazKO MEFs accumulated peripheral, often enlarged, EEA1 positive structures, as compared with WT MEF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). The juxtanuclear distribution of the REs, was however not significantly affected in the knock-out cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). Again, low expression of GFP-kazrin C but not GFP recovered the EEA1 juxtanuclear distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). The data thus suggested that kazrin promotes the transfer of endocytosed material toward the juxtanuclear region, where the RE is located.</p><p>Consistent with the role of kazrin in endocytic traffic towards the RE, recycling of TxR-Tfn back to the PM was diminished in kazKO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), albeit not completely blocked. A complete block in recycling was not to be expected because, in addition to the RAB11 route, the TfnR can take a RAB4-dependent shortcut to the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sheff et al., 2002</xref>).

Interestingly, pericentriolar localization of GFP-kazrin C was reminiscent of that observed for well-established or candidate dynein/dynactin activating adaptors such as hook2, hook3, or BICDR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baron and Salisbury, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schlager et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Szebenyi et al., 2007</xref>). Indeed, kazrin C shared 23.3% identity and 57.3% similarity with BICDR1 (BICauDal Related protein 1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), over 232 amino acids, and 19.6% identity and 61.3% similarity with hook3, over 168 amino acids. Such similarity was in the range of that shared between hook3 and BICDR1 (24.7% identity and 56.7% similarity over 268 amino acids) (LALIGN). Therefore, we hypothesized that kazrin might also interact with the dynein/dynactin complex and serve as a candidate dynein/dynactin endosomal adaptor. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that moderately expressed GFP-kazrin C pulled-down the dynactin component p150-glued from cell extracts as well as the dynein heavy chain, whereas GFP alone did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Similar to what has been described for other <italic>bona fide</italic> or candidate dynein/dynactin adaptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Celestino et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fenton et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kendrick et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schlager et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Splinter et al., 2010</xref>), we also detected co-immunoprecipitation of GFP-kazrin C with plus-end directed motors, specifically, with kinesin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>), a motor associated with EEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Loubéry et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Schmidt et al., 2009</xref>). We observed no co-immunoprecipitation with tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>), indicating that GFP-kazrin C interactions with dynactin, dynein, and kinesin-1 were not indirectly mediated by microtubules. Pull-down experiments with GST-kazrin C, expressed and purified from <italic>E. coli,</italic> and the dynactin complex, purified from pig (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jha et al., 2017</xref>), demonstrated that the interaction was direct and that it was contributed by both, the N- and C-terminal halves of kazrin C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>), suggesting multiple contacts with different dynactin components. As also described for other dynein/dynactin adaptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gonçalves et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Horgan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Redwine et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Schroeder and Vale, 2016</xref>), pull-down experiments with purified components showed a specific interaction of kazrin C with one of the dynein LIC, in particular LIC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). Finally, immunoprecipitation experiments from MEFs using the polyclonal antibody against the C-terminus of kazrin C also suggested binding of endogenous kazrin with the dynactin complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>).</p><p>To test if GFP-kazrin C might be able to convey cargo other than endosomes to the pericentriolar region, we constructed a chimera bearing the mitochondrial targeting domain (MTD) of a testis-specific <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> centrosomin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2017</xref>) (GFP-kazrin C-MTD), that lacks the centrosome targeting sequences but still bears the CM1 gamma-tubulin nucleating domain present in all centrosomin variants.

To test this hypothesis, we applied high-speed live-cell fluorescence imaging to visualize the movement of TxR-Tfn<bold>-</bold>loaded EEs in WT and kazKO cells. As previously described, EEs in WT cells were highly motile exhibiting long-range trajectories of several micrometers, followed by more confined movements within a 1 µm radius (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Driskell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Flores-Rodriguez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Loubéry et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nielsen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rogers et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zajac et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">Video 8</xref> (WT) and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video9">Video 9</xref>). Time projections of Z-stacks of 90 s Videos evidenced the linear endosomal trajectories in WT cells, with an average length of about 5 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">Video 8</xref> (WT) and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video9">Video 9</xref>). However, in kazKO MEFs, the kymographs showed a profusion of bright dots as compared to the straight trajectories in the WT, and the length of the straight trajectories (longer than 1 µm) was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">Videos 8</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video10">10</xref>). These observations suggested that the absence of kazrin reduced the association of EEs with some microtubule-dependent motors and/or diminished their processivity or velocity.

We showed that the predicted IDR of kazrin directly interacted with several EE components implicated in endocytic traffic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caplan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">George et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grant et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grant and Caplan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jović et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Naslavsky et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Perrin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rapaport et al., 2006</xref>) and that depletion of kazrin caused a delay in the transport of endocytosed Tfn to the juxtanuclear region, as well as the scattering of EEs but not REs to the cell periphery. These phenotypes recapitulate those observed when depleting other proteins involved in EE to RE transport such as EHD3, or upon inhibition of dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burkhardt et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Driskell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Naslavsky et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nielsen et al., 1999</xref>). We also showed that kazrin shared considerable homology with dynein/dynactin adaptors and that depletion or deletion of its IDR impairs the movement of Tfn-loaded endosomes toward the juxtanuclear region.</p><p>While the vesicular nature of membrane traffic from the PM to the EEs has been well characterized, the principles governing the transport of membranes and cargo within the endosomal system are much less understood. The more accepted view is that the core of the EEs, receiving the internalized material, undergoes a maturation process that leads to its conversion to LEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Huotari and Helenius, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Podinovskaia and Spang, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wang et al., 2019</xref>), while retrograde traffic is driven by tubular transport intermediates, generated by sortinexins (SNX) or clathrin-coated vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Briant et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">McNally and Cullen, 2018</xref>). In addition, retrograde transport of EEs to the pericentriolar region has been proposed to facilitate fusion with or maturation to REs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Naslavsky and Caplan, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Solinger et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Within this wide range of endosomal trafficking events, microtubules seem to play key roles. EEs move along microtubule tracks with a bias toward the cell center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Driskell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Flores-Rodriguez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nielsen et al., 1999</xref>). Retrograde movement is mainly effected by the dynein/dynactin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Driskell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nielsen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zajac et al., 2013</xref>). Treatment of cells with nocodazol, or interfering with dynein, results in the inhibition of endosome motility, the scattering of EEs to the cell periphery, and impaired endosomal maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Driskell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Flores-Rodriguez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lam et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Palmer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Valetti et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zajac et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, plus and minus-end directed microtubule-dependent-motors have both a role in maintaining the endosomal subdomain organization and in the formation and motility of SNX-dependent tubular structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hunt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Soppina et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Traer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wassmer et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, the motility of different SNX tubules or endosomal subdomains is associated with distinct dynein complexes bearing either the LIC1 or LIC2 chains and particular kinesin types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hunt et al., 2013</xref>). In this context, the interactome of kazrin C suggests that it might work as a LIC1-dynein and kinesin-1 candidate adaptor for EHD and/or AP-1/clathrin transport intermediates emanating from EEs, in transit to the RE. Hook proteins, as components of FHF (Fused Toes-Hook-Fused toes and Hook Interacting Protein) complexes, also work as EEs dynein/dynactin adaptors in yeast, fruit flies, and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bielska et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Christensen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Krämer and Phistry, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Olenick et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Villari et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Yao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). However, the interactome of the mammalian hook1 and hook3 and the endocytic pathways affected by interfering with their function differ from those of kazrin and suggest that hook proteins promote motility of EEs subdomains in transit to late endosomes (LEs) rather than to REs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Christensen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Guo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Maldonado-Báez and Donaldson, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Olenick et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Xu et al., 2008</xref>). Likewise, the phenotypes installed by depletion of FIP3-RAB11, another dynein/dynactin adaptor connecting early and recycling endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Horgan et al., 2010</xref>), do not really mimic those observed upon kazrin C deletion. The observations that FIP3-RAB11 mainly co-localizes with RE rather than EEs markers and that its depletion disperses the RAB11 compartments rather than the EEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hales et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Horgan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Horgan et al., 2004</xref>), as opposed to kazrin depletion, suggest that FIP3-RAB11 plays a role downstream of kazrin. FIB3-RAB11 might either recieve EE/RE transport intermediates that have already acquired RAB11, or it could position the RE compartment at the pericentriolar region, which might be key for the docking and fusion of incoming transport intermediates.</p><p>How kazrin C promotes EEs retrograde motility at the molecular level is still an open question. Its homology to <italic>bona fide</italic> activating adaptors, its domain organization, and its interactome suggests that it might actually work by stabilizing the dynein/dynactin complex and by linking it to EEs, either alone or in concert with other cellular components. However, kazrin might as well work by promoting the kinesin-1-dependent transport of dynactin and/or dynein to the cell surface, which in turn is required for retrograde EE motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abenza et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lenz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Zekert and Fischer, 2009</xref>).</p><p>The role of kazrin in endocytic recycling might explain some of the pleiotropic effects observed in vertebrate development upon its depletion.

Indeed, depletion of kazrin in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> leads to decreased levels of E-cadherin, which can be reverted by inhibiting endocytic uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cho et al., 2010</xref>). This observation is consistent with the role of kazrin diverting traffic of internalized E-cadherin away from the lysosomal compartment and back to the PM. Likewise, eye and craniofacial defects associated with reduced EMT and neural crest cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cho et al., 2011</xref>), might originate from altered endocytic trafficking of integrins, cadherins, and/or signaling receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cadwell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jones et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wilson et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>It is worth noticing that kazrin is only expressed in vertebrates, whose evolution is linked to an explosion in the number of cadherin genes and the appearance of desmosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Green et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gul et al., 2017</xref>). In this context, it is tempting to speculate that while the core machinery involved in membrane traffic is largely conserved from yeast to humans, vertebrates might have had the need to develop specialized trafficking machinery to spatiotemporally regulate the function of particular adhesion complexes. Therefore, kazrin might turn out to be a valid therapeutic target to selectively modulate the function of those adhesion complexes in the context of a myriad of human pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kaszak et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Yuan and Arikkath, 2017</xref>). Identification of the relevant endocytic cargo traveling in a kazrin-dependent manner will be the next step to further understand the molecular, cellular, and developmental functions of kazrin.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>DNA techniques and plasmid construction</title><p>Oligonucleotides used for plasmids construction and information about the construction strategies are available upon request.

from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.dsmz.de/dsmz">https://www.dsmz.de/dsmz</ext-link>) (ACC-60). It is a cell line with fibroblast features derived from CV-1, a simian (Cercopithecus aethiops) cell line, by transformation with an origin-defective mutant of SV-40; cells were described in the literature to support the growth of SV-40 viruses; classified as risk category 1 according to the German Central Commission for Biological Safety (ZKBS). Mice embryonic fibroblast (MEF) was provided by S. Offermanns, (University of Heidelberg, Germany) and derived from C57BL/6 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Offermanns et al., 1997</xref>). mIMCD3 were kindly provided by F. García-Belmonte from the Centro de Biología Molecular Severo Ochoa (Spain) and they were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection ATCC (CRL-2123). mIMCD-3 is an inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) cell line derived by Michael Rauchman from a mouse transgenic for the early region of SV40 [Tg(SV40E)bri/7]. It has epithelial morphology. MEF and Cos7 cells were grown in DMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 21969035) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 µ/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mM L-glutamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 25030081) in a humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere at 37 °C. mIMCD3 were grown in DMEM/F-12 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 21331020) with 10% FBS. Cos7 were transiently transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 11668027). Cells were analyzed 24 hr after transfection. For shRNA kazrin depletion, pKLO.1_sh<italic>Kzrn</italic> from Merck Mission Library 2007 (Clone ID TRCN000018283) was used. pLKO.1_CV/_SCR (SHC002) was used as a control. For lentivirus production and Cos7 cell transfection, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with either the pLL3.7 encoding GFP, for virus production control and infection efficiency monitoring, or with pLKO.1 encoding the desired shRNA, and the viral packaging (pCMV-dR8.2 dvpr) and envelope (pCMV-VSV-G) plasmids, using calcium phosphate transfection. About 16 hr after transfection, the medium was changed and half of the usual volume was added. During the two following days, the medium containing the virus was collected and filtered with a 0.45 μm filter. The filtered virus solution was directly used for the infection of cell lines or stored in aliquots at –80 °C without prior concentration of the virus. Infection and selection of stably infected cells were done in the presence of the appropriate concentration of puromycin, titrated by using the minimum antibiotic concentration sufficient to kill untransfected cells, but to maintain cells transfected with the pLL3.7 GFP-containing plasmid. Actual depletion of kazrin or the protein of interest was analyzed by immunoblot using home-made polyclonal rabbit antibodies raised against the N- (amino acids 1–176) and C- terminal (amino acids 161–327) portions of kazrin C.</p><p>MEF and mIMCD3 KO cells were produced with the CRISPR-Cas9 system.

Guide RNA oligonucleotides were annealed and inserted into a pSpCas9(BB)–2A-GFP pX458 vector. MEFs were electroporated with Nucleofector (Lonza), following the manufacturer’s instructions. GFP-positive cells were sorted by FACS in an Aria FUSION (Becton Dickinson) sorter and screened by immunoblotting with antibodies against the N-terminal and the C-terminal portions of kazrin. Lentiviral particles were produced in HEK 293T cells. Calcium phosphate-mediated transfection was used to deliver vector pINDUCER20 encoding GFP or GFP-tagged kazrin constructs, together with packaging and envelope lentiviral vectors. The supernatant of transfected HEK 293T cells was collected after 16 hr, 0.45 µm-filtered, and added to MEFs. The cells were passaged for a week, and incubated with 5 µg/ml doxycycline for 48 hr to induce the expression of the construct. GFP-positive cells were selected by FACS and pooled. MEFs were transfected by electroporation using the Ingenio solution (Mirus, MIR50108) and a nucleofector (Amaxa). The cells were processed 2 days after electroporation.</p><p>For complementation assays, GFP, GFP-kazrin C, and GFP-kazrin C-Nt were induced for up to 12 hr to achieve low, nearly-physiological expression levels of GFP-kazrin C (as compared to endogenous kazrin by immunoblot, using the home-made rabbit polyclonal anti-kazrin serums), and analogous expression levels of GFP or GFP-kazrin C-Nt (as compared by immunoblot using the mouse anti-GFP antibody (see antibodies section)). For GFP-kazrin C imaging or biochemical studies, cells were induced for up to 24 hr to achieve analogous, moderately-overexpressed levels of the proteins. To study the effect on microtubule dynamics and dynein inhibition, MEFs were treated with 100 ng/ml of nocodazole for 16 h or 40 nM of ciliobrevin for 12 hr, respectively, or DMSO, and then fixed at room temperature. kazKO MEF and kazKO MEF expressing GFP and GFP-kazrin C are available for non-commercial purposes under request. Cos7 and mIMCD3 we authenticated by ATCC. MEF was authenticated by proteomic analysis. All cell lines were tested negative for mycoplasma by PCR using EZ-PCR Mycoplasma detecting kit (VITRO, SA) or custom-made oligonucleotides.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>TxR-Tfn accumulation, juxtanuclear enrichment, and recycling assays</title><p>Cos7 cells or MEFs were grown on R-collagen-coated glass coverslips.

For the juxtanuclear enrichment assays the mean TxR-Tfn fluorescence intensity within a 10 µm diameter circle in the juxtanuclear region was divided by the signal in the whole cell selected with the Fiji free hand tool to define the ROI (Region of interest), at 10 min chase, after background subtraction. For recycling experiments, the mean fluorescence intensity per cell was measured using the Fiji free hand drawing tool to select the ROI at the indicated time points and the signal was normalized to the average intensity at time 0.</p><p>For TxR-Tfn accumulation, juxtanuclear enrichment, and recycling assays, images were taken with a Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope equipped with a 63 x oil (NA = 1.4) objective, a GaAsP PMT detector 45% QE and images were acquired at pixel size 0.06 µm, unless otherwise indicated. For the experiments shown in 4 F, an Andor Dragonfly spinning disk microscope equipped with a 100 x oil (NA = 1.49) objective and a Sona 4.2 B11 sCMOS camera 95% QE was used.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) After discussion, the reviewers thought it was necessary for the authors to directly test the ability of Kazrin to be a dynein-dynactin adaptor. It was suggested that the authors perform the in vitro experiments outlined by Reviewer 1 to provide direct support for the title of this manuscript. If the authors are unable to provide these data, the reviewers thought the authors should soften their language throughout the manuscript, and change their title to a more apt description of their results.</p><p>2) The reviewers agreed that the language used throughout the manuscript was too bold based on the presented data. Please go through the suggestions of each reviewer to change/soften the language to ensure the descriptive language, claims and conclusions match the data being presented.</p><p>3) Finally, the reviewers offered suggestions about the addition of references throughout the paper to cite prior work and to put the current results within the context of the field. Please address these suggestions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I am listing below a few suggestions that the authors might wish to consider to buttress the conclusion of their work as summarized in the title. Obviously, addressing each and every one of my suggestions would go far beyond the timeframe that is reasonable for a revised version, and therefore I leave to the authors' judgement the choice of how many of them are they willing to tackle.</p><p>A first place with room for substantial improvement is that the reference section, which is a bit outdated. Two, in my opinion, key reviews will surely help authors to address this shortcoming: Erika Holzbaur's (doi: 10.1242/jcs.227132) and Samara Reck-Peterson's (doi: 10.1038/s41580-018-0004-3). Of note, the authors often cite reviews rather than primary reports, which favors the interests of the journal(s) publishing their reviews but precludes fair recognition of the contributing scientists.</p><p>A point that is unclear to me is the relationship of the suggested kazrin pathway with the RAB11 FIP3 pathway, traditionally regarded as the pathway connecting sorting endosomes with the perinuclear recycling endosome (Bouchet et al., 2016; Eathiraj et al., 2006; Horgan et al., 2010; Vetter et al., 2015) (I wonder if authors have filmed kazrin with RAB11 and RAB5). Using dominant-negative RAB mutants could help to clarify the involvement of specific RABs in the process.</p><p>Bioinformatic analysis of kazrin is limited to a (convincing) local alignment shown in Figure 5. I think that a more detailed description of the domain organization of kazrin compared to well-established adaptors, together with extensive use of AlphaFold, would help to buttress the argued resemblance.</p><p>How do authors explain the inhibition of clathrin-dependent endocytosis by kazrin OE? Is it that kazrin hijacks a large proportion of the available pool of clathrin? How do you envisage the physiological role of the kazrin::γ-adaptin interaction?</p><p>On figure 5, coIP of p150 with GFP-kazrin is shown. It would be as important as reassuring to include more subunits of dynactin/dynein in these experiments. Have authors performed shotgun sequencing of GFP-trapped immunoprecipitates? Other hits?</p><p>It would also be reassuring that a genetic intervention in the dynein pathway (δ LIC, dynamitin overexpression, shRNA against LIC, the dynein heavy chain, etc prevents the arrival of kazrin to the RE).</p><p>I wonder why authors are acquiring z-stacks to follow the movement of kazrin endosomes. This implies that cells might be receiving an excessive amount of photodamaging light that will affect, in our experience, both run length, and speed.</p><p>It would be nice to have a longer exposure of the Ptd-inositides on 3F. Perhaps the authors could carry out liposome pull-downs?</p><p>The bar diagrams on the right panels of Figure 6 are unsuitable for presentation. I strongly suggest using one diagram per condition and to add the corresponding histograms. Please use colors as well.</p><p>Strictly speaking, the panels shown in Figure 6A are not kymographs, they are 2D projections of time stacks showing the trajectories of the vesicles. A kymograph is a graph depicting position over time. The pictures can be improved, could you please show more examples (as S-Figure)?</p><p>The number of movies is exceedingly large and often unnecessary. One Video per condition would be enough and localization of kazrin to endosome membranes could be illustrated with orthogonal views of MIPs, displayed in the main section. Any colocalization coefficient?</p><p>A plausible explanation for the kazrin-kinesin-1 association detected is that kin-1 transports dynein to the plus-ends of microtubules.</p><p>Figure 5, S1: I am afraid I can't see any movement (neither here nor in the Video)</p><p>(44) EMT: please introduce abbreviations as they appear in the main text, irrespective of whether they were spelled out in the abstract.

For statistical tests in Figure 1C, Figure 1-S3, and elsewhere, &quot;n&quot; is not defined. Given the relatively large number (&gt;25), it appears to represent the number of individual cells that were analyzed rather than independent biological replicates. As a result, the very small p values are misleading and may not be informative about reproducibility or inter-experiment variability. At a minimum, the authors should more clearly define &quot;n&quot; in the figure legend in order to explain how many experiments were performed and how many cells were analyzed per experiment.</p><p>2. It is not clear how it was determined that kazirin spots seen via microscopy are condensates. The authors should at minimum provide an acknowledgement that this is speculative.</p><p>3. The authors alternate between using red-green and magenta-green for showing 2 channels in microscopy experiments. For consistency and to help out color-blind readers, it would be best to use just the magenta-green option.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83793.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I am listing below a few suggestions that the authors might wish to consider to buttress the conclusion of their work as summarized in the title.

Given the phenotype installed upon kazrin depletion, its subcellular localization and its interaction with AP-1, we expected RAB4 to interact with kazrin, (Deneka et al., 2003; Nagelkerken et al., 2000; Perrin et al., 2013). We did find some evidence suggesting that endogenous kazrin could specifically interact with overexpressed YFP-RAB4 in Cos7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>), but unfortunately, we could not trust the data because the antibody used to presumably recognize endogenous kazrin still recognized some cellular structures in MEF kazKO. Also, the results in cells over-expressing mCherry-kazrin C and RAB4-YFP were not consistent and the cells look extremely vacuolated. Finally, we could never detect any specific interaction between kazrin and RAB4 in biochemical assays with purified components or in immunoprecipitations assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Endogenous kazrin C might interact with overexpressed RAB4 in Cos7 cells.</title><p>Fluorescence micrographs of Cos7 cells transiently expressing RAB4-YFP, RAB11YFP or RAB5-GFP, fixed and stained with a rabbit serum against kazrin C and a A568conjugated secondary antibody.

RAB11-FIP3 interacts with RAB11 and it is mostly localized to RAB11-labeled compartments, the TGN and the RE (Hales et al., 2001; Horgan et al., 2004). Instead, kazrin is mostly recruited to the EEs and not to REs, as shown by our cell fractionation experiments and by its capacity to specifically bind PI3P. On the other hand, even though depletion of either protein installs a scattered pattern of Tfn-loaded compartments ((Horgan et al., 2010) and our present work), depletion of RAB11-FIP3 causes the dispersal of RAB11 compartments without affecting the distribution of EEs (Horgan et al., 2007), whereas depletion of kazrin causes the accumulation of peripheral EEs without affecting the RAB11 distribution (our present work). These observations suggest that kazrin works in the retrograde transport of EEs or in the generation and/or motility of EE/RE transport intermediates that have not yet lost their EE identity. In agreement, we see that the scattered Tfn compartments accumulating in kazKO cells colocalize with EEA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>). RAB11-FIP3 instead, seems to play a role in either receiving EE/RE transport intermediates that have already acquired RAB11, or in positioning the RE compartment at the pericentriollar region, which might be key for the docking and fusion of incoming transport intermediates. Based on the overwhelming data demonstrating the key role of RAB11-FIP3 in positioning the RE in different contexts (Bouchet et al., 2017; Fielding et al., 2005; Horgan et al., 2007; Schiel et al., 2012; Wilson et al., 2005), we would rather favor this last possibility, even though it might play different roles in association with different motors. For simplicity, we have not included all this considerations in the manuscript, but we now mention in the discussion that kazrin and RAB-FIP3 possibly work in the same endocytic recycling pathway, but at different stages.</p><p>We thank you the reviewer for pointing it out.</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Colocalization of internalized TxRTfn and EEA1 in kazKO MEF.</title><p>Merged confocal fluorescence microscopy of kazKO MEF loaded with TxR-Tfn (magenta) for 20 min, fixed an stained with anti-EEA1 and A641-conjugated secondary antibodies (Green).

We show the α fold prediction for the mouse kazrin A, BICDR1 and RAB11-FIP3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4A</xref> as a matter of examples. Therefore, we thought that the sequence comparison would be more meaningful, especially because when we run a Clustal Omega alignment, the phylogenetic tree indicates that the similarity between kazrin and the other adaptors is comparable to the similarity among them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4B</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Similarities between kazrin and other bona fide or candidate dynein/dynactin adaptors.</title><p>A.

Is it that kazrin hijacks a large proportion of the available pool of clathrin? How do you envisage the physiological role of the kazrin::γ-adaptin interaction?</p></disp-quote><p>We think that overexpression of kazrin leads to sequestration of some factors required for the uptake step of receptor-mediated endocytosis. It might possibly be clathrin, but alterations of the actin cytoskeleton seen upon overexpression of kazrin might also play a role (Sevilla et al., 2008). As for the interaction with AP-1, we envision that kazrin might directly link the endosomal subdomains containing this clathrin adaptor to the tubulin network.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On figure 5, coIP of p150 with GFP-kazrin is shown. It would be as important as reassuring to include more subunits of dynactin/dynein in these experiments. Have authors performed shotgun sequencing of GFP-trapped immunoprecipitates? Other hits?</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree with the reviewer that showing that GFP-kazrin C can pull down not only dynactin but also dynein was very important in the context of proposing that kazrin promotes dynein/dynactin endosome motility. We now show in figure 5H that GFP-kazrin C but not GFP pulls downs the dynein heavy chain from non-denaturing extracts. The mass-spectrometry analysis of GFP-kazrin C pull downs is also a very good suggestion but we get at the moment very little material when we express GFP-kazrin C at physiological levels, so we plan to perform proximity labelling with an integrated kazrin C-BioID chimera in the near future. We did though some pull downs with GST-kazrin C from brain extracts and we identified, besides α and β tubulin, Kif5 a kinesin 1 that might link kazrin to the endosomal Rab4/Gadkin/AP-1 pathway (Schmidt et al., 2009), cenexin 1 and 2, centriole subdistal appendage proteins that might connect kazrin to the REs (Hehnly et al., 2012), and cytocentrin and RILP that might link kazrin to the Ral GTPases. We have not validated these results yet though.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would also be reassuring that a genetic intervention in the dynein pathway (δ LIC, dynamitin overexpression, shRNA against LIC, the dynein heavy chain, etc prevents the arrival of kazrin to the RE).</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree with the reviewer that showing the effects of inhibiting dynein activity on GFP-kazrin C localization and the distribution of EEs was important in the context of the manuscript. We now include an experiment in figure 5E and F showing that treatment of cells with the dynein inhibitor ciliobrevin prevents accumulation of GFP-kazrin C in the pericentrin foci and, concomitantly causes the dispersal of EEs towards the cell periphery, similar to kazrin depletion. We have also added another experiment in figure 5-S2, showing that a chimera of GFP-kazrin C fused to a mitochondria targeting domain can convey mitochondria to the pericentriolar region in Cos7 cells, suggesting that kazrin C can promote transport or clustering of cargo other that endosomes towards or at the microtubule minus ends, when fused to the adequate targeting signal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I wonder why authors are acquiring z-stacks to follow the movement of kazrin endosomes. This implies that cells might be receiving an excessive amount of photodamaging light that will affect, in our experience, both run length, and speed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer, but we needed to do Z-stacks not to lose tracks that move within the Z axes. In any case, the speeds and the length of the tracks are within the ranges of published data (Flores-Rodriguez et al., 2011; Loubery et al., 2008), so we assume that photo-damaging is not a major problem in our samples when filmed for 90 seconds under the conditions used, and that in any case, it would affect similarly all cell types under analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be nice to have a longer exposure of the Ptd-inositides on 3F. Perhaps the authors could carry out liposome pull-downs?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included a more clear exposure of the lipid strip overlay assay and we have added a liposome pelleting assay in figure 3G that shows that kazrin C interacts with liposomes containing PI3P.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The bar diagrams on the right panels of Figure 6 are unsuitable for presentation. I strongly suggest using one diagram per condition and to add the corresponding histograms. Please use colors as well.</p></disp-quote><p>We have tried several ways to represent these data and we found that a line plot with different colours was the clearest. I hope this new format is adequate for the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Strictly speaking, the panels shown in Figure 6A are not kymographs, they are 2D projections of time stacks showing the trajectories of the vesicles. A kymograph is a graph depicting position over time. The pictures can be improved, could you please show more examples (as S-Figure)?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added more examples of time projections used in these experiments in figure 6-S1 and S2. For clarity, we have coloured in blue the fairly straight, longer trajectories, as opposed to the more confined movements that appeared as round dots in the time projections (coloured in red). It is difficult to improve the images of the 2D projections because they need to be contrasted to evidence the trajectories. Instead, we have now chosen to included more videos illustrating the differences observed in cells expressing endogenous or GFP-kazrin C versus kazKO cells or kazKO cells expressing GFP or GFPkazrin C-Nt. Movies 8 and 11 show the endosome motility in representative WT and kazKO cells (Video 8) and kazKO cells expressing GFP, GFP-kazrin C or GFP-kazrin CNt (Video 11). Movies 9 and 10 show endosome motility in four magnified fields of different WT and kazKO cells, where longer and faster motility events can be observed when endogenous kazrin is expressed. Movies 12 to 14 show endosome motility in four magnified fields of different kazKO cells expressing, GFP-kazrin C (Video 12), GFP (Video 13) and GFP-kazrin C-Nt (Video 14). Longer and faster movements can be observed in the different insets of Video 12, as compared with movies 13 and 14. Finally, as suggested by the reviewer, we have reworded kymographs to time projections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The number of movies is exceedingly large and often unnecessary. One Video per condition would be enough and localization of kazrin to endosome membranes could be illustrated with orthogonal views of MIPs, displayed in the main section. Any colocalization coefficient?</p></disp-quote><p>We have reduced the number of movies by combining the ones addressing the same point in one file. Thus, in movies 3 and 5, we show four 3D reconstructions of GFP-kazrin C or GFP-kazrin C-Nt foci in association with TxRTfn-loaded endosomes. We have removed the videos showing the reconstruction of TxRTfn endosomes in GFP expressing cells, because they were indeed not very informative. In Video 4, we now include the two 3D reconstructions showing association of EDH-protein enriched subdomains with GFP-kazrin C. We have also included orthogonal views of some of these videos in the corresponding figures, as suggested. Finally, we have attempted the analysis of the association between the GFP-kazrin C and GFP-kazrin C-Nt foci with TxR-Tfn-loaded endosomes. In our hand, it was impossible to do it automatically because the foci are very small, they do not strictly co-localize (Tfn is in the endosome lumen and kazrin is in the cytosol), and the cytosolic and nuclear backgrounds are high and different for the GFP-kazrin C and GFP-kazrin C-Nt construct. What we have done is to prepare more than twenty 3D reconstructions for each case and identify manually the TxRTfn foci (EE) closest to the GFP-kazrin C or GFPkazrin C-Nt foci, by measuring with the line Fiji tool. The distance between the centroid of those foci was then measured with the same tool in the Video frame showing the maximal separation between these foci. The data shows more association of GFP-kazrin C with endosomes as compared to GFP-kazrin C-Nt (Figure 4-S3). To further reinforce the conclusion that the C-terminus mediates binding of kazrin to cellular membranes, we have also repeated up to 5 times the fractionation experiment shown in figure 4A and we consistently show that a higher portion of GFP-kazrin C co-fraccionates with the microsomal fraction, as compared with GFP-kazrin C-Nt (Figure 4B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A plausible explanation for the kazrin-kinesin-1 association detected is that kin-1 transports dynein to the plus-ends of microtubules.</p></disp-quote><p>We now introduce this possibility in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5, S1: I am afraid I can't see any movement (neither here nor in the Video)</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the figure and we have added arrows to make it more clear.

For statistical tests in Figure 1C, Figure 1-S3, and elsewhere, &quot;n&quot; is not defined. Given the relatively large number (&gt;25), it appears to represent the number of individual cells that were analyzed rather than independent biological replicates. As a result, the very small p values are misleading and may not be informative about reproducibility or inter-experiment variability. At a minimum, the authors should more clearly define &quot;n&quot; in the figure legend in order to explain how many experiments were performed and how many cells were analyzed per experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added the information on the sample size in figure legends and we have extended the information on the replicas in Materials and methods. In summary, for endosomal transport assays (Tfn uptake, recycling, endosome motility…), the experiments were performed at least twice with at least two independently seeded plates, with analogous results. Data from the different replicas of one of the experiments were pulled for the graphs. The cell fractionation experiments were performed at least three times in MEF and also confirmed in other cell types. The biochemical experiments to demonstrate proteinprotein interactions were performed at least twice with the adequate controls from unspecific binding. All relevant interactions were tested with at least two different approaches (i. e. pull downs with purified components, pull downs with cell extracts, immunoprecipitations from cells expressing GFP-kazrin C, or immunoprecipitations with endogenous kazrin C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.
