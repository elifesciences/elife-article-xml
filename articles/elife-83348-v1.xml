irrelevant to survival and attend to ones that enhance survival. When a stimulus regularly fails to be associated with an important consequence, subsequent excitatory learning about that stimulus can be delayed, which is a form of nonassociative conditioning called ‘latent inhibition’. Honey bees show latent inhibition toward an odor they have experienced without association with food reinforcement. Moreover, individual honey bees from the same colony differ in the degree to which they show latent inhibition, and these individual differences have a genetic basis. To investigate the mechanisms that underly individual differences in latent inhibition, we selected two honey bee lines for high and low latent inhibition, respectively. We crossed those lines and mapped a Quantitative Trait Locus for latent inhibition to a region of the genome that contains the tyramine receptor gene <italic>Amtyr1</italic> [We use Amtyr1 to denote the gene and AmTYR1 the receptor throughout the text.]. We then show that disruption of <italic>Amtyr1</italic> signaling either pharmacologically or through RNAi qualitatively changes the expression of latent inhibition but has little or slight effects on appetitive conditioning, and these results suggest that AmTYR1 modulates inhibitory processing in the CNS. Electrophysiological recordings from the brain during pharmacological blockade are consistent with a model that AmTYR1 indirectly regulates at inhibitory synapses in the CNS. Our results therefore identify a distinct <italic>Amtyr1</italic>-based modulatory pathway for this type of nonassociative learning, and we propose a model for how <italic>Amtyr1</italic> acts as a gain control to modulate hebbian plasticity at defined synapses in the CNS. We have shown elsewhere how this modulation also underlies potentially adaptive intracolonial learning differences among individuals that benefit colony survival. Finally, our neural model suggests a mechanism for the broad pleiotropy this gene has on several different behaviors.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>To efficiently navigate their environment, animals must pay attention to cues associated with events important for survival while also dismissing meaningless signals. The difference between relevant and irrelevant stimuli is learned through a range of complex mechanisms that includes latent inhibition. This process allows animals to ignore irrelevant stimuli, which makes it more difficult for them to associate a cue and a reward if that cue has been unrewarded before. For example, bees will take longer to ‘learn’ that a certain floral odor signals a feeding opportunity if they first repeatedly encountered the smell when food was absent. Such a mechanism allows organisms to devote more attention to other stimuli which have the potential to be important for survival.</p><p>The strength of latent inhibition – as revealed by how quickly and easily an individual can learn to associate a reward with a previously unrewarded stimulus – can differ between individuals. For instance, this is the case in honey bee colonies, where workers have the same mother but may come from different fathers. Such genetic variation can be beneficial for the hive, with high latent inhibition workers being better suited for paying attention to and harvesting known resources, and their low latent inhibition peers for discovering new ones. However, the underlying genetic and neural mechanisms underpinning latent inhibition variability between individuals remained unclear.</p><p>To investigate this question, Latshaw et al. cross-bred bees from high and low latent inhibition genetic lines. The resulting progeny underwent behavioral tests, and the genome of low and high latent inhibition individuals was screened. These analyses revealed a candidate gene, <italic>Amtyr1</italic>, which was associated with individual variations in the learning mechanism.</p><p>Further experiments showed that blocking or disrupting the production the AMTYR1 protein led to altered latent inhibition behavior as well as dampened attention-related processing in recordings from the central nervous system. Based on these findings, a model was proposed detailing how varying degrees of <italic>Amtyr1</italic> activation can tune Hebbian plasticity, the brain mechanism that allows organisms to regulate associations between cues and events. Importantly, because of the way AMTYR1 acts in the nervous system, this modulatory role could go beyond latent inhibition, with the associated gene controlling the activity of a range of foraging-related behaviors. Genetic work in model organisms such as fruit flies would allow a more in-depth understanding of such network modulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>honey bee</kwd><kwd>latent inhibition</kwd><kwd>attention</kwd><kwd>tyramine receptor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM113967</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Brian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2113179</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Brian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1559632</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Brian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000015</institution-id><institution>Department of Energy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SC0021922</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Brian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic variation in a biogenic amines receptor underlies a means of gain control for nonassociative learning and hence an important form of attention that is the basis for tradeoffs in foraging in a social collective.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ability to learn predictive associations between stimuli and important events, such as food or threats, is ubiquitous among animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Heyes, 2012</xref>), and it may underlie more complex cognitive capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Heyes, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dickinson, 2012</xref>). This ability arises from various forms of associative and operant conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mackintosh, 1983</xref>). However, the absence of reward also provides important information for learning about stimuli, because all animals must use this information to redirect a limited attention capacity to more important stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lubow, 1989</xref>). One important mechanism for learning to ignore irrelevant stimuli is called latent inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lubow, 1973</xref>). After an animal is presented with a stimulus several times without reinforcement, learning is delayed or slower when that same stimulus is reinforced in a way that would normally produce robust excitatory conditioning. For example, when honey bees are repeatedly exposed to a floral odor without association to food rewards, their ability to subsequently learn an excitatory association of this odor with a reward is delayed or reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chandra et al., 2010</xref>). While many studies in the honey bee have focused around how the presence of reward shapes learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Langberg and Smith, 2006</xref>), evaluating this important form of nonassociative learning has not received as much attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chandra et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abramson and Bitterman, 1986</xref>). Yet, like in all animals, it plays an important ecological role in the learning repertoire of honey bees. The presence of unrewarding flowers in an otherwise productive patch of flowers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Seefeldt and De Marco, 2008</xref>), or the unreinforced presence of an odor in the colony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fernández et al., 2009</xref>), can influence foragers’ choices of flowers during foraging trips.</p><p>Moreover, individual honey bees from the same colony differ in the degree to which they exhibit several learning traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brandes, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chandra et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Finke et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Smith et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pamir et al., 2014</xref>), including latent inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chandra et al., 2000</xref>). Several studies of different forms of learning have demonstrated that individual differences are heritable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chandra et al., 2000</xref>). Individuals showing different learning phenotypes occur within the same colony because a queen mates with up to 20 drones (males) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Page, 2013</xref>), and thus honey bee colonies typically contain a mixture of many different paternal genotypes. This within-colony genetic diversity of learning capacities may reflect a colony level trait that allows the colony to react and adapt to rapidly changing resource distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Latshaw and Smith, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mosqueiro et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Our objective here was to evaluate the genetic and neural mechanisms that underlie individual differences for latent inhibition in honey bees. We show that a major locus supporting individual differences maps to a location in the honey bee genome previously identified in independent mapping studies as being important for latent inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chandra et al., 2001</xref>) as well as for sugar and pollen preferences in foragers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hunt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Page et al., 2000</xref>). Disruption of a tyramine receptor encoded by <italic>Amtyr1</italic> in this region changes expression of latent inhibition in a way that suggests that intact signaling via the <italic>Amtyr1</italic> pathway is important for modulating plasticity at inhibitory synapses. Furthermore, electrophysiological analyses combined with blockade of the AmTYR1 receptor in the antennal lobe – the first synaptic center along the olfactory pathway – decreased antennal lobe responsiveness to odor and blocked a neural correlate of latent inhibition. Finally, sequencing the gene failed to reveal mutations in the coding regions that would affect protein function, leading to the conclusion that variation across workers could arise from differential gene expression through transcriptional regulation.</p><p>We discuss how these data strongly imply a functional role for <italic>Amtyr1</italic> signaling in modulating expression of attention via latent inhibition. We use the term ‘modulating’ to specifically propose that <italic>Amtyr1</italic> is not causing latent inhibition. Rather, it modulates excitatory inputs to circuitry that implements hebbian plasticity between downstream components that drive latent inhibition. Specifically, disruption of <italic>Amtyr1 increases</italic> excitatory drive to those components, and that increase drives stronger inhibitory hebbian plasticity. We propose modifications to an existing model for LTP-based latent inhibition in the antennal lobe to show that it can produce both the high and low phenotypes in natural populations by simply increasing or decreasing the level of <italic>Amtyr1</italic> activation. This model also suggests how this gene can exert broad pleiotropic effects on several different behaviors by acting as a gain control in different types of neural circuits or physiological processes. Given the established <italic>Amtyr1</italic>-based variation between workers in how this behavior is expressed, and presumably in how the circuitry functions differentially in their brains, these findings are also important for understanding the strategies colonies use to explore for and exploit pollen and nectar resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cook et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We used two genetic lines of honey bees that had been bred for high (inhibitor) or low (noninhibitor) expression of latent inhibition. These lines were independently selected using identical methods to a previous study that had successfully bred high and low lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chandra et al., 2001</xref>). We evaluated 523 recombinant drones generated from a single hybrid queen produced from a cross between a drone from a noninhibitor line and a queen from an inhibitor line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Honey bee drones are ideal for behavior genetic studies because they are haploid progeny that develop from an unfertilized egg laid by the queen. We then selected 94 high and 94 low performing drones for the Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) analysis, which identified one significant locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The QTL mapped to the same genomic region identified in a previous study of latent inhibition (called ‘<italic>lrn1</italic>’) using an independent inhibitor and noninhibitor cross and different (RAPD-based) genetic markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chandra et al., 2001</xref>). This is the same genomic region that has been identified in studies of foraging preferences of honey bees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Page et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hunt et al., 1995</xref>), where it has been called <italic>pln2</italic> for its effect on pollen versus nectar preferences and in modulating sensitivity to sucrose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pankiw et al., 2001</xref>). Clearly, this genomic region has major effects on several foraging-related behaviors.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Evaluation and selection of drones from an F1 queen.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Drone honey bees were first evaluated by conditioning them over three trials to an odor (A; gray bars) followed by sucrose reinforcement (triangles) in a way that produces robust associative conditioning expressed as odor-induced proboscis extension response (PER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bitterman et al., 1983</xref>). All drones that showed no PER response on the first trial and PER response on each of the following two trials were selected for the subsequent familiarization phase. This procedure ensured that only drones motivated to respond to sucrose and learn the association with odor were selected. Approximately 10% of honey bees fail to show evidence of learning in PER conditioning using the collection methods described in Materials and methods. The familiarization phase involved 40 4 s exposures to a different odor (X; black bars) using a 5-min interstimulus interval. These conditions are sufficient for generating latent inhibition that lasts for at least 24 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chandra et al., 2010</xref>). Finally, the test phase involved six exposures to X followed by sucrose reinforcement. (<bold>B</bold>) Frequency distribution of 523 drones evaluated in the test phase. The <italic>x</italic>-axis shows the summed number of responses over six conditioning trials. Fewer responses correspond to stronger latent inhibition.

All of the drones in that category showed responses on trials 1–6.

That gene encodes a biogenic amine receptor for tyramine (AmTYR1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blenau et al., 2000</xref>) that is expressed in several regions of the honey bee brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mustard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sinakevitch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Thamm et al., 2017</xref>). AmTYR1 is most closely related to the insect α2-adrenergic-like octopamine receptors and the vertebrate α2-adrenergic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blenau et al., 2020</xref>). Activation of AmTYR1 reduces cAMP levels in neurons that express it. We specifically considered AmTYR1 for more detailed evaluation for several reasons. Tyramine affects sucrose sensitivity in honey bees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Scheiner et al., 2017</xref>), and nurses and foragers differ in AmTYR1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Scheiner et al., 2014</xref>). Mutations in the orthologous tyramine receptor in fruit flies disrupt odor-guided innate behaviors to repellants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kutsukake et al., 2000</xref>). Tyramine is also the direct biosynthetic precursor to octopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Roeder, 2005</xref>), which has been widely implicated in sucrose-driven appetitive reinforcement learning in the honey bee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Farooqui et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hammer, 1993</xref>). Therefore, Ventral Unpaired Medial neurons, which lie on the median of the subesophageal ganglion in the honey bee brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sinakevitch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sinakevitch et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sinakevitch et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kreissl et al., 1994</xref>), and which form the basis for the appetitive reinforcement pathway must produce tyramine in the process of making octopamine. Recent analyses indicate these neurons in locusts and fruit flies also release both neuromodulators when activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kononenko et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schützler et al., 2019</xref>). Finally, octopamine and tyramine affect locomotor activity in the honey bee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fussnecker et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>We then evaluated whether nonsynonymous mutations in the coding sequence might change the functionality of the receptor. We performed a detailed genomic analysis of the 40-kb region including the <italic>Amtyr1</italic> gene, a 2-kb upstream, and a 0.5-kb downstream noncoding region. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) frequency in the coding sequence (CDS) was relatively low compared to the genome wide SNP frequency, and all 46 SNPs in the coding regions in any of the sequenced eight individual worker genomes represented synonymous substitutions, that is, these SNPs do not change the sequence of the encoded protein. Thus, phenotypic differences are not caused by structural changes in the tyramine receptor protein itself. We did, however, find an increased SNP frequency in introns, the up- and downstream noncoding regions and the 3′ untranslated region. If <italic>Amtyr1</italic> is involved in latent inhibition, these variations might be linked to the changes in the regulation of <italic>Amtyr1</italic> gene expression, for example, by changes in transcription factor-binding sites or the stability of the mRNA, which might eventually be responsible for the observed phenotypic differences.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Disruption of <italic>Amtyr1</italic> affects expression of latent inhibition</title><p>To further examine the role of <italic>Amtyr1</italic> signaling in latent inhibition, we performed a series of behavioral experiments that involved treatment of honey bees either with the tyramine receptor antagonist yohimbine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Reim et al., 2017</xref>) or with a Dicer-substrate small interfering (Dsi) RNA of the receptor (NCBI Reference Sequence: NM_001011594.1) to disrupt translation of mRNA into AmTYR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sinakevitch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guo et al., 2018</xref>). For these experiments, we used unselected worker honey bees from the same background population used for selection studies, which ensured that workers used for behavioral assays would represent a mixture of inhibitor and noninhibitor phenotypes. Therefore, treatment could increase or decrease the mean level of latent inhibition in this population. Training involved two phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). First, during the ‘familiarization’ phase honey bees were identically exposed over 40 trials to odor X without reinforcement. Our previous studies have shown that this procedure produces robust latent inhibition. The second ‘test’ phase involved measurement of latent inhibition. During this phase odor X and a ‘novel’ odor N were presented on separate trials. Both odors were associated with sucrose reinforcement in a way that produces robust appetitive conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bitterman et al., 1983</xref>). Latent inhibition would be evident if responses to odor X were lower than the responses to the novel odor N. Injections of yohimbine directly into brains occurred either prior to the familiarization phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>) or prior to the test phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Blockade of the tyramine receptor with yohimbine modulated expression of latent inhibition.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Acquisition during the test phase in two injection groups of honey bees familiarized to air as a control procedure to evaluate the effects of yohimbine on excitatory conditioning.

One group was injected (arrow) with saline (orange circles; <italic>n</italic> = 37 animals) and the other with yohimbine (blue triangles; <italic>n</italic> = 35) prior to familiarization.

In this design, each individual was equivalently conditioned to both odors during the test phase; latent inhibition is evident when the response to the novel odor is greater than to the familiar odor. Injection was prior to odor familiarization.

This procedure involved familiarization to air, which does not induce latent inhibition to odor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chandra et al., 2010</xref>). Honey bees familiarized to air learned the association of both odors with sucrose reinforcement equally well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The response to each odor significantly increased, as expected, across trials (<italic>X</italic><sup>2</sup> = 47.5, df = 3, p &lt; 0.001). Moreover, there was no effect of injection with saline versus yohimbine; the response levels to all four odors across the saline and yohimbine injection groups were equivalent. Therefore, blockade of tyramine signaling does not affect excitatory conditioning, which is an important control for the effects about to be described. This control procedure also shows that yohimbine at 10<sup>−4</sup> M probably does not affect receptors for other biogenic amines, such as octopamine, dopamine, and serotonin, all of which have been shown to have specific effects on appetitive olfactory learning in honey bees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Farooqui et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wright et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hammer and Menzel, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mercer and Menzel, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bicker and Menzel, 1989</xref>).</p><p>Yohimbine treatment affected the expression of latent inhibition in both treatments that involved familiarization to odor (the interaction between novel vs familiar odor and saline vs yohimbine injection: <italic>X</italic><sup>2</sup> = 7.4, df = 1, p &lt; 0.01). First, in the saline controls, honey bees responded more often to odor N than to X after injection of saline prior to familiarization or prior to testing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, C</xref>, circles). The response to the familiar odor was lower than the response to the novel odor on most trials, including spontaneous responses on the first trial. Injection of yohimbine eliminated the difference in response to the novel and familiar odors. Moreover, the responses to both odors after yohimbine treatment were significantly lower than, or at least equal to, the response to the familiar odor in the respective saline controls. This pattern could not arise from blockade of excitatory learning about N, because excitatory learning was unaffected in the air preexposure controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Instead, the yohimbine-induced pattern was specific to the treatments in which one odor was familiar.</p><p>This result implies that blockade of AmTYR1 modulates latent inhibition to a familiar odor and that the effect now generalizes to the novel odor. Finally, the relative effect of yohimbine treatment, that is reduction of proboscis extension response (PER) rate, is similar when it is injected either prior to familiarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) or prior to testing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This pattern, that is, the same effect prior to acquisition or testing, is similar to the action of octopamine blockade on excitatory conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Farooqui et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Although the results with yohimbine were promising, we were concerned that yohimbine can have effects on other receptors, specifically on an α2-adrenergic-like octopamine receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blenau et al., 2020</xref>) and on an excitatory tyramine receptor AmTYR2(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Reim et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, we decided to disrupt <italic>Amtyr1</italic> expression via injection of <italic>Amtyr1</italic> DsiRNA in order to provide an independent method to test the role of AmTYR1 in producing latent inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Yohimbine blocks the receptor, whereas dsiAmtyr1 disrupts production of the receptor protein. Similar outcomes with the two different methods would increase confidence in the result. For the behavioral experiments, we used the same procedure as above for yohimbine except that the mixture of three <italic>Amtyr1</italic> DsiRNA constructs was injected 20 hr prior to conditioning because of the time frame needed for the DsiRNA to target mRNA. Because of that time frame, and because injection of yohimbine prior to either phase produced equivalent results, we performed injections of <italic>Amtyr1</italic> DsiRNA only prior to familiarization. As a control we used a scrambled sequence of <italic>Amtyr1</italic> (DsiScr).

In contrast, after familiarization to one of the odors, learning of both the novel and familiar odors was poor in the <italic>Amtyr1</italic> DsiRNA injected group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). But expression of latent inhibition was normal – that is responses to the novel odor exceeded the responses to the familiar odor in the DsiScr group.

The results are dependent on unreinforced odor presentation, because that was the only difference between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref> and between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>. However, the results at first glance seemed counterintuitive. Blockade and disruption of <italic>Amtyr1</italic> did not attenuate latent inhibition by, for example, increasing the responsiveness to the familiar odor. Instead, treatment with yohimbine or <italic>Amtyr1</italic> DsiRNA reduced responsiveness to the novel odor. This result is consistent with <italic>Amtyr1</italic> modulating inhibition involved in, for example, identified inhibitory processes in the antennal lobes and/or the mushroom bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Linster et al., 2005</xref>). Specifically, and as we propose below, it would prevent the inhibition from becoming too strong, and possibly keep it at a set point between very strong and very weak.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Disruption of <italic>Amtyr1</italic> signaling affects neural codes for odors in the antennal lobe</title><p>Because of this intriguing result, we performed additional experiments to investigate the mechanism in more detail. Our prior studies of odor coding identified neural manifestations of latent inhibition in early synaptic processing of the antennal lobes of the honey bee brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lei et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Locatelli et al., 2013</xref>). Familiarization to an odor X caused a mixture of a novel odor N and X to become much more like N (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Locatelli et al., 2013</xref>). That is, neural information about familiar odors like X is filtered out of mixtures. Furthermore, responses to any novel odor are enhanced after familiarization to X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lei et al., 2022</xref>), which is a form of novelty detection. These effects in the antennal lobes could arise because of expression of AmTYR1 in presynaptic terminals of sensory axons in the honey bee antennal lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sinakevitch et al., 2017</xref>), where activation of AmTYR1 would decrease cAMP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blenau et al., 2000</xref>) and likely decrease release of acetylcholine at synapses.</p><p>We therefore chose to analyze the effect of yohimbine treatment on odor processing in the antennal lobes by recording electrophysiological responses to odors prior to and after familiarization in combination with yohimbine treatment. We used yohimbine in these experiments because of the more rapid onset (minutes vs hours) compared to DsiRNA treatment. This first experiment did not employ familiarization to odor. Prior to yohimbine treatment, recordings from 71 units across 4 animals revealed responses to odors that ranged from no detectable change in spike activity with odor presentation to a robust increase in spiking activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). After yohimbine treatment, responses decreased, although spiking activity was still detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This decrease in response is consistent with AmTYR1 being involved in regulation of inhibition in networks of the antennal lobe, assuming most recorded units that showed a decrease were Projection Neurons (PNs). In our previous use of this technique approximately 45% of recorded units were PNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lei et al., 2022</xref>). Olfactory Receptor Neuron (ORN) spikes do not register on the electrodes. Hypothetically at least, when AmTYR1 is blocked by yohimbine, excitation of inhibitory networks in the antennal lobe increases and drives down PN responses.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Yohimbine disrupts processing in the honey bee antennal lobe.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Perfusion of yohimbine solution (50 µM in physiological saline) into honey bee head capsule caused antennal lobe units to decrease response magnitude to odor stimuli (2-octanone and 1-hexanol) in general. Odor was delivered through a solenoid valve that was open at time zero and lasted for 4 s. (<bold>C</bold>) In control experiments where yohimbine was not applied, most of the units were responsive to both hexanol and octanone, but 39% were biased toward octanone (purple dots above the diagonal line), that is showing stronger response to octanone than to hexanol. During the familiarization protocol, these units were familiarized to hexanol 40 times with 1-min interval (arrow down) and were tested again with hexanol and octanone 10 min after the last odor stimulation in the familiarization phase. The test results show 54% of units responded more strongly to octanone (orange dots), which is a novel odor in this protocol. The 15% increase is statistically significant (<italic>McNemar</italic> test with Yates’s correction, df = 1, Chi-square = 5.939, p &lt; 0.02) (asterisks on purple and orange bars, <italic>N</italic> = 99).

Indeed, yohimbine treatment modified how neurons respond to novelty. Using the same familiarization protocol as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, but under conditions of saline perfusion, we found that 39% of units (<italic>N</italic> = 99) responded more strongly to the novel odor before the familiarization to an odor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, purple dots in upper panel; purple bar in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

Hence, familiarization increased bias toward the novel odor in neurons that were more responsive to that odor to begin with, which is consistent with our earlier results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lei et al., 2022</xref>). In different experiments where yohimbine was perfused, the familiarization protocol not only did not increase bias toward the novel odor, it significantly decreased the original bias from 49% (<italic>N</italic> = 56) to 14% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, gray bars) (<italic>McNemar</italic> test with Yates’s correction, df = 1, Chi-square = 11.13, p &lt; 0.001), suggesting that yohimbine interrupted this neural manifestation of latent inhibition in the antennal lobes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The tyramine/octopamine ratio in the brain is also associated with latent inhibition</title><p>A recent report implicated the release of dopamine in driving reward seeking behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2022</xref>). In order to evaluate whether dopamine might be involved in latent inhibition, and whether change in release of octopamine and/or tyramine might contribute to our behavioral results, we reanalyzed previously published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cook et al., 2019</xref>) on levels of dopamine, serotonin, octopamine, and tyramine in individual brains of 81 foragers collected from an unselected genetic background used for selection of lines for expression of latent inhibition. The foragers were collected as ‘scouts’ or ‘recruits’. Scouts were defined as the first bees to explore a new landscape into which their colony had been moved. Recruits were defined as foragers that were exploiting resources once they were found. All scouts and recruits were trained for latent inhibition in the laboratory, and then classified as to whether they showed strong or weak latent inhibition based on learning a novel and familiar odor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cook et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Of the biogenic amines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B</xref>), only tyramine showed differences between scouts and recruits (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cook et al., 2019</xref> for methods and a more complete analysis of these data).

All animals need to learn about stimuli in their environment. Latent inhibition is important for redirecting limited attention capacity away from unimportant, inconsequential stimuli and refocusing it toward novel stimuli about which the animal knows little or nothing. Two independent QTL mapping studies have now identified the genetic locus that contains <italic>Amtyr1</italic> as important for regulating individual variation in attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chandra et al., 2001</xref>). There are other loci in the genome that show associations with the behavior, and there are also other unidentified genes in the same locus. Nevertheless, our manipulation of <italic>Amtyr1</italic> function using both pharmacology and DsiRNA treatments confirm its association with behavioral expression of latent inhibition.</p><p>There are a few ideas that need to be kept in focus at this point in our understanding of <italic>Amtyr1</italic>. First, it is not a <italic>latent inhibition gene</italic>. Instead, it is a gene that has broad pleiotropic effects on foraging-related behaviors that include its effect on expression of latent inhibition. In that sense it has major effects on a broader behavioral syndrome that includes effects on sucrose sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pankiw et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Thamm et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Scheiner et al., 2017</xref>), preferences for nectar and/or pollen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Page et al., 2000</xref>), behavioral caste differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Scheiner et al., 2014</xref>), reproductive physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 2020</xref>), and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chandra et al., 2000</xref>). The model we propose below, in which <italic>Amtyr1</italic> acts as a gain control on inputs to neural networks, could potentially explain how <italic>Amtyr1</italic> can have such broad effects.</p><p>Second, the effects of <italic>Amtyr1</italic> specifically on expression of latent inhibition likely arise by combining its expression in sensory as well as more central areas of the brain. That is, it is unlikely that there is a single locus in the brain that underlies latent inhibition. We have shown in honey bees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sinakevitch et al., 2017</xref>), for example, that AmTYR1 is on presynaptic terminals of Olfactory Sensory Neuron axons in the antennal lobes, where they provide cholinergic excitation to dendrites of Local GABAergic Inhibitory Interneurons (LN) and PNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). AmTYR1 is also on presynaptic terminals of PN axons that terminate in and also provide excitatory cholinergic inputs to the mushroom body calyces. In the antennal lobe, where our electrophysiological and imaging studies have focused (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lei et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Locatelli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fernandez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Locatelli et al., 2016</xref>), familiarization to an odor causes the neural representation of a mixture that contains the familiar odor to become more like novel odors in the mixture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Locatelli et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, it potentiates the response to the novel odor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lei et al., 2022</xref>). We assume, but have yet to show experimentally, that this bias combines with how AmTYR1 affects processing in the mushroom bodies, where olfactory information converges with information from other sensory modalities. These higher-order effects of AmTYR1 could underlie individual differences among genetic lines selected in the laboratory for odor-based latent inhibition when they show differential attention to sensory stimuli associated with feeders when tested in free flying conditions in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cook et al., 2020</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Hypothetical model of how <italic>Amtyr1</italic> could modulate hebbian plasticity inhibition to modulate latent inhibition.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Circuitry of two glomeruli (<bold>A</bold> has been adapted from Figure P1 from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Das et al., 2011</xref>) that underlies latent inhibition (habituation) in the fruit fly antennal lobe, and which was also proposed via a computational model to underlie changes in antennal lobe responses to familiar and novel odors in the honey bee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Locatelli et al., 2013</xref>). The only addition here is incorporation of <italic>Amtyr1</italic> receptors on Olfactory Receptor Neuron axon terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sinakevitch et al., 2017</xref>). In the fruit fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Das et al., 2011</xref>), ORNs release Ach (purple) to coactivate Projection Neurons (PNs) and Local GABAergic Inhibitory Interneurons (LNs), which both express ACh receptors. LNs release both GABA (red) and glutamate (green) onto synapses with PNs. NMDA receptors on PNs potentiate the LN/PN synapses via a retrograde signal (green arrows) to LNs to hypothetically increase the release of GABA. This hebbian plasticity increases inhibition of PNs by LNs and thus decreases excitation of the PN. LN/PN coactivation in other glomeruli is either nonexistent (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Das et al., 2011</xref>), too low to produce potentiation of the LN/PN synapse, or strong enough to produce inhibition to odors other than the familiar odor (dashed green arrow). AmTYR1 receptors on presynaptic terminals of ORNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sinakevitch et al., 2017</xref>) are shown as black triangles. Here, we do not show the source for tyramine. We assume it could be from the VUM neuron, which has terminals in the cortex of every glomerulus, where ORN terminals overlap with PN and LN dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sinakevitch et al., 2013</xref>). (<bold>B–D</bold>) Increasing activation of AmTYR1 (pink triangles) progressively decreases release of ACh and lowers coactivation of LNs and PNs. Decreased coactivation reaches a threshold (<bold>D</bold>) below which it fails to modify the LN/PN synapse, although ACh release might still activate the glomeruli.

We expected that disruption of <italic>Amtyr1</italic> function would reduce or eliminate latent inhibition; that is, learning about a familiar odor (X) would rise to equal learning about the novel odor. Instead, the response to the novel odor was reduced to equal that to the familiar odor. <italic>This reduction was specific to familiarization treatment, so it is dependent on plasticity</italic>. It cannot be explained by nonspecific – for example toxic – effects of treatment, because the same treatments did not reduce to the same extent excitatory conditioning in the absence of familiarization to an odor. Moreover, the same effect was evident using two very different means for disruption of <italic>Amtyr1</italic> signaling.</p><p>We propose that <italic>Amtyr1</italic> modulates neural plasticity in the antennal lobes and mushroom bodies that reduces attention to a familiar odor. <italic>Amtyr1</italic> maintains coactivation of LNs and PNs in the antennal lobe at a set point between the extremes where it becomes too strong (e.g. when <italic>Amtyr1</italic> is disrupted) or too weak (<italic>Amtyr1</italic> strongly activated). Given that activation of <italic>Amtyr1</italic> reduces cAMP levels, it would be expected that its activation would reduce excitability of axon terminals. Hypothetically then, activation of <italic>Amtyr1</italic> could reduce excitatory drive of post-synaptic processes on PNs and LNs in, for example, the antennal lobes, and possibly between PN axons and intrinsic and GABAergic extrinsic neurons of the mushroom bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sinakevitch et al., 2017</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>A model of how <italic>Amtyr1</italic> could modulate inhibition in antennal lobe networks</title><p>We can now propose a model for how <italic>Amtyr1</italic> could act in the antennal lobes, and possibly also as an important component for regulating latent inhibition in distributed networks in the mushroom body. The model would have to explain why air (mechanosensory) stimulation alone does not reduce subsequent acquisition to odors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref>) as much as familiarization to an odor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B, C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B</xref>). Mechanosensory stimulation produces fast, transient responses in antennal lobe glomeruli, whereas odor stimulation produces more robust, longer lasting responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tuckman et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tuckman et al., 2021b</xref>). These differences in response could underlie the difference in response to air versus odor in our analyses, particularly in driving activity dependent plasticity at LN-to-PN synapses that we describe below.</p><p>We propose that the <italic>Amtyr1</italic>-based effects <italic>specific to odor familiarization</italic> occur by amplifying hebbian plasticity between PNs and LNs in the antennal lobe networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). A computational model of the honey bee antennal lobe previously identified hebbian plasticity at Local GABAergic Inhibitory Interneuron (LN) synapses onto PNs as the most likely locus of plasticity to give rise to the observed biasing of an odor mixture to be less like a familiar odor and more like a novel odor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Locatelli et al., 2013</xref>). If ORy in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> is not activated by an odor (X) that activates ORx, then, after familiarization to X, a novel odor that activates ORy would be better able to suppress X (via lateral inhibition) in a mixture because of strengthened LN-to-PNx synapses (see schematic in Figure 7 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Locatelli et al., 2013</xref>). A potentiated novel odor would strengthen this effect. Work with fruit flies also showed that hebbian plasticity at the same synapses underlies odor habituation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Das et al., 2011</xref>; the same process as latent inhibition just differently named).</p><p>We now use the same model framework (see schematic in Figure 7 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Locatelli et al., 2013</xref>) to propose how Amtyr1 could affect neural networks in the antennal lobe and mushroom bodies. In our new model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–E</xref>), as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Locatelli et al., 2013</xref>, coactivation of PNs and LNs via excitation from OR axon terminals would produce plasticity at the LN-to-PN synapses. Low activation of AmTYR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A, B</xref>) would lead to strong input from sensory axon terminals that would maximally activate LNs and PNs, thus leading to strong hebbian plasticity at LN-to-PN synapses. That is, it would lead to the strong inhibition of PNs in our manipulations that blocked or disrupted AmTYR1 signaling. Our model represents new now testable hypotheses. At moderate levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) we propose that this plasticity could give rise to normal latent inhibition in our high attention genetic lines just as it does in fruit flies. Strong activation of AmTYR1 would weaken the activity and reduce or prevent plasticity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), and hence lead to learning about both the novel and familiar odors (such as in our low attention genetic lines that do not show strong latent inhibition; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chandra et al., 2000</xref>). In this latter case, activation of the antennal lobe and mushroom bodies by odors might be too low to induce LTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>; all loci would be below red) but still high enough to support odor detection, discrimination, and learning.</p><p>Furthermore, combinatorial coding of odors with disruption of AmTYR1 signaling might cause generalization of latent inhibition to novel odors, as we have observed. Many of the monomolecular odorants that have been used to study olfaction and olfactory learning in honey bees have neural activity patterns that partially overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Paoli and Galizia, 2021</xref>), such as with the representations for hexanol and 2-octanone. For each odor, PNs in a few of the 160+ glomeruli of the antennal lobe are highly activated, and a subset of other PNs are activated to a lesser degree. Hypothetically at least, if the familiar odor activates some of the ORs from glomeruli that also code for the novel odor, which is likely, then coactivation of those PNs with lateral inhibition could cause hebbian plasticity at those synapses too. Under normal circumstances the excitation of those ORs might be too low to potentiate inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–E</xref>). But when AmTYR1 signaling is too low or disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A, B</xref>), ORN-driven coactivation of PNs and LNs would increase enough to drive the plasticity and reduce responses to novel odors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B, C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B,</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7E</xref>). In this case, the discriminability of familiar and novel odors could be reduced or eliminated by the Hebbian plasticity.</p><p>We have linked expression of latent inhibition to hebbian plasticity in synapses from inhibitory LNs to PNs in the antennal lobe. Although any behavioral phenomenon likely arises from distributed neural networks in the brain, we focused on the effect of familiarization in the antennal lobes because of our prior analyses of odor processing and latent inhibition there in the honey bee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Locatelli et al., 2013</xref>), and because of reports of latent inhibition in the same networks in the fruit fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Das et al., 2011</xref>). We do not specifically identify the type of LN represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, but we speculate that it would belong to the group of heteroLNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fonta et al., 1993</xref>), which receive excitatory inputs in one glomerulus and broadly transmit inhibition across glomeruli. Computational modeling suggests that the interglomerular connectivity of heteroLNs should be based on ‘functional networks’ defined by overlapping glomerular activity patterns to similar odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Linster et al., 2005</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> only represents a minimal part of the network that we feel is needed to convey a hypothetical modulation of hebbian plasticity. It will be useful to consider the broader network as represented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sinakevitch et al., 2017</xref> to more clearly understand how AmTYR1 functions in the antennal lobe, and how it may function in the calyces of the mushroom bodies as well.</p><p>We show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> that treatment with yohimbine to block AmTYR1 reduced responses to odor, which is consistent with increased excitation from ORN axon terminals driving inhibition, as represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. In fact, this reduction (in the antennal lobe and possibly the mushroom bodies) could be the reason for slightly lower acquisition in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> under dsRNA treatment. If true, the reduction in unit responsiveness did not completely block excitatory conditioning to odors or the expected potentiation after latent inhibition treatment.</p><p>We show the effect of odor familiarization on activity recorded from the antennal lobe as a potentiation of the response to a novel odor, which is consistent with our earlier report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lei et al., 2022</xref>). AmTYR1 block, when coupled to familiarization, decreased responses to the novel odor relative to the potentiation normally observed in controls. Although we show that block of potentiation after familiarization depends on activation state of AmTYR1, we do not, and at this point for lack of data we cannot, represent this mechanism in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. Potentiation could occur via an as yet unknown process intrinsic to the antennal lobe neural networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sinakevitch et al., 2017</xref>). Alternatively, it could occur via identified feedback pathways to the antennal lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kirschner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hu et al., 2010</xref>) from neural mechanisms in the mushroom bodies that are known to produce potentiation to novel stimuli in fruit flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hattori et al., 2017</xref>). Under normal circumstances AmTYR1 is functional and moderating the hebbian plasticity at LN-to-PN synapses at levels consistent with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C, D</xref>, where novel odors are learned well (likely aided by potentiation). Blocking or disrupting AmTYR1 puts the network in a state consistent with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, where responses to both types of odors are affected by hebbian plasticity at LN-to-PN synapses – including potentiated novel odors given the overlap in sensory representations.</p><p>It remains to be determined what the source for tyramine could be, and which of the local interneuron types might be the ones mediating latent inhibition in the antennal lobes. VUM neurons are an obvious possibility for the source of tyramine, since tyramine is a direct precursor to octopamine released by VUM neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Roeder, 2005</xref>). However, this hypothesis would depend on tyramine being released at almost constant, low levels without stimulation of VUM by taste receptors sensitive to sugars.</p><p>Finally, we have presented a heuristic, verbal model designed to summarize what we know about where <italic>Amtyr1</italic> is in the brain, how <italic>Amtyr1</italic> works by reducing cAMP levels, and how it could interact with established mechanisms of Hebbian plasticity between PNs and LNs that underlie latent inhibition. We feel it can predict the two natural behavioral phenotypes we find within honey bee colonies as well as the experimental results of disruption of Amtyr1 function. But this prediction lies on testable assumptions. For example, we assume that the level of LTP that develops will increase with increases in excitation gated by <italic>Amtyr1</italic>. How well our model works might also depend on a nonlinear thresholding function for coactivation that drives Hebbian plasticity (AmTYR1–LTP relationships and expected learning curves shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–E</xref>). These and other parameters will need to be investigated both experimentally and computationally to more fully evaluate how the model applies to antennal lobe and mushroom body function, and whether and under what conditions it will work.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Ideas and speculation: gain control and modulator ratios as modes of action</title><p>The modulatory role that we propose for <italic>Amtyr1</italic> could help to explain its broad pleiotropic effects on many different behaviors.

Cholinergic regulation of a disinhibitory circuit within the mouse visual cortex has been shown to regulate cortical gain control, plasticity, and learning. Understanding the dynamic mechanisms underlying network modulation across multiple model organisms may shed light on robust and similar circuit motifs for various behaviors.</p><p>We were initially drawn to <italic>Amtyr1</italic> because of its relationship potentially to the release of tyramine by identified VUM neurons, which have been implicated in excitatory conditioning through release of octopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Farooqui et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hammer, 1993</xref>). VUM neurons must make tyramine in the process of making octopamine, and they likely release both biogenic amines. In particular, the dynamic balance between octopamine and tyramine is important for regulating insect behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kononenko et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schützler et al., 2019</xref>). It is intriguing to now propose and eventually test whether a balance between octopamine and tyramine release from VUM neurons is critical for driving attention in one direction or another depending on association with reinforcing contexts. In this model, activation of VUM neurons would release octopamine to drive excitatory association between odor and reinforcement. At the same time, release of tyramine would suppress excitatory drive onto inhibition. Both processes could synergistically drive the association. Furthermore, if there is a low level of background tyramine release from VUM when unstimulated, it would explain why in the <italic>Amtyr1</italic> DsiRNA injected group in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> responded slightly lower than the Dsiscr control group.</p><p>Interestingly, we have identified a potential interaction in the ratio of tyramine to octopamine between foraging role (scouts vs recruits) and expression of latent inhibition. The lower tyramine-to-octopamine ratios in scouts would potentially activate this receptor even less that it would normally be, yielding stronger inhibition according to the model described above. Further analyses are needed to test this prediction in more detail and evaluate its role in the foraging ecology of honey bees.</p><p>Finally, why do individuals in colonies under quasi-natural conditions differ in expression of latent inhibition, and presumably in the functioning of <italic>Amtyr1</italic>? We have used this naturally occurring and selectable genetic variation to establish colonies composed of different mixtures of genotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cook et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Smith and Cook, 2020</xref>). The mixture of genotypes in the colony affects whether and how quickly colonies discover new resources via an attention-like process operant in individual foragers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Smith and Cook, 2020</xref>). We have therefore proposed that genetic variation leading to colony level variation in <italic>Amtyr1</italic> expression represents a balance between exploration for and exploitation of resources.

The first phase involved selection of drones or queens that could successfully learn to associate an odor with sucrose reinforcement, which established that the honey bees were motivated to learn. This initial excitatory conditioning does not affect generation or expression of latent inhibition. The second ’familiarization’ phase involved 40 unreinforced odor exposures for 4 s each; this new odor (black box; X) was different and discriminable from the first odor. The third and final phase involved conditioning honey bees to the now familiar odor X associated with sucrose reinforcement in a way that normally produces robust associative conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bitterman et al., 1983</xref>). Strong latent inhibition should slow the rate of learning to X. Drones and queens that exhibited this ‘inhibitor’ phenotype (defined as zero or one response to X over six conditioning trials) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chandra et al., 2000</xref>) were mated using standard instrumental insemination techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cobey et al., 2013</xref>) for honey bees to create a high (inhibitor) latent inhibition line.

Our previous studies have shown that worker progeny from inhibitor and noninhibitor matings showed significant correlation in expression of latent inhibition to their parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chandra et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferguson et al., 2001</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Recombinant drones</title><p>Male honey bees (drones) were produced from a cross between genetic lines selected for high and low expression of latent inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chandra et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Latshaw and Smith, 2005</xref>).

We chose a concentration of yohimbine that has been shown to be effective in our previous study of its effect on honey bee behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fussnecker et al., 2006</xref>). One μl of drug or saline alone was injected into the brain through the median ocellus using a Hamilton syringe (Hamilton; Reno, NV). Training began 15 min after injection, as this time has been shown to be effective in other drug studies using the same methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chandra et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mercer and Menzel, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Menzel et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>For DsiRNA studies, we used sequences and protocols developed previously for a study of <italic>Amtyr1</italic> receptor distribution in the brain, which in that study were used to show that the anti-<italic>Amtyr1</italic> antibodies specifically recognized the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sinakevitch et al., 2017</xref>). We used a Dsi RNA of the <italic>AmTyr1</italic> receptor (NCBI Reference Sequence: NM_001011594.1) to knockdown <italic>AmTyr1</italic> mRNA receptor in the brain. We used the mixture of three DsiAmTyr1 constructs designed by the tool in IDT technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sinakevitch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). As a control we used a scrambled (dsiScr) version of the <italic>Amtyr1</italic> sequence. A 138 nanoliter injection of a 100-µM mixture of dsiAmTyr1 or dsiScr (Nanoinject 2000) was made into the middle ocellus 18–20 hr before behavioral tests. All injections were done blind so that the investigator doing behavioral tests was not aware of the content of the injection. After the tests brains without optic lobes were dissected out and homogenized each in TRIzol (Invitrogen) (<italic>N</italic> = 27 for bees injected with dsiScr and <italic>N</italic> = 32 for bees injected with DsiAmTyr1). Then, the total mRNA from each injected brain was extracted separately using the manufacturer’s protocol for TRIzol method (Invitrogen). Contaminating genomic DNA was removed using DNA-free kit (Ambion, AM1906). RNA quantity and purity were evaluated using a NanoDrop (NanoDrop 2000). Expression of AmTyr1 was quantified using QuantiFAST SYBR Green RT-PCR kit (QIAGEN) on Applied Biosystem 7900 cycler (ASU DNA Facilities) with the protocol provided by the kit for a 384-well plate.

Spike waveforms were digitized with a RZ2 system at a sampling rate of 20 kHz (Tucker-Davis Technologies, Alachua, FL). After a stable recording was achieved, the honey bee preparation was first stimulated with two presentations of each of the following odors: 1-hexanol (Hex) and 2-octanone (Oct). The duration of each pulse was 4 s, and 2 min of recovering time were allowed between two pulses. During the preexposure phase, 40 pulses of Oct were delivered with inter-pulse interval of 60 s, after which 10-min recovery was given before testing. Upon completion of each experiment, extracellular spike waveforms are exported to Offline Sorter program (Plexon Inc, Dallas, TX) which classifies the similar waveforms into individual clusters (units) based on the relatedness of waveforms’ projection onto a 3D space derived from the first three principle components that capture the most variation of the original waveforms. To increase the discriminating power, the original waveforms are grouped in a tetrode configuration, matching the physical design of the recording probe, that is 16 recording sites are distributed in two shanks in a block design of 2 × 4. Each block is called a tetrode. Statistical separation of waveform clusters, representing individual neurons or units, is aided with visual inspection, all implemented in the Offline Sorter program. Once satisfied with the clustering results, the time stamps of waveforms are then exported to Neuroexplorer program (Plexon Inc, Dallas, TX) and Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA) for further analysis.</p><p>Yohimbine (Millipore-Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was diluted in saline (50 µM), which was perfused into the head capsule through a T-tube switch. Repeated stimulation with Oct started 15 min after perfusion; by then the slowing-down of spiking activities were often noticeable. Care was taken not to introduce any air bubble into the tubing when switching from the syringe containing saline to the syringe containing the yohimbine solution. The water level in the two syringes was intentionally kept the same in order to maintain a similar perfusing rate upon switching. The drug solution was kept flowing through the honey bee preparation until the end of protocol, which usually lasted for about 2 hr. No saline wash was attempted in this protocol due to the long time required for the recording sessions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Sequencing the <italic>Amtyr1</italic> region of the genome</title><p>We studied SNPs in full-genome sequences of eight <italic>A. mellifera</italic> workers (four high pollen hording and four low pollen hording).

The response variable is binomal (0,1). Trial is an ordered variable. We were most interested in testing the hypothesis that injection of yohimbine and dsiRNA before familiarization treatment would impact latent inhibition, so we focused on the interactions between trial, injection, injection time (before preexposure or before acquisition), and odor (novel or preexposed odor). To explore significant interactions further, we performed a tukey post hoc test using the package emmeans. All analyses were performed in R version 4.2.0 using RStudio version 2022.07.1.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Supervision, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Software, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology, Supervision, Validation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-83348-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All genomic, behavioral, electrophysiological and hplc data are available via Dryad.</p><p>The following datasets were generated:</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2023">2023</year><data-title>Tyramine and its AmTYR1 receptor modulate attention in honey bees (<italic>Apis mellifera</italic>)</data-title><source>Dryad Digital Repository</source><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.5061/dryad.gqnk98svb</pub-id></element-citation></p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gadau</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Mustard</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name><name><surname>Sinakewitch</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Cook</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Lei</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2023">2023</year><data-title>A tyramine receptor (<italic>Amtyr1</italic>) modulates attention in honey bees (<italic>Apis mellifera</italic>): A neural model for behavioral pleiotropy - Amtyr1-SNP genotypes</data-title><source>Dryad Digital Repository</source><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.5061/dryad.prr4xgxsg</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>National Institutes of Health NIGMS (R01GM113967), Brian H Smith.

The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Alison Mercer (Reviewer #1); Wolfgang Blenau (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision letter to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All reviewers recognize the importance of the findings reported in the manuscript. Some concerns were raised about the interpretation of behavioral and physiological results exclusively through the lens of latent inhibition. It is possible that tyramine controls lateral inhibition in the antennal lobe without necessarily producing latent inhibition. Stating that a disruption of AmTyr1 increases the expression of latent inhibition without affecting appetitive learning (see abstract) does not appear to be fully supported by existing data. The fact that treatment with yohimbine produces a near &quot;anti-bias&quot; against the novelty odor (Figure 5D) highlights the complexity of the underlying regulatory mechanisms. Even if no link can be demonstrated between the function of AmTyr1 and latent inhibition, the results of the manuscript would remain very impactful due to the insight they provide into the potential function of AmTyr1 in the antennal lobe. It is nonetheless essential to address this shortcoming of the manuscript prior to publication.</p><p>Two alternatives are envisioned. First, the authors could provide additional experimental evidence supporting the specificity of the effects of AmTyr1 on latent inhibition with limited impact on appetitive learning. This could be achieved, for instance, by testing the effects of yohimbine on a differential conditioning paradigm to evaluate the ability of bees to discriminate between odors upon loss of function of AmTyr1. This experiment is just a suggestion. Other experiments might address this point equally well (or better). The reviewers fully appreciate the amount of work behind the present version of the manuscript. The authors are not expected to add a large body of new experimental data as long as they strengthen their conclusions related to latent inhibition. In the second alternative, the authors could modify their manuscript to acknowledge that the AmTyr1 pathway might regulate lateral inhibition without necessarily affecting latent inhibition. As part of this revision, it would be useful to present a model outlining potential roles for AmTyr1 based on the data presented in this manuscript and elsewhere.</p><p>In their revised manuscript, the authors are asked to address the comments of the reviewers about the statistics. They should also correct the color legend of Figure 3.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>General comments: It may be helpful to view these results through the lens of lateral inhibition rather than latent inhibition. Please be clear also about how you interpret the results of your statistical analyses.</p><p>P3, L54: reduced? – Figure 1C suggests subsequent learning is delayed rather than reduced.</p><p>P5,105: reflex? – PE response.</p><p>P6: Is AmTYR1 the only tyramine receptor expressed in the honey bee brain?</p><p>Figure 3A: Use of the terms 'familiar' and 'novel' to refer to the two odours tested here is confusing. It would help to clarify on the figure also, that familiarization here is to air, not odour.</p><p>P8, L171-2, 179: The legend of Figure 3 suggests saline-treated bees are represented in blue and yohimbine-treated in orange. The opposite is suggested by the key in the figures.</p><p>P8, L180: 'familiarized to odor each of the two…… was familiarized..' – sentence?</p><p>P9, L190: If the time of year may be important, please specify.</p><p>P9, L195: Please explain the rationale here. How do puffs of air impact olfactory information processing in the antennal lobe? For example, do they engage in inhibitory networks?</p><p>Figure 3A: If yohimbine is injected immediately prior to conditioning, is there any change in the level of responses to odours? This seems important to test because in Figure 3B yohimbine treatment reduces levels of conditioned responses, whereas in Figure 3C learning in yohimbine-treated animals appears to be completely blocked.</p><p>P9, L212: &quot;Injection of yohimbine eliminated the difference in responses to the novel and familiar odors&quot; – yes, but it did so by reducing the responses to the novel odour. Given the variability in levels of responses in controls, it is difficult to determine whether what we see in Figure 3B, C is latent inhibition, or not. In 3B, for example, the acquisition rate of the familiar odour seems to be similar to that of the novel odour. In Figure 3C, there are too few trials to judge. Figure 1B suggests more than 4 trials may be required to show latent inhibition (as opposed to general inhibition) clearly (e.g. compare Figure 3BC; Figure 4B).</p><p>P10, L215-218: &quot;This pattern could not arise from blockade of excitatory learning about N [the novel] odor because excitatory learning was unaffected in the air preexposure controls&quot;. Is it not more likely that puffs of air do not engage inhibitory circuits in the AL in the same way as puffs of odour?</p><p>P10, L219: what evidence suggests blockade of AmTYR1 &quot;increases latent inhibition&quot;? It seems more likely that lateral inhibition is increased and affects all odours.</p><p>P10, L222-224 Treatments in this study were given before or after odour familiarization (i.e. prior to acquisition only). Farooqui et al. (2003) examined the effects of treatments given either, prior to acquisition or prior to memory recall. As results presented in Figure 3C (and 4B) suggest blockade of TYR1 inhibits learning of novel as well as familiarized odours, it seems important to provide or refer to evidence showing that OA signalling is not disrupted, either by yohimbine, or by AmTYR1 dsiRNA injection.</p><p>P11, L238: The title of Figure 4 is misleading. Neither latent inhibition nor learning is apparent in bees treated with Amtyr1 dsiRNA. Do you mean increased lateral inhibition?</p><p>P11, L243-4: A significant effect of injection (treatment) is reported (&lt;0.01). Doesn't this indicate a significant difference overall between response levels in control bees versus bees in which AmTYR1 is knocked down? This would seem consistent with an overall increase in lateral inhibition.</p><p>P11, L252: &quot;...a slight decrement in response rate….(p&lt;&lt;0.01….). – slight?</p><p>P11, L261: Why was it predicted that disruption of AmTYR1 would attenuate latent inhibition?</p><p>P13, Figure 5 title: – what evidence is there here of latent inhibition? Presentation of results described in Figure 5 earlier might help clarify at the outset the magnitude and global nature of the changes induced by compromising the AmTYR1 function. This seems consistent also with increased lateral inhibition, rather than increased latent inhibition.</p><p>The results are fascinating. They suggest to me that tyramine is released tonically in the AL providing an essential brake on lateral inhibition.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Line 70ff &quot;… a major locus … maps to a location in the honey bee genome…&quot;: I wonder if reference 21 is the correct reference at this point. Scheiner et al. did not carry out a mapping study but found a splice variant of the AmTYR1 receptor. Perhaps reference 24 (Page et al., 2000) would be more appropriate here?</p><p>Lines 124-139: This short half-page within the Results section does not refer to the results of the present study but essentially summarizes existing knowledge on the AmTYR1 receptor and VUM neurons in honey bees and other insects. The authors should consider presenting this information in the introduction.</p><p>Lines 147/147 &quot;… the tyramine receptor antagonist yohimbine …&quot;: Although widely used in insect studies as a tyramine receptor antagonist, the specificity of yohimbine is not absolute. For example, yohimbine is also a high-affinity antagonist of the recently described honey bee α2-adrenergic-like octopamine receptor (reference 31). Yohimbine also has an antagonistic effect on the second tyramine receptor of the honey bee (Reim et al., 2017). From my point of view, this underlines the importance of the use of an alternative approach (DsiAmTyr1 treatment) by the authors. Unfortunately, no more specific antagonists are available either. Nevertheless, in my view, it would be best to point out this possible specificity issue.</p><p>Line 562ff &quot;…primers for quantitative real-time PCR …&quot;: Can the authors please justify the choice of actin as the reference gene for qPCR? How has the stability of expression of the reference gene been checked?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>All of my suggestions would be outside the scope of the paper.</p><p>I would enjoy seeing profiling of classical hPTMs associated with enhancer and regulatory sites (k27ac, K4m1, K4m3) via ChIP-seq, as well as associated RNA-seq analyses between the different lines or individuals showing variation in latent inhibition, in order to better understand the molecular components of this not directly relevant to the locus; however, this is a 'tall ask' for such a well-done paper.</p><p>The statistics were simple because this was appropriate.</p><p>For honeybee, the samples were well assessed, validated via dsiRNA and pharmacological methods, and interpretations were appropriately leveraged in light of the data.</p><p>I got nothing bar a bunch of genomics that aren't necessary…</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Tyramine and its AmTYR1 receptor modulate attention in honey bees (<italic>Apis mellifera</italic>)&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Christian Rutz (Senior Editor) and Matthieu Louis (Reviewing Editor).</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed. Two of the initial three reviewers carefully went through the changes you implemented; the third reviewer was not available anymore. While we remain convinced that the results presented in this manuscript are fundamentally important, we also believe that the interpretation of your experimental data ought to be open to alternative explanations. The main problem is that the conclusions of the work rely on the use of indirect measures of latent inhibition. Presently, the electrophysiology results presented in Figure 5 fall short of unambiguously supporting latent inhibition. It is also difficult to apply the model proposed in Figure 7 to explain the results of Figure 5 (there is a concern about the fact that the original model of Ramaswami and colleagues has been partly distorted). Overall, the conceptual model of Figure 7 appears to bring more confusion than clarifications. These issues should be addressed prior to the publication of the work. We invite you to revise the manuscript along the lines suggested by the two reviewers -- please see their individual reports below.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that reaching a mechanistic understanding of the function of AmTYR1 in the antennal lobe would be beyond the reach of a single study. Given the limitations of the experimental data presented in the manuscript, we ask that you acknowledge the possibility of explanations different from pure latent inhibition in your discussion of the results. Moreover, we recommend the addition of a reciprocal treatment to complete the electrophysiology inspection of Figure 5 (see comments of Reviewer #2). This addition offers an experimentally testable prediction that can be made based on the latent-inhibition model that you are proposing.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The authors conclude that disruption of Amtyr1 signaling increases the expression of latent inhibition but has little effect on appetitive conditioning (Abstract L29), but neither conclusion is clearly supported by the results presented in Figures3 and 4. Disruption of AmTYR1 reduced response levels (including responses to the novel odor) severely. As a result, latent inhibition could not be evaluated.</p><p>2. Previous work from the Smith lab revealed that local neurons (LNs) in the antennal lobes of the bee express octopamine receptors. This elegant work led to their proposal that octopamine inhibits inhibitory LNs in the glomerular core (leading to disinhibition of PNs) and simultaneously blocks excitation in neighboring glomeruli. It seems likely this could interfere with the generation and resilience of latent inhibition. In the experiments outlined here, appetitive learning performance is used to provide an indirect measure of latent inhibition induced by odor familiarization, but one difficulty in using this approach is that stimulation of the antennae with sucrose activates the VUMmx1 neuron (Hammer 1993), which will increase octopamine levels in the antennal lobes. The effects of sensitization and appetitive conditioning are therefore superimposed on effects induced by familiarization. What do the authors predict the outcome of this would be?</p><p>3. The model provided in Figure 7 does not seem to represent well the results of the electrophysiological analysis in this study (Figure 5). Disruption of AmTYR1 signalling (in the absence of odor familiarization) caused a dramatic decline in responses to odorants (Figure 5A,B), and rather than promoting latent inhibition, yohimbine treatment decreased odor response biases, and blocked the ability to enhance existing odor biases using familiarization (Figure 5C,D). The model presented in Figure 7, however, predicts that latent inhibition should be strongest when AmTYR1 function is blocked (Figure 7B). Doesn't this suggest something other than latent inhibition might be responsible for the global inhibition observed?</p><p>4. The authors suggest that Hebbian plasticity underlying latent inhibition is responsible for observed declines in odor responses (L429-433). As a result of disruption of Amtyr1 signaling, Hebbian plasticity, they argue, could induce a signal strong enough to produce inhibition to odors other than the familiar odor. This is interesting, but the model presented in Figure 7 is confusing and tells us little about how this might occur. The schematic suggests NMDA-receptor signaling in glomerulus X (top) leads to NMDA receptor-signaling in glomerulus Y. However, in glomerulus Y there is likely to be relatively little ORN-mediated excitation of PNs (or LNs). Also, in the lower glomerulus (Y), the retrograde signal (green arrow) appears to go from LN to PN. How would this work?</p><p>5. The authors acknowledge clearly that their model is based on a model of habituation in the AL of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, proposed by Ramaswami and colleagues. However, the authors have made subtle changes to the schematic provided by Twick et al. (2014) that could lead to some confusion. For example, excitatory inputs from ORNs onto PNs and LNs are depicted in the fly model as being distant from the NMDA receptor-mediated signalling proposed to underpin habituation. These synapses appear adjacent to the shaded area, which I assume represents the glomerular core. In the schematic presented in Figure 7, these synapses lie within the shaded area, which I assume now represents the glomerulus as a whole (core plus outer cortex). These differences may seem minor, but they could be misleading.</p><p>6. To help explain why AmTYR1 dysfunction gives rise to a global decline in odor responses, it would be helpful to provide a summary of neural networks in the AL of the bee. An excellent schematic presented by Smith and colleagues in an earlier publication (Sinakovitch et al. 2017) would be extremely helpful here. I believe the Sinakovitch model would make it much easier to discuss the results of this study, and their relationship with the fly habituation model.</p><p>7. At present, the authors do not comment at all on the unique roles of various subpopulations of LN in the bee or their functional properties. This omission seems odd given the central role LNs play in latent inhibition. Consideration of the functional properties of LNs also suggests alternative explanations for the general decline in odor responses observed in this study -- for example, the potential involvement of homogeneous LNs. Activation of these neurons, which have widefield arborizations throughout the AL, would be predicted to induce lateral inhibition that could potentially provide gain control. This seems highly relevant here, because it would help prevent saturation from the strong inputs generated as a result of compromised Amtyr1 function. I strongly recommend the papers from Rachel Wilson's group on this topic (e.g., Olsen et al. 2010).</p><p>In summary, I feel the bulk of the evidence presented in this paper points to an alternative explanation for the dramatic reduction in responses to odors induced by Amtyr1 knockdown. The results could potentially be a consequence of Amtyr1 knockdown inducing large responses that cause saturation in the network. In the absence of familiarization this can be controlled by lateral inhibition, but the process of familiarization, rather than leading to latent inhibition, causes further saturation and as a result, destabilization, which causes profound inhibition of the neural network.</p><p>I hope the comments above will be helpful, as intended.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In the revised version of their manuscript, the authors have responded to many of the reviewers' comments. In particular, they modified the discussion of the data significantly. They introduced a new Figure 7 in order to make it easier for the reader to understand the complex model of the effects of AmTYR1 activation in the antennal lobe. However, I do not find the model very understandable, and, in particular, the results of the electrophysiological recordings shown in Figure 5 are not sufficiently addressed in this model. In an attempt to understand these relations better, I again looked closely at Figure 5C+D of the manuscript. The question I asked myself was what the outcome of a reciprocal experiment would be: How does the number of units (neurons) that are more responsive to octanone change when familiarization is done with octanone instead of hexanol? A drop from 39% to a smaller number would likely be expected. Is that true? In this case, what is the influence of yohimbine injection? If yohimbine prevents the latent inhibition effect, yohimbine injection should prevent a decrease in the number (below 39%) or possibly even cause the number of responding neurons to rise (above 39%). Can this be shown experimentally? Alternatively, does yohimbine lead to a decrease in the number of octanone-biased neurons also in this constellation? This would argue for yohimbine causing a general decrease in the response to odorants. Can these assumptions or the results of the corresponding experiment be reconciled with the model shown in Figure 7? What would the model imply in this case? I hope the authors find my above suggestion constructive and I look forward to their response.</p><p>Line 482 &quot;this plasticity it would give rise to&quot;: Delete &quot;it&quot;.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83348.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All reviewers recognize the importance of the findings reported in the manuscript.

The now extensive modification, esp of the discussion, is highlighted in blue text in the revision and is summarized in a model presented in a new figure 7 in the Discussion. We chose not to use the first option. As we now review in the new paragraph two in the Discussion section, Amtyr1 has been shown to be involved in several different behaviors and physiological process in addition to latent inhibition. A new experiment, e.g. differential conditioning, might just add to this now lengthy list without providing more resolution as to how this gene is acting. We feel we have highlighted this issue now much better than before as a result of this reviewer’s comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In their revised manuscript, the authors are asked to address the comments of the reviewers about the statistics.

In sum, and as we now extensively elaborate on in the Discussion, we feel that part of the mechanism for latent inhibition is through its effect on Hebbian plasticity that modifies both feed-forward and lateral inhibition. In other words, latent inhibition and lateral/feed-forward inhibition is intertwined such that one cannot be discussed without the other.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>P3, L54: reduced? – Figure 1C suggests subsequent learning is delayed rather than reduced.</p></disp-quote><p>This is in the introduction in reference to reduction of learning. This reviewer refers to patterns in Figure 1C that appears to show a delay as learning about the familiar odor in ‘Inhibitor’ drones at one end of the curve (blue) shown in Figure 1B lags behind learning about the familiar odor in ‘Noninhibitor’ (green) drones at the right of the distribution in Figure 1B. I would not dispute that learning in ‘inhibitor’ bees will ultimately reach levels of asymptotic responding in noninhibitor bees. But to me ‘reduced’ in the use here refers to any tendency for inhibitor bees to respond less than noninhibitor bees in rate of acquisition and/or in asymptotic levels of responding. And in fact sometimes we see slightly different patterns of responses to novel and familiar odors. That is evident in Figures3 and 4. But in all cases responding to the familiar odor is less than that to the novel odor. The differences in responses across experiments that are well separated in time could arise because of epigenetic modification of Amtyr1 action. That modification is something we will investigate, and will soon report on some of the first experiments in a subsequent manuscript currently in preparation. In the meantime, in an attempt to convey these subtle differences across experiments, I have modified the text on page 3 line 55 to read ‘…delayed or reduced…’. Also, just above that point in the text we refer to learning being ‘…delayed or slower…’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>P5,105: reflex? – PE response.</p></disp-quote><p>Fixed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>P6: Is AmTYR1 the only tyramine receptor expressed in the honey bee brain?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, there is one other tyramine receptor identified to date – <italic>Amtyr2</italic> (Reim et al. 2017.

It is possible that there is some reduction in responsiveness either to yohimbine and/or to the injection itself directly prior to conditioning. We thought it important to show with the experiment in 3C that injection timing was not critical to the qualitative results shown in 3B – that is that yohimbine led to an overall reduction in responsiveness and to no difference in responding to Novel and Familiar odors. In the end, the experiment should in 3C is not critical and can be deleted, in particular because we do not have comparable data in Figure 4 for reasons cited in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>P9, L212: &quot;Injection of yohimbine eliminated the difference in responses to the novel and familiar odors&quot; – yes, but it did so by reducing the responses to the novel odour. Given the variability in levels of responses in controls, it is difficult to determine whether what we see in Figure 3B, C is latent inhibition, or not. In 3B, for example, the acquisition rate of the familiar odour seems to be similar to that of the novel odour. In Figure 3C, there are too few trials to judge. Figure 1B suggests more than 4 trials may be required to show latent inhibition (as opposed to general inhibition) clearly (e.g. compare Figure 3BC; Figure 4B).</p></disp-quote><p>As with all PER studies, there is variability from experiment-to-experiment in how well any form of learning is expressed. In our studies, every experiment in this and other publications (cited in the manuscript) show lower responsiveness to the familiar odor than to the novel. Sometimes this shows up in initial responses, rate of acquisition or asymptotic responses. There is also visual component in addition to the odor specific component, which means the behavior is far more complicated than it looks. In fact, as we review here, much individual variability arises from genetic differences that, as we have shown elsewhere, are important for colony fitness. So some individual bees, and bees from lines selected for low latent inhibition, don’t show the behavior at all.</p><p>Here we selected a mix of bees, some of which would show strong latent inhibition and some weak or not at all. We did that, as we describe in the manuscript, so that latent inhibition could be increased or decreased from that mixed baseline of bees. But that means that as we select a small sample from that mixed baseline – ~20-25 bees – that we will sometimes get groups somewhat biased toward showing it or not. That is certainly one of the reasons why there is variation from experiment to experiment. But this variation does not undermine the basic fact that response levels to familiar odors is lower than to novel, one way or another.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>P10, L215-218: &quot;This pattern could not arise from blockade of excitatory learning about N [the novel] odor because excitatory learning was unaffected in the air preexposure controls&quot;.

We now describe in detail in the model presented in the new figure 7 that odor itself is much more salient and that it triggers more and different activity in the antennal lobe. All of this is discussed in the now heavily rewritten discussion. As noted in the manuscript, as well as in the responses in this document, lateral (and feedforward) inhibition is likely an important physiological mechanism that underlies latent inhibition to odor. But odor is clearly the more salient stimulus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>P10, L219: what evidence suggests blockade of AmTYR1 &quot;increases latent inhibition&quot;? It seems more likely that lateral inhibition is increased and affects all odours.</p></disp-quote><p>The evidence, it seems to us, is that the increase in inhibition is specific to odor ‘familiarization’. That pre-exposure to odor induces behavioral latent inhibition – poor learning of the familiar odor and significantly better learning of the novel odor. The effect of tyramine disruption is then specific to treatments that have odor presentation during the familiarization phase.</p><p>If tyramine blockade just increased lateral inhibition, then why is it not present to the same degree after air familiarization as it is when odor is preexposed in the familiarization phase? It seems clear that there is some effect of habituation to odor – the most salient part of the stimulus delivery – that is modulated by tyramine. Note that there is a slight effect of air in Figure 4A, which we discuss at the end of the discussion. But it is quantitatively and qualitatively different for when odor is preexposed.</p><p>We now present in Figure 7 a model that encompasses the relationship between inhibitory processes in the antennal lobe, which may also cover other areas of the brain, and the generation of odor-driven latent inhibition.</p><p>This is not to say that we have solved all the outstanding questions. There are still many issues to work out in much more detail. But we feel that our contribution at least reveals a very interesting and novel problem that needs much more attention.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>P10, L222-224 Treatments in this study were given before or after odour familiarization (i.e. prior to acquisition only). Farooqui et al. (2003) examined the effects of treatments given either, prior to acquisition or prior to memory recall. As results presented in Figure 3C (and 4B) suggest blockade of TYR1 inhibits learning of novel as well as familiarized odours, it seems important to provide or refer to evidence showing that OA signalling is not disrupted, either by yohimbine, or by AmTYR1 dsiRNA injection.</p></disp-quote><p>Our treatments are also prior to acquisition and prior to recall, as in Farooqui et al. But keep in mind that the acquisition for latent inhibition is the odor familiarization phase, when odor is presented without reinforcement. The phase in which odors are reinforced is the test phase.</p><p>It is likely that yohimbine affects octopamine receptors. But it is much less likely that dsRNA would do that. And if it did, overall learning would be reduced – à la Farooqui et al. – even after air preexposure, and it would not be specific to a familiar odor. Moreover, there are no octopamine receptors within the confidence limits of the locus that came up twice in the genetic studies.</p><p>But, given the complexities of the neural circuitry, it may well be that other receptors are involved. So, while we can conclude that Amtyr1 is involved in latent inhibition via its effect through lateral inhibition, we cannot rule out the possible roles of other receptors. To work out first what those receptors are, and then experimentally manipulate them, goes well beyond what can be addressed in a single publication.

Two of the initial three reviewers carefully went through the changes you implemented; the third reviewer was not available anymore. While we remain convinced that the results presented in this manuscript are fundamentally important, we also believe that the interpretation of your experimental data ought to be open to alternative explanations. The main problem is that the conclusions of the work rely on the use of indirect measures of latent inhibition. Presently, the electrophysiology results presented in Figure 5 fall short of unambiguously supporting latent inhibition. It is also difficult to apply the model proposed in Figure 7 to explain the results of Figure 5 (there is a concern about the fact that the original model of Ramaswami and colleagues has been partly distorted). Overall, the conceptual model of Figure 7 appears to bring more confusion than clarifications. These issues should be addressed prior to the publication of the work.

He convinced me it would be good to revise the introduction to set readers up for a story that is very different from what one expects. I have added the last paragraph to the introduction in an effort to describe what the ‘counterintuitive’ outcome of the story will be.

The authors conclude that disruption of Amtyr1 signaling increases the expression of latent inhibition but has little effect on appetitive conditioning (Abstract L29), but neither conclusion is clearly supported by the results presented in Figures3 and 4. Disruption of AmTYR1 reduced response levels (including responses to the novel odor) severely. As a result, latent inhibition could not be evaluated.</p></disp-quote><p>There is a misunderstanding here, which stems from the claim that “Disruption of AmTYR1 reduced response levels (including responses to the novel odor) severely. As a result, latent inhibition could not be evaluated.” This statement is incorrect. We show that blockade (Figure 3A) or disruption (Figure 4A) of amtyr1 has no or only slight effects on excitatory conditioning. But the same treatment that produces behavioral latent inhibition – odor familiarization – in control animals (saline or scrambled dsRNA injected animals) produces a profound reduction in odor responsiveness in treatment animals (yohimbine or dsRNA groups). The reduction is specific to the familiarization treatment that produces latent inhibition (in Figure 3B,C but not 3A, and in Figure 4B but not 4A). This indicates that amtyr1 could be affecting a neural mechanism that somehow modulates latent inhibition.</p><p>What we have done is a standard protocol for studying the effects of any gene on a behavior. One disrupts the gene (or its product) and shows that the behavior is disrupted. Therefore, it does not seem reasonable to us to conclude that amtyr1’s role in latent inhibition could not be evaluated because, when it is disrupted, animals no longer show latent inhibition.</p><p>The question is how this disruption occurs. Part of the misunderstanding is that latent inhibition is disrupted in an unexpected and counterintuitive way, which in fact we did not anticipate when we ran the experiments (and which is described in the Discussion in paragraph starting around line 443). As noted, normally one establishes a behavior and then tries to disrupt a neural pathway that is associated with the behavior. In this case, we anticipated that upon disruption of amtyr1 the response to the familiar odor would rise to equal response to the novel odor, which would remain unaffected.</p><p>But that did not happen either with pharmacological or dsRNA treatments. Instead, blockade or disruption of amtyr1 drags down the response to the novel odor to be equal to that for the familiar odor. For that reason we do not reach the conclusion that amtyr1 produces latent inhibition<italic>.</italic> But amtyr1 clearly affects expression of latent inhibition.</p><p>We try to be clear throughout the manuscript (and in the title) that it <italic>modulates</italic> expression of latent inhibition, and we ultimately argue that it does so by <italic>indirectly</italic> modifying Hebbian plasticity in inhibitory networks. (This mechanism is not unlike what this reviewer describes). Indeed in figure 7 we show based on our published data (Sinakevitch et al. 2017) that amtyr1 is operating at synapses separate from, and upstream of, the synapses that we and Ramaswami et al. have proposed for Hebbian-plasticity dependent latent inhibition.</p><p>The sentence this reviewer refers to in the abstract is: “…We then show that disruption of <italic>Amtyr1</italic> signaling either pharmacologically or through RNAi increases expression of latent inhibition but has little effect on appetitive conditioning, and these results suggest that AmTYR1 modulates inhibitory processing in the CNS.” The highlighted text now reads: “…qualitatively changes expression of latent inhibition…”. But note that even in the original version we write that it changes <italic>expression</italic> of latent inhibition, not that it disrupts latent inhibition. We also write in that sentence that it modulates inhibitory processing.</p><p>In addition, in the first revision we added the second paragraph in the Discussion in which we explicitly write “…it [amtyr1] is not a latent inhibition gene’ (Lines 385-394). Importantly, our interpretation of the effect of amtyr1 – that it is modulating sensory inputs – can potentially explain the broader pleiotropic effects that have been documented for amtyr1. This point is made in the Discussion.</p><p>Admittedly, some of the confusion may stem from the way we described the behavior in prior versions of this manuscript, some of which made it into these later versions. But our thinking has evolved, in part as a result of these very thorough reviews. We have now made new changes throughout the manuscript to hopefully remove any ambiguity in regard to this issue. It needs to be clear that the modulation by amtyr1 – at afferent axon terminals in the antennal lobe and mushroom body – is separate from the familiarization-induced mechanism for latent inhibition at LN-to-PN or PN-to-MB terminals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Previous work from the Smith lab revealed that local neurons (LNs) in the antennal lobes of the bee express octopamine receptors. This elegant work led to their proposal that octopamine inhibits inhibitory LNs in the glomerular core (leading to disinhibition of PNs) and simultaneously blocks excitation in neighboring glomeruli. It seems likely this could interfere with the generation and resilience of latent inhibition. In the experiments outlined here, appetitive learning performance is used to provide an indirect measure of latent inhibition induced by odor familiarization, but one difficulty in using this approach is that stimulation of the antennae with sucrose activates the VUMmx1 neuron (Hammer 1993), which will increase octopamine levels in the antennal lobes. The effects of sensitization and appetitive conditioning are therefore superimposed on effects induced by familiarization. What do the authors predict the outcome of this would be?</p></disp-quote><p>The measure we use for Latent Inhibition – retardation of acquisition – is the standard <italic>direct</italic> behavioral measure for latent inhibition (see refs 4 and 5 by Lubow). Unreinforced presentation of any CS sets up non associative plasticity, the memory of which interferes with the mechanisms that produce and/or express excitatory conditioning, as this reviewer’s comment suggests for octopamine. To rephrase this reviewer’s comment, latent inhibition likely interferes with the generation and resilience of excitatory conditioning, which is the basic mechanism of latent inhibition implied by retardation of acquisition. We have shown retardation of acquisition in detail in Chandra et al. (cited ref #6), including failure of summation, which is the other direct measure of latent inhibition.</p><p>In fact, in an earlier publication my colleagues and I provided a framework for how this interaction could take place.

The model provided in Figure 7 does not seem to represent well the results of the electrophysiological analysis in this study (Figure 5). Disruption of AmTYR1 signalling (in the absence of odor familiarization) caused a dramatic decline in responses to odorants (Figure 5A,B), and rather than promoting latent inhibition, yohimbine treatment decreased odor response biases, and blocked the ability to enhance existing odor biases using familiarization (Figure 5C,D). The model presented in Figure 7, however, predicts that latent inhibition should be strongest when AmTYR1 function is blocked (Figure 7B). Doesn't this suggest something other than latent inhibition might be responsible for the global inhibition observed?</p></disp-quote><p>The short answer to the question at the end is ‘no’. First, potentiation of the response to the novel odor after familiarization occurs via a mechanism we do not, and at this point for lack of data we cannot, represent in Figure 7. That potentiation could occur via a so far unknown mechanism intrinsic to the antennal lobe neural networks, or, perhaps more likely, it could occur via feedback from mechanisms in the mushroom bodies that are known to produce potentiation to novel stimuli (new ref #67). We only show in Figure 5 that expression of it depends on amtyr1 function.</p><p>Under normal circumstances amtyr1 is functional and moderating the Hebbian plasticity at LN-to-PN synapses at levels consistent with Figures7C or 7D, where novel odors are learned well (likely aided by potentiation). Blocking or disrupting amtyr1 puts the network in a state consistent with 7B, where responses to all odors are affected by very strong Hebbian plasticity at LN-to-PN synapses – including ‘potentiated’ novel odors given the overlap in sensory representations (see the response to the next comment [#4]). It is clear in the behavioral data that acquisition to novel odors is blocked by familiarization to odor with amtyr1 disruption. And this blockade does not occur in the controls when just air was used with the same amtyr1 disruption, which shows that it is not simply augmentation of inhibition outside of familiarization treatment.</p><p>We try to clarify this now with blue text paraphrased from this response in the Discussion of the manuscript (lines 525-545).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors suggest that Hebbian plasticity underlying latent inhibition is responsible for observed declines in odor responses (L429-433). As a result of disruption of Amtyr1 signaling, Hebbian plasticity, they argue, could induce a signal strong enough to produce inhibition to odors other than the familiar odor. This is interesting, but the model presented in Figure 7 is confusing and tells us little about how this might occur. The schematic suggests NMDA-receptor signaling in glomerulus X (top) leads to NMDA receptor-signaling in glomerulus Y. However, in glomerulus Y there is likely to be relatively little ORN-mediated excitation of PNs (or LNs). Also, in the lower glomerulus (Y), the retrograde signal (green arrow) appears to go from LN to PN. How would this work?</p></disp-quote><p>First, the arrow in glomerulus Y was incorrect. It should be flipped, and is correctly represented in the new version of the manuscript. Now it shows the retrograde signal going from PNy to the LN. I apologize for that error.</p><p>What this reviewer writes above is incorrect: “…in glomerulus Y there is likely to be relatively little ORN-mediated excitation of PNs (or LNs).” As we describe in lines 494 to 506 of the Discussion, and as has been described in several publications including in Figure 1 (see Figure A C-8 secondary ketone vs C-6 primary alcohol) of the Paoli and Galizia (2021) review we cite, there is overlap in odor activity maps for most of the common monomolecular odors used in behavioral and physiological studies of olfaction in honey bees, including the two odors we use in this study. So, under blockade or disruption of amtyr1, which would increase sensory drive from ORN axon terminals, Hebbian plasticity could easily occur in the representation for the novel odor under conditions of amtyr1 disruption.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The authors acknowledge clearly that their model is based on a model of habituation in the AL of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, proposed by Ramaswami and colleagues. However, the authors have made subtle changes to the schematic provided by Twick et al. (2014) that could lead to some confusion. For example, excitatory inputs from ORNs onto PNs and LNs are depicted in the fly model as being distant from the NMDA receptor-mediated signalling proposed to underpin habituation. These synapses appear adjacent to the shaded area, which I assume represents the glomerular core. In the schematic presented in Figure 7, these synapses lie within the shaded area, which I assume now represents the glomerulus as a whole (core plus outer cortex). These differences may seem minor, but they could be misleading.</p></disp-quote><p>We attempted to adopt as faithfully as possible the figure from Twick et al. The change in the shaded area was not meant to imply anything about where the synapses were made (inside or outside of a glomerulus core or cortex). This has now been clarified in the legend for this figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. To help explain why AmTYR1 dysfunction gives rise to a global decline in odor responses, it would be helpful to provide a summary of neural networks in the AL of the bee. An excellent schematic presented by Smith and colleagues in an earlier publication (Sinakovitch et al. 2017) would be extremely helpful here. I believe the Sinakovitch model would make it much easier to discuss the results of this study, and their relationship with the fly habituation model.</p></disp-quote><p>See reply to point #7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. At present, the authors do not comment at all on the unique roles of various subpopulations of LN in the bee or their functional properties. This omission seems odd given the central role LNs play in latent inhibition. Consideration of the functional properties of LNs also suggests alternative explanations for the general decline in odor responses observed in this study -- for example, the potential involvement of homogeneous LNs. Activation of these neurons, which have widefield arborizations throughout the AL, would be predicted to induce lateral inhibition that could potentially provide gain control. This seems highly relevant here, because it would help prevent saturation from the strong inputs generated as a result of compromised Amtyr1 function. I strongly recommend the papers from Rachel Wilson's group on this topic (e.g., Olsen et al. 2010).</p></disp-quote><p>We present in Figure 7 a simplified, heuristic model aimed toward helping readers understand what we think is happening in the antennal lobe and possibly at PN axon synapses in the mushroom body. This model is not meant to represent the full complexity of neural networks at either level of processing. The sort of discussion to generate a full mechanistic understanding of what is happening with amtyr1 in both networks, involving all of the different cell types in either location, would require computational modeling to understand the complexity. That can and should be done, but it is beyond the scope of one publication.</p><p>Nevertheless, in response to this review we present some information along these lines. We feel that the most likely LNs represented in Figure 7 would be the heterogeneous LNs, as represented in a previous model of the antennal lobe published by my lab. We include a paragraph in the discussion on this topic (lines 507-524). In that paragraph we also reference a prior publication Sinakevitch et al. (2017) where we present a more detailed model of the antennal lobe circuitry including amtyr1 and amoa1, a receptor for octopamine thought to be involved in excitatory conditioning.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In summary, I feel the bulk of the evidence presented in this paper points to an alternative explanation for the dramatic reduction in responses to odors induced by Amtyr1 knockdown. The results could potentially be a consequence of Amtyr1 knockdown inducing large responses that cause saturation in the network. In the absence of familiarization this can be controlled by lateral inhibition, but the process of familiarization, rather than leading to latent inhibition, causes further saturation and as a result, destabilization, which causes profound inhibition of the neural network.</p></disp-quote><p>I have put new paragraphs in the manuscript to clarify our interpretations, which will require much more physiological-level analyses and computational modeling. These paragraphs include an elaboration of one already in the Discussion from the first revision on the likelihood that <italic>behavioral</italic> latent inhibition arises as a result of distributed neural mechanisms in at least the antennal lobes and mushroom bodies (see ref 67 and lines 401-417).</p><p>But the review here is forcing us to defend a position – i.e., that we can explain behavioral latent inhibition solely in neural networks of the antennal lobes – that is too premature and speculative, and is quite possibly wrong. Explaining behavior, after we treat the entire brain, by just focusing on the antennal lobes is too speculative. We have shown that Amtyr1 is expressed in both the antennal lobes and mushroom body on afferent axon terminals from ORNs and PNs. We actually discuss this issue in the third paragraph (lines 395-411) in the Discussion, which we added as a result of the previous review.</p><p>We are proposing a model, based on a request for one in the previous review, for encoding of a correlate of latent inhibition in the antennal lobes that makes sense based on our prior analyses and those of Ramaswami et al., and based on our behavioral and electrophysiological data in this manuscript. The correlation is defined as a neural effect that is produced by the same familiarization treatment that produces behavioral latent inhibition, and which is affected by blockade or disruption of amtyr1. We feel that what is happening in the antennal lobe contributes to the behavior, but it is likely functioning with at least a similar processing mechanism in the mushroom bodies. To go into too much detail about the neural networks of the antennal lobes at this point, beyond what we do to explain the neural mechanism as we see it, would distract from the broader point that this mechanism might be acting in the mushroom bodies too.</p><p>The electrophysiological experiments we report were also never meant to show that the antennal lobe is the “seat” or “locus” of behavioral latent inhibition in the brain. It was not even meant to argue that what happens in the antennal lobe is necessary and/or sufficient for generating behavioral latent inhibition. That, or specifically what roles antennal lobe mechanisms play in behavior, now remains to be determined.</p><p>We focus on the antennal lobes simply because we know where amtyr1 is in that circuitry, and we have shown in two previous publications that manifestations of latent inhibition can be seen in the antennal lobe with the recordings. Our intention in putting the electrophysiological data from the antennal lobes into the manuscript was simply to show that we can establish neural correlates of amtyr1 blockade that depend on the same odor familiarization treatment that generates behavioral latent inhibition. These data generate ideas that can be further investigated with more detailed experiments that are beyond the scope of this publication.</p><p>I could specifically reference the mechanism described in this summary comment from this reviewer, and hopefully the reviews will be published with the manuscript. But I have to admit I am not sure I understand what is being proposed here well enough to be comfortable putting it in our manuscript, or that it is even fundamentally different from the familiarization-based mechanism that we propose in Figure 7. For example, if familiarization causes “further saturation”, as this reviewer suggests, then by definition the familiarization treatment – plasticity produced by unreinforced odor exposure – is a <italic>correlate</italic> of latent inhibition as defined above. So I don’t understand the phrase “…rather than leading to latent inhibition…”. The effect this reviewer is describing depends on the treatment that produces latent inhibition.</p><p>In the end this reviewer may be suggesting something very similar to what we are suggesting – that there is a familiarization-dependent mechanism that affects neural inhibition and hence odor processing in the antennal lobe and, quite likely, mushroom bodies too. Maybe the main difference is that our model in Figure 7 is simplified and meant only as a heuristic to explain what is happening. This reviewer proposes something more specific to the actual neural machinery of the antennal lobe to accomplish the same familiarization-dependent process. But it may not be an independent, alternative interpretation. And it requires a computational model to elaborate on it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In the revised version of their manuscript, the authors have responded to many of the reviewers' comments. In particular, they modified the discussion of the data significantly. They introduced a new Figure 7 in order to make it easier for the reader to understand the complex model of the effects of AmTYR1 activation in the antennal lobe.</p><p>However, I do not find the model very understandable, and, in particular, the results of the electrophysiological recordings shown in Figure 5 are not sufficiently addressed in this model.</p></disp-quote><p>See responses to comments 3 and 4 for review #1. The discussion of the (now the correct figure) model has been greatly expanded in lines 501-539 of the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In an attempt to understand these relations better, I again looked closely at Figure 5C+D of the manuscript. The question I asked myself was what the outcome of a reciprocal experiment would be:</p><p>How does the number of units (neurons) that are more responsive to octanone change when familiarization is done with octanone instead of hexanol?</p></disp-quote><p>In previous study (ref 51 Lei et al.; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0265009), also cited in the manuscript and in the new section of the Discussion (lines 519-524), we showed that familiarization shifted antennal lobe units to respond more strongly to novel odor, regardless of which odor – 2-octanone or hexanol – was used as the novel odor. In other words, the odors were fully counterbalanced in that study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A drop from 39% to a smaller number would likely be expected. Is that true?</p></disp-quote><p>Not necessarily. The relative portions above and below the diagonal line depend on collective response biases across all recorded units.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In this case, what is the influence of yohimbine injection?</p></disp-quote><p>With latent inhibition intact, more units became biased towards the novel odor after familiarization. With latent inhibition disrupted by yohimbine, the novel odor biases disappeared. We now explain this effect, and its origins, more in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If yohimbine prevents the latent inhibition effect, yohimbine injection should prevent a decrease in the number (below 39%) or possibly even cause the number of responding neurons to rise (above 39%). Can this be shown experimentally?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, but it’s actually the opposite. Latent inhibition resulted in percentage increase (from 39% to 54%). Yohimbine caused the percentage to decrease (from 49% to 14%). Again, see new explanation in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Alternatively, does yohimbine lead to a decrease in the number of octanone-biased neurons also in this constellation?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes. In this experiment, octanone was a novel odor. Yohimbine caused a decrease of number of units responding to octanone after familiarization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This would argue for yohimbine causing a general decrease in the response to odorants.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, yohimbine caused a general decrease in response to odorants. As we now explain in the discussion, that is consistent with an expected increase in excitation from ORN axons onto inhibitory interneurons, as shown in Figure 7. However, for either odorant (as in Lei et al. ref 51) one can still identify units that have response biases toward one or the other odor. In the current experiment (Figure 5D), 49% of units showed stronger response to octanone as the novel odor even in the presence of yohimbine. After familiarization under yohimbine treatment, response bias did not increase as it normally would. Instead it decreased such that only 14% of units remained more responsive to octanone. In other words, familiarization normally causes more units to respond to novel odor, but that was disrupted by yohimbine.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can these assumptions or the results of the corresponding experiment be reconciled with the model shown in Figure 7? What would the model imply in this case?</p></disp-quote><p>Biases toward one or the other odor prior to familiarization are consistent with many other studies of units in the antennal lobes of many insects. And these biases occur even after yohimbine treatment, which causes a general decline in unit responsiveness. But the increase in response to the novel odor after familiarization is blocked, and even reversed, by yohimbine.</p><p>There are many open questions that we can speculate on, but it would be better done in the context of more experiments with different odors, more physiological recordings both from the antennal lobes and mushroom bodies, and, importantly, all of this should be done in the context of rigorous computational modeling.</p><p>We strongly agree with the comment from this reviewer in the first review. That is, that we should adopt the fruit fly to further test what we propose here. And we are in the process of doing that.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 482 &quot;this plasticity it would give rise to&quot;: Delete &quot;it&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Deleted.</p></body></sub-article></article>
