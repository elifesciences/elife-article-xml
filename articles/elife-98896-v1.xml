Salt stress exposure alters root and shoots growth rates, thereby affecting overall plant performance. While past studies have extensively documented the effect of salt stress on root elongation and shoot development separately, here we take an innovative approach by examining the coordination of root and shoot growth under salt stress conditions. Utilizing a newly developed tool for quantifying the root:shoot ratio in agar-grown <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedlings, we found that salt stress results in a loss of coordination between root and shoot growth rates. We identify a specific gene cluster encoding domain-of-unknown-function 247 (DUF247), and characterize one of these genes as <underline>S</underline>alt <underline>R</underline>oot:shoot <underline>R</underline>atio <underline>R</underline>egulator <underline>G</underline>ene (SR3G). Further analysis elucidates the role of SR3G as a negative regulator of salt stress tolerance, revealing its function in regulating shoot growth, root suberization, and sodium accumulation. We further characterize that <italic>SR3G</italic> expression is modulated by <italic>WRKY75</italic> transcription factor, known as a positive regulator of salt stress tolerance. Finally, we show that the salt stress sensitivity of <italic>wrky75</italic> mutant is completely diminished when it is combined with <italic>sr3g</italic> mutation. Together, our results demonstrate that utilizing root:shoot ratio as an architectural feature leads to the discovery of a new stress resilience gene. The study‚Äôs innovative approach and findings not only contribute to our understanding of plant stress tolerance mechanisms but also open new avenues for genetic and agronomic strategies to enhance crop environmental resilience.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>salt stress</kwd><kwd>natural variation</kwd><kwd>GWAS</kwd><kwd>root shoot ratio</kwd><kwd>suberization</kwd><kwd>root</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2023310</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Li'ang</given-names></name><name><surname>Nelson</surname><given-names>Andrew DL</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2102120</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Li'ang</given-names></name><name><surname>Nelson</surname><given-names>Andrew DL</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Salt stress disrupts root-shoot growth coordination through SR3G, a negative regulator of salt tolerance, that affects shoot growth, root suberization, and sodium accumulation, revealing new targets for environmental resilience.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Salt stress is predominant in the dryland areas where the evaporation rate exceeds water input. As all water contains dissolved ions, the prolonged exposure to drought stress results in increased accumulation of salts in the upper soil layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrol et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tramberend, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Richards, 1969</xref>). Dryland areas of South America, southern and western Australia, Mexico, the southwest United States, and South Africa were previously identified as primary hotspots for soil salinization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hassani et al., 2021</xref>). As fresh water becomes scarcer, understanding the mechanisms of salt stress resilience becomes of paramount importance in the context of global agricultural productivity and sustainability.</p><p>Salt stress detrimentally affects plant growth and development, decreasing the activity of the meristem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">West et al., 2004</xref>). Studies utilizing main root elongation as an indicator of salt tolerance have led to identification of many crucial components of salt stress signaling and tolerance, including genes involved in salt-overly sensitive signaling (SOS) pathway, jasmonate, ethylene, abscisic acid (ABA), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in glycophytes and halophytes alike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Geng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">≈ûekerci et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Valenzuela et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wu et al., 1996</xref>). Additionally, the negative halotropism response, that describes a directional growth of the main root away from the salt gradient, was used to identify a wide range of molecular components regulating the auxin redistribution and cell-wall remodeling, to actively avoid high salt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deolu-Ajayi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Galvan-Ampudia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Korver et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zou et al., 2022</xref>). The development of lateral roots is affected by salinity, and the differential effect on main and lateral roots within specific genotypes can result in substantial reprogramming of root system architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Julkowska et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Julkowska et al., 2014</xref>). The shoot development is impacted by salt stress, as the salt impacts the plant transpiration and photosynthetic efficiency instantaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Awlia et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Awlia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Julkowska et al., 2016</xref>). Many forward genetic studies were highly successful in associating natural variation in root and shoot growth with allelic variation in gene coding and promoter regions, thereby identifying potential new target traits for improved stress resilience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Awlia et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Julkowska et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Julkowska et al., 2017</xref>). However, these studies typically focus on either above or below ground tissue.</p><p>The coordination of root and shoot growth rate is an important aspect of seedling establishment, and becomes even more critical under abiotic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bacher et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Karcher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). The importance of increased root:shoot ratio, maximizing water scavenging while limiting transpiration, is well studied under drought stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asch et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Karcher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Uga et al., 2013</xref>). However, the effect of salt stress on root:shoot ratio is yet to be described, and its contribution to salt stress remains unknown. Here, we developed a tool to quantify root:shoot ratio from agar-grown <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedlings, and re-analyzed the natural diversity panel of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> exposed to salt stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Julkowska et al., 2017</xref>). We have observed that while salt stress does not elicit a clear response in root:shoot ratio, it results in a loss of coordination of root and shoot growth rates. The locus associated with salt-induced changes in root:shoot ratio consisted of a gene cluster encoding domain-of-unknown-function 247 (DUF247), with majority of SNPs clustering into one specific gene (At3g50160), that we named as Salt Root:shoot Ratio Regulator Gene (SR3G). Further characterization of SR3G revealed its function as a negative regulator of salt stress resilience, through regulation of root suberization, shoot growth, and Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation. We found WRKY75 transcription factor, a positive regulator of salt stress tolerance, acts upstream of SR3G, binding directly to the SR3G promoter in yeast. While <italic>sr3g</italic> and <italic>wrky75</italic> mutants showed contrasting salt stress responses, the double mutants of <italic>sr3g/wrky75</italic> displayed reduced sensitivity to salt stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Natural variation in salt stress-induced changes in root:shoot ratio</title><p>To investigate salt stress-induced changes in root:shoot ratio, we developed a custom tool that quantifies green and white pixels, corresponding to the shoot and root of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedlings grown on agar plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

The growth of root and shoot for each plant was estimated using the exponential function. Salt stress-induced reduction in growth rate was observed to be dose-dependent for both root and shoot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). In general, the root growth was more sensitive to salt stress compared to shoot growth, with the population-wide relative growth rates reduced to a fraction of 0.67 and 0.41 of the growth rates observed at control for 75 and 125 mM NaCl, respectively. In comparison, the growth rates of the shoot were significantly reduced to 0.71 and 0.43 of the control in 75 and 125 mM NaCl treatments, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1‚Äîfigure supplement 3</xref>). While the mean value of root:shoot growth rate did not change upon salt stress treatment, the variance in the root:shoot ratio significantly expanded with the increasing concentrations of salt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

The associations were evaluated based on the p-value, the number of SNPs within the locus, and the number of traits associated with individual loci. As the Bonferroni threshold differs depending on the minor allele count (MAC) considered, we identified significant associations based on a Bonferroni threshold for each subpopulation of SNPs based on MAC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). While we conducted a GWAS on directly measured traits, as well as their Salt Tolerance Index (STI) values, however, the amount of associations with STI was much lower compared to directly measured traits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). This observation aligns with the understanding that plastic responses to environmental conditions tend to be genetically more complex. This complexity likely stems from the involvement of more genetic regulators compared to low-plasticity phenotypes.</p><p>The initial GWAS was performed using 250 k SNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Horton et al., 2012</xref>), and led to the identification of 14 significantly associated loci, of which 3 and 7 loci were associated with traits measured at 75 or 125 mM NaCl treatments, respectively. We identified one salt-specific association on chromosome 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1‚Äîfigure supplement 6</xref>), where two SNPs were identified within AT2G27300 encoding NAC-domain containing transcription factor (NTL8). Additionally, salt-induced changes in root:shoot ratio and shoot:total seedling area were associated with SNPs on chromosome 3, where 2 significantly associated SNPs were flanking AT3G22430, encoding an unknown gene encoding a domain of unknown function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1‚Äîfigure supplement 7</xref>).</p><p>To refine our analysis and further prioritize candidate genes for validation, we repeated the GWAS using a higher-density 4 M SNP panel <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paperpile.com/c/uiXLFV/7tWZ9">(1001</ext-link> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Genomes Consortium, 2016</xref>). This increased SNP density provided more associations and highlighted loci with greater confidence due to the higher resolution. The higher-density panel also allowed us to capture different linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks across the genome. One locus on chromosome 2, detected by both the 250 K and 4 M SNP panels, appeared to be in a region of strong LD or possibly under selection, consistently identified by both panels. However, most loci were not detected by the lower-density 250 K panel, likely due to differences in the panels' resolution and statistical power.</p><p>The new GWAS with the 4 M SNP panel revealed 32 additional loci, with only one locus (locus 30, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). being detected by both the 250 K and 4 M SNP panels. We prioritized the identified loci based on several factors, including the number of significantly associated SNPs, MAC, and the number of traits associated with each locus. This led to the identification of three loci of major interest (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). We further examined the regions in LD with the significantly associated SNPs for sequence divergence and open reading frames (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2‚Äîfigure supplements 1</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>).</p><p>Out of identified associations, locus 30 stood out as it consisted of nine SNPs associated with p-value above the Bonferroni threshold, and was associated with both root:shoot and shoot:total seedling area at 6 and 8 d after transfer of the seedling to 125 mM NaCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2‚Äîfigure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). The significantly associated SNPs were located in and around the gene coding region of AT3G50160, which encodes a domain of unknown function 247 (DUF247). We investigated the region for sequence divergence, and found that the region contained not only a high degree of sequence diversity but also potential structural variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). To identify allelic variation underlying the initial associations, we performed haplotype analysis, where accessions with shared SNP patterns within the protein-coding part of AT3G50160 were grouped into individual haplotype-groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Each unique haplotype, represented by at least three accessions, was subsequently studied for differences in observed phenotypes. We observed that Haplotype 1, represented by 46 accessions including Col-0, was significantly different from Haplotype 11, represented by 11 accessions including Blh-1, in shoot-per-total seedling area at 6 d after transfer to 125 mM NaCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), as well as shoot growth rate and relative shoot growth rate at 125 mM NaCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2‚Äîfigure supplement 2</xref>). Upon further investigation and sequencing of AT3G50160 in both Col-0 and Blh-1 accessions, we discovered that the Blh-1 allele carries a large insertion at 644 nucleotides downstream from the ATG of AT3G50160, followed by multiple other sequence variations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2‚Äîfigure supplement 3</xref>). The first insertion leads to a premature STOP-codon within the DUF247 domain after Gly-215 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2‚Äîfigure supplement 4</xref>), resulting in a truncated protein that still carries a nuclear localization signal and coiled-coil domain, but is missing a major part of the calcium-binding domain and a predicted transmembrane domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2‚Äîfigure supplement 5</xref>). As there are other DUF247s within the locus associated with salt-induced changes in root:shoot ratio, we decided to name the gene containing the majority of the associated SNPs (At3g50160) as Salt Root:shoot Ratio Regulator Gene (SR3G). Together, these results suggest that the allelic variation in the SR3G protein sequence might underlie the observed differences in root:shoot ratio under salt stress conditions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>SR3G is associated with salt stress-induced changes in shoot-per-total seedling area ratio.</title><p>The salt-induced changes in root-to-shoot and shoot-per-total seedling area ratios were used as an input for genome-wide association study (GWAS).

Exposure to drought alters the distribution of the biomass between root and shoot, to optimize water uptake, while limiting transpiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asch et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Karcher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Uga et al., 2013</xref>). While the processes underlying salt-induced changes in shoot and root growth dynamics and architecture have been systematically described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ariel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Awlia et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deolu-Ajayi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Geng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Julkowska et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zou et al., 2022</xref>), the methodological exploration of biomass distribution between root and shoot for plants exposed to salt stress is underexplored in the current body of research. Here, we developed a tool that allows a non-destructive quantification of root and shoot projected area of the seedlings grown on agar plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This new tool allows us to efficiently describe changes in biomass accumulation and stress-induced alterations in root and shoot growth. Although the method is restricted to small plants and early developmental stages, it provides valuable insight into stress responses. The application of this tool to an <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> natural diversity panel revealed that salt stress exposure results in loss of coordination between root and shoot growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), rather than a clear directional change, as in the case of drought. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of changes in root:shoot ratio. The developed tool for quantifying root and shoot size in plate-grown <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> has the potential to significantly advance research by enabling developmental and stress studies, focusing on coordination of root and shoot development during seedling establishment. Facilitating detailed comparisons of root:shoot ratios, this tool can aid in formulating new hypotheses about the mechanisms contributing to seedling vigor and stress tolerance.</p><p>The natural variation in salt-induced changes in root:shoot ratio revealed a clear association with SNPs on chromosome 3 within <italic>SR3G</italic>, that is situated within a region containing eight other <italic>DUF247</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). SR3G was previously associated with self-incompatibility in grasses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crain et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lian et al., 2021</xref>), as well as with lesions and dwarfism in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kondou et al., 2013</xref>) through constitutive activation of defense responses. However, the <italic>SR3G</italic> associated with constitutive defense response was AT3G60470 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kondou et al., 2013</xref>), which is located outside the interval associated with salt stress-induced changes in root:shoot ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Because we did not observe any consistent phenotypes in the T-DNA insertion lines of <italic>DUF247s</italic> neighboring the <italic>SR3G</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6‚Äîfigure supplements 4</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">5</xref>), we examined the RNAi lines targeting multiple <italic>DUF247s</italic> including <italic>SR3G</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s6">Figure 6‚Äîfigure supplements 6</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s8">8</xref>). Our root system architecture analyses revealed no redundancy between <italic>SR3G</italic> and other DUF247s, and the reduced lateral root development in double mutants of RNAi lines simply mimics the phenotype of <italic>sr3g-5</italic> single mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s6">Figure 6‚Äîfigure supplement 6</xref>). Furthermore, we demonstrated that only <italic>SR3G</italic> is regulated by <italic>WRKY75</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B‚ÄìE</xref>). As these genes are result of tandem duplication, they are expected to accumulate a lot of variation in the cis-regulatory regions. Therefore, differential regulation of two closely related genes can be expected by the accumulated variation within the promoter region.</p><p>The results acquired in this study provide multiple layers of evidence that support the role of <italic>SR3G</italic> as a negative regulator of salt stress response in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Loss-of-function <italic>SR3G</italic> maintained higher shoot growth rate and larger rosette area when exposed to salt stress in the soil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>), probably due to reduced Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), which in turn resulted in lower rates of cellular damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). This increased salt tolerance feature can be explained by the increased root suberization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) as suberin-deficient mutants show susceptibility to salt stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barberon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shukla et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ursache et al., 2021</xref>). For example, <italic>Arabidopsis CYP86A1/HORST</italic> (At5g58860) encodes a cytochrome P450-dependent enzyme that is responsible for catalyzing fatty acid œâ-hydroxylation. It plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of aliphatic suberin, particularly expressed in the root endodermis. Knock-out mutations of <italic>CYP86A1/HORST</italic> result in a substantial decrease of approximately 60% in total root suberin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">H√∂fer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2007</xref>). Consequently, the diminished aliphatic suberin content in the roots of <italic>cyp86a1</italic> mutants leads to increased permeability to water and solutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ranathunge and Schreiber, 2011</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>SR3G</italic> expression is enhanced by salt stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4‚Äîfigure supplement 1</xref>), specifically in the root stele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4‚Äîfigure supplement 1B</xref>). The root stele encompasses vascular bundles, procambium, and pericycle, which gives rise to the secondary growth and lateral root primordia, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Birnbaum et al., 2003</xref>). The stele is central to the systemic transport of water, minerals, and nutrients within the plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ramachandran et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zarebanadkouki et al., 2019</xref>), and to the exclusion of salt ions from the transpiration stream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">M√∏ller et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The deposition of hydrophobic residues of lignin and suberin in the Casparian strips poses a significant barrier to apoplastic transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Foster and Miklavcic, 2017</xref>). Previously, silencing genes involved in Casparian strips formation resulted in increased lateral root development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). As the suberization of the Casparian strips increases upon salt stress, it limits the accumulation of Na<sup>+</sup> and loss of K<sup>+</sup> ions from the root stele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barberon et al., 2016</xref>). However, the effects of increased root suberization under salt stress have thus far not been described to affect lateral root development. Here, we have identified <italic>SR3G</italic> as a negative regulator of root suberization under salt stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), which provides an additional layer of protection against sodium accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), but negatively impacts lateral root development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>).</p><p>As SR3G was previously not described in the context of salt stress, we attempted to identify its molecular context through its transcriptional regulation. Through our in-silico analysis, we have identified <italic>WRKY75</italic> as a putative regulator of <italic>SR3G</italic> expression, and confirmed it using RT-qPCR and Y1H assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). WRKY75 was previously described to act as a positive regulator of salt stress tolerance through activation of <italic>SOS1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lu et al., 2023</xref>). Similar to the previous study, we also observed <italic>wrky75</italic> mutants to be more sensitive to salt stress within our experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A‚ÄìC</xref>). Nevertheless, when the <italic>wrky75</italic> mutation was coupled with <italic>sr3g-5</italic>, the roots displayed a phenotype identical to Col-0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>), implying that the salt sensitivity of the <italic>wrky75</italic> mutant was counteracted by the <italic>SR3G</italic> mutation. Considering <italic>WRKY75‚Äôs</italic> role in positively regulating <italic>SOS1</italic> expression during salt stress, it is plausible that its binding to the <italic>SR3G</italic> promoter inhibits its expression, thereby enhancing salt tolerance on a larger scale.</p><p>One of the main players in Na<sup>+</sup> transport is High-affinity K<sup>+</sup> Transporter (HKT1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Laurie et al., 2002</xref>). HKT1 is expressed in root stele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">M√§ser et al., 2002</xref>), where it retrieves Na<sup>+</sup> from the transpiration stream and limits ion accumulation in the shoot, resulting in higher salt stress tolerance at later developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">M√∏ller et al., 2009</xref>). At early developmental stages, <italic>HKT1</italic> overexpression reduces the development of lateral root primordia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Julkowska et al., 2017</xref>), thus creating less Na<sup>+</sup> entry gate into the main root, resulting in less Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation in shoot. Similarly, <italic>sr3g-5</italic> mutants developed fewer lateral roots that are consistent with the lower Na<sup>+</sup> levels in the root upon salt stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The effects of HKT1 and SR3G differ in the magnitude of repression of lateral root development, with HKT1 mutants resulting in almost complete cessation of lateral root development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Julkowska et al., 2017</xref>), whereas repression of SR3G function has a much more subtle phenotype. Whereas the effect of cell-type specific overexpression of HKT1 on plant performance was negative during the early developmental stage, due to impairing lateral root development, the <italic>sr3g</italic> mutants showed increased salt tolerance when exposed to salt stress treatment during their early vegetative growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These results suggest that reduced lateral root development under salt stress can have a gradient of responses leading to increased and decreased salt tolerance, and the effect is highly dependent on the wider physiological mechanisms, and their contributions to ion exclusion and maintained plant development throughout salt stress exposure.</p><p>In conclusion, the study of salt-induced changes in the root:shoot ratio, alongside the development of new tools to quantify these changes during the seedling establishment stage, represents an important new perspective into mechanisms underlying salt stress tolerance. Identification of SR3G as a novel regulator of root suberization, shoot growth, and Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation provides better understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying plant responses to salt stress, but also offers a new avenue to explore more nuanced and tissue-specific strategies for enhancing salt stress tolerance.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Screening HapMap population for the increase in root and shoot size</title><p>The images collected within (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Julkowska et al., 2017</xref>) were re-analyzed in this manuscript to examine salt-induced changes in the root:shoot ratio for the data presented here. 360 accessions of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> HapMap population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Weigel and Mott, 2009</xref>) were screened over seven experimental batches, using four biological replicates per genotype per condition.

A MATLAB-based tool was developed to simplify and speed up the segmentation and analysis pipeline. For automatic segmentation, the tool uses a combination of image operations (histogram equalization), thresholding on different color spaces (e.g. RGB, YCbCr, Lab, HSV), and binary image processing (boundary and islands removal). As the tool is digitalizing various color scales and classifies pixels into either white (root), green (shoot), or blue (background) categories, the adjustment for white balance is obsolete. For analysis, the tool uses connected components analysis to extract the plants (combined roots and shoots) and can guide the user to find possible mistakes which can be manually corrected via the user interface. After segmentation, the number of pixels for roots and shoots are counted and recorded automatically.

following is the authors‚Äô response to the previous reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors aim to assess the effect of salt stress on root:shoot ratio, identify the underlying genetic mechanisms, and evaluate their contribution to salt tolerance. To this end, the authors systematically quantified natural variations in salt-induced changes in root:shoot ratio. This innovative approach considers the coordination of root and shoot growth rather than exploring biomass and the development of each organ separately. Using this approach, the authors identified a gene cluster encoding eight paralog genes with a domain-of-unknown-function 247 (DUF247), with the majority of SNPs clustering into SR3G (At3g50160). In the manuscript, the authors utilized an integrative approach that includes genomic, genetic, evolutionary, histological, and physiological assays to functionally assess the contribution of their genes of interest to salt tolerance and root development.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>As the authors correctly noted, variations across samples, genotypes, or experiments make achieving statistical significance challenging. Should the authors choose to emphasize trends across experiments to draw biological conclusions, careful revisions of the text, including titles and figure legends, will be necessary to address some of the inconsistencies between figures (see examples below). However, I would caution that this approach may dilute the overall impact of the work on SR3G function and regulation. Therefore, I strongly recommend pursuing additional experimental evidence wherever possible to strengthen the conclusions.</p><p>(1) Given the phenotypic differences shown in Figures S17A-B, 10A-C, and 6A, the statement that &quot;SR3G does not play a role in plant development under non-stress conditions&quot; (lines 680-681) requires revision to better reflect the observed data.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you to the reviewer for the comment. We appreciate the acknowledgment that variations among experiments are inherent to biological studies. Figures 6A and S17 represent the same experiment, which initially indicated a phenotype for the sr3g mutant under salt stress. To ensure that growth changes were specifically normalized for stress conditions, we calculated the Stress Tolerance Index (Fig. 6B). In Figure 10, we repeated the experiment including all five genotypes, which supported our original observation that the sr3g mutant exhibited a trend toward reduced lateral root number under 75 mM NaCl compared to Col-0, although this difference was not significant (Fig. 10B). Additionally, we confirmed that the wrky75 mutant showed a significant reduction in main root growth under salt stress compared to Col-0, consistent with findings reported in The Plant Cell by Lu et al. 2023. For both main root length and lateral root number, we demonstrated that the double mutants of wrky75/sr3g displayed growth comparable to wild-type Col-0. This result suggests that the sr3g mutation compensates for the salt sensitivity of the wrky75 mutant.</p><p>We completely agree with the reviewer that there is a variation in our results regarding the sr3g phenotype under control conditions, as presented in Fig. 6A/Fig. S17 and Fig. 10A-C. In Fig. 6A/Fig. S17, we did not observe any consistent trends in main root or lateral root length for the sr3g mutant compared to Col-0 under control conditions. However, in Fig. 10A-C, we observed a significant reduction in main root length, lateral root number, and lateral root length for the sr3g mutant under control conditions. We believe this may align with SR3G‚Äôs role as a negative regulator of salt stress responses. While loss of this gene benefits plants in coping with salt stress, it might negatively impact overall plant growth under non-stress conditions. This interpretation is further supported by our findings on the root suberization pattern in sr3g mutants under control conditions (Fig. 8B), where increased suberization in root sections 1 to 3, compared to Col-0, could inhibit root growth. While SR3G's role in overall plant fitness is intriguing, it is beyond the scope of this study. We cannot rule out the possibility that SR3G contributes positively to plant growth, particularly root growth. That said, we observed no differences in shoot growth between Col-0 and the sr3g mutant under control conditions (Fig. 7). Additionally, we calculated the Stress Tolerance Index for all aspects of root growth shown in Fig. 10 and presented it in Fig. S25.</p><p>To address the reviewer request on rephrasing the lines 680-681 from&quot;SR3G does not play a role in plant development under non-stress conditions&quot; (lines 680-681) statement, this statement is found in lines 652-653 and corresponds to Fig. 7, where we evaluated rosette growth in the WT and sr3g mutant under both control and salt stress conditions. We did not observe any significant differences or even trends between the two genotypes under control conditions, confirming the accuracy of the statement. To clarify further, we have added ‚Äú<italic>SR3G</italic> does not play a role in rosette growth and development under non-stress conditions‚Äù.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) I agree with the authors that detecting expression differences in lowly expressed genes can be challenging. However, as demonstrated in the reference provided (Lu et al., 2023), a significant reduction in WRKY75 expression is observed in T-DNA insertion mutant alleles of WRKY75. In contrast, Fig. 9B in the current manuscript shows no reduction in WRKY75 expression in the two mutant alleles selected by the authors, which suggests that these alleles cannot be classified as loss-of-function mutants (line 745). Additionally, the authors note that the wrky75 mutant exhibits reduced main root length under salt stress, consistent with the phenotype reported by Lu et al. (2023). However, other phenotypic discrepancies exist between the two studies. For example, (1) Lu et al. (2023) report that w¬¨rky75 root length is comparable to WT under control conditions, whereas the current manuscript shows that wrky75 root growth is significantly lower than WT; (2) under salt stress, Lu et al. (2023) show that wrky75 accumulates higher levels of Na+, whereas the current study finds Na+ levels in wrky75 indistinguishable from WT. To confirm the loss of WRKY75 function in these T-DNA insertion alleles the authors should provide additional evidence (e.g., Western blot analysis).</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely appreciate the reviewer acknowledging the challenge of detecting expression differences in lowly expressed genes, such as transcription factors. Transcription factors are typically expressed at lower levels compared to structural or enzymatic proteins, as they function as regulators where small quantities can have substantial effects on downstream gene expression.</p><p>That said, we respectfully disagree with the reviewer‚Äôs interpretation that there is no reduction in WRKY75 expression in the two mutant lines tested in Fig. 9C. Among the two independent alleles examined, <italic>wrky75-3</italic> showed a clear reduction in expression compared to WT Col-0 under both control and salt stress conditions. Using the Tukey test to compare all groups, we observed distinct changes in the assigned significance letters for each case:</p><p>Col/root/control (<bold>cd</bold>) vs wrky75-3/root/control (<bold>cd</bold>): Although the same significance letter was assigned, we still observed a clear reduction in WRKY75 transcript abundance. More importantly, the variation in expression is notably lower compared to Col-0.</p><p>Col/shoot/control (bcd) vs wrky75-3/shoot/control (a): This is significant reduction compared to Col</p><p>Col/root/salt (cd) vs wrky75-3/root/salt (bcd): Once again, the reduction in WRKY75 transcript levels corresponds to changes in the assigned significance letters.</p><p>Col/shoot/salt (bc) vs wrky75-3/shoot/salt (ab): Once again, the reduction in WRKY75 transcript levels corresponds to changes in the assigned significance letters.</p><p>To address the reviewer‚Äôs comment regarding the significant reduction in WRKY75 expression observed in T-DNA insertion mutant alleles of WRKY75 in the reference by Lu et al., 2023, we would like to draw the reviewer‚Äôs attention to the following points:</p><p>a) Different alleles: The authors in <italic>The Plant Cell</italic> used different alleles than those used in our study, with one of their alleles targeting regions upstream of the WRKY75 gene. While we identified one of their described alleles (WRKY75-1, SALK_101367) on the T-DNA express website, which targets upstream of WRKY75, the other allele (wrky75-25) appears to have been generated through a different mechanism (possibly an RNAi line) that is not defined in the <italic>Plant Cell</italic> paper and does not appear on the T-DNA express website. The authors mentioned they have received these seeds as gifts from other labs in the acknowledgement ‚ÄùWe thank Prof. Hongwei Guo (Southern University of Science and Technology, China) and Prof. Diqiu Yu (Yunnan University, China) for kindly providing the <italic>WRKY75pro:GUS</italic>, <italic>35Spro:WRKY75-GFP</italic>, wrky75-1, and wrky75-25 seeds. We thank Man-cang Zhang (Electrophysiology platform, Henan University) for performing the NMT experiment‚Äù.</p><p>However, in our study, we selected two different T-DNAs that target the coding regions. While this may explain slight differences in the observed responses, both studies independently link WRKY75 to salt stress, regardless of the alleles used. For your reference, we have included a screenshot of the different alleles used.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-98896-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>b) Different developmental stages: They measured WRKY75 expression in 5-day-old seedlings. In our experiment, we used seedlings grown on 1/2x MS for 4 days, followed by transfer to treatment plates with or without 75 mM NaCl for one week. As a result, we analyzed older plants (12 days old) for gene expression analysis. Despite the difference in developmental stage, we were still able to observe a reduction in gene expression.</p><p>c) Different tissues: The authors of <italic>The Plant Cell</italic> used whole seedlings for gene expression analysis, whereas we separated the roots and shoots and measured gene expression in each tissue type individually. This approach is logical, as WRKY75 is a root cell-specific transcription factor with higher expression in the roots compared to the shoots, as demonstrated in our analysis (Fig. 9C).</p><p>Based on the reasoning above, we did work with loss-of-function mutants of WRKY75, particularly wrky75-3. To more accurately reflect the nature of the mutation, we have changed the term &quot;loss-of-function&quot; to &quot;knock-down&quot; in line 717.</p><p>The reviewer mentioned phenotypic discrepancies between the two studies. We agree that there are some differences, particularly in the magnitude of responses or expression levels. However, despite variations in the alleles used, developmental stages, and tissue types, both studies reached the same conclusion: WRKY75 is involved in the salt stress response and acts as a positive regulator. We have discussed the differences between our study and <italic>The Plant Cell</italic> in the section above, summarizing them into three main points: different alleles, different developmental stages, and different tissue types.</p><p>To address the reviewer‚Äôs comment regarding &quot;Lu et al. (2023) report that wrky75 root length is comparable to WT under control conditions, whereas the current manuscript shows that wrky75 root growth is significantly lower than WT&quot;: We evaluated root growth differently than <italic>The Plant Cell</italic> study. In <italic>The Plant Cell</italic> (Fig. 5, H-J), root elongation was measured in 10-day-old plants with a single time point measurement. They transferred five-day-old wild-type, wrky75-1, wrky75-25, and WRKY75-OE plants to 1/2√ó MS medium supplemented with 0 mM or 125 mM NaCl for further growth and photographed them 5 days after transfer. In contrast, our study used 4-day-old seedlings, which were transferred to 1/2 MS with or without 0, 75, or 125 mM salt for additional growth (9 days). Rather than measuring root growth only at the end, we scanned the roots every other day, up to five times, to assess root growth rates. Essentially, the precision of our method is higher as we captured growth changes throughout the developmental process, compared to the approach used in <italic>The Plant Cell</italic>. We do not underestimate the significance of the work conducted by other colleagues in the field, but we also recognize that each laboratory has its own approach and specific practices. This variation in experimental setup is intrinsic to biology, and we believe it is important to study biological phenomena in different ways. Especially as the common or contrasting conclusions reached by different studies, performed by different labs and using different experimental setups are shedding more light on reproducibility and gene contribution across different conditions, which is intrinsic to phenotypic plasticity, and GxE interactions.</p><p><italic>The Plant Cell</italic> used a very high salt concentration, starting at 125 mM, while we were more cautious in our approach, as such a high concentration can inhibit and obscure more subtle phenotypic changes.</p><p>To address the reviewer‚Äôs comment on &quot;Lu et al. (2023) show that wrky75 accumulates higher levels of Na+, whereas the current study finds Na+ levels in wrky75 indistinguishable from WT,&quot; we would like to highlight the differences in the methodologies used in both studies. <italic>The Plant Cell</italic> measured Na+ accumulation in the wrky75 mutant using xylem sap (Supplemental Figure S10), which appears to be a convenient and practical approach in their laboratory. In their experiment, wild-type and wrky75 mutant plants were grown in soil for 3 weeks, watered with either a mock solution or 100 mM NaCl solution for 1 day, and then xylem sap was collected for Na+ content analysis. In contrast, our study employed a different method to measure Na+ and K+ ion content, using Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES) for root and shoot Na+ and K+ measurements. Additionally, we collected samples after two weeks on treatment plates and focused on the Na+/K+ ratio, which we consider more relevant than net Na+ or K+ levels, as the ratio of these ions is a critical determinant of plant salt tolerance. With this in mind, we observed a considerable non-significant increase in the Na+/K+ ratio in the shoots of the wrky75-3 mutant (assigned Tukey‚Äôs letter c) compared to the Col-0 WT (assigned Tukey‚Äôs letters abc) under 125 mM salt, suggesting that this mutant is salt-sensitive. Importantly, the Na+/K+ ratio in the double wrky75/sr3g mutants was reduced to the WT level under the same salt conditions, further indicating that the salt sensitivity of wrky75 is mitigated by the sr3g mutation.</p><p>Based on the reasons mentioned above, we believe that conducting additional experiments, such as Western blot analysis, is unnecessary and would not contribute new insights or alter the context of our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Salt stress is a significant and growing concern for agriculture in some parts of the world.

We now fixed the text to reflect the result.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 698-707: The statistical analysis does not support the reported differences in the Na+/K+ ratio for the single and double mutants of sr3g-5 and wrky75-3 (Fig. 10D, where levels connected by the same letters indicate they are not significantly different). Furthermore, the conclusion that &quot;the SR3G mutation indeed compensated for the increased Na+ accumulation observed in the wrky75 mutant under salt stress&quot; is also based on non-significant differences (Fig. S25B). Please revise the text to accurately reflect the results of the statistical analysis. Additionally, since each mutant is compared to the WT, I recommend using Dunnett's test for statistical analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their feedback. We have carefully revised the text to better support our findings. As previously mentioned, variations among samples are evident and are well-reflected across all our datasets. We have presented all data and focused on identifying trends within our samples to guide interpretation.</p><p>We observed that the SR3G mutation effectively compensated for the increased Na+ accumulation observed in the wrky75 mutant under salt stress. A closer examination of the shoot Na+/K+ ratio under 125 mM salt shows that the wrky75 single mutant has a higher Na+/K+ ratio (indicated by the letter &quot;c&quot;) compared to Col-0 (indicated by &quot;abc&quot;) and the two double mutants (also indicated by &quot;abc&quot;). Therefore, we have retained the statistical analysis as originally conducted, and maintain our conclusions as is.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6: data in panel C present the Na/K ratio, not Na+ content. Based on the statistical analysis of root Na+ levels presented in Fig. S17C, there is no significant difference between sr3g-5 and WT. Please update the title of Fig. 6. In addition, in panel A, the title of the Y-axis and figure legend should be &quot;Lateral root growth rate&quot; without the word length, and in panel C, the statistical analysis is missing.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer. We updated Fig. 6 title and fixed the Y-axis in panel A, and added statistical letters to panel C. Legend was updated to reflect the changes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 7: Please clearly label the time points where significant differences between genotypes are observed for both early and late salt treatments. Was there a significant difference recorded between WT and sr3g-5 on day 0 under early salt stress? Such differences may arise from initial variations in plant size within this experiment, as indicated by Fig. 7B, where significant differences in rosette area are evident starting from day 0. Additionally, please indicate the statistical analysis in panel E.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We updated the figure with a statistical test added to the panel E. Although the difference between sr3g mutant and Col-0 is indeed significant in its growth rate at day 0, we would like to draw the attention of the reviewer that this growth rate was calculated over the 24 hours after adding salt stress. Therefore, this difference in growth rate is related to exposure to salt stress. Moreover, the growth rate between Col-0 and sr3g mutant does not differ in two other treatments (Control and Late Salt Stress) further supporting the conclusion that sr3g is affecting rosette size and growth rate only under early salt stress conditions.</p><p>We have also added the Salt Tolerance Index calculation to Figure S24 as additional evidence, controlling for potential differences in size between Col-0 and sr3g mutant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure S17: statistical analysis is not indicated in panels A, B, and D.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for spotting that. We updated the figure with a statistical test.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figures S21-23: The quality of these figures is insufficient, hindering the ability to effectively interpret the authors' results and main message. Furthermore, a Dunnett's test, rather than a t-test, is the appropriate statistical method for this analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this observation. We have now added a high resolution figures for all supplemental figures, which should increase the resolution of the figures. As we are comparing all of the genotypes to Col-0 one-by-one - the results of individual t-tests are sufficient for this analysis.</p></body></sub-article></article>
