However, the role of B cells and NAbs, which are present prior to the encounter with cognate antigens, has been overlooked. One reason is due to the popular use of a single B cell-deficient mouse model, muMT mice. Cancer models using muMT mice display a similar tumor burden as their wild-type (WT) counterparts. Empirically, we observe what others have previously reported with muMT mice. However, using two other B cell-deficient mouse models (IgHELMD4 and CD19<sup>creDTA</sup>), we show a three- to fivefold increase in tumor burden relative to WT mice. In addition, using an unconventional, non-cancer-related, immune neoantigen model where hypoxic conditions and cell clustering are absent, we provide evidence that B cells and their innate, natural antibodies (NAbs) are critical for the detection and elimination of neoantigen-expressing cells. Finally, we find that muMT mice display anti-tumor immunity because of an unexpected compensatory mechanism consisting of significantly enhanced type 1 interferon (IFN)-producing plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), which recruit a substantial number of NK cells to the tumor microenvironment compared to WT mice. Diminishing this compensatory pDC-IFN-NK cell mechanism revealed that muMT mice develop a three- to fivefold increase in tumor burden compared to WT mice. In summary, our findings suggest that NAbs are part of an early defense against not only microorganisms and dying cells, but precancerous cells as well.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>natural antibodies</kwd><kwd>cancer immunesurveillance</kwd><kwd>neoantigen</kwd><kwd>pDCs</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HL115334</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jakubzick</surname><given-names>Claudia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HL135001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jakubzick</surname><given-names>Claudia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 HL155458</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jakubzick</surname><given-names>Claudia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Natural antibodies play a fundamental role in anti-cancer immunity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tumorigenesis occurs when normal cells accumulate mutations and proliferate out of control. Extrinsic tumor suppression mechanisms (i.e., cancer immunoediting) arise after intrinsic tumor suppression mechanisms fail. Extrinsic tumor suppression mechanisms are led by immune cells and divided into three stages: elimination, equilibrium, and escape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Schreiber et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mittal et al., 2014</xref>). This study focuses on the elimination phase, particularly the innate recognition of neoantigen-expressing cells by natural antibodies (NAbs).</p><p>In the elimination phase of cancer immunoediting, the identification and destruction of nascent tumors result from the expression of neoantigens by mutant cells, which form a hypoxic cluster and release damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). T cells and NK cells are the predominant immune cells to recognize these cellular abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Rao et al., 2019</xref>). To induce antigen-specific effector T cells against neoantigens (as with other foreign antigens), dendritic cells (DCs) must become licensed through their pattern recognition receptors by either DAMPs or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). This licensing allows for DCs to present neoantigens in an immunogenic fashion to T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">ArdavÃ­n et al., 2004</xref>). Hence, in the elimination phase, DAMPs are the designated mediators that license DCs to present neoantigens in an immunogenic fashion to T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">SpÃ¶rri and Reis e Sousa, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Desch et al., 2014</xref>). However, newly transformed cells that just escaped intrinsic suppression mechanisms do not express PAMPs but must be eliminated too. So, how do immune cells become licensed to eliminate newly transformed neoantigen-expressing cells prior to cluster formation and hypoxic conditions?</p><p>This question, along with two observations in unconventional, non-cancer-related, immune neoantigen (i.e., new antigens to the host) models led us to hypothesize that NAbs significantly contribute to early neoantigen recognition. The first observation is the rejection of male cells in syngeneic female mice. This immune rejection is due to the presence of Y chromosome antigens, H-Y antigens, which are perceived as neoantigens to syngeneic female mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Atif et al., 2018</xref>). The second observation is not H-Y antigen based. Adoptive transfer of MHC-matched 129Sv female cells into C57BL/6 female mice results in the rejection of 129Sv cells, and vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atif et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carmi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Atif et al., 2018</xref>). This immune response is due to the allelic variations outside of the MHC locus. Interestingly, what these two models share in common is that the adoptively transferred cells have normal MHC class I levels and no PAMPs present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sengupta et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, if there are no PAMPs, or clustering of cells leading to hypoxic conditions, how then are these neoantigen-expressing cells (i.e., C57BL/6 male and 129 female cells in C57BL/6 female mice) identified and subsequently cleared? Specifically, what is licensing endogenous antigen-presenting cells to present these neoantigen-expressing cells in an immunogenic fashion to T cells? In both models, we previously demonstrated that NAbs are required for this elimination process in a chain-link reaction: antibody bound neoantigen-expressing cells license tissue trafficking monocytes and CD11c<sup>+</sup>Irf4-dependent cells to present cell-associated neoantigens to CD4 T cells, which in turn license DC1 via CD40 to cross-present neoantigens and cross-prime CD8 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Atif et al., 2018</xref>). In these non-cancer neoantigen models, NAbs are required for the recognition and rejection of neoantigen-expressing cells.</p><p>Currently, NAbs are thought to have no role in cancer immune surveillance. In large part, because a series of widely cited studies found that B cell-deficient muMT mice mount a robust anti-tumor immune response similar to or greater than wild-type (WT) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) mice. However, several converging lines of evidence challenge this view. At least three other, lesser-known models of B cell-deficient mice show markedly enhanced tumor growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Here, we confirm previous findings in one of the models, IgHEL mice, and examine tumor burden in a new B cell-deficient model, CD19<sup>creDTA</sup> mice. Furthermore, other methods for studying the role of B cells, such as antibody depletion with anti-CD20 or anti-IgM, show increased tumor growth, contradicting the muMT findings and suggest that B cells may mediate early anti-tumor immunity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Overall, the discrepancies in the literature, along with the observations that NAbs are required to initiate the rejection of syngeneic male and MHC-matched 129Sv female cells in C57BL/6 (BL6) female mice, led us to hypothesize that NAbs may have similar functions in cancer immunosurveillance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NAb repertoire is essential for the elimination of neoantigen-expressing cells</title><p>First, we examined whether NAbs are required for the elimination of non-cancerous neoantigen-expressing cells. To investigate this, CD45 congenic cells were generated to track the acceptance or rejection of adoptively transferred cells into a CD45.2 host. Specifically, neoantigen-expressing CD45.1/2 129/BL6 cells, along with an internal control, CD45.1 BL6 cells, were adoptively transferred into CD45.2 BL6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, experimental diagram).

This immunization is independent of antibodies, as the poly I:C directly licenses TLR3<sup>+</sup> DC1 to present OVA as an immunogen to cognate T cells. Six days post-immunization, 1:1 OVA<sup>+</sup> and OVA<sup>â</sup> target cells were CFSE-labeled and adoptively transferred to measure the endogenous CTL response against OVA-expressing cells. As expected, since IgHEL mice exhibit normal DC migration from the tissue to the draining lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Atif et al., 2018</xref>), a similar CTL response against OVA-expressing cells was observed when WT and IgHEL mice were immunized with OVA and poly I:C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>Next, we examined whether NAbs are required for anti-tumor immunity using the B16F10 melanoma model. Three distinct B cell-deficient mouse models were challenged with melanoma. The first was the most popular B cell-deficient mouse model, muMT mice, which lacks CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells. muMT mice did not show enhanced tumorigenesis above WT counterparts, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). The second strain tested was IgHEL mice, where greater than &gt;90% of B cells are IgM-specific for hen egg lysozyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The third strain was CD19<sup>creDTA</sup> mice, which have 70â90% less B cells, predominantly due to the loss of B1 cells, compared to WT mice. Both strains are thus B cell-deficient, and both showed an approximately three- to fivefold increase in tumor burden compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Atif et al., 2018</xref>).

The observation that two distinct B cell-deficient mice, compared to the traditionally used muMT mouse, showed enhanced tumor burden suggests that antibody-producing B cells significantly contribute to anti-tumor immunity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>muMT mice have excess plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), with most located in the absentee B cell zone</title><p>The disparity in tumor burden between the muMT and IgHEL mice led us to probe whether muMT mice show abnormalities in other immune cell types that could compensate for B cell deficiency, particularly mononuclear phagocytes and pDCs. We did not observe any substantial difference in mononuclear phagocyte populations between muMT and WT mice (data not shown). However, the numbers of pDCs, which are lymphoid in origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sathe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rodrigues et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dress et al., 2019</xref>), were significantly greater in the muMT mice compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

However, a marked difference was the unique clustering of pDCs in muMT mice within the âabsentee B cell zone,â a region adjacent to the subcapsular sinus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This clustering occurred even in the absence of CXCR5 expression on pDCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B</xref>).

IFN-Î±, expressed by pDCs, is a robust anti-tumor cytokine. PDCs are also known as type 1 IFN-producing cells, as they produce type 1 IFNs in larger quantities compared to other immune cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Diebold et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dunn et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ito et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, we examined by IHC whether pDCs were producing IFN-Î± in the tumor microenvironment. We made two observations. First, there were significantly more pDCs in the tumor microenvironment of muMT mice than WT mice. Second, these pDCs expressed significant levels of IFN-Î± compared to other cells in the surrounding tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

Although the literature suggests that any one of the three antibodies could deplete B220<sup>+</sup> or SigH<sup>+</sup> cells, we found that effective depletion of pDCs required the triple antibody cocktail. The use of only one or two resulted in the masking of the epitope but not pDC depletion, which was revealed using Ly6C versus Ly6D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Depleting pDCs in muMT mice resulted in a threefold increase in tumor burden and size compared with non-depleted muMT and WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3A</xref>).

This underscores the role that NAbs play in anti-tumor immunity.</p><p>In WT mice, pDCs in the tumor microenvironment recruit and activate NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Joao et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Persson and Chambers, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Swiecki et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, type I IFN signaling has been associated with NK cell-mediated tumor surveillance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dunn et al., 2005</xref>). Unlike IFN-Î³, which directly target tumor cells, type I interferons such as IFN-Î± facilitate anti-tumor immunity through the activation of immune cells such as NK cells and CD8 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dunn et al., 2005</xref>). Since pDCs and IFN-Î± were prevalent in muMT mice, we next assessed the frequency of NK cells. As anticipated, tumor-bearing muMT mice had significantly more NK cells in their tumor microenvironment than WT mice. Moreover, NK cell frequency in the tumors of muMT mice were diminished after pDC depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These findings suggest that excess pDCs mediate the recruitment of NK cells in muMT mice. Finally, we investigated whether neutralizing IFN-Î±, which is highly secreted by pDCs in muMT mice, or depleting NK cells would increase the tumor burden. Indeed, low concentration of neutralizing antibodies against IFN-Î± significantly increased the tumor burden in muMT mice but not in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Moreover, depletion of NK cells in muMT mice resulted in a fivefold increase in tumor burden compared to depletion of NK cells in WT mice, suggesting that the pDC-IFN-I-NK cell axis is the main anti-tumor immune mechanism in place for muMT mice. In contrast, WT mice display other anti-tumor immune mechanisms since the tumor burden after the depletion of NK cells was not as dramatic as those observed for muMT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Taken together, these findings indicate that the compensatory mechanism exhibited in the muMT mice derives from the development of pDCs, which are recruited to the tumor microenvironment in significant numbers, secrete high levels of type 1 IFN, and recruit and activate NK cells that promote anti-tumor immunity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Natural IgM forms an immune complex with neoantigen expressing cells, leading to their elimination</title><p>Our data suggest the possibility of an immune complex formation between natural IgM antibodies and nascent tumor cells.

It is thus reasonable to hypothesize that a similar line of defense may exist for precancerous cells that recently escaped intrinsic tumor suppression mechanisms. The early recognition of precancerous cells by NAbs would allow the immune system to use multiple components of the innate branch prior to T cell activation, which is part of the adaptive branch. Our findings support the innate immune hypothesis. We found marked increases in tumor burden in three distinct B cell-deficient mouse modelsâincluding muMT mice after pDC depletionâand after B cell-derived NAb depletion. Reconstituting NAbs in deficient mice was sufficient to restore anti-tumor immunity. These findings are consistent with an innate immune response in which we envision (requiring further investigation) that NAbs tag nascent, precancerous cells for clearance, followed by activation of complement, engulfment by C1q secreting interstitial macrophages (which are present in all tissues) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gibbings et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Leach et al., 2020</xref>), surveying monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jakubzick et al., 2013</xref>), and NK cell antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.</p><p>Although muMT mice possess many immune cell abnormalities, such as reduced T cell numbers, an absence of follicular DCs, poor lymphatic development and DC migration, and small spleens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asano and Ahmed, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crowley et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angeli et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Schreiber et al., 2011</xref>), these mice were used to define for the role of B cells in anti-tumor immunity for decades. Although this study does not challenge the empirical validity of previous findings in muMT mice, which are reproducible, it highlights that relying on results from a single mouse model delayed the discovery of the fundamental role B cells play in both innate and adaptive anti-tumor immunity.</p><p>Our findings raise the question of why B cell-deficient muMT mice exhibit increased pDC frequencies, which compensate for B cell deficiency and permit anti-tumor immunity. pDCs and B cells share a common lymphoid progenitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rodrigues et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dress et al., 2019</xref>). The genetic abnormality that makes the progenitor unable to differentiate into B cells in this model may permit differentiation into pDCs instead. As pDCs normally represent a small fraction of immune cells in the lymphoid compartment in WT mice, they may not be present in sufficient numbers to enter into the tumor environment in WT mice. In muMT mice, pDCs are present in much higher numbers, and this abundance appears to enable sufficient numbers to migrate into the tumor microenvironment to mount an anti-tumor response. We also observed clustering of pDCs in the absentee B cell zone in muMT mice, but not in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The implications of pDCs residing in the absentee B cells zone of the LNs are unclear.</p><p>These findings also converge with previous results on NAb-deficient IgHEL mice. Previously, we showed that IgHEL mice developed significantly more tumors than mice deficient in DC1, a potent cross-presenting DC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Atif et al., 2018</xref>). However, DC1-deficient mice develop more tumors than WT mice. This observation suggests that for anti-tumor immune responses, NAbs contribute to both innate and adaptive immunity, whereas DC1 mainly contributes to adaptive immunity, and in particular the activation of cytotoxic T cells. Therefore, it is not surprising that a mouse deficient in both innate and adaptive responses against tumors (IgHEL mice) would develop more tumors than a mouse deficient in only adaptive immunity. However, this hypothesis may also depend on the site of tumor development, such as B16F10 injections in the skin may develop comparatively more DAMPs by passing the need for NAbs to mount anti-tumor immunity.</p><p>In summary, our findings indicate that a complete NAb repertoire is required to identify altered âselfâ and initiate the elimination of neoantigen-expressing cells, resulting in anti-tumor immunity. This conclusion is supported by converging evidence from multiple B cell and NAb-deficient mice paired with NAb repertoire reconstitution. The implication is that innate immunity is a critical part of cancer immunosurveillance and clearance of precancerous cellsâin short, that NAbs are the âkeysâ that start the âengineâ of both innate and adaptive immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Atif et al., 2018</xref>). More broadly, our findings indicate that cancer elimination begins with an innate immune response, as with other pathogens and injuries.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>CD45.2 WT (000664), C57BL/6 Ly5.1 (002014), OT-I transgenic (003831), 129S1/SvImJ (002448), Act-mOVA (005145), B6.129S2-<italic>Ighm<sup>tm1Cgn</sup></italic>/J (muMT, 002288), <italic>Aicda</italic> (AID<sup>â/</sup>â, 008825), IghelMD4 (IgHEL, 002595), <italic>Rag2<sup>â/</sup></italic><sup>â</sup> (008449), B6.129P2(C)-<italic>Cd19<sup>tm1(cre)Cgn</sup></italic>/J (CD19cre, 006785), and B6.129P2-<italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm1(DTA)Lky</sup></italic>/J (Rosa-DTA, 009669) mice were purchased from Jackson Research Laboratories and Charles River NCI. <italic>Aicda</italic> mice (hyper-IgM), B cells are unable to undergo Ig class switch recombination and have only serum IgM in circulation, lacking all other Ig isotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Muramatsu et al., 2000</xref>).

This is provocative as the dogma, based largely on data from muMT B-cell deficient mice, largely excludes a role for natural antibodies in cancer elimination. Using an experimental metastasis B16F10 model, and two B-cell deficient mouse models, the authors convincingly demonstrate that B-Cell depletion enhances tumour nodule outgrowth and that this can be mitigated, at least in part, with the supplementation of antibodies, with serum derived from wild type mice. They also reveal a potential mechanism to explain discordant results with muMT mice, wherein higher numbers of pDCs compensate for the lack of B cells, enabling a type 1 interferon response in tumours concomitant with NK cell recruitment.

Such cells include B16F10 melanoma cells and cells from 129S1 mice that bear minor histoincompatibility differences.</p><p>The authors identify moieties in B16F10 cells that can be recognised by serum antibodies. Utilizing several B cell-deficient mouse strains and serum transfer rescue experiments, the authors make a persuasive case for the notion that these natural antibodies can act as barriers to cell implantation/growth in this model. Additionally, the authors delineate an interesting pathway in muMT mice in which the expansion of plasmacytoid cells producing type I IFNs counteracts the loss of natural antibody, thereby preserving relative immunity to B16F10. The authors suggest this compensatory mechanism may have masked the contribution of antibodies/B cells to previous studies of anti-cancer immunity that have relied on muMT mice as a model of B cell-deficiency.</p><p>The data presented are clear and of interest. However, the interpretation that the data highlight a role for natural antibodies specifically in cancer immunoediting is premature. Is this cancer immunity or transplant immunity (as the B10F10 are likely to differ from the authors' host mice at multiple minor histocompatibility antigens)? Given the reliance on systemic injection of mismatched cells and the lack of clarity as to what the antibodies are binding to, these issues remain open. Further, the authors frequent allusions to the absence of DAMPs/PAMPs and hypoxia in their experiments is confusing. Is it not possible that intravenous injection alone leads to significant cell damage, exposing or releasing DAMPs? In sum, the authors provide convincing experimental evidence for a humoral barrier to allogeneic transplant but what this means for immune surveillance of cancer in an open question.</p><p>The authors are advised to steer away from broader conclusions about anti-cancer immunity and interpret their data conservatively remembering that they are using a transplantable tumor model in which cell rejection can also reflect allo-immunity.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled Redefining innate natural antibodies as important contributors to anti-tumor immunity&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.
