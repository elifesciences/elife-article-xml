Here, we report a novel Hif-3α variant, Hif-3α2, in zebrafish. Hif-3α2 lacks the bHLH, PAS, PAC, and ODD domains, and is expressed in embryonic and adult tissues independently of oxygen availability. Hif-3α2 is a nuclear protein with significant hypoxia response element (HRE)-dependent transcriptional activity. Hif-3α2 overexpression not only decreases embryonic growth and developmental timing but also causes left-right asymmetry defects. Genetic deletion of Hif-3α2 by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing increases, while Hif-3α2 overexpression decreases, Wnt/β-catenin signaling. This action is independent of its HRE-dependent transcriptional activity. Mechanistically, Hif-3α2 binds to β-catenin and destabilizes the nuclear β-catenin complex. This mechanism is distinct from GSK3β-mediated β-catenin degradation and is conserved in humans. These findings provide new insights into the oxygen-independent actions of HIFs and uncover a novel mechanism regulating Wnt/β-catenin signaling.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08996.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08996.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08996.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins known as hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are important in animals when the amount of oxygen in the air or water drops. These proteins switch on genes that help cells and tissues adapt to the shortage in oxygen, for example, by stimulating the production of red blood cells. Each HIF is made up of two subunits called α and β that only bind to each other when the oxygen levels drop. This two-subunit complex, or 'dimer', then activates a set of genes by binding to a stretch of DNA known as the hypoxia response element. HIFs also play important roles in many different stages of animal development. There are many different HIF proteins that are each present at different developmental stages; this has made them difficult to study.</p><p>Zhang et al. have found a new form of HIF-3α in zebrafish – called Hif-3α2. The experiments show that this α subunit is not regulated by oxygen, but may still be able to activate genes that have the hypoxia response element. When Hif-3α2 was injected into zebrafish embryos, the body pattern that is normally set up in embryogenesis was disrupted. Further experiments revealed that Hif-3α2 regulates embryo development by destabilizing a protein called β-catenin. This inhibits a cell communication system called Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Zhang et al. also show that the two distinct activities of Hif-3α2 – binding to the hypoxia response element and destabilizing β-catenin – involve two different regions of the protein.</p><p>Together, Zhang et al.’s findings show that zebrafish Hif-3α2 combines some conventional features of HIF proteins with a unique developmental role. It is likely that human Hif-3α may also work in a similar way, so future studies will focus on understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for these distinct roles.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08996.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08996.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>hypoxia</kwd><kwd>wnt signaling</kwd><kwd>zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS-1051034</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Duan</surname><given-names>Cunming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Hif/Hif-3α has two distinct roles in cells: activating HRE-dependent gene expression and binding to β-catenin to destabilize the nuclear β-catenin complex.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) are evolutionarily conserved transcriptional regulators that play key roles in coordinating the cellular response to hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Semenza, 2012</xref>). HIFs are heterodimers, consisting of an oxygen-regulated α subunit and a stable β subunit. All three HIFα proteins contain a bHLH (basic helix-loop-helix) domain, two PAS (Per-Arnt-Sim) domains, a PAC (PAS associated C-terminal) domain, and an ODD (oxygen-dependent degradation) domain. HIF-1α and HIF-2α have two TADs (transactivation domains) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pugh et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tian et al., 1997</xref>). HIF-3α has only one TAD but it has a unique LZIP (leucine zipper) domain in the C-terminal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hara et al., 2001</xref>). Under normal oxygen tension, HIFα proteins are hydroxylated at conserved proline residues in their ODD domains by PHDs (prolyl hydroxlase domain proteins). The prolyl hydroxylated HIFα proteins are recognized by the pVHL (von Hippel-Lindau protein). pVHL polyubiqutinates HIFα proteins and targets them to the proteasome for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kageyama et al., 2004</xref>). Under hypoxia, prolyl hydroxylation is decreased and HIFα proteins are stabilized. They then dimerize with HIFβ, translocate into the nucleus, bind to the hypoxia response elements (HREs) in the promoter regions of their target genes, and up-regulate their expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Semenza, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Simon and Keith, 2008</xref>). These HIF target genes participate in many adaptive and pathological processes such as erythropoiesis, angiogenesis, metabolic reprograming, cell-cycle regulation, and tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Semenza, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Simon and Keith, 2008</xref>). In addition to their well-known functions in coordinating the transcriptional responses to hypoxia, HIFs have been shown to have oxygen-independent roles in early development in mammals, frogs, fish, and invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barriga et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dunwoodie, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Simon and Keith, 2008</xref>). The mechanisms underlying these oxygen-independent roles of HIFs, however, are not well understood.</p><p>The HIFα genes are subjected to sophisticated post-transcriptional regulation with that of HIF-3α being the most complicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Prabhakar and Semenza, 2012</xref>). The human <italic>HIF-3α</italic> gene, for example, has 19 predicted variants that result from the use of different promoters, different transcription initiation sites, and alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duan, 2015</xref>). Eight of them have been experimentally shown to encode proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heikkila et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Maynard et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pasanen et al., 2010</xref>). The mouse <italic>Hif-3α</italic> locus also gives rise to several different variants, resulting in the full-length HIF-3α, NEPAS (neonatal and embryonic PAS), IPAS (inhibitory PAS) and possibly others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Makino et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yamashita et al., 2008</xref>). These isoforms are often expressed in different tissues, at different developmental stages, and are differentially regulated. They have distinct or even opposite functions when tested by overexpression approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duan, 2015</xref>). For instance, while human HIF-3α1, the full-length human HIF-3α, can stimulate HRE-dependent reporter construct activity and up-regulate unique target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), human HIF-3α4 isoform, a shorter isoform that lacks the TAD domain, inhibits the activity of HIF-1α and HIF-2α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maynard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maynard et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, IPAS was shown to inhibit HIF-1α activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Makino et al., 2001</xref>), while NEPAS has weak transcriptional activity and is thought to inhibit HIF-1/2α activity by competing for the common HIFβ in cells with limited amounts of HIFβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yamashita et al., 2008</xref>). The existence of such a large array of HIF-3α variants has posed enormous challenges to studying HIF-3 biology. While the conventional gene knockout technology has been used to knockout the NEPAS/HIF-3α/IPAS in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yamashita et al., 2008</xref>), the interpretation of the results is not straightforward because multiple isoforms are deleted. The new CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology makes it possible to address this problem.</p><p>Wnts are secreted glycoproteins that play crucial roles in cell fate specification, body axis determination, cell proliferation, and cell migration during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clevers and Nusse, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">MacDonald et al., 2009</xref>). The Wnt signaling pathway also regulates stem cell renewal and adult tissue homeostasis. Aberrant expression and/or activation in Wnt signaling leads to many human diseases such as birth defects, cancer, and degenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clevers and Nusse, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">MacDonald et al., 2009</xref>). In the absence of Wnt ligands, the transcriptional co-activator β-catenin is phosphorylated in the cytoplasm by a protein complex consisting of APC, CK1, Axin, and GSK3β. This leads to β-catenin recognition by the ubiquitin ligase β-TrCP. β-TrCP binds to the N-terminal region of β-catenin in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and promotes β-catenin degradation. The binding of a Wnt ligand to Frizzled and co-receptors inhibits the phosphorylation and degradation of β-catenin. The stabilized β-catenin accumulates and translocates into the nucleus to form complexes with TCF/LEF, and thereby activates target gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clevers and Nusse, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">MacDonald et al., 2009</xref>). In addition to the canonical pathway, Wnt also regulates planar cell polarity and Akt/mTOR through non-canonical pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clevers and Nusse, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">MacDonald et al., 2009</xref>)</p><p>We have recently shown that the full-length zebrafish Hif-3α is an oxygen-dependent transcription factor and that it activates a transcriptional program distinct from that of Hif-1α in zebrafish embryos under hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). In this study, we have identified a novel zebrafish Hif-3α spliced variant, termed Hif-3α isoform 2 (Hif-3α2). Hif-3α2 is an oxygen-insensitive nuclear protein. Despite its lack of the bHLH and PAS domains, Hif-3α2 has HRE-dependent transcriptional activity. We investigated the in vivo role of Hif-3α2 using transgenesis and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing. Our results suggest that Hif-3α2 inhibits canonical Wnt signaling by binding to β-catenin and destabilizing the nuclear β-catenin complex. This action is independent of its HRE-dependent transcriptional activity and is evolutionarily conserved.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Hif-3α2 is a novel oxygen-insensitive Hif-3a isoform</title><p>RT-PCR analysis of zebrafish embryo RNA detected two major transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

These transcripts are referred to as <italic>hif-3α</italic> isoforms 1 and 2, respectively (<italic>hif-3α1 and -3α2</italic>) hereafter. The complete sequence of the <italic>hif-3α2</italic> transcript (893 bp) was determined by 5' and 3' RACE (GenBank access number KR338972). It lacks exons 3–10 and a portion of exon 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The predicted ORF is 513 bp, encoding a protein of 170 amino acids with a predicted size of 19 kDa.

To test this idea, capped mRNA encoding GFP, Hif-3α1-GFP, and Hif-3α2-GFP was injected into 3 separate groups of zebrafish embryos. The embryos were raised to 6 hpf under normoxia. As previously reported, Hif-3α1-GFP was rapidly degraded under normoxia and no GFP signal was observed in this group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, strong signal was observed in Hif-3α2-GFP and GFP mRNA injected embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The Hif-3α2-GFP signal was observed in the nucleus, while the GFP protein was present in the cytoplasm and nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Western blotting confirmed these results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The levels of endogenous Hif-3α2 protein were examined using a validated Hif-3α antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). This antibody detected both Hif-3α1 and Hif-3α2 in HEK293T cells transfected with a GFP tagged construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Western blotting results showed comparable levels of Hif-3α2 in zebrafish embryos raised in normoxic and hypoxic water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), while hypoxia induced a robust increase in Hif-3α1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Likewise, 6 hr, 12 hr, and 24 hr hypoxia treatments did not change Hif-3α2 levels in adult zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).

Excessive Wnt/β-catenin activity has been linked to major phenotypic changes in zebrafish. For example, the <italic>masterblind (mbl)</italic> mutant fish had no eyes, reduced telencephalon, and expanded diencephalon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heisenberg et al., 2001</xref>). Likewise, treatment of zebrafish embryos with Lithium and BIO, which increase β-catenin signaling by inhibiting GSK3β, results in the absence of eyes or reduced eyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nishiya et al., 2014</xref>). A recent study has shown that zebrafish can activate compensation mechanisms to buffer against deleterious genetic mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rossi et al., 2015</xref>). For instance, while knockdown of egfl7 resulted in major phenotypic changes, no phenotype was found in the <italic>egfl7</italic>-/- genetic mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rossi et al., 2015</xref>). To test this possibility, we designed a morpholino (MO) targeting the Hif-3α2 ATG site. Injection of the Hif-3α2 MO but not the control MO reduced the Hif-3α2 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7A<italic>—</italic>figure supplement 1A</xref>). Injection of Hif-3α2 MO did not change the levels of Hif-3α1 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7<italic>—</italic>figure supplement 1B</xref>). Because the full-length Hif-3α1 protein is rapidly degraded under normoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>), it could not be detected nor affected by the Hif-3α2 MO. Topflash reporter assay and qRT-PCR measurement showed that knockdown of Hif-3α2 significantly increased Wnt/β-catenin activity at 9 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–D</xref>). Therefore, the Wnt/β-catenin activity is elevated in the morphants. Many of the morphants had phenotypes resembling those of <italic>mbl</italic> mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heisenberg et al., 2001</xref>), including the absent or reduced eyes and reduced forebrain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). These phenotypes were unlikely caused by MO toxicity because the Hif-3α2 targeting MO did not increase embryo mortality nor did it increase p53 mRNA expression at the injected dose (3 ng) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7<italic>—</italic>figure supplement 1C</xref>). Furthermore, the <italic>hif-3α</italic>Δ42 embryos were significantly less sensitive to the Hif-3α2 MO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). qRT-PCR results showed that the expression of <italic>boz</italic>, a maternal Wnt signaling target gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leung et al., 2003</xref>), increased at 6 hpf but returned to the control levels at 9 and 24 hpf in the <italic>hif-3α</italic>Δ42 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). No change was detected in <italic>boz</italic> expression in the morphants at any of these stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). The <italic>vent</italic> and <italic>vox</italic> mRNA levels increased significantly at 6 and 9 hpf but these increases disappeared at 24 hpf in the <italic>hif-3α</italic>Δ42 mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B–C</xref>). In contrast, knockdown of Hif-3α2 resulted in elevated <italic>vent</italic> and <italic>vox</italic> mRNA expression at 6, 9, as well as 24 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E–F</xref>). A reciprocal decrease was observed with <italic>tp63</italic> expression; <italic>tp63</italic> is a direct transcriptional target of Bmp signaling in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bakkers et al., 2002</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G–H</xref>). These results support the notion that the <italic>hif-3α</italic>Δ42 mutant embryos have activated certain compensatory mechanisms. Next, <italic>w</italic>e subjected the <italic>hif-3α</italic>Δ42 mutant embryos to Lithium and BIO. We reasoned that the <italic>hif-3α</italic>Δ42 mutant embryos should be more sensitive to these Wnt activating agents even if they can survive by activating as-yet-unidentified compensatory mechanisms. Indeed, when treated with Lithium and BIO, a significantly greater portion of the <italic>hif-3α</italic>Δ42 embryos exhibited the no eye or small eye phenotype compared to the wild type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I–J</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08996.017</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Hif-3α2 knockdown leads to Wnt/β-catenin signaling phenotypes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Wild type (WT), control MO (cMO), and Hif-3α2 targeting MO (Hif-3α2 MO)-injected embryos were raised to 24 hpf in normoxic water.

Overexpression of Hif-3α2 abolished Wnt3a-induced Topflash reporter activity in these human cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplemental 1A</xref>). In contrast, Hif-3α2 had no effect on Wnt5a-induced non-canonical Ap1 reporter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplemental 1B</xref>), suggesting that Hif-3α2 only inhibits the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. We engineered a truncated human HIF-3α9 by deleting its N-terminal 452 residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplemental 1C</xref>). This truncated HIF-3α9, like zebrafish Hif-3α2, had significant HRE-dependent transcriptional activity. It also inhibited Wnt3a- and β-catenin-induced Topflash activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplemental 1D–E</xref>). These data suggest that both activities are conserved in human HIF-3α.</p><p>Next, Flag-tagged β-catenin and GFP-tagged Hif-3α2 were co-transfected into HEK293T cells. Reciprocal co-IP experiments detected β-catenin and Hif-3α2 in the same complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). A direct protein-protein interaction between β-catenin and Hif-3α2 was confirmed by GST pull-down assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2A</xref>). No direct interaction was detected between Lef1 and Tcf4 and GST-Hif-3α2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2B–C</xref>). To test whether the Hif-3α2 can compete for β-catenin binding with its nuclear partners, Flag-β-catenin and Myc-Lef1 were co-expressed with increasing levels of Hif-3α2-GFP. Co-expression of Hif-3α2-GFP decreased the levels of both β-catenin and Lef1 in the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). Likewise, overexpression of Hif-3α2-GFP also reduced the β-catenin and Tcf4 levels in the IP complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). Analysis of the Western blotting results of the cell lysates showed that the levels of total β-catenin, Lef1, and Tcf4 were all decreased by Hif-3α2 in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B–C</xref>). Overexpression of Hif-3α2 had no effect on the levels of Tcf3 levels and Hif-3α2-GST failed to pull down Tcf3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s3">Figure 9—figure supplement 3A–B</xref>). We postulated that Hif-3α2 inhibits β-catenin by destabilizing β-catenin and its nuclear co-activators. To test this idea, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 was added. While Hif-3α2 expression resulted in a marked reduction in β-catenin levels, this reduction was blocked by MG132 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). Likewise, MG132 treatment also partially inhibited the Hif-3α2-induced reduction in Lef1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). MG132 treatment increased Hif-3α2 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D–E</xref>). Next, HEK293T cells co-transfected with β-catenin and Hif-3α2-GFP were fractionated into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions and analyzed. The expression of Hif-3α2 greatly reduced the levels of nuclear β-catenin, while it had a minimal effect on the levels of cytoplasmic β-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>). Addition of BIO and Lithium, two chemical inhibitors of GSKβ, did not affect the Hif-3α2-induced β-catenin degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9G</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that Hif-3α2 binds to β-catenin and destabilizes the active β-catenin complex through a mechanism that is independent of GSKβ/β-TrCP-mediated degradation.<fig-group><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08996.020</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Hif-3α2 binds to β-catenin and destabilizes the nuclear β-catenin complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Co-IP experiment.

All three mutants possessing full β-catenin inhibitory activity, i.e., ΔLZIP, M1, and A36G, strongly induced β-catenin degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). P37A, which had no <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). M2 and ΔTAD, which had partial β-catenin inhibitory activity, had a modest impact on β-catenin stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). Human HIF-3α9Δ 1–452 had similar activity in destabilizing β-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10—figure supplement 2</xref>). Finally, the effects of the A36G and P37A mutants on the LR asymmetry development were determined. Overexpression of A36G and Hif-3α2 resulted in heart randomization and abnormal somite development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D, E</xref>). In contrast, overexpression of P37A, which lacks the ability to induce β-catenin degradation, had little effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D–E</xref>). These findings suggest that Hif-3α2 alters LR asymmetryby destabilizing β-catenin and this action is independent of its HRE-dependent transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10F</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we have identified a novel and oxygen-insensitive Hif-3α variant, Hif-3α2. To date, a number of HIF-3α protein-coding variants have been reported, including: a) the full-length protein; b) a HIF-3α variant similar to the full-length protein; c) HIF-3α variants lacking the LZIP domain; d) HIF-3α variants lacking both bHLH and LZIP domains; e) Short HIF-3α variants lacking the C-terminal half region; f) Truncated HIF-3α variants lacking the bHLH, ODD/N-TAD, and LZIP domains; and g) HIF-3α variants lacking the bHLH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duan, 2015</xref>). Zebrafish Hif-3α2 has a structure distinct from those reported previously. Hif-3α2 lacks the entire N-terminal region and only contains the N-TAD and LZIP domains. Hif-3α2 is expressed in all embryonic stages and in many adult tissues examined. Although the Hif-3α2 mRNA levels were lower compared to those of the full-length Hif-3α1, the Hif-3α2 protein was abundantly expressed in embryonic and adult tissues under both normoxia and hypoxia. Functional analysis results show that Hif-3α2 has significant HRE-dependent transcriptional activity. This activity depends on its TAD. Although Hif-3α2 has the ability to induce HRE-dependent gene expression, its action is not identical to that of the full-length Hif-3α1. The transcriptional activity of Hif-3α2 is weaker compared to that of Hif-3α1. Among the five Hif-31α target genes examined, Hif-3α2 increases the expression of <italic>igfbp-1a, mlp3c</italic> and <italic>redd1</italic> but not that of <italic>zp3v2</italic> and <italic>sqrdl</italic>.</p><p>We observed two major phenotypes resulting from Hif-3α2 overexpression. One is the global growth retardation and developmental timing delay. This is similar to what has been reported for Hif-3α1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). This action apparently requires the transcriptional activity because it was abolished by deletion the TAD but not LZIP domain. Another phenotype is the defective LR asymmetry. Forced expression of Hif-3α2 altered the expression of several asymmetry genes and resulted in the randomization of laterality of the heart, liver, and pancreas. This action is unique to Hif-3α2 because no such phenotype was observed in the Hif-3α1 expressing embryos. Importantly, the A36G mutant, which had no HRE-dependent transcriptional activity, caused a similar heart randomization, suggesting that this action does not required its HRE transcriptional activity. The LR axis development in zebrafish is divided into several phases, beginning from the symmetry breaking, and continuing with DFC appearance and clustering, KV organogenesis, lateral plate mesoderm asymmetry, and left- or right-specific organ formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carl et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matsui and Bessho, 2012</xref>). Our results suggest that forced expression of Hif-3α2 impairs LR axis development at the step of KV organogenesis/function. This conclusion is supported by the findings that Hif-3α2 overexpression altered KV morphology and <italic>spaw</italic> expression, while it did not affect DFC appearance or DFC clustering.</p><p>We provided several lines of evidence suggesting that Hif-3α2 impairs KV development by inhibiting the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. These include: i) Hif-3α2 overexpression decreases Wnt target gene expression while it had no effect on Fgf-, Hedgehog-, and Notch target genes; ii) Co-expression of Hif-3α2 inhibits Wnt3 and β-catenin-induced gene expression and dorsalization; iii) genetic deletion of Hif-3α2 (without affecting Hif-3α1 expression and function) increases Topflash reporter activity and Wnt target gene expression; iv) MO-based knockdown had similar effects in elevating Wnt signaling. These data strongly suggest that Hif-3α2 is a negative regulator of canonical Wnt signaling. Wnt signaling plays multiple roles in vertebrate axis specification (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hikasa and Sokol, 2013</xref>). While the maternal Wnt/β-catenin signaling contributes to the dorsoventral axis establishment in early embryogenesis, the zygotic Wnt/β-catenin signaling is involved in anteroposterior axis specification. It has been suggested that these two different roles are mediated by two distinct sets of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hikasa and Sokol, 2013</xref>). As discussed earlier, canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling also plays an important role in KV development and the establishment of the LR axis in zebrafish. Our results showed that overexpression of Hif-3α2 acts at the step of KV development. This may be related to the fact that it takes several hours for the injected mRNA to be translated into protein, and for resulting biological activities to manifest. Since Hif-3α2 mRNA is maternally deposited, the endogenous Hif-3α2 may act earlier. Indeed, we observed a significant increase in maternal Wnt signaling and elevated mortality in early stages in the mutant embryos. Although deletion of Hif-3α2 by either genetic mutations or gene knockdown results in elevated Wnt/β-catenin signaling, the two approaches gave rise to very different phenotypes. The F3 <italic>hif-3α</italic>Δ42 mutant embryos had significantly elevated mortality in early stages. This increase in embryo mortality was also observed in F3 <italic>hif-3α</italic>Δ20 mutant embryos. In contrast, no mortality increase was detected in the morphants. In both genetic alleles, the vast majority of the surviving embryos looked morphologically normal. The morphants, however, displayed phenotypes characteristic of excessive Wnt signaling. There are several possible explanations for the different phenotype. It is conceivable that the lack of a body patterning phenotype in the surviving mutant embryos may be due to activation of compensatory mechanisms. Such compensation mechanisms have been demonstrated recently in zebrafish and accounted for the different phenotypes found in the <italic>egfl7-/-</italic> genetic mutants and Egfl7 morphants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rossi et al., 2015</xref>). In support of this view, the <italic>hif-3α</italic>Δ42 mutant embryos displayed a transient and dynamic activation of Wnt signaling, while a sustained elevation in Wnt signaling was observed in the morphants. A concomitant reduction in BMP signaling was observed in the <italic>hif-3α</italic>Δ42 embryos but not in the morphants. Furthermore, the <italic>hif-3α</italic>Δ42 mutant embryos were more sensitive to the Wnt activating agents Lithium and BIO. Another possible explanation is the differential effects of genetic mutations and MO knockdown on the maternal Wnt signaling. The maternal Wnt signaling is significantly elevated in the F3 <italic>hif-3α</italic>Δ42 mutant embryos, as indicated by the increased boz expression, while no such increase was observed in the morphants. It is also possible that Hif-3α2 may have other activities in vivo. In fact, our results show that Hif-3α2 can regulate gene expression via its TAD domain. We cannot exclude the possibility Hif-3α2 may affect other pathways directly or indirectly.</p><p>A biochemical and functional interaction between an HIF-3α isoform and Wnt signaling has not been reported before. However, HIF-1α has been shown to both inhibit and activate Wnt signaling in mammals. Kaidi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaidi et al., 2007</xref>) reported that hypoxia inhibits the β-catenin/TCF4 complex formation and activity, resulting in a G1 arrest in cultured colon cancer cells. These authors proposed that HIF-1α acts by competing with TCF4 for β-catenin binding. Lim et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lim et al., 2008</xref>) reported that HIF-1α inhibits Wnt signaling by binding to human arrest defective 1 (hARD1), which is responsible for β-catenin acetylation. Another mechanism was reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al. (2013)</xref>. They showed that HIF-1α indirectly inhibits the Wnt signaling pathway by inducing the expression of a Wnt antagonist Sclerostin in MC3T3 osteoblastic cells. In a very recent paper, Majmundar et al. demonstrated that tissue-specific knockout of HIF-1α in mice has little effect on embryonic and fetal myogenesis but increases adult muscle regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Majmundar et al., 2015</xref>). HIF-1α acts by repressing canonical Wnt signaling in adult skeletal muscle. HIF-1α has also been shown to activate Wnt signaling in mammals. Using β-Gal Wnt reporter and Hif-1a conditional knockout mouse lines, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mazumdar et al. (2010)</xref>Mazumdar et al. (2010) showed that HIF-1α increases Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity in murine embryonic mesencephalon and adult hippocampal neuronal stem cells and precursor cells in vitro and in vivo. These authors further showed that HIF-1α activates canonical Wnt signaling by increasing the expression levels of β-catenin and its downstream effectors LEF-1 and TCF-1. Subsequently, Jeong and Pack reported that HIF-1α increases β-catenin expression level and action in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jeong and Park, 2013</xref>). Medley et al. reported that hypoxia activates Wnt signaling in undifferentiated iPS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Medley et al., 2013</xref>). As in the case of HIF-1α, HIF-2α has been shown to inhibit or/and enhance Wnt/β-catenin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Santoyo-Ramos et al., 2014</xref>). Another mechanism by which HIF-1α and -2α can active the Wnt signaling pathway was reported by Yuen et al. recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yuen et al., 2014</xref>). They reported that HIF-1α and -2α directly bind to the promoters of the Wnt7a and 7b genes and induce their expression in murine oligodendrocytes. Our study is different from the above studies in that Hif-3α2 is an oxygen-insensitive and constitutively expressed Hif-3α isoform and therefore functions under both normoxia and hypoxia. Importantly, our biochemical analysis results revealed that Hif-3α2 directly binds to β-catenin and promotes the degradation of the nuclear β-catenin complex. This action is specific, as shown by the fact that Hif-3α2 overexpression had no effect on the level of Tcf3, a β-catenin suppressor. This mechanism is distinct from those reported for HIF-1α and -2α.</p><p>In addition to the GSK3β/β-TrCP-mediated degradation mentioned earlier, β-catenin is also subject to negative regulation by pVHL. The β-catenin degradation induced by pVHL is dependent on the presence of Jade-1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chitalia et al., 2008</xref>). These two pathways are unlikely to be involved in the Hif-3α2-induced degradation for several reasons. First, both β-TrCP and Jade-1 bind to the N-terminal region of β-catenin in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and predominantly degrade β-catenin in the cytosol. Our results showed that Hif-3α2 inhibits the activity of β-cateninΔN, a constitutively active β-catenin mutant lacking the N-terminal sequence. Second, two GSK-3β inhibitors, BIO and lithium, did not inhibit Hif-3α2-induced β-catenin degradation. Finally, Hif-3α2 not only reduces the levels of β-catenin but also decreases the levels of Tcf-4 and Lef1. GST-Hif-3α2 did not directly interact with Tcf-4 and Lef1. Therefore, Hif-3α2 probably binds to β-catenin, which in turn interacts with Tcf-4 and Lef1. It is unclear whether other factors may be involved in the physical association between Hif-3α2 and β-catenin and whether post-translational modification of Hif-3α2 and/or β-catenin is involved its their binding. β-catenin can shuttle in and out of the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krieghoff et al., 2006</xref>). The results of our cell fractionation experiment showed that Hif-3α2 expression resulted in a marked decrease in the nuclear β-catenin levels without notable changes in the cytosolic β-catenin levels. In general, the fate of active β-catenin in the nucleus is not well understood. A recent study reported that the RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl preferentially targets the active nuclear β-catenin for degradation by binding to the ARM domains of β-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chitalia et al., 2013</xref>). Wnt activation promotes c-Cbl phosphorylation at Y371, and the phosphorylated c-Cbl dimerizes, translocates into the nucleus and promotes nuclear active β-catenin degradation during the Wnt-on phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shivanna et al., 2015</xref>). TRIM33, another E3 ubiquitin ligase, has been reported to interact with and ubiquitylate nuclear β-catenin, and promote nuclear β-catenin degradation in a GSK-3β and β-TrCP-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xue et al., 2015</xref>). It is unknown where c-Cbl and/or TRIM33 mediated the degradation of the β-catenin/Tfc4/Left1 complex. Future studies will be needed to determine the molecular mechanism(s) responsible for the Hif-3α2-induced β-catenin complex destabilization.</p><p>Another intriguing and potentially important finding made in this study is that Hif-3α2 has HRE-dependent transcriptional activity. The current dogma is that HIFs act as α/β heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Semenza, 2012</xref>). The bHLH domain in HIFα is known to be involved in DNA binding, and the PAS-A and PAS-B domains are proposed to be involved in dimerization with HIF-β and target gene specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Erbel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Simon and Keith, 2008</xref>). Although Hif-3α2 has a TAD, it lacks the bHLH and PAS domains. While our findings suggest that Hif-3α2 has transcriptional activity under normoxia, it is not clear whether this action requires HIF-β. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Makino et al. (2001)</xref> reported that mouse IPAS could not form dimers with HIF-β. Rather, it formed a complex with HIF-1α but this complex did bind to an HRE. Using co-immunoprecipitation assays, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maynard et al. (2005)</xref> showed that HIF-3α4 interacted with HIF-1α when transfected into HEK293 cells. HIF-3α4 also formed a complex with HIF-β. The HIF-3α4/HIF-β complex did not appear to be capable of binding to an HRE, but it inhibited the binding of the HIF-1α/β complex to the HRE in a dose-dependent fashion. A similar relationship between HIF-3α4 and HIF-2α was reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maynard et al., 2007</xref>). The structure of mouse IPAS and human HIF-3α4 is very different from zebrafish Hif-3α2. Mouse IPAS and human HIF-3α4 contain bHLH, PAS-A and -B, and PAC domains but lack the ODD/T-NAD and LIZP domains. In contract, zebrafish Hif-3α2 contains N-TAD and LZIP only. The LZIP domain is only found in HIF-3α among the 3 HIFα isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duan, 2015</xref>). LZIP is the dimerization domain of the ATF-6/CREB subfamily of bZIPs (a class of eukaryotic transcription factors) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vinson et al., 1989</xref>) and it facilitates dimerization and in some cases higher oligomerization of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lu et al., 1997</xref>). LZIP containing regulatory proteins include c-Fos and c-Jun and the LZIP domains in Fos and Jun are necessary for the formation of the AP1 heterodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ransone et al., 1989</xref>). The LZIP domains in Fos and Jun have also been shown to bind to cAMP-responsive elements as a homodimer and can activate transcription from CRE-containing reporter genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lu et al., 1998</xref>). Our available data showed that the ΔLZIP mutant had stronger transcriptional activity. Future studies are needed to elucidate whether Hif-3α2 exerts its HRE-dependent activity independently of Hif β and to determine the functional relationships between Hif-3α2, Hif-3α1, and other Hifα proteins.</p><p>In summary, Hif-3α2 represents a novel and O<sub>2</sub>-insensitive HIF/Hif-3α variants. Hif-3α2 has two distinct functions: activating HRE-dependent gene expression and binding to β-catenin and destabilizing the nuclear β-catenin complex. The corresponding region of human HIF-3α possesses both activities, suggesting that both actions are evolutionarily conserved. In agreement with this notion, Wnt3a knockout mice exhibit randomized internal organ positioning across the midline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nakaya et al., 2005</xref>). The Hif-3α<sup>-/-</sup> mice had enlarged embryonic right atrium and right ventricle and this phenotype became more prominent in neonatal mice and continues until the adult stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yamashita et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, no enlargement was observed in the left ventricle in these mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yamashita et al., 2008</xref>). Our mutation analysis results suggested that different structural element(s) are responsible for these two distinct biological actions. Interestingly, the full-length Hif-3α1, while exhibiting strong HRE-dependent transcriptional activity, does not inhibit β-catenin activity. It is possible that there are structural element(s) in the full-length Hif-3α proteins that mask this important activity. In support of this view, we found that while the full-length human HIF-3α9 has no β-catenin inhibitory activity, deletion of its N-terminal sequence can unmask this ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10—figure supplement 2</xref>). An earlier study suggested that there are structural element(s) in the full-length human HIF-3α inhibiting its ubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Maynard et al., 2003</xref>). Sequence analysis of human and fish HIF/Hifαs indicate that the residues critical for promoting β-catenin degradation are conserved in human and fish HIF/Hifαs. It is possible that all HIFαs may have the ability to interact with β-catenin. Future studies will determine whether this activity is conserved in the full-length HIFαs and reveal how they are regulated. This would explain the inconsistent and even opposite results regarding the interactions between HIF-1/2α and Wnt/β-catenin signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Reagents</title><p>All chemicals were purchased from Fisher Scientific unless otherwise noted.

Your full submission has been evaluated by Charles Sawyers (Senior Editor), Tanya Whitfield (Reviewing Editor), and three peer reviewers. The decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers and the editors. Based on our discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>As you will see, all three reviewers found merit in your study and recognised that this is an important and complex field of study. However, at present there are too many concerns to make your manuscript suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> without major revisions that would be too substantial for what we require at <italic>eLife</italic>. In particular, it was felt that explicit clarification of the effects of your mutation on the various HIF3 isoforms was needed, together with a much more rigorous analysis of the mutant phenotype, particularly in relation to Wnt signalling. The effects on left-right asymmetry, mentioned in the title, were not fully convincing and needed additional support. We would recommend that a more streamlined version of the manuscript, delivering a clearer key message, would be helpful.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Zhang and colleagues analyse the function of a novel hypoxia-inducible factor 3a splice variant in zebrafish and cell culture. This splice variant HIF-3α2 binds β-catenin independently of oxygen availability to destabilise the nuclear β-catenin complex. A detailed analysis uncovers that β-catenin destabilisation by HIF-3a2 occurs independently of its hypoxia response element (HRE) dependent transcriptional activity. In the zebrafish, the authors find HIF-3α2 expressed in all adult tissues analysed. Performing gain and loss of function experiments the authors state that HIF-3α2 is required for left-right asymmetry of the heart due to its repressive function on the formation of the Kupffer's vesicle.</p><p>This manuscript by Zhang and co-workers contains some interesting and well carried out in vitro work adding to the already complex world of HIF proteins. However, I have major concerns regarding the physiological role of HIF-3α2.</p><p>The authors state that HIF-3α2 mRNA overexpression results in general growth retardation and developmental delays (paragraph two, Discussion). They also show varying morphological phenotypes with most embryos looking pretty unhealthy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Their only marker analysis on embryos injected with mRNA of unknown concentration (200-800 pg as stated in the Experimental Procedures is very vague) show an early loss of somitic structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The KV dependent establishment of brain and organ laterality during early embryonic development is a highly sensitive process and is influenced by numerous structures, processes and conditions ranging from cilia formation and motor protein function to gastrulation defects and even temperature (i.e. Basu and Brueckner, 2008; Bisgrove et al., 2005; Capdevilla et al., 2000; Dreosti et al., 2014; Nonaka et al., 1998; Supp et al., 1997; Wilkinson et al., 2009 and others). Given all the alterations observed by the authors, the specificity of the effect on gene expression in the Kupffer's vesicle and its connection to the concomitant rather mild effect on heart laterality needs a vigorous validation. Granted, the in vivo rescue experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> regarding general early morphology look convincing, but canonical Wnt signaling has many important roles during early embryonic development. Therefore a minimum requirement to verify a potential specific effect would be to for instance manipulate gene expression specifically in the DFCs (gain and loss of function) or the KV as has been reported previously (e.g. Caron et al., 2012) and to perform a detailed analysis of KV morphology and function (for instance cilia morphology and functionality). Thereafter, the additional analysis of asymmetric organs other than the heart such as liver, pancreas and brain should be considered to validate the laterality defect.</p><p>The high mortality rate of HIF-3α2 knock out fish (subheading “C RISPR/Cas9-mediated editing of the hif-3α2 locus and ablation of Hif-3α2 increase Wnt/β-c atenin signalling”) emphazises the critical role of this gene during development in processes other than heart laterality, although the cause of the embryonic lethality has not been investigated. The morphological ko-phenotype shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref> looks like a delayed development phenotype and has not much in common with a canonical Wnt phenotype. The same applies to the HIF-3α2 overexpression phenotype.</p><p>The authors' in vivo analysis concentrates on gain of function experiments, which is good because both the morpholino and CRISPR approach will affect also HIF-3α1 gene function if I am not mistaken. This should also be considered by the authors or explained in a more precise way.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This paper describes the functional analysis of a HIF3a2 isoform and finds that it may be involved in downregulating wnt signalling.</p><p>Much of the data is convincing, however if I take a step back, a lot of data hinges on overexpression data which, just like morpholino data, I find it hard to be convinced by. To me the gold standard of proof of functional relevance and importance of a protein function is loss of function studies via genetic mutations.</p><p>I was pleased to see that a mutant had been made. However it was unclear to me what this mutant actually does molecularly, but this may be simply unclear presentation of the data. Importantly, the difference in intron exon structure is not explained properly, &quot;it lacks portions of intron 1 and 11&quot;, this is unclear as spliced RNA has no introns. The figure is too small to get any wiser. Therefore, the paper needs to state the difference between HIF3a1 and HIF3a2 more clearly and explicitly somewhere in the main text; where is the alternative start codon does it correspond to a codon in the a1 isoform? In addition it needs to explain as well that the mutant obtained does NOT affect HIF3a1 and why. A DNA alignment of the 2 variant transcripts with annotated start codon and the deleted sequence in the mutant allele would do all of this. As sequence deletions in the primary transcript might affect splicing of other splice variants a northern blot might be the best way to prove specificity of the mutant.</p><p>The loss-of-function data are the make or break of this paper, and making and analysis of the mutant should not be in an additional figure. They should be at the center of the paper and convince me. qPCR is a nice technique to analyse gene expression differences in mutants, but dangerous as well, can general defects lead to increased gene expression?</p><p>I would be more convinced if a specific mutant phenotype is shown. For instance:</p><p>– Can known &quot;wnt overexpression&quot; phenotypes be identified, like a masterblind-type phenotype? There are various ISH markers that could be used to make such a phenotype visible. If there is no such phenotype, all is not lost….</p><p>– If this is the case, are the HIF3a2 mutants nevertheless interacting with wnt overexpressing mutants? I.e. can they enhance them, can you sort something based on a sensible phenotype and then genotype to show enrichment for the HIF3a2 mutants?</p><p>– Another way of doing this might be: if a clutch of embryos which segregates for the mutant is treated with low doses of wnt activators (e.g., Li), can the mutants be identified in a blinded sorting experiments?</p><p>The phenotype of the mutant is mysterious: early lethal or viable? That does not make sense, and therefore needs to be treated with caution.</p><p>Only a single allele is presented, how do we know it is clean? A second allele needs to be made and transheterozygotes need to show the same phenotype. If the allele is viable, is there a stronger and clearer maternal-zygotic phenotype?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Zhang et al., entitled &quot;An oxygen-insensitive Hif-3α isoform regulates left-right asymmetry be destabilizing the nuclear β-catenin complex&quot;, carries on the challenging, but highly important, work by this research team aiming to unravel the complexities of HIF-3α biology. Research on the O2 labile HIF-α subunits has been dominated by the relatively less complicated HIF1A and HIF2A genomic loci, which encode alternative mRNA species, but are not nearly as complex as human HIF3A which encodes &gt; 19 predicted mRNA variants, and at least 8 distinct polypeptides. As such, the HIF-3α subfamily and its role in HIF biology should clearly be delineated for the sake of completeness. The manuscript reports on a novel Hif-3α variant in zebrafish (&quot;Hif-3α2&quot;) and its possible role in regulating developmental left-right asymmetry. The authors wisely employ CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to complement their Hif-3α overexpression studies, and conclude that Hif-3α imposes its developmental activity via inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Here Hif-3α2 (which lacks bHLH, PAS, and ODD domains) binds β-catenin and destabilizes nuclear β-catenin complexes. Surprisingly this effect is independent of the well-characterized GSK3B pathway and O2 availability, as Hif-3α2 abundance is not regulated by O2 levels. The paper describes novel, O2-independent HIF functions, and suggests that Wnt/β-catenin can be regulated by previously uncharacterized mechanisms.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1) The paper includes a substantial amount of well-controlled experiments, and appropriately complements the Hif-3α overexpression studies with CRISPR-mediated loss of function analyses in zebrafish. However, the Hif-3α2-/- fish exhibit significant mortality rates without showing the degree of morphological changes that might be expected if the deletants had the converse phenotypes detailed for the overexpression (i.e. in vivo gain of function) studies. Can the authors account for this? Is it possible Hif-3α2 effects on Wnt/β-catenin signaling are relatively minor (albeit detectable) compared to other in vivo activities?</p><p>2) The qRT-PCR data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and 1D</xref> do not mirror the RT-PCR amplicons depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>. For example, it is hard to detect an amplicon in the adult kidney, whereas the qRT-PCR data indicate that this is the tissue exhibiting high levels of Hif-3α2 transcripts.</p><p>3) Data shown for both the DFC marker gene, sox17, and number of migrating DFCs, while not statistically significant, suggest experimental trends and should be acknowledged as such.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref> has a labeling error that needs to be corrected so that the data can be interpreted properly.</p><p>5) The direct interaction data shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 3A suggesting β-catenin binds to GST-Hif-3α2, is very modest. Does this indicate a physical association that involves other factors beyond direct binding between the two proteins? Or perhaps in vivo post translational modifications needed?</p><p>6) Data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> indicate that while MG132 treatment results in elevated levels of LEF1, co-expression with Hif-3α2 still resulted in a proportionate reduction in LEF1 protein accumulation. The comment &quot;MG132 also inhibited the Hif-3α2-induced reduction in LEF1 levels&quot; therefore appears to be inaccurate.</p><p>7) The statement &quot;Mutant M2 completely lost its β-catenin inhibitory activity&quot; is not consistent with data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;An oxygen-insensitive Hif-3α isoform inhibits Wnt signaling by destabilizing the nuclear β-catenin complex&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Charles Sawyers (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers. The manuscript is substantially improved but are just a couple of small points from the reviewers that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) Please use the name hif-3αΔ42 instead of hif-3α2 mutant. (Comment from reviewer: It is courageous to state that hif-3α1 function is unaffected in hif-3αΔ42 mutants. This notion is likely with respect to the experimental data presented, but there may still be not identified functional changes due to for instance protein folding or other consequences of the deletion. While I feel that these potentialities do not need further addressing in the current manuscript, hif-3αΔ42 mutants carry a mutation in both hif-3α2 and hif-3α1 and possibly other existing hif-3α forms even if only hif-3α2 function seems affected. Even if this may be semantic, sticking to the naming hif-3αΔ42 instead of hif-3α2 mutant would be scientifically sound.)</p><p>2) How was the DFC cluster size determined? It would be helpful to have this mentioned in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> or its legend.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08996.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</italic></p><p>We are very appreciative of the comments and constructive criticisms. We feel that we already have the additional data and/or explanations to address the three major issues raised by the reviews.</p><p><italic>Issue #1: the HIF-3 isoform specific mutant fish.</italic></p><p>This is arguably the biggest concern. This concern is mostly due to our poor presentation of the data. We have clearly failed to explain the nature of our mutant well enough. This mutant fish line was generated to eliminate the function of the Hifa2 isoform specifically. We have strong evidence that while the Hifa2 mRNA and protein levels were reduced to non-detectable levels, the expression levels of the full-length Hifa1 isoform did not change. More importantly, we will include new data to demonstrate that the mutation did not affect the functionality of the full-length Hifa1 isoform. We will include all these data and re-write this section to give an explicit clarification of the effects of our mutation on the different Hif3 isoforms.</p><p>We are also glad to report that we have obtained an additional mutant fish line. In this new mutant line, both the full-length Hifa1 and the oxygen-independent Hifa2 were targeted. Since the full-length Hifa1 protein is degraded under the normal oxygen condition, this new mutant line can be used to provide additional evidence for our hypothesis.</p><p>We would also like to clarify that the morpholino used was specific for the oxygen-independent Hifa2 isoform. It is our fault again that we did not make it explicitly clear. We will make this point very clear in the revised submission.</p><p><italic>Issue #2: the left-right asymmetry phenotype.</italic></p><p>We have used additional maker genes (spaw and lefty) and confirmed the effect of Hifa2 overexpression on the left-right asymmetry. We have also demonstrated this action of Hif3a2 in the LiPan reporter fish, in which liver is labeled by the expression of DsRed and pancreas by GFP expression). Importantly, overexpression of the full-length Hifa1 protein had no such activity, while the full-length Hifa1 protein was active in reducing body growth.</p><p><italic>Issue #3: the lack of obvious phenotype in the mutant fish.</italic></p><p>We agree that this is a very surprising result. A new study published last week by Dr Didier Stainier's lab (Rossi et al., Nature. 2015 Aug 13;524(7564):230-3. doi: 10.1038/nature14580) showed that in stable knockout of genes in zebrafish activated compensatory mechanisms to buffer against deleterious mutations while such genetic compensation was not observed after translational or transcriptional knockdown. This study is consistent with what we observed. We found that injection of aHifa2 isoform-specific morpholino resulted in phenotypes consistent with increased Wnt signaling activity. We have now performed more rigorous analyses of the phenotypes of the morphants and stable genetic mutant fish.</p><p><italic>As you will see, all three reviewers found merit in your study and recognised that this is an important and complex field of study.

The mutant fish line (<italic>Δ42</italic>) was generated to genetically delete the expression and function of Hif-3α2 specifically. It is our fault that we did not make it explicitly clear. We have re-worked the figure and revised the text to clearly explain the nature of the mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). We have provided data showing that the Hif-3α2 mRNA and protein levels were undetectable in the mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In contrast, the expression and the functionality of the full-length Hif-3α1 remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We have also obtained another allele (<italic>Δ20)</italic>. Both the full-length Hif-3α1 and Hif-3α2 were disrupted in <italic>Δ20 embryos (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Since the full-length Hif-3α1 protein is degraded under normoxia, this new mutant line can provide additional evidence for our hypothesis. I would also like to clarify that the morpholino used was designed to specifically knockdown Hif-3α2. We have modified the relevant figure and re-written the text to give an explicit clarification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>[…] together with a much more rigorous analysis of the mutant phenotype, particularly in relation to Wnt signalling.</italic> </p><p>We have performed additional analyses. The <italic>Δ42</italic> null mutant embryos had significantly elevated mortality between 6-9 hours post fertilization (hpf) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This increase in mortality was also observed in <italic>Δ20</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Most of the surviving mutant embryos, however, looked morphologically normal and continued to develop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In contrast, no mortality increase was detected in the morpholino knocked-down embryos but the morphants displayed phenotypes characteristic of excessive Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). An increase in maternal Wnt signaling was observed in the hif-3α2-/- mutant embryos but absent in the morphants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Further analyses revealed that the hif-3α2-/- mutant embryos displayed a transient and dynamic activation of zygotic Wnt signaling, while a more sustained increase of Wnt signaling was observed in the morphants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). A recent study from Dr. Didier Stainier's lab (Rossi et al., Nature. 2015 Aug 13;524:230-3) showed that stable knockout of genes in zebrafish can activate compensatory mechanisms to buffer against deleterious mutations, while such genetic compensation was not observed after translational or transcriptional knockdown. This notion is consistent with what we observed. In support of this view, we have detected a concomitant reduction in BMP signaling in the hif-3α2-/- mutant embryos but not in the morphants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Following reviewer 2's suggestion, we treated mutant embryos with two <italic>Wnt activating agents</italic> Lithlium and BIO. The results showed that the <italic>mutant embryos were more sensitive to</italic> Lithlium and BIO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8J</xref>). These data are consistent with the view that some compensatory mechanisms may have been activated in the genetic mutant to buffer against deleterious genetic mutation of hif-3α2-/-.</p><p><italic>The effects on left-right asymmetry, mentioned in the title, were not fully convincing and needed additional support.</italic> </p><p>We have analyzed the expression of two additional asymmetrical maker genes (spaw and lft2) and confirmed the effect of Hif-3α2 overexpression on LR asymmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C-D</xref>). We have also investigated this action of Hif-3α2 using the LiPan reporter fish, in which liver is labeled by the expression of DsRed and pancreas by GFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Importantly, overexpression of the full-length Hif-3α1 had no such effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Because the central point of our study is on inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling by an oxygen-insensitive Hif-3α isoform and since the genetic mutant embryos showed little LR phenotype, we have changed the title into &quot;An oxygen-insensitive Hif-3α isoform inhibits Wnt <italic>signaling by destabilizing the nuclear β-catenin complex&quot;</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1: […] Therefore a minimum requirement to verify a potential specific effect would be to for instance manipulate gene expression specifically in the DFCs (gain and loss of function) or the KV as has been reported previously (e.g. Caron et al., 2012) and to perform a detailed analysis of KV morphology and function (for instance cilia morphology and functionality). Thereafter, the additional analysis of asymmetric organs other than the heart such as liver, pancreas and brain should be considered to validate the laterality defect.</italic> </p><p>a) In pilot experiments, we tested different doses (200 pg to 600 pg) of Hif-3α2 mRNA. For the data reported in this manuscript, the injected mRNA dose was 800 pg for Hif-1α’, Hif-3α1’, GFP mRNA, and 600 pg for Hif-3α2 mRNA. This information is now added to the figure legends.</p><p>b) We observed two major phenotypes resulted from Hif-3α2 overexpression. One is the global growth retardation and developmental timing delay. This action apparently requires the transcriptional activity because it was abolished by deletion the TAD domain. Another phenotype is the LR asymmetry defect. This action is unique to Hif-3α2 because no such phenotype was observed in the Hif-3α1 expressing embryos. This action does not appear to require the HRE-dependent transcriptional activity (TA) because the TA dead mutant, A36G mutant, caused a similar heart randomization.</p><p>c) We have added additional data on spaw and lft2 expression patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C-D</xref>). We have also added new data on liver and pancreas location using the LiPan reporter fish line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p><p>d) We agree that the KV dependent establishment of brain and organ laterality is a highly sensitive process and influenced by numerous factors. We showed that overexpression of Hif-3α2 altered LR asymmetry, while the full-length Hif-3α1 protein had no such activity. We examined DFC clustering and migration and found no significant change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A-C</xref>). Wnt signaling plays several distinct roles in vertebrate axis specification. While maternal Wnt/β-catenin signaling contributes to the dorsoventral axis establishment in early embryogenesis, the zygotic Wnt/β-catenin signaling is involved in anteroposterior axis specification. It has been suggested that these two roles are mediated by two distinct sets of target genes. Canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling also regulates KV development and the establishment of the LR axis in zebrafish. Overexpression of Hif-3α2 mainly impairs KV development and results in subsequent changes in organ laterality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This is probably because it takes some time for the injected mRNA to be translated into protein and for resulting biological changes to manifest. Since Hif-3α2 mRNA is maternally deposited, the endogenous Hif-3α2 may act earlier. Indeed, we observed a significant increase in maternal Wnt signaling and early mortality in the hif-3α2-/- embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Since the goal of our study is to determine the role of the oxygen-insensitive Hif-3α2 in regulating Wnt signaling, we did not perform the suggested experiments to manipulate gene expression specifically in the DFCs or the KV. As mentioned earlier, we have modified the title of this manuscript to tone down the emphasis on LR asymmetry development. Another and more practical reason is that the first author of this work has moved on. Given that this manuscript already contains 6 years of work and 10 multi-panel figures plus 14 supplemental figures, we feel that this body of new and original data is sufficient to stand on its own. We sincerely hope the reviewer would agree.</p><p><italic>The high mortality rate of HIF-3α2 knock out fish (subheading “C RISPR/Cas9-mediated editing of the hif-3α2 locus and ablation of Hif-3α2 increase Wnt/β-c atenin signalling”) emphazises the critical role of this gene during development in processes other than heart laterality, although the cause of the embryonic lethality has not been investigated. The morphological ko-phenotype shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref> looks like a delayed development phenotype and has not much in common with a canonical Wnt phenotype. The same applies to the HIF-3α2 overexpression phenotype.</italic> </p><p>We agree that the elevated mortality rate is important. We have more carefully analyzed this phenotype. Six pairs of mutant fish were bred 4 times. The mortality rate varied considerably among different pairs of mutant fish and between different breeding cycles in the same pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), but was significantly higher than that of the wild type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This increase in embryo mortality was also observed in <italic>Δ20</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Most of the surviving mutant embryos, however, looked morphologically normal and continued to develop. In contrast, no mortality increase was detected in the morphants. The morphants displayed phenotypes characteristic of excessive Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The MO effect was unlikely due to toxicity because the Hif-3α2 targeting MO did not increase embryo mortality, nor did it increase p53 mRNA expression at the injected doses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, the hif-3α<italic>Δ42</italic> embryos were less sensitive to Hif-3α2 MO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). These data are consistent with the notion that stable knockout of hif-3α2 may have activated compensatory mechanisms to buffer against deleterious mutations.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] Much of the data is convincing, however if I take a step back, a lot of data hinges on overexpression data which, just like morpholino data, I find it hard to be convinced by. To me the gold standard of proof of functional relevance and importance of a protein function is loss of function studies via genetic mutations. I was pleased to see that a mutant had been made. However it was unclear to me what this mutant actually does molecularly, but this may be simply unclear presentation of the data. Importantly, the difference in intron exon structure is not explained properly, &quot;it lacks portions of intron 1 and 11&quot;, this is unclear as spliced RNA has no introns. The figure is too small to get any wiser. Therefore, the paper needs to state the difference between HIF3a1 and HIF3a2 more clearly and explicitly somewhere in the main text; where is the alternative start codon does it correspond to a codon in the a1 isoform? In addition it needs to explain as well that the mutant obtained does NOT affect HIF3a1 and why. A DNA alignment of the 2 variant transcripts with annotated start codon and the deleted sequence in the mutant allele would do all of this. As sequence deletions in the primary transcript might affect splicing of other splice variants a northern blot might be the best way to prove specificity of the mutant.</italic> </p><p>Following this suggestion, we have re-worked the figure and re-worded the text to clearly explain the nature of the mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). A second allele was also obtained and used in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p><italic>The loss-of-function data are the make or break of this paper, and making and analysis of the mutant should not be in an additional figure. They should be at the center of the paper and convince me. qPCR is a nice technique to analyse gene expression differences in mutants, but dangerous as well, can general defects lead to increased gene expression?</italic> </p><p><italic>I would be more convinced if a specific mutant phenotype is shown. For instance:</italic> </p><p><italic>– Can known &quot;wnt overexpression&quot; phenotypes be identified, like a masterblind-type phenotype? There are various ISH markers that could be used to make such a phenotype visible.

I.e. can they enhance them, can you sort something based on a sensible phenotype and then genotype to show enrichment for the HIF3a2 mutants?</italic> </p><p><italic>– Another way of doing this might be: if a clutch of embryos which segregates for the mutant is treated with low doses of wnt activators (e.g., Li), can the mutants be identified in a blinded sorting experiments?</italic> </p><p>We thank this reviewer for this criticism and helpful suggestion. We have performed additional experiments. The <italic>Δ42</italic> null mutant embryos had significantly elevated mortality in early stages. Among the surviving mutant embryos, a few did show reduced forebrain and smaller eyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). There was a transient increase in both maternal and zygotic Wnt target genes in the surviving and normal looking embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Expression of flh, a mid/caudal diencephalon marker gene, increased at 6 hpf but returned to the control levels at 10 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Following this reviewer's suggestion, we have treated the embryos with Lithium and BIO. A significantly greater portion of the hif-3αΔ42 embryos exhibited the no eye or small eye phenotype compared to the wild type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8J</xref>). We further showed that knockdown of Hif-3α2 significantly increased Wnt/β-catenin activity and resulted in phenotypes resembling those of mbl mutant embryos ((<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These and other data led us to postulate that stable knockout of hif-3α2 has activated compensatory mechanisms to buffer against deleterious mutations.</p><p><italic>The phenotype of the mutant is mysterious: early lethal or viable?

A second allele needs to be made and transheterozygotes need to show the same phenotype.

However, the Hif-3α2-/- fish exhibit significant mortality rates without showing the degree of morphological changes that might be expected if the deletants had the converse phenotypes detailed for the overexpression (i.e.</italic> in vivo <italic>gain of function) studies. Can the authors account for this? Is it possible Hif-3α2 effects on Wnt/β-catenin signaling are relatively minor (albeit detectable) compared to other</italic> in vivo <italic>activities?</italic> </p><p>We agree that the lack of LR axis phenotype was surprising. We have performed additional experiments with this mutant line (<italic>Δ42</italic>) and another mutant line (<italic>Δ20</italic>). In both mutant lines, there were significant increases in Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>—figure upplement 1 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). We also compared the genetic mutants with MO-knocked down embryos (please see responses to editor's comment#2 and Reviewer 2's comments). These data suggested that some compensatory mechanisms have been activated in the genetic mutant to buffer against deleterious genetic mutations of hif-3α2-/-. However, it is also possible that Hif-3α2 may have other activities in vivo. In fact, our results show that Hif-3α2 can regulate gene expression via its TAD domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and this activity is required for its role in body growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We cannot exclude the possibility Hif-3α2 may affect other pathways directly or indirectly. We have discussed these possibilities (paragraph three, Discussion).</p><p><italic>2) The qRT-PCR data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and 1D</xref> do not mirror the RT-PCR amplicons depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>. For example, it is hard to detect an amplicon in the adult kidney, whereas the qRT-PCR data indicate that this is the tissue exhibiting high levels of Hif-3α2 transcripts.</italic> </p><p>We have deleted the redundant RT-PCR data, which were not quantitative.</p><p><italic>3) Data shown for both the DFC marker gene, sox17, and number of migrating DFCs, while not statistically significant, suggest experimental trends and should be acknowledged as such.</italic> </p><p>We have made this point more clear.</p><p><italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref> has a labeling error that needs to be corrected so that the data can be interpreted properly.</italic> </p><p>We have modified the figure.</p><p><italic>5) The direct interaction data shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 3A suggesting β-catenin binds to GST-Hif-3α2, is very modest.

We have replaced the old image with an image from another experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref>). We cannot exclude the possibility that other factors may be involved in this physical association. Post-translational modification is also plausible. These possibilities have been added to the Discussion (paragraph five).</p><p><italic>6) Data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> indicate that while MG132 treatment results in elevated levels of LEF1, co-expression with Hif-3α2 still resulted in a proportionate reduction in LEF1 protein accumulation.

(Comment from reviewer: It is courageous to state that hif-3α1 function is unaffected in hif-3αΔ42 mutants. This notion is likely with respect to the experimental data presented, but there may still be not identified functional changes due to for instance protein folding or other consequences of the deletion. While I feel that these potentialities do not need further addressing in the current manuscript, hif-3αΔ42 mutants carry a mutation in both hif-3α2 and hif-3α1 and possibly other existing hif-3α forms even if only hif-3α2 function seems affected. Even if this may be semantic, sticking to the naming hif-3αΔ42 instead of hif-3α2 mutant would be scientifically sound.)</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewers.
