specialized microenvironments that regulate their self-renewal and differentiation. In the adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> testis stem cell niche, somatic hub cells produce signals that regulate adjacent germline stem cells (GSCs) and somatic cyst stem cells (CySCs). Hub cells are normally quiescent, but after complete genetic ablation of CySCs, they can proliferate and transdifferentiate into new CySCs. Here we find that Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling is upregulated in hub cells after CySC ablation and that the ability of testes to recover from ablation is inhibited by reduced EGFR signaling. In addition, activation of the EGFR pathway in hub cells is sufficient to induce their proliferation and transdifferentiation into CySCs. We propose that EGFR signaling, which is normally required in adult cyst cells, is actively inhibited in adult hub cells to maintain their fate but is repurposed to drive stem cell regeneration after CySC ablation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>stem cell</kwd><kwd>niche cell</kwd><kwd>testis</kwd><kwd>transdifferentiation</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>EGFR</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31HD085748</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Greenspan</surname><given-names>Leah J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HD052937</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matunis</surname><given-names>Erika L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM136665</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matunis</surname><given-names>Erika L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In the adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> testis, normally quiescent niche cells can be forced to re-enter the cell cycle and give rise to new stem cells in response to epidermal growth factor receptor signaling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Stem cells, which are unique in their ability to self-renew and produce daughter cells that differentiate into the mature cells of a tissue, reside in specialized microenvironments, called niches, that contain signals vital for stem cell maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Drummond-Barbosa, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Greenspan et al., 2015</xref>). Loss of a stem cell population due to injury or aging can be detrimental to tissue function, but recent studies have shown that stem cells can be regenerated even after complete loss of a stem cell population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beumer and Clevers, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Greenspan et al., 2015</xref>). In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> testis, both germline and somatic stem cells can be regenerated de novo by conversion of other cell types into stem cells, which makes this well-characterized system an exceptional model for studying the dynamics of stem cell regeneration in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brawley and Matunis, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Greenspan and Matunis, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hétié et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sheng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Voog et al., 2014</xref>). The molecular mechanisms that trigger these events remain largely unknown, but elucidating them could lead to the development of novel regenerative and anti-aging therapies.</p><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> testis niche contains a cluster of somatic hub cells that sends signals to two types of stem cells: germline stem cells (GSCs), which give rise to sperm, and somatic cyst stem cells (CySCs), which give rise to the cyst cells that encase differentiating germ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hardy et al., 1979</xref>). CySCs and hub cells derive from a common pool of precursor cells and are specified early in embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dinardo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Le Bras and Van Doren, 2006</xref>). Hub cells are completely quiescent in adult flies, but after injury to the testis, in the form of genetic ablation of CySCs, they can exit quiescence, leave the hub, and transdifferentiate into CySCs, thereby replenishing the lost population of stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hétié et al., 2014</xref>). The molecular signals that trigger hub cells to re-enter the cell cycle are not known but are likely acting upstream of Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (Cdk4) and its binding partner Cyclin D, since the forced over-expression of these two proteins is sufficient to drive hub cells out of quiescence and into the transdifferentiation program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hétié et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, conversion of adult hub cells into CySCs also occurs when the Snail-family transcription factor Escargot or the tumor suppressor and Cdk4/Cyclin D target Retinoblastoma-family protein (Rbf) is knocked down directly in hub cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Greenspan and Matunis, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Voog et al., 2014</xref>). Although many examples of transdifferentiation have been reported in vitro, there are relatively few examples in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Merrell and Stanger, 2016</xref>), making the upstream events that instruct hub cells to transdifferentiate upon injury to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> testis of interest.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Activation of EGFR signaling in adult hub cells causes them to re-enter the cell cycle.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> testis stem cell niche.

In the developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> testis, the EGFR signaling pathway is essential for the formation and function of cyst cells. While Notch is expressed in all somatic gonadal precursor cells (SGPs) and required for hub cell fate during embryogenesis, EGFR signaling is only expressed in a subset, repressing hub cell fate and enabling these cells to differentiate into cyst lineage cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kitadate and Kobayashi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Okegbe and DiNardo, 2011</xref>). In adult testes, EGFR signaling is required in cyst lineage cells for their encapsulation of germ cells, and this association is vital for germ cell differentiation and maturation into sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hudson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kiger et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sarkar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schulz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tran et al., 2000</xref>). EGFR signaling is also required in the adult germline stem cells to regulate the frequency of their divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Parrott et al., 2012</xref>). Whether EGFR signaling has a role in adult hub cells has not yet been investigated.</p><p>Here, we show that the direct activation of EGFR signaling in adult hub cells is sufficient to cause them to re-enter the cell cycle and transdifferentiate into CySCs. We also provide evidence suggesting that EGFR signaling is required in the hub for testes to recover from CySC ablation. Our results support the hypothesis that EGFR signaling, which normally functions in cyst cells and germ cells in adult testes, is repurposed after complete CySC ablation to drive the de novo formation of stem cells from adjacent quiescent niche cells in an adult tissue.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Activation of EGFR signaling in quiescent adult hub cells is sufficient to trigger cell cycle re-entry</title><p>To identify changes in signaling that are sufficient to drive hub cells into mitosis, we conducted a genetic screen in which we mis-expressed components of major signaling pathways in the adult hub and immunostained testes for mitotic hub cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We used the Gal4-UAS system to conditionally knock down or over-express candidate genes specifically in adult hub cells; candidates included receptors, downstream effectors, and transcription factors from most of the canonical signaling pathways in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Housden and Perrimon, 2014</xref>). Flies carrying the hub-specific driver <italic>E132-Gal4</italic> and the temperature-sensitive Gal4 inhibitor <italic>tub-Gal80<sup>ts</sup></italic> (which we abbreviate as <italic>E132-Gal4, Gal80<sup>ts</sup></italic>) were crossed to flies carrying UAS-based over-expression or knockdown (dominant-negative or RNAi) constructs (<italic>UAS-X</italic>). Crosses were set at permissive temperature (18 °C), and adult male progeny (<italic>E132-Gal4, Gal80<sup>ts</sup> &gt; UAS X</italic>) were shifted to restrictive temperature (31 °C) for 7 days to induce expression of the transgene. Testes were then dissected, fixed, and immunostained for the hub cell marker Fasciclin 3 (Fas3) and the mitotic cell marker Phospho-histone H3 (PH3). As a positive control for our candidate screen, we included testes from flies in which hub cells are forced to re-enter the cell cycle by knockdown of the cell cycle inhibitor Rbf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Greenspan and Matunis, 2018</xref>). As expected, PH3-positive cells were detected in 29–32% of these positive control testes (<italic>E132-Gal4, Gal80<sup>ts</sup> &gt; UAS-Rbf-RNAi</italic>; n = 291 testes; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Importantly, PH3-positive hub cells were not detected in testes from flies serving as negative controls (<italic>E132-Gal4, Gal80<sup>ts</sup> &gt; UAS-GFP-RNAi</italic>; n = 237 testes; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). PH3-positive hub cells were not detected in testes with knockdown or over-expression of most signaling pathways (<italic>E132-Gal4, Gal80<sup>ts</sup> &gt; UAS</italic> X; Appendix 1). However, PH3-positive hub cells were detected in significant numbers of testes from several fly lines over-expressing components of the canonical EGFR/MAPK pathway (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Upon ligand binding, EGFR becomes active and positively regulates Ras; activated Ras initiates a signaling cascade that ultimately activates MAPK, which phosphorylates Pointed, the major activating transcription factor of the pathway (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lusk et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shilo, 2014</xref>). Over-expression of Pointed (either isoform, P1 or P2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Klaes et al., 1994</xref>) or a constitutively active form of EGFR in the hub resulted in significant numbers of testes with PH3-positive hub cells (7% of testes, n = 55, for P1; 6% of testes, n = 100, for P2; or 4% of testes, n = 117, for EGFR; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–G</xref>). Over-expression of constitutively active Ras for 7 days caused testes to develop grossly abnormal or missing hubs (data not shown), complicating the scoring process; however, we found significant numbers of testes with PH3-positive hub cells after a shorter period (3 or 5 days) of constitutively active Ras expression in the hub (11% of testes, n = 18, after 3 days, or 6% of testes, n = 36, after 5 days; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). The percentage of testes with PH3-positive hub cells upon over-expression of EGFR/MAPK pathway components (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) is similar to that seen during recovery from CySC ablation (6–10% testes have PH3-positive hub cells at 1–5 days after ablation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hétié et al., 2014</xref>).

Hub and cyst lineage cells both differentiate from a pool of somatic gonadal precursor cells (SGPs). Notch is activated in almost all SGPs and is required to specify hub cell identity, whereas in posterior SGPs, hub cell fate is repressed by activation of EGFR, causing these cells to differentiate into cyst lineage cells instead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kitadate and Kobayashi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Okegbe and DiNardo, 2011</xref>).

To test if EGFR activation in hub cells is sufficient to drive both hub cell proliferation and transdifferentiation, we performed lineage analysis of hub cells using the Gal4 Technique for Real-time and Clonal Expression (G-TRACE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Evans et al., 2009</xref>). This system, which we used previously to mark cyst lineage cells that arise from transdifferentiating hub cells upon knockdown of Rbf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Greenspan and Matunis, 2018</xref>), marks the nuclei of cells currently expressing Gal4 with a red fluorescent protein (RFP) and permanently marks the nuclei of any cells originating from the Gal4-expressing cells with a green fluorescent protein (GFP). We drove expression of EGFR pathway components (<italic>UAS-X</italic>) and G-TRACE in adult hub cells using <italic>E132-Gal4, Gal80<sup>ts</sup></italic>. Flies were raised at 18 °C and then shifted to 29 °C for 8 days to induce simultaneous expression of <italic>UAS-X</italic> and <italic>G-TRACE</italic>. (At 31 °C, we found high background marking with the G-TRACE system alone, necessitating a lower temperature for this experiment.) In control testes expressing the G-TRACE cassette alone (<italic>E132-Gal4, Gal80<sup>ts</sup> &gt; G-TRACE</italic>), hub cell nuclei were marked with both RFP (real-time Gal4 expression) and GFP (permanent marking expression), but cyst lineage cells outside the hub remained unmarked, as expected (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In testes over-expressing components of the EGFR/MAPK pathway in the hub together with G-TRACE, hub cell nuclei were again marked with RFP and GFP, but we also found GFP-marked nuclei outside the hub in significant numbers of testes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>). Most of the GFP-marked nuclei outside the hub had little to no detectable RFP, indicating that the <italic>E132-Gal4</italic> hub cell driver was no longer expressed in these cells. This observation, together with the morphology and arrangement of these nuclei, suggests that the GFP-marked cells outside the hub are cyst lineage cells that have lost their hub cell identity.

To test this hypothesis, we used <italic>E132-Gal4, Gal80<sup>ts</sup></italic> to drive expression of a Sprouty RNAi knockdown construct (<italic>UAS-sprouty-RNAi</italic>) in adult hub cells.

To determine if hub cells depleted for Sprouty can also transdifferentiate into CySCs, we expressed Sprouty RNAi together with G-TRACE in adult hub cells (<italic>E132-Gal4, Gal80<sup>ts</sup> &gt; UAS-sprouty-RNAi + G-TRACE</italic>). After 8 days, a significant number of testes had GFP-marked cells outside the hub (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), indicating that knockdown of Sprouty in adult hub cells is sufficient to cause their conversion to cyst lineage cells.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Negative regulators of EGFR signaling maintain hub cell quiescence and identity.</title><p>(<bold>A–B, D</bold>) Single confocal sections through the apex of testes immunostained for Fas3 (hub cell membranes, green), PH3 (mitotic chromosomes, nuclear green), and either (<bold>A–B</bold>) Vasa (germ cells, magenta) or (<bold>D</bold>) Traffic jam (Tj; somatic cell nuclei, magenta).

Therefore, we asked whether PTEN is required in adult hub cells. After 7 days of PTEN knockdown in the hub (<italic>E132-Gal4, Gal80<sup>ts</sup> &gt; UAS-Pten-RNAi</italic>), a significant number of testes had PH3-positive hub cells (3% of testes, n = 125; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Knockdown of PTEN in adult hub cells is also sufficient to cause their conversion to cyst lineage cells: after expressing PTEN RNAi together with G-TRACE in adult hub cells for 7 days (<italic>E132-Gal4, Gal80<sup>ts</sup> &gt; UAS-Pten-RNAi + G-TRACE</italic>), we found a significant number of testes with GFP-marked cells outside the hub (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). We conclude that PTEN is required in adult hub cells to maintain their quiescence and prevent their conversion to cyst lineage cells. We did not find PH3-positive hub cells after over-expressing or knocking down other members of the canonical PI3K pathway (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; Appendix 1), which supports the idea that PTEN acts in hub cells by inhibiting EGFR rather than by regulating the PI3K pathway. As further support for this hypothesis, we assayed for EGFR pathway activation using di-phosphorylated ERK (dpERK) as an indicator. Two regulatory residues in ERK/MAPK (encoded by the <italic>rolled</italic> gene in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) are phosphorylated upon pathway activation and can be detected by antibodies specific for dpERK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biggs et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gabay et al., 1997</xref>). We assessed dpERK immunostaining levels in hub cells in flies conditionally expressing PTEN RNAi in the hub (<italic>E132-Gal4, Gal80<sup>ts</sup> &gt; UAS-Pten-RNAi</italic>) or conditionally expressing Sprouty RNAi in the hub (<italic>E132-Gal4, Gal80<sup>ts</sup> &gt; UAS-sprouty-RNAi</italic>) and compared them to control flies with no EGFR pathway perturbations (<italic>y w</italic>). After 7 days at restrictive temperature (31 °C), PTEN and Sprouty knockdown flies both had significantly higher levels of dpERK in the hub than control (<italic>y w</italic>) flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), confirming that the EGFR/MAPK pathway is up-regulated in hub cells upon knockdown of PTEN or Sprouty. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that the EGFR pathway is actively inhibited in adult hub cells by at least two cell-autonomous inhibitors, Sprouty and PTEN, which maintain hub cell quiescence and prevent their conversion to cyst lineage cells.</p><p>The final negative regulator of the EGFR pathway we examined, Argos, is a secreted protein that acts extracellularly by binding to and sequestering the EGF ligand Spitz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Golembo et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Klein et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schweitzer et al., 1995</xref>). To ask if Argos is required cell-autonomously to maintain hub cell quiescence, we drove expression of an Argos RNAi knockdown construct in adult hub cells for 7 days (<italic>E132-Gal4, Gal80<sup>ts</sup> &gt; UAS-argos-RNAi</italic>), but we did not find a significant number of testes with PH3-positive hub cells in this case ( &lt; 1% of testes, n = 170; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). However, Argos is induced by EGFR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Golembo et al., 1996</xref>), which occurs at high levels in cyst lineage cells in adult testes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fairchild et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schulz et al., 2002</xref>), suggesting that cyst lineage cells could be a source of Argos in the testis. To test this hypothesis, we drove expression of <italic>UAS-argos-RNAi</italic> conditionally in adult testes using the cyst lineage driver <italic>C587-Gal4, Gal80<sup>ts</sup></italic> (<italic>C587-Gal4, Gal80<sup>ts</sup> &gt; UAS-argos-RNAi</italic>). After 7 days of knockdown, we found a significant number of testes with PH3-positive hub cells (2% of testes, n = 287; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), supporting the hypothesis that Argos is required non-cell-autonomously to maintain hub cell quiescence in adult testes. For technical reasons, we are unable to drive expression of G-TRACE in hub cells while knocking down Argos in cyst lineage cells, so we cannot assess hub cell transdifferentiation in this case.</p><p>Having found that hub cells can be forced to re-enter the cell cycle by EGFR pathway activation - via over-expression of activators or knockdown of inhibitors - we next asked if over-expression of EGF ligands is sufficient to induce the same phenotype. Four EGF ligands have been identified in <italic>Drosophila</italic>: Gurken, Keren, Spitz, and Vein. Vein is produced as a secreted protein, but the other three are produced as inactive membrane precursors that must be cleaved to produce the active, secreted form of the ligand (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shilo, 2014</xref>). We over-expressed Vein or secreted forms of the other ligands using <italic>E132-Gal4, Gal80<sup>ts</sup></italic> or <italic>C587-Gal4, Gal80<sup>ts</sup></italic> to conditionally drive expression in adult hub cells or cyst lineage cells, respectively. After 6–9 days of ligand over-expression, we did not find a significant number of testes with PH3-positive hub cells with any of these fly strains (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>). We speculated that the levels of EGF produced by these transgenes might not be high enough to override negative regulation by pathway inhibitors, and to test this hypothesis, we drove expression of <italic>UAS-secreted Spitz</italic> and <italic>UAS-argos-RNAi</italic> together in adult testes using <italic>C587-Gal4, Gal80<sup>ts</sup></italic> (<italic>C587-Gal4, Gal80<sup>ts</sup> &gt; UAS-argos-RNAi + UAS-secreted Spitz</italic>). However, the number of testes with PH3-positive hub cells in these flies was not significantly different than in flies expressing <italic>UAS-argos-RNAi</italic> alone (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>). We conclude that over-expression of EGF ligands is not sufficient to trigger loss of hub cell quiescence, or to enhance the loss of quiescence caused by knockdown of the Spitz antagonist Argos, but the reason for these results is not clear.</p><table-wrap id="table4" position="float"><label>Table 4.</label><caption><title>Overexpression of EGF ligands in the adult testis niche does not cause hub cell proliferation.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Gal4 driver</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">UAS line</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Days at 31 °C</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">% Testes with PH3-positive hub cells</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="7" valign="middle">C587-Gal4, Gal80<sup>ts</sup></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">UAS-GFP-RNAi</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BDSC 9330 or 9331</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">7</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0% (n = 0/294)<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table4fn2">*</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">UAS-secreted spitz</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BDSC 63134</td><td align="char" char="ndash" valign="bottom">7–9</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0% (n = 0/219)<sup>a,ns</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">UAS-secreted spitz</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BDSC 58436</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">7</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0% (n = 0/75)<sup>a,ns</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">UAS-gurken ΔTC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Queenan et al., 1999</xref></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">7</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0% (n = 0/82)<sup>a,ns</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">UAS-secreted gurken</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BDSC 58417</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">7</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0% (n = 0/118)<sup>a,ns</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">UAS-secreted keren</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Urban et al., 2002</xref></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">7</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0% (n = 0/113)<sup>a,ns</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">UAS-vein</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schnepp et al., 1996</xref></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">6</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0% (n = 0/96)<sup>a,ns</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="7" valign="middle">E132-Gal4, Gal80<sup>ts</sup></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">UAS-GFP-RNAi</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BDSC 9330 or 9331</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">7</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0% (n = 0/237)<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table4fn2">*</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">UAS-secreted spitz</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BDSC 63134</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">7</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0% (n = 0/208)<sup>a,ns</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">UAS-secreted spitz</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BDSC 58436</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">7</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0% (n = 0/92)<sup>a,ns</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">UAS-gurken ΔTC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Queenan et al., 1999</xref></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">7</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0% (n = 0/86)<sup>a,ns</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">UAS-secreted gurken</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BDSC 58417</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">7</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1% (n = 1/77)<sup>a,ns</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">UAS-secreted keren</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Urban et al., 2002</xref></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">7</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0% (n = 0/113)<sup>a,ns</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">UAS-vein</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schnepp et al., 1996</xref></td><td align="char" char="hyphen" valign="bottom">---</td><td align="char" char="hyphen" valign="bottom">---</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">C587-Gal4, Gal80<sup>ts</sup></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">UAS-secreted spitz +UAS-Argos-RNAi</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BDSC 63134 +BDSC 28383</td><td align="char" char="ndash" valign="bottom">7–9</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2% (n = 4/203)<sup>b,ns</sup></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Fisher’s Exact Test: ns = not significant (a, compared to UAS-GFP-RNAi control;

We began by asking if we could detect activation of the EGFR pathway in hub cells in these testes. Genetic ablation of CySCs is accomplished by using the cyst lineage driver <italic>C587-Gal4, Gal80<sup>ts</sup></italic> to drive expression of the pro-apoptotic gene <italic>grim</italic> in adult testes (<italic>C587-Gal4, Gal80<sup>ts</sup> &gt; UAS</italic> grim); after <italic>grim</italic> expression is withdrawn, hub cells in most testes re-enter the cell cycle, eventually giving rise to new CySCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hétié et al., 2014</xref>).

We shifted control (<italic>C587-Gal4, Gal80<sup>ts</sup></italic>) and experimental (<italic>C587-Gal4, Gal80<sup>ts</sup> &gt; UAS</italic> grim) flies to restrictive temperature (31 °C) for 2 days to ablate all early cyst lineage cells in the experimental flies, and then returned them to permissive temperature (18 °C) for 2 days.

Moreover, this pathway must be actively inhibited in adult hub cells to maintain their quiescence and fate, since loss of the pathway inhibitors Sprouty, Argos, or PTEN is sufficient to drive these phenotypes. We also show that the EGFR pathway is activated in hub cells upon genetic ablation of CySCs and is important for recovery of CySCs from hub cells after ablation. Signaling pathways other than EGFR could also be involved in driving hub cells out of quiescence after CySC ablation.</p><p>In adult testes, the EGF ligand Spitz is known to be secreted from germ cells and received by cyst cells, where activation of the EGFR pathway is essential for their proper encystment of the germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sarkar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schulz et al., 2002</xref>). In the absence of cyst lineage cells – for example, after genetic ablation of CySCs and early cyst cells – we propose that EGF ligands are still secreted from the germ cells but are received by the hub cells instead, promoting their conversion to new CySCs. In support of this model, after genetic ablation of all CySCs and early cyst lineage cells, testes rarely recover CySCs in the absence of germ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">Table 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hétié et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, hub cells do not divide and convert to CySCs after genetic ablation of only some, but not all, CySCs and early cyst lineage cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hétié et al., 2014</xref>), consistent with the idea that hub cell quiescence is maintained by signals from cyst lineage cells. We propose a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) where, after CySC ablation, hub cell proliferation and conversion to CySCs are driven by EGFR signaling, promoted by a new signal (EGF ligands from germ cells) not normally received by the hub, and by loss of an existing signal (the EGFR inhibitor Argos from cyst lineage cells). Once CySCs recover, the inhibitory signal returns, causing EGFR signaling levels in the hub to diminish. Recovery from genetically-induced tissue damage thus depends on the coordination of signals between different cell types within the testis stem cell niche. Future studies of the cellular distribution of EGFR signaling pathway components within the niche could be informative in understanding how these signals are coordinated in unperturbed and recovering niches.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Model for cyst lineage recovery after ablation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In wild type testes, EGF ligands (red circles) are secreted by germ cells and received by cyst lineage cells. The EGFR pathway is repressed in hub cells by the secreted inhibitor Argos (yellow squares), which sequesters EGF ligands, and by intrinsic pathway inhibitors (Sprouty and PTEN). Hub quiescence and identity are maintained. (<bold>B</bold>) After genetic ablation of all CySCs and early cyst lineage cells, EGF ligands are no longer sequestered by Argos and are received by the hub. The EGFR pathway is activated in hub cells, driving expression of the downstream transcription factor Pointed and its target genes, resulting in hub cell proliferation and conversion to CySCs. As new CySCs are generated, Argos is once again expressed, down-regulating EGFR signaling in the hub.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-70810-fig5-v1.tif"/></fig><p>A similar example of cellular plasticity in a stem cell niche was recently described in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary, where two types of stem cells, germline stem cells and somatic follicle stem cells (FSCs), are housed in distinct niches at the apical ends of each ovary. A niche for FSCs is created by adjacent escort cells (aka inner germarial sheath cells), which do not give rise to new FSCs under normal conditions; however, under starvation conditions or upon forced activation of mTOR or Toll signaling in escort cells, these cells can convert into new FSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rust et al., 2020</xref>). Another example comes from the mouse small intestine, where quiescent Paneth cells, which create a niche for adjacent <italic>Lgr5+</italic> stem cells, can replace stem cells that are lost as a result of inflammation-induced damage or irradiation to the tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schmitt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yu et al., 2018</xref>). The ability of quiescent niche cells to convert to stem cells in response to tissue damage is therefore likely to be a general feature of adult stem cell niches.</p><p>In flies recovering from genetic ablation of CySCs, when <italic>Egfr</italic> gene dosage is reduced, transdifferentiation of hub cells into CySCs and ectopic niche formation are both affected, happening less often than in control flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">Table 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6">Table 6</xref>). However, in otherwise wild-type flies, forced activation of EGFR signaling in hub cells is sufficient for hub cell transdifferentiation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) but not for ectopic niche formation. This result is surprising because hub cell transdifferentiation and ectopic niche formation are both common in testes with forced expression of cell cycle activators or knockdown of a cell cycle inhibitor in hub cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hétié et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Greenspan and Matunis, 2018</xref>). Interestingly, no ectopic niches were reported in testes after depletion of the transcription factor Escargot from the hub, which causes hub cells to transdifferentiate into CySCs without also re-entering the cell cycle, resulting in the complete loss of hub cells over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Voog et al., 2014</xref>). Taken together, these studies suggest that the transdifferentiation of hub cells to CySCs does not by itself cause ectopic niche formation, and that additional factors must come into play in some cases to push testes towards this abnormal phenotype. This is of interest, since the regulation of niche number across tissues, particularly during regeneration, is not understood. What factors regulate regeneration, and how multiple signals from different cell types interact after injury to a tissue to ensure its proper recovery, are questions with important implications for regenerative medicine.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> husbandry and strains</title><p>Flies were raised on a standard yeast/cornmeal/molasses medium (1212.5 mL water, 14.7 mL agar, 20.4 g yeast, 81.8 g cornmeal, 109.1 ml molasses, 10.9 mL Tegosept, 3.4 mL propionic acid, 0.4 mL phosphoric acid per tray of 100 vials) supplemented with dry yeast at 18 °C unless otherwise indicated.

Your article is being evaluated by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation is being overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Utpal Banerjee as the Senior Editor.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Several strengths of the manuscript were noted by the Reviewers including well designed experiments, use of the appropriate fly genetics tools, well described transdifferentiation phenotype of quiescent niche cells into stem cells in the fly testis and elucidating the role of EGFR signaling in this process. The Reviewers also suggested critical experiments that were missing. Some of these include the explanation for relatively low % of hub cells activated by EGFR signaling that enter into mitosis, and knocking down some of the other negative regulators (such as PTEN and others) that could compensate for over expression of EGFR pathway. Rev 3 also raised a concern that there is not sufficient evidence to localize the source of EGFs to the germ cell population.</p><p>Based on these and their other more detailed comments (described below), I am recommending a revision of your manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>They first showed that, during steady state, EGRF signaling is suppressed in the hub cells, maintaining these cells quiescent, while its forced activation (e.g., by means of induction of activated form of the receptor and inhibiting intracellular suppressors) results in the cell cycle activation and transdifferentiation to CySCs. They also showed that EGFR signaling plays vital roles in the previously reported transdifferentiation process triggered by the ablation of CySCs and/or early cyst cells, by means of changing signal strength using EGFR heterozygotes.</p><p>The authors further demonstrated that suppression of a secreted inhibitor of EGF ligands (i.e., Argos) elicits the hub-to-CySC transdifferentiation. Based on this finding, in combination with the previous observations that EGF ligands secreted from the germ cells (presumptively GSCs) induces the encapsulation of germ cells by cyst cells, and that germ cells are indispensable for the recovery of depleted CySCs (most likely through transdifferentiation), they have proposed an interesting model. In particular, they hypothesize that, in steady state, although GSC-derived EGFR ligands act on the cyst (stem) cells to promote encapsulation, their action does not reach the hub cells through the function of Argos (secreted by CySCs), suppressing the cell cycle entry and transdifferentiation program in the hub. However, when CySCs are ablated, the loss of Argos results in the activation of proliferation and transdifferentiation program in the hub cells to replenish the lost CySCs.</p><p>Throughout, this study has been conducted thoroughly and well documented, and the proposed model is interesting. Whilst, although series of genetical analyses consistently support this hypothesis, it remains puzzling what underpins the differential interplay between EGFR ligands and Argos between different target cells. In particular, while Argos inhibits the effect of the ligands on the hub cells, it appears not to affect the action on CySCs. I am fully convinced that this model is supported from a genetics point of view, but there should be some additional mechanism that remains to be elucidated. It would make this study really a strong piece of work, beyond an increment of their previous study, if some insights has been made to this remaining question. Naively, I would suspect that some spatial (local) separation of the ligands, EGFR, and the inhibitor (Argos) could explain this puzzle. For example, on the CySCs, EGFR could be displayed on their surface toward GSCs, while Argos could be secreted to the opposite, outside the capsule to antagonize the leaked ligands, and/or to the site of GSC-hub interaction. The localization of EGFR on the hub could be an important component of such differential action. Is it ever possible to investigate the local distribution of these factors in the undisturbed and CySC-depleted gonads?</p><p>Another point is that the conclusion that EGFR signaling is NOT involved in the formation of ectopic hub following the genetic ablation of CySCs, another striking discovery by the authors, is not convincing. The authors only showed that the NULL HYPOTHESIS that the induction efficiency of ectopic hub is not affected by suppressing the EGFR signaling was NOT REJECTED statistically. Of course, this results does not support the afore-mentioned conclusion. Indeed, the actual values of the occurrence of ectopic hubs was lower in the EGFR heterozygous background compared with the wild-type situation (19% vs 32%, albeit the non-significant statistical difference). Based on the current dataset and analyses, the authors may not be able to draw any conclusions with regard to the involvement of EGFR signaling in the ectopic hub formation. Further data collection and/or more careful statistical analyses would be essential to discuss this issue appropriately.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Greenspan et al., characterizes the role of Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling in the transdifferentiation of hub cells in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> testis stem cell niche, facilitating the replenishment of somatic cyst stem cells after ablation. The myriad of genetic manipulation approaches that the authors use to demonstrate the involvement of the EGFR pathway in transdifferentiation in vivo is truly impressive, and provides a convincing picture that supports the overall conclusions.</p><p>Some points that require clarification / suggestions to strengthen the manuscript:</p><p>– It is not clear as to why, if EGFR is the master regulator of this transactivation process, the percentage of testes with hub cells recruited into mitosis is lower following EGFR activation (4%) than with activation of downstream effectors/transcription factors (i.e. Pointed and Ras – up to 11% mitotic activation). Also, it is noted that during recovery from CySC ablation, 6-10% of testes have mitotic hub cells, again a higher percentage than following EGFR activation. This highlights the possibility that there may be other signaling pathways at play that could act on similar effector molecules.</p><p>– The authors note that a large-scale genetic screen was conducted to mis-express components of numerous major signaling pathways and subsequently identify resumption of mitosis in quiescent hub cells. The 'negative' results of this screen are eluded to several times throughout the manuscript, however a summary of the data is not shown. A summary of the genes / pathways that were mis-expressed would be a useful resource to include in the paper, even if this manipulation had no effect on hub-cell transdifferentiation.</p><p>– Why is significant mitotic activation seen in hub cells after activation of Egfr type II but not type I? Would perhaps be useful to provide some explanation in the text.</p><p>– Activation of EGFR is less effective at driving hub cells into mitosis then the activation of Pointed or Ras, but activation of EGFR seems to be more effective at instigating transdifferentiation in G-TRACE experiments. Can the authors speculate on what the cause of this discrepancy may be?</p><p>– Over-expression of EGF ligands was shown to be insufficient to trigger loss of hub-cell quiescence and the authors hypothesise that this could be because negative regulators of the EGF pathway (Sprouty, PTEN, Argos) override this effect. Would it be possible to test this hypothesis by knocking down inhibitor(s) while simultaneously over-expression ligand(s) to show that the effect on hub cell transdifferentiation is increased when compared to inhibitor knockdown alone?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The reported findings represent exciting new advances to the field in our understanding of the regulation of homeostasis and regeneration. The authors have utilized genetic approaches to systematically dissect EGF signaling among the hub and CySC populations, including highly complex multi-gene approaches. However, there are some missing controls that would support conclusions that MAPK signaling downstream EGFR participates in the exit from quiescence. Furthermore, the authors assume EGF ligands derive from the germ cell population (portrayed in Figure 5), but the source of EGF ligands remains undetermined. Finally, the participation of PTEN in both hub proliferative activation and transdifferentiation may also suggest that additional pathways may participate in both processes, particularly in the absence of evidence that PTEN promotes EGFR degeneration within the hub. Collectively, however, the studies are of high quality and well written in a manner appropriate for the journal.</p><p>– The authors need to better connect activation of the MAPK pathway to proliferative and transdifferentiation responses in the hub. A simple control can be staining Argos, PTEN, and Sprouty knockdowns for dpERK to determine whether or not activation of the MAPK pathway coincides with proliferation and transdifferentiation (in the case with PTEN and Sprout knockdowns only).</p><p>– The authors indicate the inhibition of EGF signaling at 3 locations, externally via Argos and inside the hub cell via PTEN or Sprouty, suppresses the onset of hub proliferation and transdifferentiation. Each target individually contributes to the inhibition, suggesting that either multiple upstream signals converge on the MAPK pathway or the three components act synergistically to inhibit the MAPK pathway. For example, with PTEN knockdown, proliferation and transdifferentiation are induced with Sprouty intact. Similarly, in the absence of Argos in CySCs, proliferation is still triggered despite intact downstream inhibition via PTEN and Sprouty. To disseminate whether the inhibitors act in conjunction or from separate pathways, the authors need to perform compound knockdowns of paired targets (i.e. Sprouty + PTEN). Understandably for technical reasons, combined knockdowns of Argos and Sprouty or PTEN are not feasible.</p><p>– In the absence of proliferation induction with EGF ligand overexpression from either hub cells or CySCs, there is not sufficient evidence to localize the source of EGFs to the germ cell population (depicted in Figure 5), even with circumstantial evidence from regeneration experiments in Figure 4 that illustrate the presence of germ cells while the hub regenerates. To localize the source of EGF ligands to germ cells given limitations noted in the study, the authors could perform compound ablation using both the C587-Gal4 driver alongside a germ-cell specific driver.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70810.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>They first showed that, during steady state, EGRF signaling is suppressed in the hub cells, maintaining these cells quiescent, while its forced activation (e.g., by means of induction of activated form of the receptor and inhibiting intracellular suppressors) results in the cell cycle activation and transdifferentiation to CySCs.

Naively, I would suspect that some spatial (local) separation of the ligands, EGFR, and the inhibitor (Argos) could explain this puzzle. For example, on the CySCs, EGFR could be displayed on their surface toward GSCs, while Argos could be secreted to the opposite, outside the capsule to antagonize the leaked ligands, and/or to the site of GSC-hub interaction. The localization of EGFR on the hub could be an important component of such differential action. Is it ever possible to investigate the local distribution of these factors in the undisturbed and CySC-depleted gonads?</p></disp-quote><p>We tested several transgene reagents, such as EGFR-GFP, which unfortunately did not reveal receptor distribution in our system. We also tried immunostaining for EGFR, Spitz, and Argos, but as is often the case for secreted factors and their cell-surface receptors, we were not able to detect a reliable signal above background. Building additional reagents to test receptor localization is beyond the scope of this current study, but these are interesting questions for future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another point is that the conclusion that EGFR signaling is NOT involved in the formation of ectopic hub following the genetic ablation of CySCs, another striking discovery by the authors, is not convincing. The authors only showed that the NULL HYPOTHESIS that the induction efficiency of ectopic hub is not affected by suppressing the EGFR signaling was NOT REJECTED statistically. Of course, this results does not support the afore-mentioned conclusion. Indeed, the actual values of the occurrence of ectopic hubs was lower in the EGFR heterozygous background compared with the wild-type situation (19% vs 32%, albeit the non-significant statistical difference). Based on the current dataset and analyses, the authors may not be able to draw any conclusions with regard to the involvement of EGFR signaling in the ectopic hub formation. Further data collection and/or more careful statistical analyses would be essential to discuss this issue appropriately.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for encouraging us to repeat this experiment. Upon analyzing many more testes, we found that ectopic niche formation was very significantly reduced in testes lacking one copy of Egfr compared to control testes. We have added these new data to Table 6 and revised the text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The manuscript by Greenspan et al., characterizes the role of Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling in the transdifferentiation of hub cells in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> testis stem cell niche, facilitating the replenishment of somatic cyst stem cells after ablation. The myriad of genetic manipulation approaches that the authors use to demonstrate the involvement of the EGFR pathway in transdifferentiation in vivo is truly impressive, and provides a convincing picture that supports the overall conclusions.</p><p>Some points that require clarification / suggestions to strengthen the manuscript:</p><p>– It is not clear as to why, if EGFR is the master regulator of this transactivation process, the percentage of testes with hub cells recruited into mitosis is lower following EGFR activation (4%) than with activation of downstream effectors/transcription factors (i.e. Pointed and Ras – up to 11% mitotic activation). Also, it is noted that during recovery from CySC ablation, 6-10% of testes have mitotic hub cells, again a higher percentage than following EGFR activation. This highlights the possibility that there may be other signaling pathways at play that could act on similar effector molecules.</p></disp-quote><p>The apparent differences in the percentage of positive testes upon activation of EGFR vs. downstream pathway members are not significant, but we agree that other signaling pathways could be involved in recovery of CySCs after ablation. We have clarified this point in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors note that a large-scale genetic screen was conducted to mis-express components of numerous major signaling pathways and subsequently identify resumption of mitosis in quiescent hub cells. The 'negative' results of this screen are eluded to several times throughout the manuscript, however a summary of the data is not shown. A summary of the genes / pathways that were mis-expressed would be a useful resource to include in the paper, even if this manipulation had no effect on hub-cell transdifferentiation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have added a summary of the genes and pathways tested in our screen (Appendix 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Why is significant mitotic activation seen in hub cells after activation of Egfr type II but not type I? Would perhaps be useful to provide some explanation in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We have not independently tested the strength of these constructs, so the reason for the difference is not clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Activation of EGFR is less effective at driving hub cells into mitosis then the activation of Pointed or Ras, but activation of EGFR seems to be more effective at instigating transdifferentiation in G-TRACE experiments. Can the authors speculate on what the cause of this discrepancy may be?</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, the differences in percentage of testes with mitotic hub cells (Table 1) are not statistically significant. In the G-TRACE experiments, the percentages of positive testes are significantly different between EGFR, P1, and P2 (p &lt; 0.05 by ANOVA). However, it’s not clear whether the differences are biologically relevant or reflect differences in transgene strength, genetic background (with or without the G-TRACE system), or some other factor, and teasing apart these potential factors would require experiments beyond the scope of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Over-expression of EGF ligands was shown to be insufficient to trigger loss of hub-cell quiescence and the authors hypothesise that this could be because negative regulators of the EGF pathway (Sprouty, PTEN, Argos) override this effect. Would it be possible to test this hypothesis by knocking down inhibitor(s) while simultaneously over-expression ligand(s) to show that the effect on hub cell transdifferentiation is increased when compared to inhibitor knockdown alone?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. To address this question, we used the conditional cyst lineage driver c587-Gal4; Gal80[ts] to knock down Argos and over-express Spitz concurrently. Contrary to our expectations, we found that the percentage of testes with dividing hub cells in these flies was not significantly different than in flies with Argos knockdown alone. We have added these data to Table 4, but as we discuss in the text, the reason for this result is not clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The reported findings represent exciting new advances to the field in our understanding of the regulation of homeostasis and regeneration. The authors have utilized genetic approaches to systematically dissect EGF signaling among the hub and CySC populations, including highly complex multi-gene approaches. However, there are some missing controls that would support conclusions that MAPK signaling downstream EGFR participates in the exit from quiescence. Furthermore, the authors assume EGF ligands derive from the germ cell population (portrayed in Figure 5), but the source of EGF ligands remains undetermined. Finally, the participation of PTEN in both hub proliferative activation and transdifferentiation may also suggest that additional pathways may participate in both processes, particularly in the absence of evidence that PTEN promotes EGFR degeneration within the hub. Collectively, however, the studies are of high quality and well written in a manner appropriate for the journal.</p><p>– The authors need to better connect activation of the MAPK pathway to proliferative and transdifferentiation responses in the hub. A simple control can be staining Argos, PTEN, and Sprouty knockdowns for dpERK to determine whether or not activation of the MAPK pathway coincides with proliferation and transdifferentiation (in the case with PTEN and Sprout knockdowns only).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We assessed dpERK immunostaining levels upon conditional knockdown of PTEN or Sprouty in the hub and compared them to control flies (y w) with no EGFR pathway perturbation. We found that dpERK levels in hub cells were significantly elevated upon knockdown of PTEN or Sprouty, consistent with activation of the MAPK pathway, and we have added these new data to Figure 3. We tried to assess dpERK levels upon knockdown of Argos in cyst lineage cells, but for reasons that are not clear, we got very inconsistent results for this combination and for the cyst lineage driver alone, and we have not included these data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors indicate the inhibition of EGF signaling at 3 locations, externally via Argos and inside the hub cell via PTEN or Sprouty, suppresses the onset of hub proliferation and transdifferentiation. Each target individually contributes to the inhibition, suggesting that either multiple upstream signals converge on the MAPK pathway or the three components act synergistically to inhibit the MAPK pathway. For example, with PTEN knockdown, proliferation and transdifferentiation are induced with Sprouty intact. Similarly, in the absence of Argos in CySCs, proliferation is still triggered despite intact downstream inhibition via PTEN and Sprouty. To disseminate whether the inhibitors act in conjunction or from separate pathways, the authors need to perform compound knockdowns of paired targets (i.e. Sprouty + PTEN). Understandably for technical reasons, combined knockdowns of Argos and Sprouty or PTEN are not feasible.</p></disp-quote><p>While we agree that this is an interesting question, we believe that the results of such an experiment would be difficult to interpret. These knockdowns are dependent on RNAi constructs, which (unlike null alleles) do not result in complete knockdown of a gene. Therefore, if paired targets were to result in a stronger phenotype, we could not distinguish between stronger knockdown of inhibitors in one pathway vs. combined partial knockdown of two pathways.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In the absence of proliferation induction with EGF ligand overexpression from either hub cells or CySCs, there is not sufficient evidence to localize the source of EGFs to the germ cell population (depicted in Figure 5), even with circumstantial evidence from regeneration experiments in Figure 4 that illustrate the presence of germ cells while the hub regenerates. To localize the source of EGF ligands to germ cells given limitations noted in the study, the authors could perform compound ablation using both the C587-Gal4 driver alongside a germ-cell specific driver.</p></disp-quote><p>While we agree that the compound ablation would be a nice experiment to add, we have found that germ cells and cyst cells do not respond equally well to the same death-inducing transgenes, and building flies with all the required transgenes is technically challenging. Fortunately, germ cells are already known to be a source of the EGF ligand Spitz (Sarkar et al., 2007), which we have clarified in the text.</p></body></sub-article></article>
