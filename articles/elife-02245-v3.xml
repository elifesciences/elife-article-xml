In C<sub>3</sub> plants (e.g., rice, wheat), elevated concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (eCO<sub>2</sub>) reduce protein and nitrogen concentrations, and can increase the total non-structural carbohydrates (TNC; mainly starch, sugars). However, contradictory findings have obscured the effect of eCO<sub>2</sub> on the ionome—the mineral and trace-element composition—of plants. Consequently, CO<sub>2</sub>-induced shifts in plant quality have been ignored in the estimation of the impact of global change on humans. This study shows that eCO<sub>2</sub> reduces the overall mineral concentrations (−8%, 95% confidence interval: −9.1 to −6.9, p&lt;0.00001) and increases TNC:minerals &gt; carbon:minerals in C<sub>3</sub> plants. The meta-analysis of 7761 observations, including 2264 observations at state of the art FACE centers, covers 130 species/cultivars. The attained statistical power reveals that the shift is systemic and global. Its potential to exacerbate the prevalence of ‘hidden hunger’ and obesity is discussed.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02245.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02245.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02245.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Rice and wheat provide two out every five calories that humans consume. Like other plants, crop plants convert carbon dioxide (or CO<sub>2</sub>) from the air into sugars and other carbohydrates. They also take up minerals and other nutrients from the soil.</p><p>The increase in CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere that has happened since the Industrial Revolution is thought to have increased the production of sugars and other carbohydrates in plants by up to 46%. CO<sub>2</sub> levels are expected to rise even further in the coming decades; and higher levels of CO<sub>2</sub> are known to lead to lower levels of proteins in plants. But less is known about the effects of CO<sub>2</sub> levels on the concentrations of minerals and other nutrients in plants.</p><p>Loladze has investigated the effect of rising CO<sub>2</sub> levels on the nutrient levels in food plants by analyzing data on 130 varieties of plants: his dataset includes the results of 7761 observations made over the last 30 years, by researchers around the world. Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> levels were found to reduce the overall concentration of 25 important minerals—including calcium, potassium, zinc, and iron—in plants by 8% on average. Furthermore, Loladze found that an increased exposure to CO<sub>2</sub> also increased the ratio of carbohydrates to minerals in these plants.</p><p>This reduction in the nutritional value of plants could have profound impacts on human health: a diet that is deficient in minerals and other nutrients can cause malnutrition, even if a person consumes enough calories. This type of malnutrition is common around the world because many people eat only a limited number of staple crops, and do not eat enough foods that are rich in minerals, such as fruits, vegetables, dairy and meats. Diets that are poor in minerals (in particular, zinc and iron) lead to reduced growth in childhood, to a reduced ability to fight off infections, and to higher rates of maternal and child deaths.</p><p>Loladze argues that these changes might contribute to the rise in obesity, as people eat increasingly starchy plant-based foods, and eat more to compensate for the lower mineral levels found in crops. Looking to the future, these findings highlight the importance of breeding food crops to be more nutritious as the world's CO<sub>2</sub> levels continue to rise.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02245.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02245.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>elevated CO<sub>2</sub></kwd><kwd>zinc</kwd><kwd>iron</kwd><kwd>ionome</kwd><kwd>crops</kwd><kwd>human nutrition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The author declares that there was no external funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Increasing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide reduce the mineral content but increase the levels of starch and sugars found in crop plants; which could exacerbate both obesity and malnutrition in some human populations.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mankind's ultimate source of carbohydrates is atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) converted by photosynthesis to sugars. The bulk of the terrestrial conversion of CO<sub>2</sub>-to-carbohydrates is done by C<sub>3</sub> plants, which account for over three quarters of global primary production and for over 90% of Earth's plant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Still and Berry, 2003</xref>). (<italic>If not stated otherwise, hereafter, terms ‘plant(s)’ and ‘crop(s)’ refer to C<sub>3</sub> species</italic>). When exposed to CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations twice the preindustrial level of ∼280 ppm, plants increase the synthesis of carbohydrates by 19–46% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Leakey et al., 2009</xref>). Currently, CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations are reaching 400 ppm—the highest level since the dawn of agriculture and likely to be the highest since the rise of modern humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Siegenthaler et al., 2005</xref>). Within a single human lifespan, CO<sub>2</sub> levels are projected to reach 421–936 ppm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">IPCC, 2013</xref>). Will rising CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations—one of the most certain and pervasive aspects of global climate change—alter the quality of crops and wild plants? Will the CO<sub>2</sub>-induced stimulation of carbohydrate synthesis increase the carbohydrates-to-minerals ratio in crops? Can such shifts in crop quality affect human nutrition and health?</p><p>Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> effects on plant <italic>quantity</italic> (productivity and total biomass) have been extensively studied and show higher agricultural yields for crops, including wheat, rice, barley, and potato. But eCO<sub>2</sub> effects on plant <italic>quality</italic>, and possible cascading effects on human nutrition, have been largely ignored in the estimation of the impact of eCO<sub>2</sub> on humans. Notably, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">IPCC (2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">2013)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">AAAC Climate Science Panel (2014)</xref> include direct CO<sub>2</sub> effects (e.g., ocean acidification) in their climate change assessments but do not mention any CO<sub>2</sub> effects on crop or wild plant quality. However, it is unwarranted to assume that plants will balance the increased carbohydrate synthesis with other adjustments to their physiology to maintain the nutritional quality for their consumers in a state of unperturbed homeostasis. The stoichiometry—the relative ratios of chemical elements—in plants is plastic and, to a considerable degree, reflects their environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib149">Sterner and Elser, 2002</xref>). However, detecting CO<sub>2</sub>-induced shifts in plant quality is challenging for several reasons. First, plant quality involves multiple nutritional currencies, for example macronutrients (carbohydrates, protein, and fat) and micronutrients (minerals, vitamins and phytonutrients). Assessing relative changes within and among multiple currencies requires significantly more effort and funding than measuring only plant quantity (e.g., yield). Second, plant quality, including the plant ionome—all the minerals and trace-elements found in a plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Lahner et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Salt et al., 2008</xref>)—is inherently variable; and measurement imprecisions further amplify the variability. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Stefan et al. (1997)</xref> report the accuracy test for 39 facilities that analyzed samples of the same plant tissues: the inter-laboratory variance was 6.5% for N, but twice as large for phosphorus (P) and calcium (Ca), and reached 130% for sodium (Na). Therefore, CO<sub>2</sub>-induced changes in the plant ionome (the signal) can be easily lost amid highly variable data (the noise), especially when such data are limited and sample sizes are small. However, it is important to bear in mind that a low signal-to-noise ratio <italic>does not</italic> imply that the signal is practically insignificant, especially if it is global and sustained—a point revisited in the ‘Discussion’.</p><sec id="s1-1"><title>Elusive CO<sub>2</sub> effect on the plant ionome: contradictory findings</title><p>The first empirical evidence of lower mineral content in plants exposed to eCO<sub>2</sub> appeared at least over a quarter century ago (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Porter and Grodzinski, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Peet et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">O’Neill et al., 1987</xref>). Physiological mechanisms responsible for the overall decline of plant mineral content—with expected changes being <italic>non-uniform</italic> across minerals—have been proposed: the increased carbohydrate production combined with other eCO<sub>2</sub> effects such as reduced transpiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Loladze, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">McGrath and Lobell, 2013</xref>). However, most of the experimental evidence showing CO<sub>2</sub>-induced mineral declines came from artificial facilities, mainly closed chambers and glasshouses, and many results were statistically non-significant. This led some research groups to challenge altogether the notion of lower mineral content in plants exposed to eCO<sub>2</sub> in field conditions. Such conditions are most accurately represented in Free-Air Carbon dioxide Enrichment (FACE) centers, which have been established in at least 11 countries.</p><p>In the grains of rice harvested at four FACE paddies in Japan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Lieffering et al. (2004)</xref> found no decline in any of the minerals but lower N content. The result disagreed with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Seneweera and Conroy (1997)</xref>, who were the first to report lower iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) in grains of rice grown at eCO<sub>2</sub> and warned that altered rice quality can negatively affect developing countries. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Lieffering et al. (2004)</xref>, however, argued that the result of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Seneweera and Conroy (1997)</xref> could be an artifact of growing rice in pots, which restrict rooting volumes. They hypothesized that in FACE studies, which provide unrestricted rooting volumes, plants would increase uptake of all minerals to balance the increased carbohydrate production. This hypothesis, however, found no support in the FACE studies of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Pang et al. (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib174">Yang et al. (2007)</xref> (carried out in China and latitudinally not very far from the study in Japan), who found that eCO<sub>2</sub> significantly altered the content of several minerals in rice grains.</p><p>The contradictory results coming from these studies on rice seem perplexing, especially in light of the very robust effect that eCO<sub>2</sub> has on N in non-leguminous plants. Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> reduces N concentrations by 10–18% systemically throughout various tissues: leaves, stems, roots, tubers, reproductive and edible parts, including seeds and grains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cotrufo et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Jablonski et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib152">Taub et al., 2008</xref>). If the increased carbohydrate production dilutes the nutrient content in plants, why does the dichotomy seem to exist between the responses of N and minerals to eCO<sub>2</sub>? In addition to the carbohydrate dilution and reduced transpiration, eCO<sub>2</sub> can further lower N concentrations in plants by: (1) reducing concentrations of Rubisco—one of the most abundant proteins on Earth that comprises a sizable N-pool in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Drake et al., 1997</xref>), and (2) inhibiting nitrate assimilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bloom et al., 2010</xref>). Hence, it is reasonable to expect the effect of eCO<sub>2</sub> on N to be larger and, thus, easier to discern than its effect on most minerals. The stronger signal for N, combined with the plentiful and less noisy data on this element, can help explain why by the end of last century the effect of eCO<sub>2</sub> on N had been already elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cotrufo et al., 1998</xref>), but its effect on minerals has remained elusive.</p><p>The obscure nature of the effect of eCO<sub>2</sub> on minerals becomes particularly apparent in the largest to date meta-analysis on the issue by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Duval et al. (2011)</xref>, who fragmented data from 56 eCO<sub>2</sub> studies into 67 cases. In 47 of the cases, the effect of eCO<sub>2</sub> on minerals was statistically non-significant, that is the 95% Confidence Interval (CI) for the effect size overlapped with 0. The remaining 20 cases were statistically significant but showed no pattern: for example, Fe increased in grasses but decreased in trees, Zn increased in roots but decreased in stems, while in grains only sulfur (S) decreased. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Duval et al. (2011)</xref> concluded: “A major finding of this synthesis is the lack of effect of CO<sub>2</sub> on crop grains nutrient concentration”. This would imply laying to rest the hypothesis that eCO<sub>2</sub> consistently alters the plant ionome and would render mitigation efforts to combat declining crop mineral concentrations in the rising CO<sub>2</sub> world unnecessary. However, a closer examination of the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Duval et al. (2011)</xref> reveals that every statistically significant increase in mineral concentrations was obtained by bootstrapping a sample of size 2, 4 or 5—a recipe for generating invalid 95% CIs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ioannidis (2005)</xref> showed that false research findings, stemming from small sample sizes and associated low statistical power, are a persistent problem in biomedical sciences.</p></sec><sec id="s1-2"><title>‘Power failure’ and the plant ionome</title><p>Calling the problem as ‘power failure’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Button et al. (2013)</xref> emphasized that the probability of a research finding to reflect a true effect drops drastically if the statistical power is reduced from 0.80 (considered as appropriate) to low levels, for example &lt;0.30. Since the power of a statistical test drops non-linearly with the effect size, a sample size that is sufficient for detecting a 15% effect, for example a decline in N content, can be inadequate for detecting a 5% effect, for example a decline in a mineral content. Considering that the standard deviation of mineral concentrations in a plant tissue can reach 25% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Duquesnay et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Lahner et al., 2003</xref>), the 5% effect size standardized as Cohen's <italic>d</italic> is <italic>d</italic> = 5/25 = 0.2. A <italic>t</italic> test applied for <italic>d</italic> = 0.2 to a sample size of 3–5—a typical size used in eCO<sub>2</sub> studies—yields the power of 0.06–0.10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Faul et al., 2007</xref>). (Unfortunately, <italic>MetaWin</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Rosenberg et al., 2000</xref>), a statistical package routinely used in meta-analytic and other CO<sub>2</sub> studies in ecology, provides neither a priori nor <italic>post-hoc</italic> power estimates.) Such a small power not only raises the probability of obtaining a false negative to 90–94% but also increases the likelihood that a statistically significant result does not reflect a true effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Button et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s1-3"><title>Answering questions with adequate power</title><p>As of this writing, researchers on four continents have generated data sufficient for answering with an adequate statistical power, the following questions:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Does eCO<sub>2</sub> shift the plant ionome?

Hence, for humans, TNC carries the most of caloric and metabolic load of carbohydrates. Out of the two types of carbohydrates, eCO<sub>2</sub> affects stronger the latter, boosting TNC concentration by 10–45% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib150">Stiling and Cornelissen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Robinson et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, eCO<sub>2</sub> tends to lower protein in plant tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib152">Taub et al., 2008</xref>). Hence, we can reason that eCO<sub>2</sub> should exacerbate the inverse relationship found between TNC and protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Poorter and Villar, 1997</xref>). Considering that TNC and protein are two out of the three primary macronutrients (with fats/lipids being the third), it becomes imperative to quantify changes in TNC:protein, when estimating the impact of altered plant quality on human nutrition in the rising CO<sub>2</sub> world.</p><p>Regrettably, TNC:protein is rarely reported by CO<sub>2</sub> studies; instead C:N is used as a yardstick for accessing changes in the plant quality.

It lowers the GDP of the most afflicted countries by 2–5% and is partly responsible for their Third World status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib166">WHO, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Stein, 2009</xref>). A paradoxical aspect of ‘hidden hunger’ is that the minuscule amount of minerals, which a human body requires, could be provided easily and inexpensively—at least in theory—to all people in need by fortifying foods with minerals. However, in practice, such required mineral levels do not reach large parts of the world's community. The case of iodine is illustrative: although iodized table salt nearly wiped out iodine deficiency in the industrialized world, a billion people still have no regular access to it, making iodine deficiency the leading cause of preventable brain damage, cretinism, and lower IQ in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib162">Welch and Graham, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib166">WHO, 2002</xref>). Hence, the reality of logistic, economic, and cultural hurdles for fortification leaves the natural and bioavailable mineral content in food, and in plants in particular, to be the major, and sometimes the only, consistent mineral supply for a large part of mankind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib165">White and Broadley, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bouis and Welch, 2010</xref>). This supply, unfortunately, is suboptimal for human nutrition with some of the consequences outlined below.</p><p>Every third person in the world is at risk of inadequate Zn intake with its deficiency substantially contributing to stunting, compromised immunity, and child mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brown et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib158">UNICEF, 2009</xref>). Iron deficiency affects at least 2 billion people and is the leading cause of anemia that increases maternal mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib166">WHO, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib158">UNICEF, 2009</xref>). Millions are Ca, Mg, and Se deficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Stein, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib165">White and Broadley, 2009</xref>), including some population segments of developed countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Rayman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Khokhar et al., 2012</xref>). Ironically, a person can be obese <italic>and</italic> mineral undernourished—the so called ‘hunger-obesity paradox’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Scheier, 2005</xref>), for example the many homeless in the US who rely on “cheap and energy-dense but low-nutrient” foods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Koh et al., 2012</xref>). With every third adult in the world being overweight or obese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Keats and Wiggins, 2014</xref>), WHO ranks both mineral undernutrition and obesity among the top 20 global health risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib166">WHO, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Hill et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Stein, 2009</xref>). While the role of mineral deficiency in obesity is still unclear, intriguing links have been found between the lower blood serum concentrations of Ca, Cr, Fe, Mg, Mn, Se, Zn, and increased body mass index (BMI), with most of the findings appearing in the last decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Singh et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Martin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnaud et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">García et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Payahoo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib175">Yerlikaya et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>How can the CO<sub>2</sub>-induced depletion of minerals in crops affect humans? I emphasize that the impact of CO<sub>2</sub>-induced shifts in the quality of crops on human health is far from settled. The purpose of what follows is not to make definitive claims but to stimulate research into this important but unresolved issue.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Stoichiometric thought experiment</title><p>A randomized controlled trial for a human diet based exclusively (directly or indirectly) on plants grown in eCO<sub>2</sub> is unlikely and ethically questionable; and even if feasible, the trial might take years to generate results. In lieu of relevant data, we can employ a thought experiment. While such ‘experiments’ are usually reserved for physical sciences, any living system, notwithstanding its complexity, adheres to simple but irrefutable elemental mass balance, which can help us to elucidate plausible scenarios.</p><p>For simplicity, let us focus on one question: how can a 5% reduction in the plant mineral content affect human nutrition? Thus, we ignore other potential or likely CO<sub>2</sub> effects: for example higher agricultural yields; altered concentrations of lipids, vitamins, and polyphenols; substantially higher TNC:protein and TNC:minerals; differential C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> plant responses; changes in the phytate content that affects mineral bioavailability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Manoj-Kumar, 2011</xref>); and multiplicative health effects of the concomitant declines of many minerals in the same tissue.</p><p>Suppose that starting tomorrow and without our knowledge, the baseline mineral content of all plants on Earth drops by 5%. A self-evident but easily overlooked mass-balance law tells us that neither thermal nor mechanical processing of raw plants enriches them with minerals (i.e., transmutations are impossible). Thus, the mineral decline in raw crops will follow into plant-based foods (except for a few food items that are fortified with certain minerals in some countries).</p><p>We can safely assume that the individuals, whose dietary intake of each essential mineral has exceeded the recommended dietary intake (RDI) by &gt;5%, will be unaffected by the depletion. This leaves us with the majority of the human population, whose diet is either at risk of deficiency or already deficient in atleast one mineral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib166">WHO, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Kennedy et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Stein, 2009</xref>). Though a human body can synthesize complex compounds (e.g., vitamins K and D, non-essential amino acids), the mass balance low implies that <italic>no organism can synthesize any amount of any mineral</italic>. Therefore, to compensate for the mineral deficit, an organism has to increase mineral intake (or, otherwise, endure the consequences of the deficit). Taking supplements or intentionally shifting one's diet toward mineral-rich foods, for example animal products, can eliminate the deficit. Such dietary changes, however, presuppose behavioral adjustments on the part of the individuals who are aware of their mineral deficiency and have both the means and motivation to address it. A simpler way to compensate for the mineral deficit is to <italic>increase food intake</italic>, whether consciously or not. (The notion of compensatory feeding is not entirely alien—herbivores <italic>do</italic> increase consumption by 14–16%, when consuming plants grown in eCO<sub>2</sub>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib150">Stiling and Cornelissen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Robinson et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>For a calorie deficient person, eating 5% more (to be exact 5.26%, because 1.0526*.95 ≈ 1) is likely to be beneficial. However, for a calorie sufficient but mineral deficient person, eating 5% more could be detrimental. The dynamic mathematical model of human metabolism, which links weight changes to dietary and behavioral changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hall et al., 2011</xref>), can help to quantify the effect of a prolonged 5% increase in food intake. When parameterized with anthropometric data for an average moderately active American female (age 38, height 163 cm, weight 76 kg, BMI 28.6, energy intake 2431 kcal/day [10171 kJ]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Fryar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">CIA, 2013</xref>), the model outputs a weight gain of 4.8 kg over a 3-year period, provided all other aspects of behavior and diet remain unchanged. For a male, the respective weight gain is 5.8 kg. The results are congruent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Hill et al. (2003)</xref>, who argued that a 4–5% difference in total daily energy intake, a mere 100 kcal/day, could be responsible for most weight gain in the population.</p><p>The above ‘experiment’ suggests that a systemic and sustained 5% mineral depletion in plants can be nutritionally significant. While the rise in the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration is expected to be nearly uniform around the globe, its impact on crop quality might unequally affect the human population: from no detrimental effects for the well-nourished to potential weight gain for the calorie-sufficient but mineral-undernourished.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Has rising CO<sub>2</sub> already altered the plant ionome?</title><p>The rise in CO<sub>2</sub> levels over the last 18–30 years has already been implicated in the two effects that can influence the plant ionome: higher C assimilation and plant growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Donohue et al., 2013</xref>), and lower transpiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Keenan et al., 2013</xref>). Considering that over the last 250 years, the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration has increased by 120 ppm—an increase that is not far from the mean 184 ppm enrichment in the FACE studies—it is plausible that plant quality has changed. Indeed, declines in mineral concentrations have been found in wild plants and in crop fruits, vegetables, and grains over 22–250 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Penuelas and Matamala, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Duquesnay et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Davis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ekholm et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Jonard et al., 2009</xref>). While the mineral declines in crops can be an unintended consequence of the Green Revolution that produced high-yield cultivars with altered mineral content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Davis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fan et al., 2008</xref>), the reason for the mineral declines in wild plants cannot be attributed to it.</p><p>Can eCO<sub>2</sub> directly affect human health? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Hersoug et al. (2012)</xref> proposed that rising CO<sub>2</sub> promotes weight gains and obesity in the human population directly (via breathing) by reducing the pH of blood and, consequently, increasing appetite and energy intake. Weight gain has been observed in wild mammals, lab animals, and humans over the last several decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Klimentidis et al., 2011</xref>). However, it is not clear what role, if any, the rising CO<sub>2</sub> could have played either directly (breathing) or indirectly (altered plant quality). And disentangling the rising CO<sub>2</sub> effect from other plausible factors currently does not seem feasible due to scarce data. This brings us to the broader issue of detecting—amid high local noise—signals that are small in their magnitude but global in their scope.</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Hidden shifts of global change</title><p>While some scientific areas (e.g., genomics, bioinformatics) have experienced a data deluge, many areas of global change, including the issue of shifting plant quality, have been hindered by chronic data scarcity.

It is their collective efforts that have made it possible to reveal the CO<sub>2</sub>-induced shift in the plant ionome.</p><p>Human activities profoundly alter the biogeochemical cycle not only of C but also of N, P, and S, which are central to all known life forms. It is plausible that other subtle global shifts in the physiology and functioning of organisms lurk amid highly noisy data. The small magnitude of such shifts makes them hard to detect and easy to dismiss. But by virtue of being global and sustained, the shifts can be biologically potent. Revealing hidden shifts requires plentiful data to attain sufficient statistical power. (For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Rohde et al. (2013)</xref> analyzed 14 million <italic>mean</italic> monthly local temperature records to uncover the 1.5°C rise in the global average temperature since 1753—undoubtedly a potent but a very small change relative to the variations of tens of degrees in local temperature.)</p><p>New data on the effects of eCO<sub>2</sub> on plant quality (e.g., minerals, TNC: protein, TNC:minerals, lipids, bioavailability of nutrients) can be generated very cost-efficiently by analyzing fresh and archived plant samples collected at FACE centers worldwide (the project leaders of many centers are keen to share such samples; PS Curtis, BA Kimball, R Oren, PB Reich, C Stokes; IL personal communication, July, 2006). With regard to minerals, the application of the high-throughput techniques of ionomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Salt et al., 2008</xref>) can generate rich phenotypic data that can be linked with functional genomics. Such analyses will shed more light on changes in plant quality in the rising CO<sub>2</sub> world.

If, in rare instances, a publication reported three or more separate datasets for the same species or cultivar, the data were averaged prior to the inclusion into the foliar dataset. For the edible tissue dataset, the study inclusion rules were the same as for the foliar dataset with the following exception: due to relative scarcity of data for edible tissues, the data with co-factors were included in the dataset (e.g., observations from combined eCO<sub>2</sub> and ozone experiments were included). The ‘Additional info’ column in the dataset specifies exactly what datasets were extracted from each study with multiple datasets.</p><p>The above publication-inclusion and data-inclusion rules allow treating each study as independent in the dataset. At no instance, potentially co-dependent observations (e.g., multiple observations of the same plant throughout a growing season or observations of various parts of the same plant) were included in either the foliar or the edible dataset as separate studies. I used GraphClick v.3.0 and PixelStick v.2.5 to digitize data presented in a graphical form, for example bar charts.</p><p>The foliar dataset covers 4733 observations of 25 chemical elements in 110 species and cultivars. The edible tissues dataset covers 3028 observations of 23 elements in 41 species and cultivars. The FACE studies cover 2264 observations of 24 elements in 25 species and cultivars. The two datasets reflect data on 125 C<sub>3</sub> and 5 C<sub>4</sub> species/cultivars.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Effect size measure</title><p>While the amount of statistical details provided in each study varies considerably, the following data were extractable from each study: (1) the relative change (or lack thereof) in the mean concentration between the low and the high CO<sub>2</sub> treatments: <italic>(E-A)/A</italic>, where <italic>A</italic> and <italic>E</italic> are the mean concentrations of an element at the low and the high CO<sub>2</sub> treatments respectively, (2) the sample size or the number of replicates (<italic>n</italic>).</p><p>Since a decrease in the concentration of a mineral is limited to 100%, but an increase in its concentration is theoretically unlimited, a standard technique was applied to reduce biases towards increases. Specifically, the natural log of the response ratio, that is <italic>ln(E/A)</italic>, was used as the effect size metric (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Hedges et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Jablonski et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib152">Taub et al., 2008</xref>).

Meta-analytic studies often weight effect sizes by the reciprocal of their variance, which tends to give a greater weight to studies with greater precision. However, many eCO<sub>2</sub> studies do not report measures of variation in the data (standard error, standard deviation, or variance). In lieu of the measures of variance, studies can be weighted by the number of replicates (<italic>n</italic>) or, alternatively, each study can be assigned equal weight, that is, unweighted method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Jablonski et al., 2002</xref>). I used both methods (weighted and unweighted) to calculate the means of effect sizes with 95% CIs and compared the results of both methods. Nearly in all instances, the difference between the weighted and the unweighted means was small and lesser than the standard error of the unweighted mean. For example, across all the FACE studies, the overall mineral change was −6.1% (−7.8 to −4.4) when unweighted cf. the −6.5% (−8.0 to −5.1) when weighted. For the reason of close similarity between weighted and unweighted approaches, I used the simpler out of the two methods, that is the unweighted one, when reporting the results.</p><p>Since the distribution of effect sizes is not necessarily normal, I applied both parametric (<italic>t</italic> test) and non-parametric (bootstrapping with 10,000 replacements) tests for calculating the 95% CI for the mean effect size and the statistical power. The latter was calculated for: (1) an absolute effect size of 5%, and (2) the probability of Type I error, <italic>α</italic> = 0.05. If the variance of a small sample &lt;&lt; the true population variance, then this leads to substantial overestimations of Cohen's <italic>d</italic> and the statistical power. To be conservative when estimating power for small samples (m &lt;20), I used the <italic>larger</italic> of the sample standard deviation or 0.21, which is the standard deviation for the entire mineral dataset.</p><p>The results from the parametric and non-parametric tests were very close. For example, for Zn in edible tissues (sample size = 65), <italic>t</italic> test yields (−11.4%, −14.0 to −8.7) and 0.91 power cf. (−11.4%, −13.9 to −8.7) and 0.92 power for the bootstrapping procedure. A close similarity between the results of <italic>t</italic> test and non-parametric test is expected when sample size (<italic>m</italic>, the number of independent observations for each mineral) is &gt;30, which often was the case in this study. For reporting purposes, I used the 95% CI and the power generated by the non-parametric method, that is, the bootstrapping procedure.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Testing for publication bias</title><p>To test for publication bias or ‘the file drawer effect’ in the dataset, I plotted effect sizes against corresponding sample sizes/replicates, <italic>n</italic>, to provide a simple visual evaluation of the distribution of effect sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). The resulting cloud of points is funnel-shaped, narrowing toward larger sample sizes, and overall is symmetrical along the mean effect size. This indicates the absence of any significant publication bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Egger et al., 1997</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Fragmenting the dataset into categories</title><p>Meta-analytic CO<sub>2</sub> studies often partition their datasets into various categories (e.g., plant group, plant tissue, fertilization, or water regime) to estimate effect sizes for each category. Such data fragmentation, however, is warranted only if the statistical power of the resulting test for each category is adequate. Otherwise, low power can lead to non-significant outcomes and Type II errors. As tempting as it can be to partition the current dataset into many categories and cases (e.g., Zn in fruits, Fe in tuber, Cu in annuals, multiple CO<sub>2</sub> levels), only by fragmenting the data into sufficiently large categories an adequate statistical power can be retained. Such categories include: foliar tissues, edible tissues, woody plants (trees and shrubs), herbaceous plants, FACE studies, non-FACE studies, crops, wild plants (all non-crops, including ornamental plants), C<sub>3</sub> plants, C<sub>4</sub> plants, rice, wheat, barley, and potato. Furthermore, I fragmented the data for C<sub>3</sub> plants, the foliar and the edible tissues, the non-FACE and the FACE studies into individual chemical elements and into individual common plant names (e.g., all rice cultivars grouped under ‘rice’). For the regional analysis, I used only OTC and FACE studies because they reflect local environment much more accurately than studies using complete-enclosures (e.g., closed chamber, glasshouse). If an OTC or FACE study did not report precise geographic coordinates, then the latitude and longitude of a nearby research facility or city was used (all coordinates in the dataset are in decimal units). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2 fig3 fig4 fig5 fig6 fig7">Figures 1–7</xref> include results with the statistical power &gt;0.40 for each element, country, region, plant tissue or category. Generally, power &gt;0.80 is considered acceptable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cohen, 1988</xref>). Unfortunately, such a level was achievable only for elements for which the data are most abundant and for the ionomes of some plant groups and species. Note that the power was calculated for a 5% effect size, while the true effect size is likely to be larger (∼8%); therefore, the true power is likely to be higher than the calculated power for most results. All the results, irrespective of the statistical power, can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1–source data 1</xref>. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows the mean effect sizes (with their 95% CI) plotted against their respective statistical powers for all the minerals and all the plant groups/tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Formula for calculating percentage changes in TNC:protein and TNC:minerals</title><p>If the concentration of substance X in a plant increases by <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>%</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and concomitantly the concentration of substance Y decreases by <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo>%</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> in the plant, then the X-to-Y ratio of the plant (X:Y) increases by:<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>100</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>·</mml:mo><mml:mn>100</mml:mn><mml:mo>%</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><sec id="s4-8-1"><title>Proof</title><p>Let us denote the initial concentrations of substances <italic>X</italic> and <italic>Y</italic> in a plant as <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub> and <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub>, respectively.

The two decision letters after peer review are shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled “Hidden shift: elevated CO<sub>2</sub> alters the plant ionome depleting minerals at the base of human and herbivore nutrition” for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your full submission has been evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 peer reviewers, and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers. We regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication at this time.</p><p>The following peer reviewers have agreed to reveal their identity: David Salt and Lisa Ainsworth.</p><p>This is not an easy call, as all reviewers agreed that it was a solid analysis that builds significantly on the previously published work in Trends in Ecology and Evolution in 2002 and that the power analysis was a particularly noteworthy advance. The reason for decision to reject lay in the concerns about the “scaleability” the results from the FACE trails to human nutrition. The conclusions were based on analogies to human obesity studies and were simply too strongly drawn to be supported by the data. It also wasn't clear to the reviewers that the FACE results could extrapolate to tropical agricultural systems given that tropical agricultural productivity is limited by other factors (water, nitrogen, pests etc).</p><p><italic>Reviewer</italic> <italic>#1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript details a meta analysis based on published data on the concentration of elements (aka ionome) in various plant tissues and species from studies in which atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> has been varied. Analysis of the data in an appropriate statistical framework revealed significant chances in the plant ionome after growth of plants in atmospheres with elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (in both laboratory and field-based experiments). Many of these changes were not observed as significant changes in the original studies due to low sample sizes. Further analyses by integration of published data on carbohydrate content of plant tissues reveals that these changes in the plant ionome are likely due to dilution by the enhanced accumulation of carbohydrates observed when plants are grown in elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. An interesting discussion is then presented on the potential significance of this dilution of essential mineral nutrients in our global food supply.</p><p>I enjoyed reading this manuscript and liked the discursive style (something that is now quite rare in the scientific literature). However, I felt the manuscript was too long and both the Introduction and Discussion could be significantly shortened after careful editing without significant loss of readability or information content. For example, the long discussion on sample size being important to detect significant differences between treatments when the effect is expected to be small could be significantly reduced.</p><p><italic>Reviewer</italic> <italic>#2:</italic></p><p>This is an interesting review of the effects of rising CO<sub>2</sub> on the mineral content of plants. This author previously published a study on this topic, alerting the community to the detrimental impact that rising CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations were having on mineral content of plants and edible parts of plants. In the current manuscript, a much larger data set is compiled and statistically analyzed to report that elevated CO<sub>2</sub> significantly decreases mineral content in leaves and other edible parts of plants. Much thought and discussion is given to the power of the meta-dataset and I think that this is an important aspect of the paper. Finally, a thought experiment is done to discuss the potential impact of the increase in C and decrease in mineral nutrients on human health.</p><p>I think that the biggest question from this analysis is the impact on human health. In regions of the world where people are most dependent on bioavailable calories and nutrients from plants, few elevated CO<sub>2</sub> experiments have been done. For example, there are no published data from FACE experiments in the tropics. In tropical regions, drought, extreme temperatures and/or very poor nutrient supply likely limit agricultural production and in these areas elevated CO<sub>2</sub> may have substantially less impact on plant growth or plant quality. Therefore, it is very uncertain what effect elevated CO<sub>2</sub> will have on human nutrition there, and I think this needs to be acknowledged as a gap in the data and in the potential inferences made in this paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer</italic> <italic>#3:</italic></p><p>I very much enjoyed reading this paper. It takes a clever approach to the highly significant issue of how climate change might impact on the human food chain via its influence of plant composition, and in so doing does an excellent job of discussing the results in a broad integrative context. Usually a critical reviewer, I could find little to complain about here: the story is important, convincing, and nicely told.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for sending your work entitled “Hidden shift: elevated CO<sub>2</sub> alters the plant ionome and depletes minerals at the base of human nutrition” for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Ian Baldwin and 3 new peer reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript presents a unique collection of data on CO<sub>2</sub>-induced changes of the plant ionome, which clearly show that the majority of plants investigated so far showed a remarkably similar tendency in their response to CO<sub>2</sub> (albeit with variation). This is clearly an under-appreciated component of the undeniable rise in global CO<sub>2</sub> levels, which deserves more attention. The reviewers also recognized that the core of the argument that relates to the impact of changes in nutrient content of the edible portion of food crops on human health has simply not been settled, and were (again) split as to whether this problem was sufficient to reject the manuscript for <italic>eLife</italic>. After discussion, a consensus agreement was reached that the manuscript could be accepted if it was substantially revised so that it was clear that impact of changes in nutrient content of the edible portion of food crops on human health has not been settled. We hope that in revising the manuscript, this uncertainty is explicitly addressed and that you could highlight the need for more research to address this very important but festering issue. In addition, it was felt that the Introduction should be shortened, downplaying the thought experiment, and significantly tempering the conclusions drawn in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02245.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p>Reviewer 2 claims that there is “no published data from FACE experiments in the tropics.” Her opinion is that “elevated CO<sub>2</sub> may have substantially less impact” on plant quality in the tropics and, “therefore, it is very uncertain what effect elevated CO2 will have on human nutrition there.”</p><p>This argument is flawed. There <italic>are</italic> published FACE, open-top chamber and greenhouse experiments carried out between the 35<bold>°</bold> N &amp; S latitudes – the tropical and subtropical regions, where large parts of malnourished population reside (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Ma <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Jia <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Pal <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Singh <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>; Khan <italic>et al.</italic> 2012; Azam <italic>et al.</italic> 2012), and they do show declines in the plant mineral content. Prompted by the <italic>eLife</italic> review, I made the regional analysis of all the CO<sub>2</sub> studies carried out between the 35<bold>°</bold> N &amp; S parallels: it shows that the plant mineral content declines by 5% in the region. Furthermore, many countries in the tropics rely on imports of wheat, maize and soybeans, most of which are grown north of the N 35<bold>°</bold>parallel, where FACE and other experiments also reveal declines in the crop mineral content.</p><p>No reviewer found any logical flaws in my human-nutrition thought experiment, which relies on the rigor of mass balance laws. However, I understand that such “experiments” are not conventional even if their conclusions are valid. For this reason, I can tone down and shorten the health and obesity discussion.

Specifically:</p><p>I have added the following statement to the Discussion: “I emphasize that the impact of CO<sub>2</sub>-induced shifts in the quality of crops on human health is far from settled. The purpose of what follows is not to make definitive claims but to stimulate research into this important but festering issue.”</p><p>I have added a new subsection to the Discussion, titled “Data Scarcity,” noting that for many crops, the pertinent data are limited or non-existent.</p><p>The wording about the effects of the mineral decline on human nutrition was toned down from “will” to “can”/“might/potential”. (Furthermore, the abstract was changed to stress that the effects on human health are discussed (and, thus, are not parts of results.)</p><p><italic>In addition, it was felt that the Introduction should be shortened, downplaying the thought experiment..</italic>.</p><p>I deleted the passage referring to my 2002 ‘thought experiment’ from the Introduction and do not mention it anywhere else in the manuscript.</p><p>I deleted the reference to Loladze &amp; Elser (2011) together with the sentence stating that the cellular stoichiometric homeostasis is sensitive to the environment.</p><p>I have shortened and simplified the passage about the dichotomy between CO<sub>2</sub> effects on N and minerals.</p><p>I have shortened and improved readability of the list of questions at the end of the Introduction. The new Introduction is shorter by ∼200 words.</p><p><italic>...and significantly tempering the conclusions drawn in the Discussion</italic>.</p><p>Aside from changes indicated above, I have made the following changes to the Discussion:</p><p>1) Deleted <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> showing the graphical output of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hall et al. (2011)</xref> dynamic model of weight gains in a female and a male.</p><p>2) Tempered and shortened conclusions about the impact on human health. Now the statements are reduced to: “The above ‘experiment’ suggests that a systemic and sustained 5% mineral depletion in plants can be nutritionally significant. While the rise in the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration is expected to be nearly uniform around the globe, its impact on crop quality might unequally affect the human population: from no detrimental effects for the well-nourished people to potential weight gain for the calorie-sufficient but mineral-undernourished.”</p><p>In addition, to the above changes I revamped the Results by separating them into clear subsections. Furthermore, the readability throughout the paper was improved.</p></body></sub-article></article>
