We found that the slug <italic>Elysia timida</italic> induces changes to the photosynthetic light reactions of the chloroplasts it steals from the alga <italic>Acetabularia acetabulum</italic>. Working with a large continuous laboratory culture of both the slugs (&gt;500 individuals) and their prey algae, we show that the plastoquinone pool of slug chloroplasts remains oxidized, which can suppress reactive oxygen species formation. Slug chloroplasts also rapidly build up a strong proton-motive force upon a dark-to-light transition, which helps them to rapidly switch on photoprotective non-photochemical quenching of excitation energy. Finally, our results suggest that chloroplasts inside <italic>E. timida</italic> rely on oxygen-dependent electron sinks during rapid changes in light intensity. These photoprotective mechanisms are expected to contribute to the long-term functionality of the chloroplasts inside the slugs.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Plants, algae and a few other organisms rely on a process known as photosynthesis to fuel themselves, as they can harness cellular structures called chloroplasts to convert light into usable energy. Animals typically lack chloroplasts, making them unable to use photosynthesis to power themselves. The sea slug <italic>Elysia timida</italic>, however, can steal whole chloroplasts from the cells of the algae it consumes: the stolen structures then become part of the cells in the gut of the slug, allowing the animal to gain energy from sunlight.</p><p>Once they are in the digestive system of the slug, the chloroplasts survive and keep working for longer than expected. Indeed, these structures are often harmed as a side effect of photosynthesis, but the sea slug does not have the right genes to help repair this damage. In addition, conditions inside animal cells are widely different to the ones found inside algae and plants. It is not clear then how the sea slug extends the lifespan of its chloroplasts by preventing damage caused by sunlight.</p><p>To investigate this question, Havurinne and Tyystjärvi compared photosynthesis in sea slugs and the algae they eat. A range of methods, including measuring fluorescence from the chloroplasts, was used: this revealed that the slug changes the inside of the stolen chloroplasts, making them more resistant to damage.</p><p>First, when exposed to light the stolen chloroplasts can quickly switch on a mechanism that dissipates light energy to heat, which is less damaging. Second, a molecule that serves as an intermediate during photosynthesis is kept in a ‘safe’ state which prevents it from creating harmful compounds. And finally, additional safeguard molecules ‘deactivate’ compounds that could otherwise mediate damaging reactions. Overall, these measures may reduce the efficiency of the chloroplasts but allow them to keep working for much longer.</p><p>Early chloroplasts were probably independent bacteria that were captured and ‘domesticated’ by other cells for their ability to extract energy from the sun. Photosynthesizing sea slugs therefore provide an interesting way to understand some of the challenges of early life. The work by Havurinne and Tyystjärvi may also reveal new ways to harness biological processes such as photosynthesis for energy production in other contexts.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Acetabularia acetabulum</italic></kwd><kwd>biophysics</kwd><kwd><italic>Elysia timida</italic></kwd><kwd>green algae</kwd><kwd>kleptoplasty</kwd><kwd>photosynthetic sea slugs</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002341</institution-id><institution>Academy of Finland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>307335</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tyystjärvi</surname><given-names>Esa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003125</institution-id><institution>Suomen Kulttuurirahasto</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate student grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Havurinne</surname><given-names>Vesa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002342</institution-id><institution>Suomalainen Tiedeakatemia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate student grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Havurinne</surname><given-names>Vesa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005609</institution-id><institution>University of Turku graduate school, DPMLS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate student grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Havurinne</surname><given-names>Vesa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002341</institution-id><institution>Academy of Finland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>333421</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tyystjärvi</surname><given-names>Esa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Slug chloroplasts avoid damage to photosynthesis by maintaining an oxidized electron transfer chain with the help of oxygen-sensitive electron acceptors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The sea slug <italic>Elysia timida</italic> is capable of stealing chloroplasts from its algal prey (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Once stolen, the chloroplasts, now termed kleptoplasts, remain functional inside the slug’s cells for several weeks, essentially creating a photosynthetic slug. The only animals capable of this phenomenon are some marine flatworms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Van Steenkiste et al., 2019</xref>) and sea slugs belonging to the Sacoglossan clade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rumpho et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Vries et al., 2014</xref>). Despite decades of research, there is still no consensus about the molecular mechanisms that allow the slugs to discriminate other cellular components of the algae and only incorporate the chloroplasts inside their own cells, or how the slugs maintain the chloroplasts functional for times that defy current paradigms of photosynthesis. Also the question whether the slugs in fact get a real nutritional benefit from the photosynthates produced by the stolen chloroplasts, is still being debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cartaxana et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rauch et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Laboratory cultures of the photosynthetic sea slug <italic>E. timida</italic> and its prey alga <italic>Acetabularia</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A freshly fed adult <italic>E. timida</italic> individual.

Photoinhibition of Photosystem II (PSII) takes place at all light intensities and photosynthetic organisms have developed an efficient PSII repair cycle to counteract it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tyystjärvi, 2013</xref>). Unlike higher plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Järvi et al., 2015</xref>), the chloroplast genomes of all algal species involved in long-term kleptoplasty encode FtsH, a protease involved in PSII repair cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Vries et al., 2013</xref>). However, out of all prey algae species of photosynthetic sea slugs, only in <italic>Vaucheria litorea</italic>, the prey alga of <italic>Elysia chlorotica</italic>, the chloroplast-encoded FtsH contains the critical M41 metalloprotease domain required for degradation of the D1 protein during PSII repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Christa et al., 2018</xref>). Photoinhibition of Photosystem I (PSI) occurs especially during rapid changes in light intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tikkanen and Grebe, 2018</xref>) and should cause problems in isolated chloroplasts in the long run. In addition to the specific inhibition mechanisms of the photosystems, unspecific damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khorobrykh et al., 2020</xref>) is expected to deteriorate an isolated chloroplast.</p><p>Photoprotective mechanisms counteract photodamage. Recent efforts have advanced our understanding of photoprotection in kleptoplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Christa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cartaxana et al., 2019</xref>). It has been shown that kleptoplasts of <italic>E. timida</italic> do retain the capacity to induce physiological photoprotection mechanisms similar to the ones in the prey green alga <italic>Acetabularia acetabulum</italic> (hereafter <italic>Acetabularia</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Christa et al., 2018</xref>). The most studied mechanism is the ‘energy-dependent’ qE component of non-photochemical quenching of excitation energy (NPQ). qE is triggered through acidification of the thylakoid lumen by protons pumped by the photosynthetic electron transfer chain. The xanthophyll cycle enhances qE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ruban and Horton, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Papageorgiou GC, 2014</xref>) but there have been contrasting reports on the capability of <italic>E. timida</italic> to maintain a highly functional xanthophyll cycle if the slugs are not fed with fresh algae (i.e. starved) and about the effect of NPQ on kleptoplast longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Christa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cartaxana et al., 2019</xref>). Although advancing our understanding of the mechanisms of kleptoplast longevity, these recent publications underline the trend of contradictory results that has been going on for a long time.</p><p>There are reports of continuous husbandry of photosynthetic sea slugs, mainly <italic>E. timida</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schmitt et al., 2014</xref>) and <italic>E. chlorotica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rumpho et al., 2011</xref>), but still today most research is conducted on animals caught from the wild. We have grown the sea slug <italic>E. timida</italic> and its prey <italic>Acetabularia</italic> in our lab for several years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). As suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schmitt et al., 2014</xref>, <italic>E. timida</italic> is an attractive model organism for photosynthetic sea slugs because it is easy to culture with relatively low costs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). A constant supply of slugs has opened a plethora of experimental setups yet to be tested, one of the more exciting ones being the case of red morphotypes of both <italic>E. timida</italic> and <italic>Acetabularia</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). Red morphotypes of <italic>E. timida</italic> and <italic>Acetabularia</italic> were first described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">González-Wangüemert et al., 2006</xref> and later shown to be due to accumulation of an unidentified carotenoid during cold/high-light acclimation of the algae that were then eaten by <italic>E. timida</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Costa et al., 2012</xref>). The red morphotypes provide a visual proof that the characteristics of the kleptoplasts inside <italic>E. timida</italic> can be modified by acclimating their feedstock to different environmental conditions.</p><p>We optimized a new set of biophysical methods to study photosynthesis in the sea slugs and found differences in photosynthetic electron transfer reactions between <italic>E. timida</italic> and <italic>Acetabularia</italic> grown in varying culture conditions. The most dramatic differences between the slugs and their prey were noticed in PSII electron transfer of the red morphotype <italic>E. timida</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and <italic>Acetabularia</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In addition to measuring chlorophyll <italic>a</italic> fluorescence decay kinetics, we also measured fluorescence induction kinetics, PSI electron transfer and formation of proton-motive force during dark to light transition. Our results suggest that dark reduction of the plastoquinone (PQ) pool, a reserve of central electron carriers of the photosynthetic electron transfer chain, is weak in the slugs compared to the algae, and that a strong build-up of proton-motive force is likely linked to higher levels of NPQ in kleptoplasts. It is also clear that PSI utilizes oxygen-sensitive electron sinks in both the slugs and the algae, and this sink protects the photosynthetic apparatus from light-induced damage in <italic>E. timida</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Non-photochemical reduction of the chloroplast electron transfer chain is inefficient in <italic>E. timida</italic></title><p>We estimated reoxidation kinetics of the first stable electron acceptor of PSII, Q<sub>A</sub><sup>-</sup>, from dark acclimated <italic>E. timida</italic> and <italic>Acetabularia</italic> by measuring the decay of chlorophyll <italic>a</italic> fluorescence yield after a single turnover flash (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In the green morphotypes of the slugs and the algae, Q<sub>A</sub><sup>-</sup> reoxidation kinetics were similar between the two species in aerobic conditions both in the absence and presence of 3-(3, 4-dichlorophenyl)−1, 1-dimethylurea (DCMU), an inhibitor of PSII electron transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). This indicates that electron transfer within PSII functions in the same way in both species. In anaerobic conditions, fluorescence decay was slower than in aerobic conditions in both species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), showing that the environment of the slug kleptoplasts normally remains aerobic in the dark even in the presence of slug respiration. Anaerobicity slowed the fluorescence decay less in <italic>E. timida</italic> than in <italic>Acetabularia</italic>, especially during the fast (~300–500 μs) and middle (~5–15 ms) phases of fluorescence decay in anaerobic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

The exact mechanisms underlying the wave phenomenon are still unknown, but the involvement of NDA2, a type II NDH protein is clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deák et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krishna et al., 2019</xref>).

Despite the remarkable analogy, more experiments are needed to validate the presence of a type II NDH protein in <italic>Acetabularia</italic> and its role in the wave-phenomenon in the red morphotype. However, since there are no reports indicating incorporation of algal mitochondria by Sacoglossan sea slugs and they have been shown to digest cellular components of the algae other than the chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rumpho et al., 2000</xref>), we interpret the lack of the wave phenomenon as a sign of missing contribution of respiratory electron donors into the kleptoplasts inside <italic>E. timida</italic>.

The build-up of proton-motive force in <italic>E. timida</italic> suggests that protons are released into the thylakoid lumen during illumination, but not out. This could be indicative of defects in ATP-synthase functionality in the slugs, perhaps due to lack of inorganic phosphate. Interestingly, our results from ambient air and high-CO<sub>2</sub> slugs and algae show that while the acclimation state of the prey algae is reflected onto the NPQ capacity of the slugs, the slugs exhibit higher levels of NPQ than their respective prey <italic>Acetabularia</italic> at the same light intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G,H</xref>).

Based on the current literature on P700 redox kinetics during the first seconds after a dark to light transition, the most likely candidates for these electron acceptors are FLVs that donate electrons to oxygen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jokel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gerotto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ilík et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jokel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shimakawa et al., 2019</xref>).

Full activation of FLVs as electron acceptors of PSI takes ~ 1 s after a transition from dark to light and they subsequently remain a considerable electron sink during the time required for light activation of Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ilík et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gerotto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bulychev et al., 2018</xref>). The mechanism of such fast regulation of FLV functionality is not known, but the conserved cysteine residues of FLVs have been suggested to offer a means for redox regulation through conformational changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alboresi et al., 2019</xref>). This, in conjunction with the data showing that anaerobicity diminishes P700 reoxidation even with the second pulse protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), support the view that FLVs are also behind P700 oxidation during the second pulse.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>High P700 oxidation capacity improves kleptoplast longevity under fluctuating light</title><p>By feeding <italic>E. timida</italic> individuals with <italic>Acetabularia</italic> grown in ambient air and high CO<sub>2</sub> conditions, we successfully created slugs whose kleptoplasts reflected the acclimation state of their respective prey algae at the levels of P700 redox kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–D</xref>), rETR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>) and NPQ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G,D</xref>).

The simplest explanation for this is downregulation of FLVs in elevated CO<sub>2</sub> environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jokel et al., 2015</xref>), but this was not confirmed by a western blot analysis from ambient-air and high-CO<sub>2</sub> <italic>Acetabularia</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). However, the protein band detected with the FLV antibody from <italic>Acetabularia</italic> is broad, and might conceal two protein bands, possibly the <italic>Acetabularia</italic> homologues of FLVA and FLVB. Another important factor influencing PSI electron transfer that could be affected by alterations in CO<sub>2</sub> levels in <italic>Acetabularia</italic> is the Mehler’s reaction, but this seems an unlikely candidate for the differences in P700 redox kinetics during the 780 ms light pulse, as the evidence from FLV knockout and insertion mutant algae and plants show that Mehler's reaction cannot substitute for FLVs in the reoxidation of P700 during such a time frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gerotto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ilík et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jokel et al., 2018</xref>). Also altered stoichiometry of PSII and PSI could affect P700 redox kinetics, but the highly similar ratio of chlorophylls <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic> between ambient-air (chlorophyll <italic>a</italic>/<italic>b</italic> = 2.37, SE ± 0.03, n = 5) and high-CO<sub>2</sub> slugs (chlorophyll <italic>a</italic>/<italic>b</italic> = 2.41, SE ± 0.06, n = 6) indicates that photosystem stoichiometry does not strongly depend on CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. Whatever the exact reason behind the altered P700 redox kinetics is, it is clear that acclimation of <italic>Acetabularia</italic> to high CO<sub>2</sub> lowers P700 oxidation capacity and this acclimation state is transferred into <italic>E. timida</italic>.</p><p>When ambient air and high-CO<sub>2</sub><italic>E, timida</italic> were starved for 46 days in steady-light conditions, they behaved nearly identically in terms of kleptoplast longevity, while still retaining the differences in P700 redox kinetics after 5 days in starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The differences in P700 redox kinetics were also noticeable on days 0 and 6 of the starvation experiment in fluctuating light. In fluctuating light, F<sub>V</sub>/F<sub>M</sub> of the high-CO<sub>2</sub> slugs decreased faster than in ambient-air slugs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Our results suggest that alternative electron acceptors of PSI, possibly FLVs, are utilized by <italic>E. timida</italic> to protect kleptoplasts from formation of ROS during fluctuating-light starvation. The exact mechanism of PSI damage is not clear, but FLVs have been shown to protect PSI in green algae by donating excess electrons to oxygen without producing ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shimakawa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jokel et al., 2018</xref>). However, both slug groups did retain PSI activity for at least up to 6 days in starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). This shows that PSI was protected against fluctuating light even in the high-CO<sub>2</sub> <italic>E. timida</italic> that exhibited lowered, but not completely abolished, P700 oxidation capacity. Lower P700 oxidation capacity in high-CO<sub>2</sub> slugs could, however, cause an increase in the rate of Mehler's reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mehler, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khorobrykh et al., 2020</xref>).

If the capacity to oxidize P700 by alternative electron acceptors is lowered in <italic>E. timida</italic> kleptoplasts, is this compensated for by an increased capacity of the main electron sink, that is the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle? If not, <italic>E. timida</italic> slugs would risk having a foreign organelle inside their own cells that readily produces ROS via one-electron reduction of oxygen. Interestingly, a major feature separating Sacoglossan slug species capable of long-term retention of kleptoplasts from those that are not, is their high capacity to downplay starvation-induced ROS accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Vries et al., 2015</xref>). This could imply that long-term retention slug species such as <italic>E. timida</italic> do not need to concern themselves over the perfect functionality of the electron transfer reactions downstream of PSI.

In addition to bringing closure to a biological conundrum that has remained unanswered for decades, solving how sea slugs are able to incorporate and maintain kleptoplasts in their own cells could provide useful insights into the ancient endosymbiotic events that led to the evolution of eukaryotic life.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Elysia timida</italic>)</td><td><italic>Elysia timida</italic> Turku Isolate1 (TI1)</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>Mediterranian locality (Elba, Italy, 42.7782° N, 10.1927° E)</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Acetabularia acetabulum</italic>)</td><td><italic>Acetabularia acetabulum</italic> Düsseldorf Isolate 1 (DI1)</td><td>This paper, <break/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schmitt et al., 2014</xref></td><td/><td>Mediterranian locality, s train originally isolated by Diedrik Menzel</td></tr><tr><td>Biological sample (<italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>)</td><td>CC406 wild-type strain</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jokel et al., 2015</xref>; Chlamydomonas resource center</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014960">SCR_014960</ext-link></td><td>Total protein extract</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit anti-FLVB</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jokel et al., 2015</xref></td><td/><td>(1:5000)</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>DC Protein Assay Kit</td><td>Bio-Rad</td><td>Bio-Rad #5000111</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Next Gel 10% Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis Solutions</td><td>VWR</td><td>VWR # 97063–026</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>3-(3, 4-dichlorophenyl)−1, 1-dimethylurea (DCMU)</td><td>Merck</td><td>Merck #D2425</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>D-(+)-Glucose</td><td>Merck</td><td>Merck #G8270</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Glucose Oxidase from<italic>Aspergillus niger</italic></td><td>Merck</td><td>Merck #G2133</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Catalase from bovine liver</td><td>Merck</td><td>Merck #C9322</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Fiji</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_003070">SCR_003070</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Origin</td><td>Originlab (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://originlab.com">https://originlab.com</ext-link>)</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014212">SCR_014212</ext-link></td><td>Origin 2016 v.9.3</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Organisms and culture conditions</title><p>Axenic stock cultures of the green alga <italic>Acetabularia</italic> (Düsseldorf Isolate 1, DI1; strain originally isolated by Diedrik Menzel) were grown in 5–10 l plastic tanks in sterile filtered f/2 culture medium made in 3.7% artificial sea water (ASW; Sea Salt Classic, Tropic Marin, Montague, MA, USA). All ASW were prepared in 10 l batches in regular tap water of Turku, Finland. It is important to note the regional differences in tap water quality, and the suitability of tap water for cultures of algae or sea slugs should be assessed before large scale cultures to avoid mass loss of the cultures. In order to slow down the stock culture growth, PPFD of growth lights (TL-D 58W/840 New Generation fluorescent tube; Philips, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) was &lt; 20 µmol m<sup>−2</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>. The culture medium for the stock cultures was changed at 8–10 week intervals. Keeping the lids of the <italic>Acetabularia</italic> tanks locked in place (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) effectively prevented excessive evaporation from the tanks. Other <italic>Acetabularia</italic> culture maintenance procedures, such as induction of gamete release, formation of zygotes and sterilization procedures were performed essentially as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hunt and Mandoli, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cooper and Mandoli, 1999</xref>). The day-night cycle was 12/12 hr and temperature was maintained at 23°C at all times for all algae and slug cultures, unless mentioned otherwise. Algae used in the experiments were transferred to new tanks containing fresh f/2 media and grown under lights adjusted to PPFD 40 µmol m<sup>−2</sup>s<sup>−1</sup> (TL-D 58W/840 New Generation fluorescent tube) for minimum of two weeks prior to any further treatments. No attempt was made to use only algae of certain age or size, and all populations were mixtures of cells in different developmental stages. PPFD was measured with a planar light sensor (LI-190R Quantum Sensor; LI-COR Biosciences; Lincoln, NE, USA) at the tank bottom level in all growth and treatment conditions. Irradiance spectra of all growth light sources used in the current study are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1, measured with an absolutely calibrated STS-VIS spectrometer (Ocean Optics, Largo, FL, USA).</xref></p><p>Sea slug <italic>E. timida</italic> individuals (50 individuals in total) were initially collected from the Mediterranean (Elba, Italy, 42.7782° N, 10.1927° E). The slug cultures were routinely maintained essentially as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schmitt et al., 2014</xref>. Briefly, <italic>E. timida</italic> were maintained at the same conditions as the cultures of <italic>Acetabularia</italic>, their prey alga, in aerated 5–10 l plastic tanks containing 3.7% ASW. Newly prepared ASW was added to the tanks weekly to dilute contaminants and slug excrements, and the slugs were placed in new tanks with fresh ASW at 3–5 week intervals. Similar to <italic>Acetabularia</italic> tanks, also the lids of the slug tanks were locked in place. The tanks were aerated with a silicon tubes connected to air spargers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Differing amounts of <italic>Acetabularia</italic> were added to the slug tanks at irregular intervals, usually once every two weeks. When the adult slugs were transferred to new tanks, the old tanks with their contents were not discarded but supplemented with fresh ASW media and <italic>Acetabularia</italic> in order to allow unhatched slugs or slugs still in their veliger stage to develop into juvenile/adult slugs that are visible to the eye and could be pipetted out with a 10 ml plastic Pasteur pipette. The development from microscopic veligers to juvenile slugs usually took 2–3 weeks. Our method for cultivating slugs has enabled us to maintain a constant slug population consisting of 500–1000 slugs with relatively little labour and cost for years. It is, however, difficult to maintain the slug cultures axenic, and the slug tanks do foul, if not attended to. The contaminants in our laboratory cultures have not yet been identified but, based on optical inspection, seem to consist mainly of diatoms and ciliates. These organisms are likely derived from the Mediterranean and have been co-cultured with the slugs throughout the years. All slugs used in the experiments were always transferred into new tanks filled with fresh ASW and fed with abundant <italic>Acetabularia</italic> for 1–2 weeks prior to the experiments, unless mentioned otherwise. Slug individuals taken straight from the normal culture conditions were used for some of the measurements, without special considerations on the retention status of the chloroplasts inside the slugs, that is the slugs were not allowed to incorporate the chloroplasts overnight in the dark. The use of slugs without overnight settling time is indicated in the figures.</p><p>Acclimating <italic>Acetabularia</italic> to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> levels was done in a closed culture cabinet (Algaetron AG230; Photon Systems Instruments, Drásov, Czech Republic) by raising the CO<sub>2</sub> level from the ambient concentration (0.04% of air volume) to 1% CO<sub>2</sub> inside the cabinet. Plastic 5 l tanks filled with <italic>Acetabularia</italic> were placed inside the cabinet and the tank lids were slightly opened, that is one of the plastic lid locks was not locked, to facilitate gas exchange. Newly made f/2 medium was added every second day to account for evaporation (approximately 50 ml per week, estimated in a separate tank) as a precaution. This can admittedly lead to salinity fluctuations, but we chose to add f/2 medium instead of water, as the evaporation in our conditions was low. Incident light provided by the growth cabinet white LEDs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref> for the spectrum) was adjusted to PPFD 40 µmol m<sup>−2</sup>s<sup>−1</sup> and the day-night cycle was 12/12 hr. Temperature was maintained at 23°C. The algae were always acclimated for a minimum of three days to high CO<sub>2</sub> prior to any measurements or feeding of the slugs with high-CO<sub>2</sub> acclimated algae.</p><p>The red morphotype of <italic>Acetabularia</italic> was induced by growing the algae at 10°C and continuous high white light (PPFD 600 µmol m<sup>−2</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>) for 31 days in a closed culture cabinet in ambient air (Algaetron AG230; Photon Systems Instruments), essentially as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Costa et al., 2012</xref>. While this procedure was successful in producing the desired colour morphotype of <italic>Acetabularia</italic>, the yield was very low, and most of the <italic>Acetabularia</italic> cells bleached during the treatment. A few cells of red <italic>Acetabularia</italic> could be found in tanks where the cell concentration had been high enough to create a light attenuating algal mat. These red <italic>Acetabularia</italic> cells were then collected and used for measurements or fed to the slugs as indicated.</p><p><italic>E. timida</italic> individuals that were devoid of chloroplasts, that is bleached, were obtained by subjecting freshly fed slugs to starvation in high light (Ikea Växer PAR30 E27, 10 W; PPFD &gt; 1000 µmol m<sup>−2</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>; 12/12 hr day/night) in otherwise normal growth conditions. After 1 week of starvation the coloration of the slugs was estimated by eye, and only the palest individuals were selected for further experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Protein analysis</title><p>Crude total proteins were extracted from <italic>Acetabularia</italic> cells grown in ambient air and high CO<sub>2</sub> conditions by cutting up approximately 4 g (wet weight) of algae with a razor blade and then grinding them in 500 µl of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 2% SDS, 10 mM EDTA) using a 1 ml Dounce tissue grinder (DWK Life Sciences, Millville, NJ, USA). The homogenate was filtered through one layer of Miracloth (Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany). Algae used for the extractions were taken straight from their respective growth conditions. All protein isolation procedures were performed at 4°C in dim light. Protein concentrations from the homogenates were determined with DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) using BSA as a standard.</p><p>Aliquots containing 25 µg protein were solubilized and separated by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel using Next Gel solutions and buffers according to the manufacturer’s instructions (VWR, Radnor, PA, USA). Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P PVDF membranes (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA, USA). FLVs were immunodetected using an antibody raised against <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> FLVB, reacting with <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> FLVA and FLVB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jokel et al., 2015</xref>). Western blots were imaged using goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and CDP-star Chemiluminescence Reagent (Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). Protein bands were quantified using Fiji image processing software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>).

PSII electron transfer was blocked in certain measurements, as indicated in the figures, with DCMU. For this, a 2 mM stock solution of DCMU in dimethylsulfoxide was prepared and diluted to a final concentration of 10 µM in either f/2 or ASW medium, depending on whether it was administered to the algae or the slugs, respectively. DCMU was only applied to samples that had been in the dark for 1 hr and the dark acclimation in the presence of DCMU was continued for additional 20 min. When pertinent, DCMU containing medium was applied to cover the samples during the actual measurements too.</p><p>Anaerobic conditions were achieved by a combination of glucose oxidase (eight units/ml), glucose (6 mM) and catalase (800 units/ml) in f/2 or ASW medium. Our data shows that using the above reagents and concentrations in a sealed vial with stirring, nearly all oxygen was consumed from 250 ml of ASW media in a matter of minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Similar to the DCMU treatments, anaerobic conditions were initiated only after the samples had been in the dark for 1 hr. In the case of <italic>Acetabularia</italic>, the samples were placed inside a sealed 50 ml centrifuge tube filled with f/2 medium that had been pre-treated with the glucose oxidase system for 10 min. The algae were then kept inside the sealed tube for 5 min in the dark, after which they were picked out and placed to the sample holder of the instrument in question. In order to maintain oxygen concentrations as low as possible, the samples were then covered with the anaerobic medium and left in the dark for additional 5 min, so that the oxygen mixed into the medium during sample placement would be depleted. Before imposing anaerobic conditions to slug individuals, they were swiftly decapitated with a razor blade, a procedure that has been shown not to significantly affect PSII activity in the photosynthetic sea slug <italic>Elysia viridis</italic> during a 2 hr measurement period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cruz et al., 2015</xref>). The euthanized slugs were then treated identically to the algae used in the anaerobic measurements.</p><p>Q<sub>A</sub><sup>-</sup> reoxidation kinetics after a strong single turnover (ST) flash (maximum PPFD 100,000 µmol m<sup>−2</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>, according to the manufacturer) were measured using an FL 200 fluorometer with a SuperHead optical unit (Photon Systems Instruments, Drásov, Czech Republic) utilizing the software and protocol provided by the manufacturer. The measurement protocol was optimized to be robust enough to allow its use in measurements from both <italic>Acetabularia</italic> and the slugs. The parameters used in the script were as follows: experiment duration - 120 s, Number of datapoints/decade - 8, First datapoint after ST flash - 150 µs, ST flash voltage – 100%, ST flash duration – 30 µs, measuring beam (MB) voltage – 60%. The wavelength for the ST flash and the MB was 625 nm. The option to enhance the ST flash intensity by complementing it with the MB light source was not used in the measurements. Number of datapoints/decade was changed to two for the measurements in the presence of DCMU.</p><p>The slugs tend to crawl around any typical cuboid 2 ml measuring cuvette if the cuvette is filled with ASW, which causes disturbances to the fluorescence signal. On the other hand, if ASW is removed from the cuvette, the slugs tend to stick to the bottom, placing them away from the light path of the instrument. For this reason, a compromise was made between ideal optics and slug immobilization by placing three to five slugs into a regular 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and then pipetting most of the ASW out of the tube, leaving just enough ASW to cover the slugs. Only in the measurements in anaerobic conditions were the tubes filled with oxygen depleted ASW. The tube was placed into the cuvette holder of the SuperHead optical unit so that the narrow bottom of the tube with the slugs was situated in the middle of the light path of the instrument and the tube was resting on its top appendices. The tube caps were left open for the measurements without any inhibitors and in the presence of DCMU, unlike the anaerobic measurements where the caps were closed. In the context of Q<sub>A</sub><sup>-</sup> reoxidation data from the slugs, one biological replicate refers to one measurement from three to five slugs inside the same tube in this study. Completely new slugs were used for each biological replicate. In order to facilitate comparison, Q<sub>A</sub><sup>-</sup> reoxidation from the algae was also measured using 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes, but due to the sessile nature of the algae there was no need to remove the f/2 media from the tubes. For each biological replicate representing the algae in the Q<sub>A</sub><sup>-</sup> reoxidation data sets, approximately five to ten cells were placed inside each of the tubes.</p><p>The polyphasic fluorescence rise kinetics (OJIP curves) were measured with AquaPen-P AP 110 P fluorometer (Photon Systems Instruments) that has an inbuilt LED emitter providing 455 nm light for the measurements. The fluorometer was mounted on a stand and all measurements were done by placing a Petri dish with the sample on it on a matte black surface and positioning the sample directly under the probe head of the fluorometer. The intensity of the 2 s multiple turnover (MT) saturating pulse used for the measurements was optimized separately for measurements from single slug individuals (representing one biological replicate) and one to two cells/strands of algae (representing one biological replicate) placed under the probe of the instrument.</p><p>The final MT pulse intensity setting of the instrument was 70% (100% being equal to PPFD 3000 µmol m<sup>−2</sup>s<sup>−1</sup> according to the manufacturer’s specifications) for the slugs and 50% for <italic>Acetabularia</italic>. OJIP curves were measured from samples that had been covered in their respective treatment media, which presented a concern with regard to the anaerobic measurements, as the samples were not in a closed environment and oxygen diffusion into the sample could not be prevented. The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref> shows that diffusion is largely negated during the additional 5-min dark period even in an open setup. The conditions during these OJIP measurements will be referred to as anaerobic although some diffusion of oxygen to the samples occurred.</p><p>Fast kinetics of P700 oxidation during a 780 ms MT pulse were measured with Dual-PAM 100 (Heinz Walz GmbH, Effeltrich, Germany) equipped with the linear positioning system stand 3010-DUAL/B designed for plant leaves and DUAL-E measuring head that detects absorbance changes at 830 nm (using 870 nm as a reference wavelength). The absorbance changes are not caused entirely by P700 redox state, as the contribution of other components of the electron transfer chain, plastocyanin and ferredoxin, cannot be distinguished from the P700 signal at this wavelength region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klughammer and Schreiber, 2016</xref>). P700 measurements were carried out essentially as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shimakawa et al., 2019</xref>, with slight modifications. We built a custom sample holder frame that can be sealed from the top and bottom with two microscope slide cover glasses by sliding the cover glasses into the frame. The frame of this sample holder was wide enough so that the soft stoppers of the Dual-PAM detector unit’s light guide could rest on it without disturbing the sample even when the top cover glass was not in place. A 3D-printable file for the sample holder is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://seafile.utu.fi/d/2bf6b91e85644daeb064/">https://seafile.utu.fi/d/2bf6b91e85644daeb064/</ext-link>.</p><p>The 635 nm light provided by the LED array of Dual-PAM was used for the MT pulse (780 ms, PPFD 10,000 µmol m<sup>−2</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>) in the P700<sup>+</sup> measurements. Fluorescence was not measured during the MT pulse, as the MB used for fluorescence seemed to disturb the P700<sup>+</sup> signal from the slugs. The drift of the signal made attempts to estimate the maximum oxidation level of P700 according to the standard protocol described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schreiber and Klughammer, 2008a</xref> impossible with the slugs. Measurements from the algae would not have required any special considerations due to a stronger signal, but the algae were nevertheless measured identically to the slugs for the sake of comparability. The measuring light intensity used for detecting the P700 absorbance changes had to be adjusted individually for each sample. All P700<sup>+</sup> kinetics were measured from individual slugs (i.e one slug represents one biological replicate), as pooling multiple slugs together for a single measurement did not noticeably enhance the signal.</p><p>Due to the delicate nature of the P700<sup>+</sup> signal, all slugs used for these measurements had to be decapitated with a razor blade before the measurements. It is important to note that obtaining a single, meaningful fast kinetics curve of P700 oxidation requires sacrificing a lot of slug individuals. In this study, a minimum of 10 individuals were used to construct each curve, because in approximately 30–50% of the measurements the signal was simply too noisy and drifting to contain any meaningful information.</p><p>The P700<sup>+</sup> measurements were carried out similarly to the OJIP measurements, with three main differences. First, the number of algae cells per measurement (representing one biological replicate) was higher, usually five to ten cells/strands forming an almost solid green area between the light guides of Dual-PAM inside the sample holder. Secondly, the anaerobic measurements were carried out in a sealed system, achieved by closing the sample holder with both cover glasses after filling it with anaerobic medium. Measurements from all other treatments were carried out in open sample holders. The third difference was that for some of the experiments a second MT pulse was fired after a 10 s dark period following the first MT pulse. This procedure is referred to as ‘second pulse P700 redox kinetics protocol’ in the main text.</p><p>Electrochromic shift (ECS, or P515) during a MT pulse (780 ms, 635 nm, PPFD 10000 µmol m<sup>−2</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>) was measured with P515 module of Dual-PAM 100 using the dual beam 550–515 transmittance difference signal (actual wavelengths used were 550 and 520 nm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schreiber and Klughammer, 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Klughammer et al., 2013</xref>). ECS from <italic>Acetabularia</italic> was measured using the exact same setup as with the P700 measurements, but ECS from the slug <italic>E. timida</italic> could only be measured using the pinhole accessory of Dual-PAM 100. Shortly, a pinhole plug was placed on the optical rod of the P515 detector and 3–5 decapitated slug individuals (representing one biological replicate) were placed into the hole of the plug, covering the optical path. After placing a sample between the optical rods of the P515 module, the ECS signal was calibrated and the MB was turned off to decrease the actinic effect caused by the MB. MB was turned back on again right before measuring the ECS kinetics during a MT pulse. The intensity of the MB was adjusted for each sample separately.</p><p>The P700 oxidation and ECS data from <italic>E. timida</italic> and <italic>Acetabularia</italic> were slope corrected, when needed, using the baseline subtraction tool of Origin 2016 v.9.3 (OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA, USA) to account for signal drift. All biological replicates used to construct the fast kinetics data figures (Q<sub>A</sub><sup>-</sup> reoxidation, OJIP, P700 oxidation and ECS) were normalized individually as indicated in the main text figures, and the normalized data were averaged to facilitate comparison between the samples.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Maximum quantum yield of PSII and rapid light response curves</title><p>Maximum quantum yield of PSII photochemistry (F<sub>V</sub>/F<sub>M</sub>) was routinely measured from slug individuals using PAM-2000 fluorometer (Heinz Walz GmbH) after minimum of 20 min darkness. The measurements were carried out by placing a dark acclimated slug on to the side of an empty Petri dish and then pipetting all ASW media out, leaving the slug relatively immobile for the time required for the measurement. The light guide of PAM-2000 was hand-held at a ~ 45° angle respective to the slug, using the side and bottom of the Petri dish as support, and a saturating pulse was fired. PAM-2000 settings used for F<sub>V</sub>/F<sub>M</sub> measurements from the slugs were as follows: MB intensity 10 (maximum), MB frequency 0.6 kHz, high MB frequency 20 kHz (automatically on during actinic light illumination), MT pulse intensity 10 (maximum, PPFD &gt; 10,000 µmol m<sup>−2</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>), MT pulse duration 0.8 s.</p><p>Measuring rapid light curves (RLCs) requires total immobilization of the slugs, a topic that has been thoroughly discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cruz et al., 2012</xref>. Instead of using the anaesthetic immobilization technique described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cruz et al., 2012</xref>, we tested yet another immobilization method to broaden the toolkit available for studying photosynthesis in Sacoglossan sea slugs. Alginate is a porous, biologically inert and transparent polymer that is widely used for fixing unicellular algae and cyanobacteria to create uniform and easy to handle biofilms or beads in for example biofuel research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kosourov and Seibert, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antal et al., 2014</xref>). For the fixation of the slugs, an individual slug (representing one biological replicate) was placed on a Petri dish and a small drop of 1% alginate (m/v in H<sub>2</sub>O) was pipetted on top of the slug, covering the slug entirely. Next, roughly the same volume of 0.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> was distributed evenly to the alginate drop to allow the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions to rapidly polymerize the alginate. The polymerization was allowed to continue for 10–30 s until the alginate had visibly solidified. All leftover CaCl<sub>2</sub> was removed with a tissue, and the slug fixed inside the alginate drop was placed under the fixed light guide of PAM-2000, in direct contact and in a 90° angle, for the measurement. After the measurement was over, the alginate drop was covered with abundant 1M Na-EDTA to rapidly chelate the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions and depolymerize the alginate. Once the slug was visibly free of alginate, it was immediately transferred to fresh ASW for rinsing with a Pasteur pipette. The slugs usually recovered full movement, defined as climbing the walls of the container, in 10–20 min. The slugs were placed into a new tank for breeding purposes once motility had been restored. We also tested the effect of alginate fixation on F<sub>V</sub>/F<sub>M</sub> during a 10-min time period, a typical length for RLC measurements, and no effect was noticeable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). All RLCs from algae were measured from five to ten cells/measurement (representing one biological replicate), using otherwise the same setup as with the slugs, except that alginate fixation was not applied. The basic settings for RLC measurements were the same as with F<sub>V</sub>/F<sub>M</sub> measurements, except for the MB intensity, which was adjusted to setting five with the algae to avoid oversaturation of the signal. Each light step lasted 90 s and the PPFDs that were used are shown in the figures. rETR was calculated as 0.42*Y(II)*PPFD, where 0.42 represents the fraction of incident photons absorbed by PSII, based on higher plant leaf assumptions, and Y(II) represents effective quantum yield of PSII photochemistry under illumination. NPQ was calculated as F<sub>M</sub>/F<sub>M’</sub>−1, where F<sub>M’</sub> represent maximum chlorophyll fluorescence of illuminated samples. See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kalaji et al., 2014</xref> for detailed descriptions of rETR and NPQ.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Feeding experiments</title><p>In order to ensure that the slugs incorporate only specifically acclimated chloroplasts inside their own cells, the first feeding experiment was done with slug individuals that had been kept away from their food for 4 weeks in 5 l tanks filled with fresh ASW medium in their normal culture conditions. The coloration of the slugs was pale after the starvation period, indicating a decrease in the chloroplast content within the slugs. Altogether 107 starved slug individuals were selected for the feeding experiments and divided to two tanks filled with abundant <italic>Acetabularia</italic> in f/2 culture medium, one tank containing high-CO<sub>2</sub> acclimated algae (54 slugs) and the other one algae grown in ambient air (53 slugs). The tanks with the slugs and algae in them were put to their respective growth conditions for 4 days to allow the slugs to incorporate new chloroplasts inside their cells. The tanks were not aerated during the feeding, but the tank lids were unlocked for both feeding groups. The elevated CO<sub>2</sub> level in the closed culture cabinet posed a problem, as it noticeably affected the slug behavior by making them sessile in comparison to normal growth conditions, probably due to increased replacement of O<sub>2</sub> by CO<sub>2</sub>. Because of this, the slugs selected for feeding on the high-CO<sub>2</sub> acclimated algae were fed in cycles where the tanks were in the closed CO<sub>2</sub> cabinet for most of the time during the daylight hours, but taken out every few hours and mixed with ambient air by stirring and kept in the ambient-air conditions for 1–2 hr before taking the tanks back to the high-CO<sub>2</sub> cabinet. The tanks were always left inside the closed cabinets for the nights in order to inflict minimal changes to the acclimation state of the algae. After 4 days of feeding, 50 slug individuals of similar size and coloration were selected from both feeding groups and distributed into 2 new 5 l tanks/feeding group, filled with approximately 2 l of 3.7% ASW medium and containing no algae. All slugs (25+25 ambient-air slugs, 25+25 high-CO<sub>2</sub> slugs) were moved to ambient-air growth conditions and kept in the dark overnight in order to allow maximal incorporation of the chloroplasts before starting the starvation experiment in steady-light conditions.</p><p>For the second feeding experiment, the 4-week pre-starvation period of the slugs was discarded to see whether the differences in photosynthetic parameters between the two feeding groups could be inflicted just by allowing the slugs to replace their old kleptoplasts with the specific chloroplasts fed to them. We selected 100 slugs from normal growth conditions and divided them once again into two tanks containing f/2 culture medium and <italic>Acetabularia</italic> that had been acclimated to ambient air (50 slugs) or high CO<sub>2</sub> (50 slugs). The slugs were allowed to feed for 6 days, but otherwise the feeding protocol was identical to the one used in the first feeding experiment. After the sixth day of feeding, 45 slug individuals of similar size and coloration were selected from both feeding groups and divided to two new 5 l tanks (20+25 ambient-air slugs, 20+25 1% CO<sub>2</sub> slugs) filled with approximately 2 l of ASW and kept overnight in the dark before starting the starvation experiment in fluctuating light.</p><p>A third feeding experiment was conducted in order to create the red morphotype of <italic>E. timida</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">González-Wangüemert et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Costa et al., 2012</xref>). Slug individuals from normal growth conditions were selected and placed in Petri dishes filled with f/2 culture medium and abundant red <italic>Acetabularia</italic>. The slugs were allowed to eat the algae for 2 days in the normal culture conditions of the slugs prior to the measurements. Three Petri dishes were filled with just the red form <italic>Acetabularia</italic> in f/2 culture medium in exactly the same conditions, and these algae were used for measurements regarding the red morphotypes of <italic>Acetabularia</italic> and <italic>E. timida</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Starvation experiments</title><p>Two different starvation experiments were carried out with ambient-air slugs and high-CO<sub>2</sub> slugs. In the first one the slugs from the first feeding experiment were starved in steady-light conditions, where the only changes in the incident light were due to the day/night light cycle (12/12 hr). Here, all four tanks (25+25 ambient-air slugs, 25+25 high-CO<sub>2</sub> slugs) were placed under white LED lights (Växer PAR30 E27, 10 W; Ikea, Delft, The Netherlands; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref> for the spectrum) adjusted to PPFD 40 µmol m<sup>−2</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>. Temperature was maintained at 23°C and the tanks were not aerated during the starvation experiment apart from the passive gas flux that was facilitated by the unlocked lids of the tanks. Fresh ASW medium (approximately 500 ml) was added to the tanks every second day and the slugs were placed into new tanks with fresh ASW 1–2 times a week throughout the entire starvation period of 46 days. The day following the overnight dark period that the slugs were subjected to after the feeding experiment was noted as day 0 in the starvation experiments. F<sub>V</sub>/F<sub>M</sub> during starvation was measured from individual slugs (representing one biological replicate) as indicated in the main text figures. Sampling caused losses to the slug populations on days 0, 5, and 15, when 10 slug individuals/group were selected for P700 oxidation kinetics measurements. Unfortunately, the P700<sup>+</sup> signals after 15 days in starvation were too weak and noisy for any meaningful interpretations. Before day 25, starvation induced mortality of both groups was 0. After that the ambient-air slug population suffered losses on days 27 (1 slug), 35 (2 slugs), 45 (5 slugs), 46 (1 slug) altogether nine slugs. For the high-CO<sub>2</sub> slug population the losses were as follows: day 27 (1 slug), 29 (1 slug), 31 (1 slug), 45 (8 slugs) and 46 (1 slug), 12 slugs in total. Lengths of the slugs were estimated from images taken at set intervals essentially as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Christa et al., 2018</xref>. Images were taken with a cropped sensor DSLR camera equipped with a macro lens (Canon EOS 7D MKII + Canon EF-S 60 mm f/2.8 Macro lens; Canon Inc, Tokyo, Japan) and the body length of each slug individual was estimated using the image analysis software Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). The slugs from both feeding groups were pooled into one tank/group after day 25 in starvation.</p><p>The second starvation experiment was carried out using ambient-air slugs and high-CO<sub>2</sub> slugs from the second feeding experiment. The four tanks from both feeding groups (20+25 ambient-air slugs, 20+25 high-CO<sub>2</sub> slugs) were placed under a fluctuating light regime. The day/night cycle was maintained at 12/12 hr, but during the daylight hours the background illumination (PPFD 40 µmol m<sup>−2</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>) was supplemented with a 10 s pulse of high light (PPFD 1500 µmol m<sup>−2</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>) every 10 min. Both the background illumination and the high-light pulses originated from a programmable Heliospectra L4A greenhouse lamp (model 001.010; Heliospectra, Göteborg, Sweden; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref> for the irradiance spectra). All other conditions and procedures were identical to the ones used in the first starvation experiment. F<sub>V</sub>/F<sub>M</sub> during starvation was measured as indicated in the main text figures. Sampling caused losses to the slug populations on days 0 and 6, when 10 slugs/group were selected for P700 redox kinetics measurements, and on day 10, when five slugs/group were selected for RLC measurements. No images were taken during the starvation experiment in fluctuating light. The slugs were pooled into one tank/feeding group after 25 days in starvation. Chlorophyll was extracted from the slugs with N,N-dimethylformamide and chlorophyll <italic>a/b</italic> was estimated spectrophotometrically according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Porra et al., 1989</xref>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was funded by Academy of Finland (grants 307335 and 333421).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Christian Hardtke as the Senior and Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>The reviewers all appreciate your manuscript, which aims to explore the mechanistic basis of a unique biological phenomenon. However, they are also of the opinion that your paper is too speculative at this point and requires further experimental evidence to substantiate your claims.</p><p>In particular, it is essential that you provide definite proof for the (elevated) presence of flavodiiron (FLV) in the plastids/slug tissue. The FLV hypothesis is crucial to your paper because it might explain protective P700 re-oxidation under fluctuating light. What is clearly needed then is firm evidence for the existence of an FLV in either the algae or the slug. For example, to start with, does the <italic>Acetabularia</italic>/slug genome encode FLVs? Or ideally, could an FLV be detected in the slug body or the algae?</p><p>Please note that data supporting the existence of FLVs in your study system are required for further consideration of your manuscript. In a revised version, please also address the individual review comments, which you can find pasted below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Sacoglossan sea slugs (<italic>Elysia timida</italic> in this study) are probably the only known animals capable of photosynthesis. The slugs eat certain algae (<italic>Acetabularia acetabulum</italic> in this study), extract (or rather &quot;steal) their chloroplasts and incorporate them in their own cells. This phenomenon known as kleptoplasty allows Elysia to survive for longer under starvation conditions. However, inside the slug the chloroplasts are cut off from their normal host organism <italic>Acetabularia</italic>. As such they must rely on what they had when they were stolen. Therefore, the question is how the chloroplasts are able to survive and remain functional for a month or so inside the slug cells.</p><p>This study suggests that the chloroplasts inside the slug undergo a number of adaptations that may be life prolonging outside the host organism:</p><p>– A more oxidized plastoquinone pool, that would relieve oxidative stress on Photosystem II</p><p>– Rapid acidification of the thylakoid lumen and enhanced non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), a mechanism that can protect photosynthetic organisms from the effects of excess light.</p><p>– A high P700 oxidation capacity that may increase the longevity of chloroplasts in the slugs under fluctuating light. The high P700 oxidation capacity was attributed to the hypothetical presence of flavodiiron proteins (FLVs) as electron acceptors at the level of Photosystem I. The FLVs would have to originate from the <italic>Acetabularia</italic> algae.</p><p>This is a fascinating study that should be suitable for the journal and its broad audience. The manuscript is expertly written and the figures are of excellent quality.</p><p>It is believable that the above-mentioned photosynthetic adaptations may contribute to the longevity of the chloroplasts inside the slug cells. Overall, the data appear solid but they also raise some questions.</p><p>It is imaginable that the above-mentioned photosynthetic adaptations may contribute to the longevity of the chloroplasts inside the slug cells. Overall, the data are intriguing but also raise a number of questions, mostly with regard to the comparison of the algae and slug systems:</p><p>1) The flavodiiron (FLV) hypothesis is crucial to this paper and might explain protective P700 re-oxidation under fluctuating light. What is clearly needed here (and should be added) is evidence for the existence of a FLV in either the algae or the slug. Does the <italic>Acetabularia</italic> genome (or that of related species) encode FLVs? Or could an FLV be detected somehow (Western blot, mass spec) in the slug body or the algae?</p><p>2) With regard to the measurements: how does the animal body and physiology influence the photosynthetic parameters? Could altered CO2 concentrations or the addition of DCMU alter slug physiology or metabolism in a way that would be reflected at the level of slug photosynthetic parameters? Are the chlorophyll concentrations and the extinction properties of the algae and slug samples comparable so that equal light intensities would result in a similar level of chlorophyll excitation and therefore induce similar NPQ?</p><p>3)The electrochromic shift in Figure 4A was measured at 520 and 550 nm: is there any possible contribution here by electrochromism occurring in the animal body and outside the kleptoplast? It may be interesting to test this in kleptoplast-free Elysia slugs.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This study provides a far-reaching investigation of chloroplasts physiology in <italic>Acetabularia</italic> algae and upon integration into sea slug cells. It raises new hypothesis and show strong evidences, for mechanisms explaining long-term maintenance of functional kleptoplasts inside the animal cells.</p><p>The Introduction is clear and well written, providing all necessary background to contextualize the study. The level of detail in the Materials and methods is impressive and incredibly useful. The results are explained in detail.</p><p>Overall, as a reader, I was left with a feeling of honest and clear explanations throughout the manuscript, as all scientific manuscript should be. Criticism to other studies is also made in a constructive manner.</p><p>I do not hesitate recommending this work for publication. It will be of interest for both specific communities investigating kleptoplasty (in Sacoglossa and others) but also for researchers investigating plant physiology and endosymbiosis theory.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This manuscript describes spectroscopic investigation of kleptoplastids in the sea slug <italic>Elysia timida</italic>. The authors appear to have achieved a technical advance in establishing an experimental system for culturing populations of Elysia (and <italic>Acetabulariaacetabulum</italic>, a green alga that it feeds on), and this enables them to make extensive measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence and absorbance changes to investigate the photosynthetic electron transport chain in kleptoplastids in situ.

The slugs eat certain algae (Acetabularia acetabulum in this study), extract (or rather &quot;steal) their chloroplasts and incorporate them in their own cells. This phenomenon known as kleptoplasty allows Elysia to survive for longer under starvation conditions. However, inside the slug the chloroplasts are cut off from their normal host organism Acetabularia. As such they must rely on what they had when they were stolen. Therefore, the question is how the chloroplasts are able to survive and remain functional for a month or so inside the slug cells.</p><p>This study suggests that the chloroplasts inside the slug undergo a number of adaptations that may be life prolonging outside the host organism:</p><p>– A more oxidized plastoquinone pool, that would relieve oxidative stress on Photosystem II.</p><p>– Rapid acidification of the thylakoid lumen and enhanced non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), a mechanism that can protect photosynthetic organisms from the effects of excess light.</p><p>– A high P700 oxidation capacity that may increase the longevity of chloroplasts in the slugs under fluctuating light. The high P700 oxidation capacity was attributed to the hypothetical presence of flavodiiron proteins (FLVs) as electron acceptors at the level of Photosystem I. The FLVs would have to originate from the Acetabularia algae.</p><p>This is a fascinating study that should be suitable for the journal and its broad audience. The manuscript is expertly written and the figures are of excellent quality.</p><p>It is believable that the above-mentioned photosynthetic adaptations may contribute to the longevity of the chloroplasts inside the slug cells. Overall, the data appear solid but they also raise some questions.</p><p>It is imaginable that the above-mentioned photosynthetic adaptations may contribute to the longevity of the chloroplasts inside the slug cells. Overall, the data are intriguing but also raise a number of questions, mostly with regard to the comparison of the algae and slug systems:</p><p>1) The flavodiiron (FLV) hypothesis is crucial to this paper and might explain protective P700 re-oxidation under fluctuating light. What is clearly needed here (and should be added) is evidence for the existence of a FLV in either the algae or the slug. Does the Acetabularia genome (or that of related species) encode FLVs? Or could an FLV be detected somehow (Western blot, mass spec) in the slug body or the algae?</p></disp-quote><p>The existence of FLVs in <italic>Acetabularia</italic> was confirmed by Western blot analysis using an antibody raised against <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> FLVB protein; the antibody reacts with FLVA and FLVB of <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> (Figure 6 and associated text, Results subsection “P700 redox kinetics in <italic>E. timida</italic> are affected by the acclimation status of its prey”, last paragraph, Discussion subsections “Flavodiiron proteins function as alternative electron sinks in <italic>E. timida</italic> and <italic>Acetabularia</italic>” and “High P700 oxidation capacity improves kleptoplast longevity under fluctuating light”, Materials and methods subsection “Protein analysis”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) With regard to the measurements: how does the animal body and physiology influence the photosynthetic parameters? Could altered CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations or the addition of DCMU alter slug physiology or metabolism in a way that would be reflected at the level of slug photosynthetic parameters?</p></disp-quote><p>This in an important point, and unfortunately we do not have a definitive answer for the effects of DCMU and elevated CO<sub>2</sub> levels on slug metabolism. Based on our observations about the viability of the slugs, however, they do not seem to be severely affected by DCMU when used in the 10 µM concentration utilized in this study. Also a previous study has shown that another PSII blocking diuron, monolinuron, does not dramatically affect viability of another slug species, <italic>Plakobranchus ocellatus</italic> (Christa et al. 2013 Plastid-bearing sea slugs fix CO<sub>2</sub> in the light but do not require photosynthesis to survive. Proc. Biol. Sci. 281:20132493. DOI: 10.1098/rspb.2013.2493).</p><p>Based on our own observations, <italic>E. timida</italic> slugs do bleach fast when starved in the light in the presence of DCMU, but in our study only freshly fed slugs were utilized in DCMU experiments. Since the slugs do not e.g. curl up when exposed to DCMU, we believe that the optical properties of the slugs are not severely affected by DCMU treatment, when compared to non-treated slug individuals.</p><p>As for elevated CO<sub>2</sub> levels, they do seem to affect the motility of the slugs, as they become sessile, as described in the Materials and methods of the text. However, all slug measurements from high CO<sub>2</sub> slugs were performed after at least an overnight settling period in ambient air, after which the slugs had recovered full motility. The possibility of DCMU not blocking all PSII units in the slugs is now discussed in the third paragraph of the subsection “Full photochemical reduction of the electron transfer chain during a dark-to-light transition is delayed in <italic>E. timida</italic>”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are the chlorophyll concentrations and the extinction properties of the algae and slug samples comparable so that equal light intensities would result in a similar level of chlorophyll excitation and therefore induce similar NPQ?</p></disp-quote><p>The optical properties between the slugs and the algae do differ. However, our unpublished data related to another study show that the slugs in fact absorb less light on a Chl basis than the algae. This affects light utilization by photosynthesis, i.e. less photons are utilized by the slugs than the algae. We have tried to downplay this problem by mainly analyzing data obtained by truly saturating pulses (PPFD 10 000 µmol m<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> or more). When this was not possible, as was the case with Aquapen used for the OJIP measurements, we felt it necessary to include data obtained with a set of high light pulses of differing intensities that showcase the saturating effect of the light pulse that was referred to in the main text.</p><p>It is certainly true that since the light absorption properties of the slugs are different from the algae, the light intensities presented in the X-axes of the RLC figures do not tell the whole truth concerning light utilization by the slugs vs. the algae. However, since the slugs absorb less light per Chl, the stronger NPQ in the slugs is even more remarkable, further emphasizing our point, that the slugs induce physiological changes in the chloroplasts that help the chloroplasts remain functional inside the slug tissue. As the data showing the absorption on a Chl basis has not been published yet, we cannot discuss this point in this manuscript in full detail, but changes have been made to the text that emphasize the optical differences between the slugs and the algae (subsection “Full photochemical reduction of the electron transfer chain during a dark-to-light transition is delayed in <italic>E. timida</italic>”, third paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3)The electrochromic shift in Figure 4A was measured at 520 and 550 nm: is there any possible contribution here by electrochromism occurring in the animal body and outside the kleptoplast?

However, photodamage to PSII has been studied for decades and usually F<sub>M</sub> decreases but F<sub>0</sub> stays almost unchanged. Increase in F<sub>0</sub> has been seen in a few cases, especially under anaerobic conditions (see the review by Tyystjärvi 2008, Coord Chem Rev 252: 361-376) or in very low light (see Tyystjärvi and Aro 1996, PNAS 93: 2213-2218). An obvious reason for an unchanged F<sub>0</sub> is that the photoinhibited PSII reaction centers quench excitation energy. In higher plants, this quenching behavior has also been experimentally verified (Matsubara and Chow, 2004). The behavior of F<sub>0</sub> during a photoinhibition experiment depends on the experimental details, as quenching by photoinhibited PSII lowers both F<sub>M</sub> and F<sub>0</sub> while photodamage would simultaneously cause an increase in F<sub>0</sub>. In the case of starving slugs, the overall decrease in the number of kleptoplasts adds a third factor to the equation.
