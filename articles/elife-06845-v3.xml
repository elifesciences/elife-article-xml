The chromatin remodeler SWR1 mediates site-specific incorporation of H2A.Z by a multi-step histone replacement reaction, evicting histone H2A-H2B from the canonical nucleosome and depositing the H2A.Z-H2B dimer. Binding of both substrates, the canonical nucleosome and the H2A.Z-H2B dimer, is essential for activation of SWR1. We found that SWR1 primarily recognizes key residues within the α2 helix in the histone-fold of nucleosomal histone H2A, a region not previously known to influence remodeler activity. Moreover, SWR1 interacts preferentially with nucleosomal DNA at superhelix location 2 on the nucleosome face distal to its linker-binding site. Our findings provide new molecular insights on recognition of the canonical nucleosome by a chromatin remodeler and have implications for ATP-driven mechanisms of histone eviction and deposition.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06845.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06845.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06845.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A DNA molecule can be several meters long and to fit this length inside a cell, it is wrapped around proteins called histones. This compacts the DNA to form a structure known as chromatin; complexes of DNA and histones, called nucleosomes, serve as the building blocks of chromatin.</p><p>Cells regulate the organization of chromatin to switch genes ‘on’ and ‘off’. Complexes of proteins, such as SWR1, alter the packing of chromatin and are known as ‘chromatin modifiers’. To express a gene, parts of the chromatin have to unpack to allow various proteins and other factors to access to the underlying DNA. Chromatin remodeling enzymes can loosen chromatin by sliding nucleosomes away from each other, removing them altogether, or replacing one type of histone with another. For example, a histone variant called H2A.Z appears to poise genes for expression and is enriched near the start sites of most genes in the genome. The SWR1 complex evicts the conventional, ‘canonical histone’ called H2A that is already present at these sites and replaces them with H2A.Z.</p><p>H2A.Z is related to H2A, and the SWR1 complex can interact with both of these proteins. However, it remains poorly understood how SWR1 can discriminate between the two at the molecular level. Ranjan et al. have now addressed this in budding yeast cells, by constructing hybrids that contain parts of H2A combined with H2A.Z. The experiments revealed that the SWR1 complex recognizes key elements within the histone H2A protein itself that differ from H2A.Z. Binding to H2A activates SWR1 and causes it to replace H2A with H2A.Z.</p><p>Ranjan et al. next looked to see if the SWR1 complex also interacts with the DNA present within a nucleosome and whether any gaps in the DNA interfere with histone replacement. The experiments revealed that gaps in DNA at a specific region of the nucleosome prevent SWR1 from depositing H2A.Z. Therefore, close contact between SWR1 and a nucleosome's DNA is another factor that is required for SWR1 activity. These findings provide new insights as to how SWR1 recognizes histone and DNA elements of a canonical nucleosome. Further work is needed to understand how SWR1 acts to replace H2A with H2A.Z.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06845.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06845.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>chromatin remodeler</kwd><kwd>nucleosome</kwd><kwd>H2A.Z</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Janelia Research Campus</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ranjan</surname><given-names>Anand</given-names></name><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Carl</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute (NCI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ranjan</surname><given-names>Anand</given-names></name><name><surname>Wei</surname><given-names>Debbie</given-names></name><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Carl</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Specific elements of the canonical nucleosome are recognized by the multi-component SWR1 chromatin remodeler for ATP-dependent replacement of H2A-H2B dimers with H2A.Z-H2B.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The histone variant H2A.Z, a universal component of nucleosomes flanking eukaryotic promoters, enhancers, and other genetic elements, has an important role in transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Santisteban et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barski et al., 2007</xref>). In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, H2A.Z is deposited by the ATP-dependent activity of the multi-component SWI/SNF-related SWR1 complex, which replaces nucleosomal histone H2A-H2B with H2A.Z-H2B in a coupled histone-dimer transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mizuguchi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Luk et al., 2010</xref>). SWR1 recruitment to nucleosome-deficient or nucleosome-free regions (NFRs) of yeast promoters is due to its preference for nucleosomes adjoining long linker DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ranjan et al., 2013</xref>), but post-recruitment activation of the SWR1 complex requires binding of both its natural substrates—the canonical nucleosome and the H2A.Z-H2B dimer—which also serve as essential activators of SWR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Luk et al., 2010</xref>). Progression of the SWR1-mediated reaction on the canonical ‘AA’ nucleosome generates the ‘AZ’ and ‘ZZ’ nucleosome states consecutively, which leads to repression of the ATPase and histone exchange activities of SWR1 by the H2A.Z-nucleosome end-product, thereby preventing futile expenditure of chemical energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Luk et al., 2010</xref>). Specific α-C helix residues of H2A.Z on the free H2A.Z-H2B dimer are critical for its SWR1-activating function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clarkson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wu et al., 2005</xref>). However, the key-activating elements of the canonical nucleosome that distinguish it from the non-activating H2A.Z-nucleosome have been obscure. Here, we show that the histone-fold, but not the α-C helix of histone H2A in the nucleosome, has a major role in the activation of the SWR1 complex. We also define a local DNA site on the nucleosome core particle that is critical for activating SWR1.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To identify elements of histone H2A on the canonical nucleosome that activate SWR1, we constructed hybrids in which H2A segments were systematically interchanged with segments of histone H2A.Z. Hybrid nucleosome substrates were reconstituted and analyzed by a SWR1-mediated histone H2A.Z replacement assay. Interchanging the M6 and α-C regions of H2A with H2A.Z on the nucleosome had only a small effect on SWR1 activity as measured by nucleosomal incorporation of H2A.Z-3xFlag, which generates a native gel mobility upshift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Strikingly, an additional interchange of the M4 domain of nucleosomal H2A with H2A.Z caused a ∼90% decrease in H2A.Z replacement by SWR1, and extension of the interchange to M2 and M3 domains further reduced SWR1's activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Interchanging the M4 domain alone caused a large reduction in activity of SWR1, and activity was also reduced by interchange of M5 and M3A domains individually, whereas M2 and M3B domain interchanges had minimal effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Thus, residues contained entirely within the H2A histone-fold motif (the α1 helix, α2 helix, and loop 2) contribute to activation of SWR1. Underlying mechanism(s) could include improved enzyme binding, as the non-activating H2A.Z-nucleosome shows slightly decreased affinity for SWR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), but activation at a post-recruitment step is required, because neither ATPase stimulation nor histone replacement occurs under saturating conditions ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Luk et al., 2010</xref>] and data not shown). Interchange of the M4 region of H2A for H2A.Z (substitution of five residues) in yeast causes lethality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). This indicates that the N-terminal portion of the H2A α2 helix provides an essential function apart from regulating SWR1 activity, which itself is not essential for viability. Glycine 47 is the only surface accessible H2A-specific residue in the M4 region. Strains bearing single or double amino acid substitutions to corresponding H2A.Z residues-G47K and P49A are viable. The single P49A substitution showed no reduction (even an increase) of H2A.Z levels at gene promoters by ChIP-PCR. However, the G47K interchange in the M4 region shows reduced H2A.Z incorporation (average 63% of WT), as does the double-substitution G47K, P49A (average 54% of WT), suggesting that G47 facilitates activation of SWR1 in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06845.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>H2A histone regions in the canonical nucleosome that activate H2A.Z replacement by SWR1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Left</italic>: H2A/H2A.Z hybrid histones used for reconstituting nucleosomes. <italic>Right</italic>: Histone H2A.Z replacement assay.

Further scanning identified a 6 nt region (−17 to −22 nt from the dyad), whose integrity is required for histone replacement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

Introduction of gaps on both sides of the nucleosome dyad caused a complete failure of H2A.Z replacement by SWR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Taken together, our findings indicate that close contact between SWR1 and nucleosomal DNA around SHL2 is critical for enzyme activation.

SWR1 quantitatively evicts both H2A-H2B dimers on this nucleosome, replacing them with H2A.Z-H2B, but whether nucleosome positioning was also altered was unknown. To examine this question, we used a 601 nucleosome bearing a 60 bp linker on one side, and a native PAGE mobility assay, which separates nucleosomes on the basis of different linker lengths and spatial orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hamiche et al., 1999</xref>). We found no substantial mobility shift indicative of a repositioned nucleosome after incorporation of (untagged) H2A.Z-H2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Similar results were obtained for a center-positioned 601 nucleosome (data not shown). By contrast, the INO80 remodeler mobilized the nucleosome from the end- to center-position, as shown by gel mobility shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Shen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Udugama et al., 2011</xref>).

A DNA site at SHL2 on the nucleosome, in a region identified for DNA translocation by chromatin remodelers RSC, SWI/SNF, ISW2, and ISW1, is also important for histone exchange by SWR1. The ATPase domains of the SNF2 and ISW2 nucleosome sliding complexes are known to interact with the nucleosome at SHL2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dang and Bartholomew, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dechassa et al., 2012</xref>), and we envision that the catalytic Swr1 ATPase also contacts the SHL2 site. Footprinting experiments show that other chromatin remodelers contact the nucleosome core particle at either the linker-proximal side or both sides of the dyad axis; however, SWR1 contacts the core particle on the linker-distal side of the dyad. This distinction between SWR1 and other remodelers may reflect the unique requirements of dimer eviction and deposition as opposed to nucleosome sliding. Within the nucleosome core particle, each H2A-H2B dimer is stabilized by histone–DNA interactions (at three minor groove locations SHL3.5, SHL4.5, and SHL5.5) and histone–histone interactions (the α2 and α3 helices of H2B interact with α2 and α3 helices of H4 in a four-helix bundle). For histone exchange, SWR1 must disrupt either one or both of these interactions, coordinated with H2A.Z-H2B deposition. This might be initiated by transient, confined DNA translocation by the SWR1 ATPase essentially as indicated for other remodelers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clapier and Cairns, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mueller-Planitz et al., 2013</xref>), but without propagation as histone exchange is not accompanied by repositioning of the histone octamer on DNA. Alternatively, histone replacement could be initiated by a local, ATP-driven DNA conformational change near SHL2 that alters the path of the DNA superhelix, resulting in destabilization of H2A-H2B contacts with DNA or with the H3-H4 tetramer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>In budding yeast, the +1 nucleosome flanked on one side by a NFR would orient SWR1 to interact with the linker-distal face. We speculate that this configuration favors replacement of the H2A-H2B dimer on the NFR-distal side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Consistent with this possibility, recent genome-wide sub-nucleosomal mapping shows enrichment of H2A.Z at the NFR-distal face of the +1 nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Rhee et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Earlier work has shown that the structures of H2A- and H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes show prominent differences in the region C-terminal to the histone-fold domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Suto et al., 2000</xref>). This C-terminal region is important for binding of the free H2A.Z-H2B dimer to specific chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Luk et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hong et al., 2014</xref>), and for effector interactions post-incorporation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clarkson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 2001</xref>). For histone H2A.Z replacement, our analysis shows that SWR1 utilizes other unique and conserved features of the H2A nucleosome for substrate specificity. Of the three SWR1-activating regions of the H2A histone-fold, the α2 helix and loop 2 are exposed on the nucleosome surface for contact with SWR1, whereas the α1 helix is buried and may act by allostery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Residue G47 of the H2A α2 helix is highly conserved and is located at the bottom of a cleft (∼8 Å deep) on the H2A nucleosome surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). This cleft might serve as a structural feature for recognition by SWR1; the presence of a Lysine residue at this position in H2A.Z would fill it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). It would be of interest to determine structural interactions of SWR1 with this local nucleosome surface. Our findings provide new insights on the structural basis by which canonical and H2A.Z-nucleosomes are recognized by SWR1 and should facilitate future studies of the histone H2A.Z replacement mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains and plasmids</title><p>Plasmid pZS66 used in this study was a gift from Zu-Wen Sun.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by James Manley (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Irwin Davidson (Reviewing editor) and Bradley Cairns (peer reviewer). A further reviewer remains anonymous.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Ranjan et al. searched and identified elements of the canonical nucleosome that activate the chromatin remodeling SWR1 complex for histone H2A.Z replacement. They constructed hybrids in which H2A segments were systematically interchanged with segments of histone H2A.Z. Hybrid nucleosome substrates were then reconstituted and analyzed by a SWR1-mediated histone H2A.Z replacement assay. The authors were able to show that the nucleosomal H2A α-2 helix, but not the α-C helix, plays a major role in the activation of the SWR1 complex. They also identified a local DNA site on the nucleosome core particle (around SHL2) that is critical for activating SWR1. Overall, the work is well designed, well executed, and well presented. The manuscript is clearly and concisely written. Notably, the extensive work involving DNA gaps near SHL2 shows that the reaction progresses from AA to AZ when a gap is located on one side, but is prevented (remains AA) when gaps reside on both sides (in the 17-22 region). These experiments are convincing and really inform the mechanism. Also, the apparent lack of nucleosome sliding provides an interesting contrast to other remodelers.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>A specific and substantive concern raised by both peer reviewers concerns the lack of in vivo data. While the biochemistry is very clean and convincing some concerns are present in the current manuscript. The most important issue is the lack of in vivo data validating the importance of the M4 box for H2A eviction and H2A.Z exchange. The authors should better define the M4 epitope and introduce the H2A M4 mutant in yeast and assess how this mutant affects H2A.Z incorporation even at a small defined set of loci. This will certainly give a broader significance to their findings.</p><p>M4 has a very strong effect (reduction) on replacement, M5 is moderate, and M3a is modest, but lacks a higher level of resolution. Having shown such a strong affect in M4, and pointing out both the conservation and positioning of G47 and P49 within this region, the work begs for an examination of their individual affects, and for a test in vivo. A limited but effective version might involve a single amino acid replacement in H2A (entirely feasible in yeast) and examination of H2A.Z replacement in vivo at a set of locations by qPCR (genome-wide not required), to establish that a reduction in replacement occurs.</p><p>The Discussion is quite short, and the general reader may not understand why interaction of SWR1 with intact DNA at SHL+2 (followed by ATP hydrolysis) is needed to remove a linker-distal H2A-H2B dimer. One can explain this by the ATPase pulling/translocating/twisting DNA from SHL+2, breaking histone-DNA contacts and therefore making the H2A-H2B dimer susceptible to release/replacement. It is clear from the positioning data that the DNA does not reposition greatly, so perhaps this pull/translocation/twist is both short and confined (in part, by SWR1 binding to the exit/linker); here, the DNA may simply collapse back to its original location following replacement by H2A.Z. The authors might have a different model in mind, but a more mechanical explanation (perhaps with a model figure) might help the reader understand more fully the interesting implications of this data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06845.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>A specific and substantive concern raised by both peer reviewers concerns the lack of in vivo data.

First, we interchanged the M4 region of H2A for H2A.Z (substitution of 5 residues) and examined the mutant phenotype in yeast. We found that the M4 swap causes lethality in yeast cells, indicating that the N-terminal portion of the H2A α2 helix provides an essential function apart from regulating SWR1 activity, which is not essential for cell viability. The single P49A substitution is viable, and shows no reduction (even an increase) of H2A.Z levels on a sample of yeast gene promoters by ChIP-PCR. However, the G47K interchange of the only surface-accessible residue in the M4 region shows reduced H2A.Z incorporation, as does the double-substitution G47K, P49A. Thus, our in vivo findings are consistent with, and support the importance of the M4 region of H2A in activating SWR1 in vitro. We have included a new supplemental figure, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref>, and discussed the data in the revised text (Results, first paragraph).</p><p><italic>The Discussion is quite short, and the general reader may not understand why interaction of SWR1 with intact DNA at SHL+2 (followed by ATP hydrolysis) is needed to remove a linker-distal H2A-H2B dimer.

The authors might have a different model in mind, but a more mechanical explanation (perhaps with a model figure) might help the reader understand more fully the interesting implications of this data</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for requesting further articulation of mechanism(s), which was precluded by the word limit for the short article format. The paragraph below and model figure have been introduced in the revised text, which we hope will help the reader envision how histone replacement might occur.</p><p>“Within the nucleosome core particle each H2A-H2B dimer is stabilized by histone-DNA interactions (at three minor groove locations: SHL3.5, SHL4.5 and SHL5.5) and histone-histone interactions (α2 and α3 helices of H2B interact with α2 and α3 helices of H4 in a four-helix bundle). For histone exchange, SWR1 must disrupt either one or both of these interactions, coordinated with H2A.Z-H2B deposition. This might be initiated by transient, confined DNA translocation by the SWR1 ATPase essentially as indicated for other remodelers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clapier and Cairns, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mueller-Planitz et al., 2013</xref>)<underline>,</underline> but without propagation as histone exchange is not accompanied by repositioning of the histone octamer on DNA. Alternatively, histone replacement could be initiated by a local, ATP-driven DNA conformational change near SHL2 that alters the path of the DNA superhelix, resulting in destabilization of H2A-H2B contacts with DNA or with the H3-H4 tetramer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2B</xref>).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
