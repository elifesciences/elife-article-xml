In this study, we demonstrate the resource-dependent nature of predictive mechanisms in language comprehension across the lifespan: Experimentally limiting executive resources through a concurrent task reduces the effect of language predictability on reading time. Participants (<italic>N</italic> = 175, replication <italic>N</italic> = 96) read short articles presented word-by-word while completing a secondary font colour <italic>n</italic>-back task, thus varying cognitive demand. Language predictability was indexed by word surprisal as derived from a pre-trained large language model (GPT-2). Across two independent samples, our findings reveal that language predictions are not cost-free: They draw on executive control resources, and this dependency becomes more pronounced with age (18–85 years). These results help resolve the debate over cognitive demands in language comprehension and highlight prediction as a dynamic, resource-dependent process across the lifespan.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Understanding language requires more than simply recognizing individual words. Instead, readers and listeners continuously generate predictions about what might come next. For instance, after reading “She walked her…”, most individuals would probably anticipate the word “dog.”</p><p>Such predictive processes facilitate comprehension, making it faster and more efficient. Yet, a long-standing debate concerns whether these predictions emerge effortlessly and automatically, or whether they depend on domain-general executive resources, including working memory, attention, inhibitory control and goal-directed behaviour. Importantly, these resources are finite: they can be temporarily depleted when performing additional non-linguistic tasks and generally decline with age.</p><p>Schuckart et al. investigated whether language prediction during reading relies on executive resources and how language prediction might change with age as executive functioning declines. Employing a dual task reading paradigm, they examined how imposing a cognitively demanding secondary task influenced the effect of word predictability on reading speed in adults aged 18 to 85. This approach addressed a fundamental question in psycholinguistics – whether prediction is automatic or resource-dependent – and shed light on why language comprehension remains robust despite age-related cognitive decline.</p><p>The study involved 175 participants, with an independent replication sample of 96, who read texts word by word while sometimes performing a concurrent working-memory task. Word predictability was quantified using ‘surprisal’, a lexical score derived from the large language model GPT-2, which provides information about how unpredictable a word is.</p><p>The results revealed that less predictable words were read more slowly, confirming that readers actively generated linguistic predictions. The effect of predictability diminished under increased cognitive load, demonstrating that language prediction draws on executive resources. Older adults exhibited stronger predictability effects overall, but these were also more susceptible to reduction when executive resources were taxed. Together, the results show that language prediction is not cost-free and changes systematically across the adult lifespan.</p><p>These findings advance our understanding of how predictive language processing relies on executive resources and may have implications for interventions in conditions where these resources are compromised, such as following a stroke.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>language</kwd><kwd>prediction</kwd><kwd>executive resources</kwd><kwd>ageing</kwd><kwd>cognitive load</kwd><kwd>reading</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/018mejw64</institution-id><institution>DFG</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OB 352/2-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Obleser</surname><given-names>Jonas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/018mejw64</institution-id><institution>DFG</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HA 6314/4-2; Research Unit 5429/1 (467143400): HA 6314/10-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hartwigsen</surname><given-names>Gesa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0472cxd90</institution-id><institution>ERC</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-2021-COG 101043747</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hartwigsen</surname><given-names>Gesa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Analyses of self-paced reading times reveal that linguistic prediction deteriorates under limited executive resources, with this resource sensitivity becoming markedly more pronounced with advancing age.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>We constantly rely on our ability to swiftly yet accurately process linguistic input. When reading a book, watching television, or navigating a car through busy traffic while following instructions, language prediction is considered a catalyst that enhances the efficiency of linguistic processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clark, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pickering and Garrod, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Onnis et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rao and Ballard, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Ryskin and Nieuwland, 2023</xref>). However, due to the inherent flexibility and richness of natural language, upcoming words can rarely be predicted from context with complete certainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Rubenstein and Aborn, 1958</xref>). Instead, linguistic features are thought to be pre-activated broadly rather than following an all-or-nothing principle, as there is evidence for predictive processing even for moderately or low-restraint contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boston et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Roland et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Schmitt et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Smith and Levy, 2013</xref>). This generation of graded predictions is sometimes described as being passive and cost-free (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Luke and Christianson, 2016</xref>). However, it is still under debate whether maintaining such an elaborate process really incurs no cognitive cost.</p><p>Graded language predictions necessitate the active generation of hypotheses on upcoming words as well as the integration of prediction errors to inform future predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clark, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Ryskin and Nieuwland, 2023</xref>). Supporting this, recent evidence suggests that language predictions may indeed impose processing demands. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Shain et al., 2024</xref> found that reading time increases with decreasing word predictability, with even small drops in predictability of highly expected words leading to significant processing costs. These findings suggest that language predictions are not entirely automatic or effortless. This aligns with numerous neuroimaging studies arguing for a strong interaction between language-specific and domain-general executive brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Geranmayeh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Martin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Sliwinska et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Wingfield and Grossman, 2006</xref>), particularly in situations that are cognitively demanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Erb et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Vaden et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Vaden et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Vaden et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Peelle, 2018</xref>).</p><p>In this context, domain-general executive resources refer to higher-level cognitive control processes, such as working memory, inhibitory control, and cognitive flexibility, that are crucial for managing and coordinating behaviour across a wide range of tasks and modalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvarez and Emory, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Duncan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Friedman and Miyake, 2017</xref>). These processes are supported by the multiple-demand system, a fronto-parietal network that is recruited in various cognitively challenging situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Duncan, 2010</xref>). However, while numerous studies support the claim that language prediction relies on such domain-general executive resources, a body of research suggests the opposite (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Ryskin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Shain et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Wehbe et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Diachek et al., 2020</xref>). This raises the unresolved question to what extent such resources are taxed by predictive processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Ryskin and Nieuwland, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">MacGregor et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Shain et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Xie et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>An interesting test case for the dynamic interplay between language-specific and domain-general systems is cognitive ageing, as advancing age has been shown to be associated with sensory and executive decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Idowu and Szameitat, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Salthouse et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Verhaeghen et al., 2003</xref>). In the current study, we thus ask: How does language prediction change when executive resources are limited – both intrinsically due to advanced age, and extrinsically through increased task demands?</p><p>The age-related change in cognitive resources is reflected by longer linguistic processing times, especially in situations with high cognitive effort, such as dual-task processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Smiler et al., 2003</xref>). However, previous research presents conflicting results on how cognitive ageing affects the use of linguistic predictions during language comprehension. Behavioural studies suggest a decline in using context to make semantic predictions with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Häuser et al., 2019</xref>) while EEG studies present a more nuanced picture. Some studies indicate heightened neural sensitivity to unexpected information in older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cheimariou et al., 2019</xref>), while others report no significant age-related differences in neural response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dave et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Payne and Federmeier, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, it is unclear how the use of language predictions across the adult lifespan might be affected by increasing cognitive demands. According to the <italic>Compensation-Related Utilisation of Neural Circuits Hypothesis</italic> (CRUNCH; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Reuter-Lorenz and Cappell, 2008</xref>), older adults might earlier reach a point where their cognitive load capacity is fully exhausted than young adults, leading to a performance decline. If language prediction draws on executive resources, its effect on reading time might thus diminish with increasing cognitive load due to shared cognitive resources. However, this effect might re-emerge once capacity limits are reached, causing tasks to be processed sequentially, which would result in an increased effect of language prediction paralleled by slower performance.</p><p>Here, we explored the role of executive control in language prediction in two large cohorts across the adult lifespan. Using a novel dual-task paradigm that couples natural reading with an <italic>n</italic>-back task that taxes executive resources, we tested the following hypotheses: First, both increased cognitive load and reduced word predictability (i.e., increased surprisal) should be reflected by longer reading time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a, b</xref>), alongside a decrease in text comprehension and <italic>n</italic>-back task performance. Second, we expected that the formation of language predictions should be contingent upon the availability of executive resources. Most importantly, a gradual limitation of these resources due to increased task demands should result in diminished effects of language predictability on reading time (interaction between cognitive load and surprisal; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Visualisation of hypotheses.</title><p>We expected main effects on reading time of (<bold>a</bold>) cognitive load and (<bold>b</bold>) surprisal, as well as (<bold>c</bold>) an interaction of surprisal and cognitive load. Additionally, (<bold>d</bold>) we explored how these effects are modulated by age.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-108176-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Lastly, we explored how these previously described effects would be modulated by age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Note that the literature allows for contradicting hypotheses: On the one hand, if language predictions are impaired under limited executive resources, older individuals should rely less on language predictions due to overall decreased executive resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Idowu and Szameitat, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Salthouse et al., 2003</xref>). This should be reflected by diminished predictability effects. On the other hand, given the presumed stability of language comprehension across the lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Shafto and Tyler, 2014</xref>), older adults might instead rely more heavily on language predictions, thus fully compensating for any impairments in reading comprehension caused by sensory and executive decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Idowu and Szameitat, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Salthouse et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Verhaeghen et al., 2003</xref>). In this case, we should see strong surprisal effects independent of age, or even stronger surprisal effects in older than younger adults.</p><p>The two large-sample reading-time studies presented here help resolve the ongoing discussion on the role of executive resources in language predictions with three key findings: First, across our large age range, we found a general increase in reading time with both low language predictability and high task demands. Second, higher task demands reduce the influence of language predictability on reading time, indicating that linguistic prediction relies on executive control resources. Third, predictability had a more pronounced effect on reading time in older adults compared to younger ones. These findings highlight the dynamic interaction between language predictability and executive resources.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We report data from 175 participants (<italic>M</italic> = 44.9 ± 17.9, 18–85 years, 51% female) who were either tested online (<italic>N</italic><sub>online</sub> = 80) or in the laboratory (<italic>N</italic><sub>laboratory</sub> = 95) in one session.

As such, it reflects the post-stimulus integration of predictions. In an additional control analysis, we considered entropy, which reflects the uncertainty (and thus the inverse precision) of pre-stimulus predictions, or – put simply – the expected surprisal of an upcoming word (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pimentel et al., 2022</xref>). To examine whether limitations in executive resources constrain prediction generation before word onset or prediction integration after word onset, we modelled the effects of entropy on reading times, using the same approach as for modelling the effect of surprisal. Analogous to the effects of surprisal, we expected reading time to increase with higher entropy and anticipated that increased cognitive load would attenuate the effect of entropy on reading time.</p><p>Contrary to our hypothesis, results indicated that in the Reading Only condition, with minimal cognitive load, participants benefitted from higher entropy, as reflected by shorter reading times. As the reading materials were designed to be as easy to understand as possible, entropy was overall very low, ranging from 0.708 to 6.763 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bentz and Alikaniotis, 2016</xref> for an overview of entropy in natural texts in different languages). The observed facilitated processing for segments with slightly increased entropy is thus consistent with previous findings that entropy can have facilitating effects on language comprehension due to pre-activation of semantic features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Karimi et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, as cognitive load increased, this effect reversed: participants showed longer reading times when entropy was high (<italic>β</italic><sub>1-back</sub> = −0.0066, <italic>t</italic><sub>1-back</sub>(287,500.04) = 5.214, <italic>p</italic><sub>1-back</sub> &lt; 0.001, <italic>β</italic><sub>2-back</sub> = 0.0065, <italic>t</italic><sub>2-back</sub>(287,757.94) = 5.026, <italic>p</italic><sub>2-back</sub> &lt; 0.001), which is in line with our hypotheses. While we found this pattern – beneficial effect of entropy under minimal cognitive load and detrimental effect under increased cognitive load – in our younger participants, older participants showed a detrimental effect of increased entropy across conditions.

This corresponds to approximately 22.91% of the average per-word reading time in the BL condition (<italic>M</italic> = 522.04 ± 275.927 ms), highlighting a substantial effect of surprisal – especially considering that all other predictors were held constant when estimating the effect of surprisal. The substantial effect of surprisal is particularly notable given that the texts were edited for ease of comprehension and contained relatively low surprisal values overall (<italic>M</italic> = 18.165 ± 7.523), indicating that the observed reading time differences between high- and low-surprisal words likely underestimate the potential effect size in more complex texts with higher surprisal variability.</p><p>Notably, in everyday life, we typically encounter sequences of words, ranging from short phrases to texts of hundreds or thousands of words. Consequently, small word-level effects can accumulate and yield substantial processing differences over time (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Funder and Ozer, 2019</xref>). Thus, to quantify this cumulative effect of surprisal, we predicted reading time for two average participants aged 27 (<italic>M</italic> − 1 SD) and 63 (<italic>M</italic> + 1 SD) years for a short example sentence.

But do they really come ‘for free’, or how much do they draw on executive resources? With the present study, we asked how language predictions change with increasing cognitive load, and how this interaction is modulated by age. To do so, we paired a self-paced reading task with a secondary <italic>n</italic>-back task on the font colour of the words.</p><p>First, as expected, and validating our overall approach, high cognitive load was associated with an increase in reading time as well as a decrease in task performance across age groups. This is consistent with previous studies using <italic>n</italic>-back tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lamichhane et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kwong See and Ryan, 1995</xref>).</p><p>Next, as hypothesised, higher word surprisal slowed down reading, even when controlling for word length and frequency as well as prediction entropy. This effect of surprisal replicates findings from previous studies showing that highly unpredictable words are generally associated with a longer reading time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Schmitt et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Smith and Levy, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Heilbron et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Monsalve et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Shain et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Wilcox et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we explored the relationship between surprisal and cognitive load across the (cross-sectional) adult lifespan. We hypothesised that increasing cognitive load should gradually impair the building of language predictions, which should surface in a diminished surprisal effect on reading time in conditions with high cognitive load. In line with our hypothesis, we found that the effect of word surprisal on reading time was modulated by cognitive load. Specifically, when cognitive load was high, the effect of surprisal on reading time was significantly diminished.</p><p>Interestingly, this interaction between surprisal and cognitive load was modulated by age. While age generally increased the reliance on language prediction, it also increased the susceptibility of this strategy to changes in available executive resources: Older adults showed the strongest relative reduction of the surprisal effect with increasing cognitive load. However, under high load, older adults still showed the strongest surprisal effect in absolute terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). In a direct replication of the original experiment, we reproduced this finding, further confirming the reliability of our results.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Disentangling effects of attention versus executive resources</title><p>When investigating the interaction of cognitive load and language predictability on reading time, we found that increased cognitive load diminished the effect of word predictability. We take this as evidence that executive resources are involved in the generation of language predictions.</p><p>Predictive processing has not only been suggested to be foundational to language comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Ryskin and Nieuwland, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Schmitt et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Heilbron et al., 2022</xref>), but it is also thought to be a core mechanism of the human brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rao and Ballard, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bubic et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Friston, 2010</xref>). Drawing parallels between domains can thus offer valuable insights into the mechanisms of language prediction: For instance, there is evidence from the visual domain showing that attending to the stimulus material is a prerequisite for predictive processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Larsson and Smith, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Richter and de Lange, 2019</xref>). This observation from the visual domain can potentially be extended to our findings, wherein language predictions were diminished if attention had to be divided between the reading material and a challenging non-linguistic secondary task.</p><p>However, attention alone cannot fully account for the differences in sensitivity to word predictability shown here. The predictability effect did not only diminish when a secondary task was introduced but also decreased with increasing cognitive load even when attentional switching costs were held constant between conditions (i.e., when comparing the 1-back to 2-back load conditions). In line with previous literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Huettig and Janse, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ito et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fricke and Zirnstein, 2022</xref>), our results thus suggest that executive processes beyond attention, such as updating and maintenance of context information, shifting between tasks, and inhibition of irrelevant information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvarez and Emory, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Duncan, 2010</xref>), are integral to language prediction.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Language prediction as a compensatory mechanism in older age</title><p>Further examining the effect of language predictability across the adult lifespan revealed interesting age differences. Namely, older adults showed stronger language predictability effects than younger participants. This effect held true even when controlling for potential differences in verbal intelligence and education between participants. Our result aligns with previous work on age-related changes in linguistic predictions, indicating heightened sensitivity to unexpected lexical input in older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cheimariou et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>This finding may reflect a commonly reported pattern of greater reliance on intact vocabulary and world knowledge with age in the face of declining executive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Martin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Salthouse et al., 2003</xref>). Here, we show that even under increased cognitive load, older adults still rely heavily on their refined system of linguistic predictions driven by their lifelong experience. This allows them to make more fine-tuned predictions but also renders them more vulnerable to unexpected information (i.e., high-surprisal words) than their younger counterparts.</p><p>Previous studies have found a larger vocabulary size associated with more rapid processing of language and improved language comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Borovsky et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Huettig and Pickering, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mainz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Matthews, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Stæhr, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Stæhr, 2008</xref>). In line with this, older adults exhibit more advanced language processing abilities compared to children or younger adults due to their accumulated years of exposure to language and their increased vocabulary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brysbaert et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ito and Sakai, 2021</xref>). This accumulated skill is thought to serve as a compensatory mechanism for decline in working memory capacities or reduced executive functioning with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bunzeck et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Reuter-Lorenz et al., 2021</xref>). Indeed, speech comprehension appears to remain largely intact in older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Shafto and Tyler, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Burke and Mackay, 1997</xref>).</p><p>As a caveat, one should not disregard the possibility of age-related differences between younger and older adults in utilising formed predictions. While we assumed that formed predictions are utilised automatically, and that the observed differences in the effect of language predictability on reading time between individuals might thus be attributable to a difference in executive resources, one could also argue that individuals might simply weigh their formed predictions differently.</p><p>Akin to the longer exposure to language in older individuals, it is reasonable to assume that older individuals have also had more time to accumulate experience regarding the accuracy of their predictions and to refine their predictions through prediction errors. Consequently, older adults might rely more heavily on their predictions than younger adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Moran et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, due to age-related sensory decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Verhaeghen et al., 2003</xref>), older adults might exhibit a stronger dependence on context-based predictions to process language, as incoming sensory information might be less informative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rogers, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Wingfield et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Wolpe et al., 2016</xref>). A stronger reliance on language predictions could thus serve as a compensatory mechanism to facilitate language comprehension despite sensory decline in older adults.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>How can limited executive resources affect language prediction?</title><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the relationship between word predictability and age depends on cognitive load. Under low load, predictability effects on reading time increased with age; older adults showed robust effects, while younger adults showed none. Under intermediate load (1-back), this pattern reversed, with younger adults showing stronger predictability effects than older adults.</p><p>This reversal begs for an explanation, and we deem it most likely to reflect differences in how executive resources are deployed. In low-load settings, young adults may process both predictable and unpredictable words efficiently, minimising observable surprisal effects. The absence of a predictability effect in this group should therefore not be taken as evidence against predictive processing. Rather, it may indicate that prediction is less necessary when processing is fast and flexible. Under intermediate load, executive resources are partially taxed, revealing underlying prediction processes in young adults. At higher loads, predictability effects diminish again, suggesting resource constraints impair predictive processing.</p><p>In older adults, however, predictability effects decline already at intermediate load, consistent with the CRUNCH model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Reuter-Lorenz and Cappell, 2008</xref>), which posits that cognitive capacity limits are reached earlier in ageing. At this point, resources are insufficient to maintain predictive processing while also performing the secondary task. Behaviourally, this may result in fluctuating performance or trial-wise switching between the two tasks. As load increases further, older adults continue to show reduced, though still measurable, predictability effects – indicating sustained but strained processing.</p><p>Taken together, the data suggest that both age groups experience a reduction in predictive processing when executive resources are limited, but the ‘crunch point’ is reached earlier in older adults.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Limitations and future directions</title><p>One intriguing question that remains is how <italic>n</italic>-back performance and language surprisal interrelate. It is plausible that when texts are highly predictable (i.e., when surprisal is very low on average), the cognitive load associated with language processing is reduced. This reduction could free up domain-general executive resources, thereby enhancing <italic>n</italic>-back performance. Conversely, when surprisal is high, the increased demands of processing less predictable language may compromise working memory updating and lead to poorer <italic>n</italic>-back performance. As we assessed <italic>n</italic>-back performance at block-level and maintained equal predictability across texts, analysing trial-level effects of surprisal on <italic>n</italic>-back task performance was not possible. Future studies could address this limitation by systematically examining the relationship between surprisal and <italic>n</italic>-back performance at a more granular level.</p><p>Another important area for future research involves exploring potential age-related differences in task strategies within dual-task designs. We previously hypothesised that the differing effects of cognitive load on surprisal-driven reading times across age groups may reflect compensatory strategies in older adults. Given declines in executive control and working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Idowu and Szameitat, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Salthouse et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Verhaeghen et al., 2003</xref>), older adults may prioritise language processing over multitasking under high load, whereas younger adults might distribute resources more flexibly. Future studies should thus examine how age affects our response strategies in dual tasks.</p><p>Finally, it is important to note that GPT-2 next-word predictions are not tailored to individual participants. Large language models like GPT-2 are trained on extensive internet corpora (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Radford et al., 2019</xref>). Consequently, this raises the question of whether linguistic content from the internet – and, by extension, GPT-2’s language generation – disproportionately reflects the linguistic patterns of specific demographic or cognitive groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gustilo and Dino, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Haller et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hardy and Friginal, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Tan and Celis, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Venkit et al., 2023</xref>). There is only very limited evidence addressing these questions directly. However, it has been shown that GPT-3.5 – a later-generation model building on the same transformer architecture as GPT-2 – shows performance comparable to children aged 6–15 in a language task requiring recollection and inference abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sicilia et al., 2023</xref>). Additionally, another study shows that predictions generated by a German <italic>GPT-2 Large</italic> model (which we use in our studies as the smaller version, <italic>GPT-2 Small</italic>) align more closely with the language patterns of individuals with low verbal intelligence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Haller et al., 2024</xref>), complementing the findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sicilia et al., 2023</xref>. Despite the limited number of studies in this area, the findings from both studies suggest that the language predictions produced by GPT-2 may reflect certain demographic or cognitive traits, such as a very young age or a low verbal intelligence. As a result, language predictions generated by GPT-2 may not be equally representative across different groups, which must be considered when interpreting between-group effects in studies that rely on GPT-2-generated stimuli. In our study, this potential bias is unlikely to affect the results. We did not compare adults with children, and in the lab sample where verbal intelligence was measured (<italic>N</italic> = 90), it was only mildly correlated with age (<italic>ρ</italic> = 0.279, <italic>p</italic> = 0.007). Including verbal intelligence in our models did not improve model fits, and all main effects and interactions of age, cognitive load, and surprisal remained robust. Nevertheless, developing methods to generate individualised next-word predictions is an interesting direction for future research.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, the present study contributes to resolving the debate about the cognitive cost of predictive language processing.

Second, we find that higher task demands diminish the effects of language predictability on reading time, replicably demonstrating that language prediction draws on resources of executive control. Third, the data reveal age-related differences in the use of linguistic predictions: High predictability had more leverage on reading efficiency in older than in younger adults but was also more sensitive to available executive resources.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>We recorded data from 178 participants, who were either tested online (<italic>N</italic> = 83) or in a controlled lab environment (<italic>N</italic> = 95).

This is usually the case if the previous context is very restricting. Conversely, if a vast amount of words in the vocabulary would be suited as continuations for the given context, and the probability distribution across words is fairly uniform, word entropy – and thus uncertainty about which word will come next – is high. Taken together, word surprisal signifies the predictability of each word whereas word entropy signifies the uncertainty underlying its prediction.</p><p>In the current study, we computed surprisal scores as well as one entropy score for each word in the experimental texts (mean surprisal: 18.165 ± 7.523, mean entropy: 4.067 ± 0.932; see further information in the <italic>Appendix</italic>).</p><p>Entropy and surprisal scores were estimated using a two-word context window. While short contexts have been shown to enhance GPT-2’s psychometric alignment with human predictions, making next-word predictions more human-like (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kuribayashi et al., 2022</xref>), other work suggests that longer contexts can also increase model–human similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Goldstein et al., 2022</xref>). To reconcile these findings in our stimuli and guide the choice of context length, we tested longer windows and found surprisal scores were highly correlated with the 2-word context (e.g., 10-word vs. 2-word context: Spearman’s <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.976), with the overall pattern of results unchanged. Additionally, employing longer context windows would have also reduced the number of analysable trials, since surprisal cannot be computed for the first <italic>k</italic> words of a text with a <italic>k</italic>-word context window. Crucially, any additional noise introduced by the short context biases effect estimates towards zero, making our analyses conservative rather than inflating them.</p><p>To generate word entropy and surprisal scores, we used a 12-layered GPT-2 model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Radford et al., 2019</xref>), which was pre-trained on German texts by the MDZ Digital Library team (dbmdz) at the Bavarian State Library, and the corresponding tokeniser, both available from the Hugging Face model hub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Schweter, 2021</xref>).

This measure quantifies the ability to distinguish between target and non-target stimuli, in our case trials (i.e., words in dual- and rectangles in single-task blocks) with colour repetitions and trials where the current colour does not match the colour from the nth previous trial. A <italic>d</italic>' value of 0 signifies an inability to discriminate between signal and noise stimuli, suggesting that participants indicated they saw a target in either no or all trials. Thus, we excluded all dual-task blocks with <italic>d</italic>-primes of 0 from further analyses, which affected only five participants. In total, we excluded three main blocks in the online sample and two main blocks in the lab sample.</p><p>After each text block, participants were asked to answer three multiple-choice questions as a measure of reading comprehension. For each question, we showed four response options, with only one of them being correct. To ensure participants performed the tasks as intended and read the words on screen, we excluded all blocks where none of the questions were answered correctly. In total, we excluded one 1-back and seven 2-back Dual Task blocks from the online sample, as well as four 1-back and eleven 2-back Dual Task blocks from the lab sample, from datasets of 6 and 14 participants, respectively.</p><p>Lastly, we preprocessed the reading time data: First, any trial exhibiting a raw reading time exceeding 5000 ms was considered an extended break and subsequently excluded from further analyses. This cutoff was selected arbitrarily, based on the observation that participants tested in the lab did not exhibit trial durations exceeding 5000 ms. Therefore, we assume that participants tested online may have been distracted and less focused on the experiment during trial durations of this length.</p><p>To further remove outliers, we followed the procedure recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berger and Kiefer, 2021</xref> to ensure comparable exclusion criteria for long and short outliers in typically skewed reading time: First, reading times were transformed using the <italic>Proportion of Maximum Scaling</italic> method (POMS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Little, 2013</xref>). We POMS-transformed the data on block level to account for potential differences in reading time distributions between blocks.

We employed a linear mixed-effects model (LMM) for d-primes and a logistic linear mixed-effects model (GLMM, logit link function) for comprehension question accuracy.</p><p>In both models, we included recording location (online vs. lab), cognitive load (1-back and 2-back Dual Task vs. Reading Only as the reference level) and continuously measured age (centred) in both models as well as the interaction of age and cognitive load as fixed effects. In the model for the d-primes, we additionally included measures of comprehension question accuracy (on participant and block level) as well as the block number as fixed effects to control for different response strategies and tiredness effects, respectively. Moreover, we included the mean d-primes from the 1-back and 2-back Single Tasks as a working memory measure.</p><p>Please note that we did not control for trial-level stimulus colour here.

The model included an interaction of age, surprisal, and cognitive load motivated by our hypotheses as well as additional fixed effects to control for nuisance effects. The final selection of fixed and random effects structure was based on highest <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> values. As we only modelled reading times from trials where we had surprisal scores, the first two trials of each block were not included in the statistical analyses.</p><p>We included the reading time of the previous word as a fixed effect to control for potential nuisance effects such as post-error slowing following a missed <italic>n</italic>-back target in the previous trial, or sequential modulation effects if the previous trial was ended prematurely, leading to an extended reading time carried over to the current trial. Additionally, it is important to consider that reading times, like many sequential behavioural measures, exhibit strong autocorrelation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Schuckart et al., 2025</xref>), meaning that the reading time of a given word is partially predictable from the reading time of the previous word. Such spillover effects can confound attempts to isolate trial-specific cognitive processes. As our primary goal was to model single-word prediction, we explicitly accounted for this autocorrelation by including the reading time of the preceding trial as a covariate.</p><p>As response strategies may differ between individuals, but also within an individual from block to block, we included two different regressors representing these distinct between- vs. within-participant effects on reading time. Between-participant effects were modelled by the individual mean comprehension performance whereas within-participant effects were modelled by the block-level deviation from this mean (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Tune et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bell et al., 2019</xref>). We further included block-wise d-primes and participant-wise mean single-task <italic>d</italic>-primes as a proxy of each participant’s working memory capacity. By incorporating block- and participant-level performance measures, which are designed to be sensitive to task difficulty, we accounted for the potential variation in perceived task load between age groups or samples. For instance, the 2-back task might present a greater challenge for an older individual compared to their younger counterpart, therefore rendering the tasks not entirely comparable between age groups if not appropriately controlled for.</p><p>The remaining fixed effects entailed the recording location (online vs. lab), word frequency (as estimated using Python’s wordfreq package; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Speer et al., 2018</xref>), word length, as well as the position of block and trial in the course of the experiment as main effects. Furthermore, we included entropy as a fixed effect to account for the uncertainty in the prediction of the next word. Surprisal and entropy values were weakly correlated (<italic>r</italic> = 0.29, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). To account for the delay in reaction time associated with <italic>n</italic>-back responses, we included <italic>n</italic>-back reaction (reaction vs. no reaction) as a binary predictor in our models.</p><p>Finally, we included the three-way interaction of age (as a continuous predictor), cognitive load (on three levels: Reading Only, 1-back Dual Task, and 2-back Dual Task; contrasted using a simple coding scheme with the Reading Only condition as the reference level), and surprisal score (continuous predictor). This entails the implicit inclusion of all two-way interactions of age, cognitive load, and surprisal, as well as the main effects of those variables.</p><p>Random effects included random intercepts for participants, the effect of text, the current word, the colour of the current word, and by-participant random slopes for cognitive load.

The random effect structure was set up similarly to the LMM.</p><p>It is important to note that the outcomes of GAMs and LMMs can differ: GAMs are particularly adept at identifying localised, non-linear changes in predictor effects on reading time that may be overlooked by LMMs. As a result, the effects obtained from LMMs and those derived from GAMs are based on distinct metrics, which complicates direct comparisons between the two approaches.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-7"><title>Control analysis: Disentangling the effect of cognitive load on pre- and post-stimulus predictive processing</title><p>Predictive processing can be conceptualised in terms of two complementary information-theoretic constructs: surprisal and entropy. While surprisal captures the cognitive cost associated with the post-stimulus integration of a generated prediction and the actual percept, entropy reflects the uncertainty underlying a next-word prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Smith and Levy, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hale, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Levy, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pimentel et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Shannon, 1948</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Slaats and Martin, 2023</xref>). As such, entropy mirrors the estimated surprisal, suggesting entropy and surprisal are somewhat related, but do not represent the same construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pimentel et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>While the primary focus of the present study is on predictive processing as indexed by word surprisal, it is also possible to partially dissociate pre- and post-stimulus predictive mechanisms by examining entropy. The empirical literature on the effect of entropy on reading time is scarce and somewhat contradictory, with evidence for both facilitative and inhibitory effects, or even no effects of next-word entropy over and above surprisal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pimentel et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Karimi et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Schijndel and Schuler, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aurnhammer and Frank, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Roark et al., 2009</xref>). Accordingly, we sought to investigate the effect of increased entropy in our dataset, asking whether higher entropy is associated with longer reading times, and whether this relationship is modulated by cognitive load, analogous to the effects observed for surprisal.</p><p>To this end, we fitted a linear mixed-effects model structurally analogous to that used for surprisal, substituting surprisal with entropy. Consistent with our approach for surprisal, we also included a three-way interaction of entropy with age and cognitive load to capture potential age-related changes in the relationship between entropy and cognitive load.</p><p><code>log(RT)~RT of previous word +

This internal replication was preregistered on OSF (doi: 10.17605/OSF.IO/SU6VX).</p><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>Replication sample</title><p>As outlined in the preregistration, we conducted an online study with a sample of 100 participants. We excluded data from four participants from further analysis, either due to technical issues (<italic>N</italic> = 2) or because they reported having been distracted during the task (<italic>N</italic> = 2). The resulting final sample comprised 96 participants aged 18–70 years (<italic>M</italic> = 39.750 ± 13.996 years) with a balanced gender distribution of 51% female, 48% male, and 1% non-binary identifying participants. As in the original experiment, all participants were native German speakers with normal or corrected-to-normal vision and intact colour vision without dyslexia, illiteracy, a history of psychiatric or neurological disorders or drug abuse. Individuals who had consumed drugs or alcohol immediately prior to the study were not eligible for participation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-2"><title>Replication analyses</title><p>Analogous to the original experiment, we first cleaned the reading time data of trials exceeding a duration of 5000 ms as well as outliers (see section <italic>Preprocessing</italic>), which affected 4.036% of all trials from the main blocks with an average of 72.656 ± 11.089 excluded trials per participant. The structure of the statistical model for the replication analysis was analogous to the model for the original analysis of reading times (see section <italic>Statistical analysis of reading times</italic>), except for the predictor of recording location, which was excluded as we only analysed data collected online. In addition, we modelled the two-way interaction between cognitive load and surprisal rather than the higher-order three-way interaction with age. This more parsimonious model structure was chosen to ensure adequate statistical power and to yield stable, interpretable estimates given the available sample sizes.</p><p>To compare results from the original experiment and the replication, we fitted the model once using the data of the online sample from the original experiment and once using the new online replication datasets.</p><p>Given that we simplified the analysis approach in the original study after having preregistered the replication, we deviated from the analysis plan described in the preregistration and made the same modifications here, resulting in the use of word surprisal for only one context length instead of four and, consequently, only one LMM instead of several.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Reviewing editor, eLife</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing, shared first authorship with Sandra Martin</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing, shared first authorship with Merle Schuckart</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing, shared last authorship with Jonas Obleser</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – review and editing, shared last authorship with Gesa Hartwigsen</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the local ethics committees of the University of Lübeck and Leipzig University, respectively.

Due to the predominantly younger demographic on <italic>Prolific</italic>, the online samples comprised mainly younger and middle-aged participants, whereas the lab sample spanned a broader age range (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s9"><title>Study design</title><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s9-1"><title>Text stimuli</title><p>During the experiment, participants were asked to read short newspaper articles on emotionally neutral topics such as literature, history, geography, and biology. All texts were edited to be easy to understand without excessive simplification. By doing so, we aimed to keep the cognitive load in the reading task as low as possible, while still maintaining a balance between text clarity and the avoidance of consistently high word predictability.</p><p>All texts had a Wiener Sachtextformel (WSTF4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bamberger and Lesen, 1984</xref>) score below or equal to 10, which corresponds to a reading level suitable for students below 10th grade (mean WSTF4 score: 7.9 ± 0.623). As the WSTF4 only measures the syntactic complexity of a text, participants rated the subjective text difficulty as well as their subjective interest for two of the texts presented to them. All texts used in this study yielded a mean difficulty rating of 21.983 ± 2.799 (on a scale from 0 to 100, with 100 being ‘extremely difficult’) and a mean interest rating of 70.684 ± 5.657 (on a scale from 0 to 100, with 100 being ‘extremely interesting’), confirming that the texts used in this study were both easy to understand and interesting to read.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s10"><title>Structure of the experiment</title><p>At the outset of the experiment, participants were first presented with a training block of the Reading Only condition to familiarise themselves with the task. This was followed by the first main block of the Reading Only task (300 trials). After this, in a short training block (20 trials, repeating it was optional) followed by a longer main block (60 trials in the online experiment, 90 trials in the lab experiment), the participant was introduced to either the 1-back or the 2-back task as a non-linguistic single task comprising coloured rectangles as stimuli. Which <italic>n</italic>-back task was introduced first was randomised. This was then followed by the first dual-task block (300 trials) where the previously practised <italic>n</italic>-back task was performed together with the reading task. After having completed the first dual-task block in one of the two <italic>n</italic>-back conditions, the participant was then introduced to the other <italic>n</italic>-back task in the same fashion as before. Having performed each of the conditions once, the participant was subsequently presented with three main blocks of each of the three conditions in random order (300 trials each). After each block comprising a reading task, participants were asked to answer three multiple-choice comprehension questions on the content of the text.</p><table-wrap id="app1table1"

To investigate this, they employed a dual-task paradigm where participants read texts word-by-word while simultaneously performing a secondary task (an n-back task on font color) designed to manipulate cognitive load. The study examines how this external cognitive load, along with the effects of aging, modulates the impact of word predictability (measured by surprisal and entropy) on reading times. The central finding is that increased cognitive load diminishes the effects of word predictability, supporting the conclusion that language prediction is a resource-dependent process.</p><p>A major strength of the revised manuscript is its comprehensive and parallel analysis of both word surprisal and entropy. The initial submission focused almost exclusively on surprisal, which primarily reflects the cost of integrating a word into its context after it has been perceived. The new analysis now thoroughly investigates entropy as well, which reflects the uncertainty and cognitive effort involved in predicting the next word before it appears. This addition provides a much more complete and theoretically nuanced picture, allowing the authors to address how cognitive load affects both predictive and integrative stages of language processing. This is a significant improvement and substantially increases the paper's contribution to the field.</p><p>Furthermore, the authors have commendably addressed the initial concerns regarding the robustness of their replication findings. The first version of the manuscript presented replication results that were inconsistent, particularly for key interaction effects. In the revision, the authors have adopted a more focused and appropriately powered modeling approach for the replication analysis. This revised analysis now demonstrates a consistent effect of cognitive load on the processing of predictable words across both the original and replication datasets. This strengthens the evidence for the paper's primary claim.</p><p>The initial review also raised concerns that the results could be explained by general cognitive factors, such as task-switching costs, rather than the specific demands on the language prediction system. While the complexity of cognitive load in a dual-task paradigm remains a challenge, the authors have provided sufficient justification in their revisions and rebuttal to support their interpretation that the observed effects are genuinely tied to the process of language prediction.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.108176.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper considers the effects of cognitive load (using an n-back task related to font color), predictability, and age on reading times in two experiments. There were main effects of all predictors, but more interesting effects of load and age on predictability. The effect of load is very interesting, but the manipulation of age is problematic, because we don't know what is predictable for different participants (in relation to their age). There are some theoretical concerns about prediction and predictability, and a need to address literature (reading time, visual world, ERP studies).</p><p>There is a major concern about the effects of age. See the results (155-190): this depends what is meant by word predictability. It's correct if it means the predictability in the corpus. But it may or may not be correct if it refers to how predictable a word is to an individual participant. The texts are unlikely to be equally predictable to different participants, and in particular to younger vs. older participants, because of their different experience. To put it informally, the newspaper articles may be more geared to the expectations of younger people. But there is also another problem: the LLM may have learned on the basis of language that has largely been produced by young people and so its predictions are based on what young people are likely to say. Both of these possibilities strike me as extremely likely. So it may be that older adults are affected more by words that they find surprising, but it is also possible that the texts are not what they expect, or the LLM predictions from the text are not the ones that they would make. In sum, I am not convinced that the authors can say anything about the effects of age unless they can determine what is predictable for different ages of participants. I suspect that this failure to control is an endemic problem in the literature on aging and language processing and needs to be systematically addressed.</p><p>Overall, I think the paper makes enough of a contribution with respect to load to be useful to the literature. But for discussion of age, we would need something like evidence of how younger and older adults would complete these texts (on a word-by-word basis) and that they were equally predictable for different ages. I assume there are ways to get LLMs to emulate different participant groups, but I doubt if we could be confident about their accuracy without a lot of testing. But without something like this, I think making claims about age would be quite misleading.</p><p>The authors respond to my summary comment by saying that prediction is individual and that they account for age-related effects in their models. But these aren't my concerns. Rather:</p><p>(1) The texts (these edited newspaper articles) could be more predictable for younger than older adults. If so, effects with older adults could simply be because people are less likely to predict less than more predictable words.</p><p>(2) The GPT-2 generated surprisal scores may correspond more closely to younger than older adult responses -- that is, its next word predictions may be more younger- than older-adult-like.</p><p>In my view, the authors have two choices: they could remove the discussion of age-related effects, or they could try to address BOTH (1) and (2).</p><p>As an aside, consider what we would conclude if we drew similar conclusions from a study in which children and adults read the same (children's) texts, but we didn't test what was predictable to each of them separately.</p><p>The paper is really strong in other respects and if my concern is not addressed, the conclusions about age might be generally accepted.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.108176.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Schuckart</surname><given-names>Merle Marie</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Lübeck</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lübeck</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Martin</surname><given-names>Sandra</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Leipzig</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Tune</surname><given-names>Sarah</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Lübeck</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lübeck</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Schmitt</surname><given-names>Lea-Maria</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Radboud University Nijmegen</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Nijmegen</named-content></addr-line><country>Netherlands</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hartwigsen</surname><given-names>Gesa</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Leipzig</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Obleser</surname><given-names>Jonas</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Lübeck</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lübeck</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>This manuscript reports a dual-task experiment intended to test whether language prediction relies on executive resources, using surprisal-based measures of predictability and an n-back task to manipulate cognitive load. While the study addresses a question under debate, the current design and modelling framework fall short of supporting the central claims. Key components of cognitive load, such as task switching, word prediction vs integration, are not adequately modeled. Moreover, the weak consistency in replication undermines the robustness of the reported findings. Below unpacks each point.</p><p>Cognitive load is a broad term. In the present study, it can be at least decomposed into the following components:</p><p>(1) Working memory (WM) load: news, color, and rank.</p><p>(2) Task switching load: domain of attention (color vs semantics), sensorimotor rules (c/m vs space).</p><p>(3) Word comprehension load (hypothesized against): prediction, integration.</p><p>The components of task switching load should be directly included in the statistical models. Switching of sensorimotor rules may be captured by the &quot;n-back reaction&quot; (binary) predictor. However, the switching of attended domains and the interaction between domain switching and rule complexity (1-back or 2-back) were not included. The attention control experiment (1) avoided useful statistical variation from the Read Only task, and (2) did not address interactions. More fundamentally, task-switching components should be directly modeled in both performance and full RT models to minimize selection bias. This principle also applies to other confounding factors, such as education level. While missing these important predictors, the current models have an abundance of predictors that are not so well motivated (see later comments). In sum, with the current models, one cannot determine whether the reduced performance or prolonged RT was due to affecting word prediction load (if it exists) or merely affecting the task switching load.</p><p>The entropy and surprisal need to be more clearly interpreted and modeled in the context of the word comprehension process. The entropy concerns the &quot;prediction&quot; part of the word comprehension (before seeing the next word), whereas surprisal concerns the &quot;integration&quot; part as a posterior. This interpretation is similar to the authors writing in the Introduction that &quot;Graded language predictions necessitate the active generation of hypotheses on upcoming words as well as the integration of prediction errors to inform future predictions [1,5].&quot; However, the Results of this study largely ignored entropy (treating it as a fixed effect) and only focus on surprisal without clear justification.</p><p>In Table S3, with original and replicated model fitting results, the only consistent interaction is surprisal x age x cognitive load [2-back vs. Reading Only]. None of the two-way interactions can be replicated. This is puzzling and undermines the robustness of the main claims of this paper.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary</p><p>This paper considers the effects of cognitive load (using an n-back task related to font color), predictability, and age on reading times in two experiments.

There are some theoretical concerns about prediction and predictability, and a need to address literature (reading time, visual world, ERP studies).</p><p>Strengths/weaknesses</p><p>It is important to be clear that predictability is not the same as prediction. A predictable word is processed faster than an unpredictable word (something that has been known since the 1970/80s), e.g., Rayner, Schwanenfluegel, etc. But this could be due to ease of integration. I think this issue can probably be dealt with by careful writing (see point on line 18 below). To be clear, I do not believe that the effects reported here are due to integration alone (i.e., that nothing happens before the target word), but the evidence for this claim must come from actual demonstrations of prediction.</p><p>The effect of load on the effects of predictability is very interesting (and also, I note that the fairly novel way of assessing load is itself valuable). Assuming that the experiments do measure prediction, it suggests that they are not cost-free, as is sometimes assumed. I think the researchers need to look closely at the visual world literature, most particularly the work of Huettig. (There is an isolated reference to Ito et al., but this is one of a large and highly relevant set of papers.)</p><p>There is a major concern about the effects of age. See the Results (161-5): this depends on what is meant by word predictability. It's correct if it means the predictability in the corpus.

The texts are unlikely to be equally predictable to different participants, and in particular to younger vs. older participants, because of their different experiences.

We have carefully considered each of the points raised and made substantial additions and revisions.</p><p>As a summary, we have directly addressed the concerns raised by the reviewers by incorporating task-switching predictors into the statistical models, paralleling our focus on surprisal with a full analysis and interpretation of entropy, clarifying the robustness (and limitations) of the replicated findings, and addressing potential limitations in our Discussion.</p><p>We believe these revisions substantially strengthen the manuscript and improve the reading flow, while also clarifying the scope of our conclusions. We will not illustrate these changes in more detail:</p><p>(1) Cognitive load and task-switching components.</p><p>We agree that cognitive load is a multifaceted construct, particularly since our secondary task broadly targets executive functioning. In response to Reviewer 1, we therefore examined task-switching demands more closely by adding the interaction term n-back reaction × cognitive load to a model restricted to 1-back and 2-back Dual Task blocks (as there were no n-back reactions in the Reading Only condition). This analysis showed significantly longer reading times in the 2-back than in the 1back condition, both for trials with and without an n-back reaction. Interestingly, the difference between reaction and no-reaction trials was smaller in the 2-back condition (β = -0.132, t(188066.09) = -34.269, p &lt; 0.001), which may simply reflect the general increase in reading time for all trials so that the effect of the button press time decreases in comparison to the 1-back. In that sense, these findings are not unexpected and largely mirror the main effect of cognitive load. Crucially, however, the three-way interaction of cognitive load, age, and surprisal remained robust (β = 0.00004, t(188198.86) = 3.540, p &lt; 0.001), indicating that our effects cannot be explained by differences in taskswitching costs across load conditions. To maintain a streamlined presentation, we opted not to include this supplementary analysis in the manuscript.</p><p>(2) Entropy analyses.</p><p>Reviewer 1 pointed out that our initial manuscript placed more emphasis on surprisal. In the revised manuscript, we now report a full set of entropy analyses in the supplementary material. In brief, these analyses show that participants generally benefit from lower entropy across cognitive load conditions, with one notable exception: young adults in the Reading Only condition, where higher entropy was associated with faster reading times. We have added these results to the manuscript to provide a more complete picture of the prediction versus integration distinction highlighted in the review (see sections “Control Analysis: Disentangling the Effect of Cognitive Load on Pre- and PostStimulus Predictive Processing” in the Methods and “Disentangling the Effect of Cognitive Load on Pre- and Post-Stimulus Predictive Processing“ in the Results).</p><p>(3) Replication consistency.</p><p>Reviewer 1 noted that the results of the replication analysis were somewhat puzzling. We take this point seriously and agree that the original model was likely underpowered to detect the effect of interest. To address this, we excluded the higher-level three-way interaction of age, cognitive load, and surprisal, focusing instead on the primary effect examined in this paper: the modulatory influence of cognitive load on surprisal. Using this approach, we observed highly consistent results between the original online subsample and the online replication sample.</p><p>(4) Potential age bias in GPT-2.</p><p>We thank Reviewer 2 for their thoughtful and constructive feedback and agree that a potential age bias in GPT-2’s next-token predictions warrants caution. We thus added a section in the Discussion explicitly considering this limitation, and explain why it should not affect the implications of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>The d-prime model operates at the block level.

Indeed, there was an error in our initial calculations, which we have now corrected in the manuscript. Importantly, the correction does not meaningfully affect the results for the analysis of d-primes or the conclusions of the study (see line 102).</p><p>“A linear mixed-effects model revealed n-back performance declined with cognitive load (β = -1.636, t(173.13) = -26.120, p &lt; 0.001), with more pronounced effects with advancing age (β = -0.014, t(169.77) = -3.931, p &gt; 0.001; Fig. 3b, Table S1)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Consider spelling out all the &quot;simple coding schemes&quot; explicitly.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this helpful suggestion.

The n-back task, which required participants to judge colours, was administered at the single-trial level, with colours pseudorandomised to prevent any specific colour - or sequence of colours - from occurring more frequently than others. In contrast, comprehension questions were presented at the end of each block, meaning that trial-level stimulus colour was unrelated to accuracy on the block-level comprehension questions. However, we agree that this distinction may not have been entirely clear, and we have now added a brief clarification in the Methods section to address this point (see line 534):</p><p>“Please note that we did not control for trial-level stimulus colour here. The n-back task, which required participants to judge colours, was administered at the single-trial level, with colours pseudorandomised to prevent any specific colour - or sequence of colours - from occurring more frequently than others. In contrast, comprehension questions were presented at the end of each block, meaning that trial-level stimulus colour was unrelated to accuracy on the blocklevel comprehension questions”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Could you explain why comprehension accuracy is not modeled in the same way as d-prime, i.e., with a similar set of predictors?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very good point. After each block, participants answered three comprehension questions that were intentionally designed to be easy: they could all be answered correctly after having read the corresponding text, but not by common knowledge alone. The purpose of these questions was primarily to ensure participants paid attention to the texts and to allow exclusion of participants who failed to understand the material even under minimal cognitive load. As comprehension accuracy was modelled at the block level with 3 questions per block, participants could achieve only discrete scores of 0%, 33.3%, 66.7%, or 100%. Most participants showed uniformly high accuracy across blocks, as expected if the comprehension task fulfilled its purpose. However, this limited variance in performance caused convergence issues when fitting a comprehension-accuracy model at the same level of complexity as the d′ model. To model comprehension accuracy nonetheless, we therefore opted for a reduced model complexity in this analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>RT of previous word: The motivations described in the Methods, such as post-error-slowing and sequential modulation effects, lack supporting evidence. The actual scope of what this variable may account for is unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>We are happy to elaborate further regarding the inclusion of this predictor. Reading times, like many sequential behavioural measures, exhibit strong autocorrelation (Schuckart et al., 2025, doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.08.19.670092">10.1101/2025.08.19.670092)</ext-link>. That is, the reading time of a given word is partially predictable from the reading time of the previous word(s). Such spillover effects can confound attempts to isolate trialspecific cognitive processes. As our primary goal was to model single-word prediction, we explicitly accounted for this autocorrelation by including the log reading time of the preceding trial as a covariate. This approach removes variance attributable to prior behaviour, ensuring that the estimated effects reflect the influence of surprisal and cognitive load on the current word, rather than residual effects of preceding trials. We now added this explanation to the manuscript (see line 553):</p><p>“Additionally, it is important to consider that reading times, like many sequential behavioural measures, exhibit strong autocorrelation (Schuckart et al., 2025), meaning that the reading time of a given word is partially predictable from the reading time of the previous word. Such spillover effects can confound attempts to isolate trial-specific cognitive processes. As our primary goal was to model single-word prediction, we explicitly accounted for this autocorrelation by including the reading time of the preceding trial as a covariate”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Block-level d-prime: It was shown with the d-prime performance model that block-level d-prime is a function of many of the reading-related variables. Therefore, it is not justified to use them here as &quot;a proxy of each participant's working memory capacity.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comment. We would like to clarify that the d-prime performance model indeed included only dual-task d-primes (i.e., d-primes obtained while participants were simultaneously performing the reading task). In contrast, the predictor in question is based on singletask d-primes, which are derived from the n-back task performed in isolation. While dual- and singletask d-primes may be correlated, they capture different sources of variance, justifying the use of single-task d-primes here as a measure of each participant’s working memory capacity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Word frequency is entangled with entropy and surprisal. Suggest removal.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment. While word frequency is correlated with word surprisal, its inclusion does not affect the interpretation of the other predictors and does not introduce any bias. Moreover, it is a theoretically important control variable in reading research. Since we are interested in the effects of surprisal and entropy beyond potential biases through word length and frequency, we believe these are important control variables in our model. Moreover, checks for collinearity confirmed that word frequency was neither strongly correlated with surprisal nor entropy. In this sense, including it is largely pro forma: it neither harms the model nor materially changes the results, but it ensures that the analysis appropriately accounts for a well-established influence on word processing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Entropy reflects the cognitive load of word prediction. It should be investigated in parallel and with similar depth as surprisal (which reflects the load of integration).</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point that warrants further investigation, especially since the previous literature on the effects of entropy on reading time is scarce and somewhat contradictory. We have thus added additional analyses and now report the effects of cognitive load, entropy, and age on reading time (see sections “Disentangling the Effect of Cognitive Load on Pre- and Post-Stimulus Predictive Processing” in the Results, “Control Analysis: Disentangling the Effect of Cognitive Load on Pre- and Post-Stimulus Predictive Processing” in the Methods as well as Fig. S7 and Table S6 in the Supplements for full results). In brief, we observe a significant three-way interaction among age, cognitive load, and entropy. Specifically, while all participants benefit from low entropy under high cognitive load, reflected by shorter reading times, in the baseline condition this benefit is observed only in older adults. Interestingly, in the baseline condition with minimal cognitive load, younger adults even show a benefit from high entropy. Thus, although the overall pattern for entropy partly mirrors that for surprisal – older adults showing increased reading times when word entropy is high and generally greater sensitivity to entropy variations – the effects differ in one important respect. Unlike for surprisal, the detrimental impact of increased word entropy is more pronounced under high cognitive load across all participants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>I agree in relation to prediction/load, but I am concerned (actually very concerned) that prediction needs to be assessed with respect to age. I suspect this is one reason why there is so much inconsistency in the effects of age in prediction and, indeed, comprehension more generally. I think the authors should either deal with it appropriately or drop it from the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this important concern. It is true that prediction is a highly individual, complex process as it depends upon the experiences a person has made with language over their lifespan. As such, one-size-fits-all approaches are not sufficient to model predictive processing. In our study, we thus took particular care to ensure that our analyses captured both age-related and other interindividual variability in predictive processing.</p><p>First, in our statistical models, we included age not only as a nuisance regressor, but also assessed age-related effects in the interplay of surprisal and cognitive load. By doing so, we explicitly model potential age-related differences in how individuals of different ages predict language under different levels of cognitive load.</p><p>Second, we hypothesised that predictive processing might also be influenced by a range of interindividual factors beyond age, including language exposure, cognitive ability, and more transient states such as fatigue. To capture such variability, all models included by-subject random intercepts and slopes, ensuring that unmodelled individual differences were statistically accommodated.</p><p>Together, these steps allow us to account for both systematic age-related differences and residual individual variability in predictive processing. We are therefore confident that our findings are not confounded by unmodelled age-related variability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 18, do not confuse prediction (or pre-activation) with predictability. Predictability effects can be due to integration difficulty. See Pickering and Gambi 2018 for discussion. The discussion then focuses on graded parallel predictions, but there is also a literature concerned with the prediction of one word, typically using the &quot;visual world&quot; paradigm (which is barely cited - Reference 60 is an exception). In the next paragraph, I would recommend discussing the N400 literature (particularly Federmeier). There are a number of reading time studies that investigate whether there is a cost to a disconfirmed prediction - often finding no cost (e.g., Frisson, 2017, JML), though there is some controversy and apparent differences between ERP and eye-tracking studies (e.g., Staub). This literature should be addressed. In general, I appreciate the value of a short introduction, but it does seem too focused on neuroscience rather than the very long tradition of behavioural work on prediction and predictability.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. In the revised manuscript, we have clarified the relevant section of the introduction to avoid confusion between predictability and predictive processing, thereby improving conceptual clarity (see line 16).</p><p>“Instead, linguistic features are thought to be pre-activated broadly rather than following an all-or-nothing principle, as there is evidence for predictive processing even for moderately- or low-restraint contexts (Boston et al., 2008; Roland et al., 2012; Schmitt et al., 2021; Smith &amp; Levy, 2013)”.</p><p>We also appreciate the reviewer’s comment regarding the introduction. While our study is behavioural, we frame it in a neuroscience context because our findings have direct implications for understanding neural mechanisms of predictive processing and cognitive load. We believe that this framing is important for situating our results within the broader literature and highlighting their relevance for future neuroscience research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I don't think 2 two-word context is enough to get good indicators of predictability. Obviously, almost anything can follow &quot;in the&quot;, but the larger context about parrots presumably gives a lot more information. This seems to me to be a serious concern - or am I misinterpreting what was done?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very important point and we thank the reviewer for raising it. Our goal was to generate word surprisal scores that closely approximate human language predictions. In the manuscript, we report analyses using a 2-word context window, following recommendations by Kuribayashi et al. (2022).</p><p>To evaluate the impact of context length, we also tested longer windows of up to 60 words (not reported). While previous work (Goldstein et al., 2022) shows that GPT-2 predictions can become more human-like with longer context windows, we found that in our stimuli – short newspaper articles of only 300 words – surprisal scores from longer contexts were highly correlated with the 2word context, and the overall pattern of results remained unchanged. To illustrate, surprisal scores generated with a 10-word context window and surprisal scores generated with the 2-word context window we used in our analyses correlated with Spearman’s ρ = 0.976.</p><p>Additionally, on a more technical note, using longer context windows reduces the number of analysable trials, since surprisal cannot be computed for the first k words of a text with a k-word context window (e.g., a 50-word context would exclude ~17% of the data).</p><p>Importantly, while a short 2-word context window may introduce additional noise in the surprisal estimates, this would only bias effects toward zero, making our analyses conservative rather than inflating them. Critically, the observed effects remain robust despite this conservative estimate, supporting the validity of our findings.</p><p>However, we agree that this is a particularly important and sensitive point, and have now added a discussion of it to the manuscript (see line 476).</p><p>“Entropy and surprisal scores were estimated using a two-word context window. While short contexts have been shown to enhance GPT-2’s psychometric alignment with human predictions, making next-word predictions more human-like (Kuribayashi et al., 2022), other work suggests that longer contexts can also increase model–human similarity (Goldstein et al., 2022). To reconcile these findings in our stimuli and guide the choice of context length, we tested longer windows and found surprisal scores were highly correlated with the 2-word context (e.g., 10-word vs. 2-word context: Spearman’s ρ = 0.976), with the overall pattern of results unchanged. Additionally, employing longer context windows would have also reduced the number of analysable trials, since surprisal cannot be computed for the first k words of a text with a k-word context window. Crucially, any additional noise introduced by the short context biases effect estimates toward zero, making our analyses conservative rather than inflating them”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 92, task performance, are there interactions?
