Mutations in Aß also cause familial forms of AD (fAD). Here, we use deep mutational scanning to quantify the effects of &gt;14,000 mutations on the aggregation of Aß. The resulting genetic landscape reveals mechanistic insights into fibril nucleation, including the importance of charge and gatekeeper residues in the disordered region outside of the amyloid core in preventing nucleation. Strikingly, unlike computational predictors and previous measurements, the empirical nucleation scores accurately identify all known dominant fAD mutations in Aß, genetically validating that the mechanism of nucleation in a cell-based assay is likely to be very similar to the mechanism that causes the human disease. These results provide the first comprehensive atlas of how mutations alter the formation of any amyloid fibril and a resource for the interpretation of genetic variation in Aß.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia, affecting more than 50 million people worldwide. Despite more than 400 clinical trials, there are still no effective drugs that can prevent or treat the disease. A common target in Alzheimer’s disease trials is a small protein called amyloid beta. Amyloid beta proteins are ‘sticky’ molecules. In the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease, they join to form first small aggregates and then long chains called fibrils, a process which is toxic to neurons.</p><p>Specific mutations in the gene for amyloid beta are known to cause rare, aggressive forms of Alzheimer’s disease that typically affect people in their fifties or sixties. But these are not the only mutations that can occur in amyloid beta. In principle, any part of the protein could undergo mutation. And given the size of the human population, it is likely that each of these mutations exists in someone alive today.</p><p>Seuma et al. reasoned that studying these mutations could help us understand the process by which amyloid beta forms new aggregates. Using an approach called deep mutational scanning, Seuma et al. mutated each point in the protein, one at a time. This produced more than 14,000 different versions of amyloid beta. Seuma et al. then measured how quickly these mutants were able to form aggregates by introducing them into yeast cells.</p><p>All the mutations known to cause early-onset Alzheimer’s disease accelerated amyloid beta aggregation in the yeast. But the results also revealed previously unknown properties that control how fast aggregation occurs. In addition, they highlighted a number of positions in the amyloid beta sequence that act as ‘gatekeepers’. In healthy brains, these gatekeepers prevent amyloid beta proteins from sticking together. When mutated, they drive the protein to form aggregates.</p><p>This comprehensive dataset will help researchers understand how proteins form toxic aggregates, which could in turn help them find ways to prevent this from happening. By providing an ‘atlas’ of all possible amyloid beta mutations, the dataset will also help clinicians interpret any new mutations they encounter in patients. By showing whether or not a mutation speeds up aggregation, the atlas will help clinicians predict whether that mutation increases the risk of Alzheimer’s disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>amyloid</kwd><kwd>deep mutagenesis</kwd><kwd>nucleation</kwd><kwd>aggregation</kwd><kwd>Alzheimer's</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004837</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RTI2018-101491-A-I00</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bolognesi</surname><given-names>Benedetta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004837</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BFU2017-89488-P</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lehner</surname><given-names>Ben</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>616434</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lehner</surname><given-names>Ben</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003030</institution-id><institution>Agència de Gestió d’Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SGR 1322</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lehner</surname><given-names>Ben</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003030</institution-id><institution>Agència de Gestió d’Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019FI_B 01311</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Seuma</surname><given-names>Mireia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007492</institution-id><institution>Fondation Bettencourt Schueller</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Prize</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lehner</surname><given-names>Ben</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A massively parallel analysis of the effects of mutations on amyloid beta nucleation provide the first comprehensive atlas of how mutations alter the formation of amyloid fibrils.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Amyloid plaques consisting of the amyloid beta (Aß) peptide are a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia and a leading global cause of morbidity with very high societal and economic impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ballard et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">World Health Organization, 2012</xref>). Although most cases of AD are sporadic and of uncertain cause, rare familial forms of the disease also exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campion et al., 1999</xref>). These inherited forms of dementia typically have earlier onset and are caused by high penetrance mutations in multiple loci, including in the amyloid precursor protein (<italic>APP</italic>) gene, which encodes the protein from which Aß is derived by proteolytic cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">O'Brien and Wong, 2011</xref>). Several mutations in <italic>PSEN1</italic> and <italic>PSEN2</italic>, the genes coding for the secretases performing sequential cleavage of APP, also lead to autosomal dominant forms of AD. The two most abundant isoforms of Aß generated upon cleavage are 42 and 40 amino acids (aa) in length, with the longer Aß peptide associated with increased aggregation in vitro and cellular toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meisl et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sandberg et al., 2010</xref>). The amyloid state is a thermodynamically low energy state but, both in vitro and in vivo, the spontaneous formation of amyloids is normally very slow because of the high kinetic barrier of fibril nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Knowles et al., 2014</xref>). The process of nucleation generates oligomeric Aß species that have been hypothesized to be particularly toxic to cells and that then grow into fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Michaels et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolognesi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cleary et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Fourteen different mutations in the Aß peptide have been reported to cause familial Alzheimer’s disease (fAD), with all but two having a dominant pattern of inheritance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Weggen and Beher, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Van Cauwenberghe et al., 2016</xref>). However, it is not clear why these particular mutations cause fAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Weggen and Beher, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Van Cauwenberghe et al., 2016</xref>), and these 14 mutations represent only 3.7% of the possible 378 single nucleotide changes that can occur in Aß. As for nearly all disease genes, therefore, the molecular mechanism by which mutations cause the disease remains unclear and the vast majority of possible mutations in Aß are variants of uncertain significance (VUS). This makes the clinical interpretation of genetic variation in this locus a difficult challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Starita et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gelman et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, given the human mutation rate and population size, it is likely that nearly all of these possible variants in Aß actually exist in at least one individual currently alive on the planet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Conrad et al., 2011</xref>). A comprehensive map of how all possible mutations affect the formation of Aß amyloids and how these changes relate to the human disease is therefore urgently needed.</p><p>More generally, amyloid fibrils are associated with many different human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Knowles et al., 2014</xref>), but how mutations alter the propensity of proteins to aggregate into amyloid fibrils is not well understood and there has been no large-scale analysis of the effects of mutations on the formation of any amyloid fibril. Here, we address this shortcoming by quantifying the rate of fibril formation for &gt;14,000 variants of Aß. This provides the first comprehensive map of how mutations alter the propensity of any protein to form amyloid fibrils. The resulting data provide numerous mechanistic insights into the process of Aß fibril nucleation. Moreover, they also accurately classify all the known dominant fAD mutations, validating the clinical relevance of a simple cell-based model and providing a comprehensive resource for the interpretation of clinical genetic data.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Deep mutagenesis of Aß</title><p>To globally quantify the impact of mutations on the nucleation of Aß fibrils, we used an in vivo selection assay in which the nucleation of Aß is rate-limiting for the aggregation of a second amyloid, the yeast prion [<italic>PSI+</italic>] encoded by the <italic>sup35</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chandramowlishwaran et al., 2018</xref>).

Consistent with this, we quantified the nucleation of three C-terminal fragments of the peptide (aa 22-42, 24-42, 27-42) and found that they nucleate similarly or better than full length Aß (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Mutations to polar and charged residues in this region nearly all decrease nucleation, but so too do most changes to other hydrophobic residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), suggesting specific side chain packing in this region is important for nucleation. The relative effects of different mutations are only partially captured by changes in hydrophobicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>; Pearson correlation coefficient, R = 0.45) and by predictors of aggregation potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Only a few mutations in this region increase nucleation: substitutions to isoleucine at positions 30, 34, and 39; mutations to valine at positions 29, 30, and 34; a change to threonine at position 30; changes to leucine and methionine at 36; and a mutation to phenylalanine at position 41 (FDR = 0.1).</p><p>Mutations in the N-terminus of Aß have a more balanced effect on nucleation, and these effects are not well predicted by either hydrophobicity or predictors of aggregation potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B,D and E</xref>). The effects of introducing particular aa are, however, biased, with the introduction of asparagine, isoleucine, and valine most likely to increase nucleation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). As at the C-terminus, the introduction of negative charged residues typically strongly reduces nucleation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). However, in contrast to what is observed in the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), the effects of introducing positive charge are less severe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Interestingly, the effects of mutations to proline, isoleucine, valine, and threonine in the N-terminus depend on the position in which they are made: mutations in the first 12 residues typically decrease nucleation, whereas mutations in the next four to nine residues increase nucleation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The conformational rigidity of proline and the beta-branched side chains of isoleucine, valine, and threonine that disfavour helix formation suggest that disruption of a secondary structure in this region may favour nucleation. Interestingly, this same region was highlighted as the part of the peptide remaining most disordered across different states of the solution ensemble of Aß in molecular dynamics simulations, with the same region also making extensive long-range contacts in different states of the kinetic ensemble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Löhr et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>The role of charge in limiting Aß nucleation</title><p>At five of six negatively charged positions in Aß, mutations frequently increase nucleation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A</xref>). Moreover, the introduction of negative charge at other positions strongly decreases nucleation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), suggesting that negatively charged residues act as gatekeepers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pedersen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rousseau et al., 2006</xref>) to limit nucleation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In contrast, mutations in the three positively charged residues (R5, K16, K28) mostly decrease nucleation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Mutating the negatively charged gatekeepers to the polar aa glutamine and asparagine, to positively charged residues (arginine and lysine), or to small side chains (glycine and alanine) increases nucleation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Mutating the same positions to hydrophobic residues typically reduces nucleation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

Including double mutants allows the net charge of Aß to vary over a wider range and it also allows comparison of the nucleation of peptides with the same net charge but a different total number of charged residues (e.g., a net charge of −3 can result from a negative/positive aa composition of 6/3, as in wild-type Aß, or compositions of 7/4, 5/2, etc.). Considering all mutations between charged and polar residues or glycine reveals that, although reducing the net charge of the peptide from −3 progressively increases nucleation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), the total number of charged residues is also important: for a given net charge, nucleation is increased in peptides containing fewer charged residues of any sign (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F and G</xref>).

At position 17, changes to polar, aromatic, and aliphatic aa all increase nucleation, as does the introduction of a positive charge and mutation to proline. Only a mutation to cysteine reduces nucleation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This suggests a specific role for leucine at position 17 in limiting nucleation, perhaps as part of a nucleation-limiting secondary structure suggested by the mutational effects of proline, isoleucine, valine, and threonine in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p><p>Finally, the distribution of mutational effects at position 42 differs from that in the rest of the hydrophobic C-terminus of Aß, with mutations most often increasing nucleation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; FDR = 0.1).

At position 11, for example, there are five mutations with a NS higher than the known E11K disease mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>).

These mutations destabilise enzyme-substrate complexes, increasing the production of the longer Aß peptides that more effectively nucleates amyloid formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Szaruga et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Veugelen et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, Aß42 oligomers are hypothesised to be more toxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Michaels et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolognesi et al., 2010</xref>). It is possible that the effects of some of the mutations reported here on nucleation are also mediated by a change in the concentration of Aß rather than by an increase in a kinetic rate parameter. Some of the variants evaluated here may have additional effects, for example, altering cleavage of APP. Future work will be needed to test these hypotheses.</p><p>Comparing our results to the effects of mutations on Aß solubility quantified in a previous high-throughput analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gray et al., 2019</xref>) provides evidence that, in the same type of cell (yeast), Aß can aggregate in at least two different ways. Moreover, the different performance of the two sets of scores from these datasets in classifying fAD mutations suggests that one of these aggregation processes (quantified by the nucleation assay employed here) is likely to be very similar to the aggregation that occurs in the human brain in fAD. The other pathway of aggregation (quantified by the solubility assay; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gray et al., 2019</xref>), however, is less obviously related to the human disease, because mutations that cause fAD do not consistently affect it. This second aggregation pathway is, at least to a large extent, driven by changes in hydrophobicity, similar to what we previously reported for the aggregation in yeast of the ALS protein, TDP-43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolognesi et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>More generally, our results highlight how the combination of deep mutational scanning and human genetics can be a general ‘genetic’ strategy to quantify the disease relevance of biological assays. Many in vitro and in vivo assays are proposed as ‘disease models’ in biomedical research with their relevance often justified by how ‘physiological’ the assays seem or how well phenotypes observed in the model match those observed in the human disease. The range of phenotypes that can be assessed and their similarity to the pathology of AD human brains are appealing features of many animal models of AD and many important insights have been derived – and will continue to be derived – from animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sasaguri et al., 2017</xref>). However, there are applications where animal models cannot be realistically used, for example, for high-throughput compound screening for drug discovery and for testing hundreds or thousands of genetic variants of unknown significance. For these applications, in vitro or cell-based (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pimenova and Goate, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Veugelen et al., 2016</xref>) assays are required and an important challenge is to evaluate the ‘disease relevance’ of different assays. Our study highlights an approach to achieve this, which is to use the complete set of known disease-causing mutations to quantify the ‘genetic agreement’ between an assay and a disease. Thus, although the yeast-based assay that we employed here might typically be dismissed as ‘non-physiological,’ ‘artificial,’ or ‘lacking many features important for a neurological disease,' unbiased massively parallel genetic analysis provides very strong evidence that it is reporting on biopysicall events that are extremely similar to – or the same as – those that cause the human disease. Indeed, one could argue that this simple system is now better validated as a model of fAD than many others, including animal models where the effects of only one or a few mutations (including control mutations) have ever been tested. Similarly strong agreement between mutational effects in a cellular assay and the set of mutations already known to cause a disease is observed for other diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Starita et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gelman et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting the generality of this approach.</p><p>We suggest therefore that the combination of deep mutational scanning and human genetics provides a general strategy to quantify the disease relevance of in vitro and cell-based assays. We encourage that deep mutagenesis should be employed early in discovery programmes to ‘genetically validate’ (or invalidate) the relevance of assays for particular diseases. The concordance between mutational effects in an assay and a disease is an unbiased metric that can be used to prioritize between different assays. Quantifying the ‘genetic agreement’ between an assay and a disease will help prevent time and resources being wasted on research that actually has little relevance to a disease.</p><p>Finally, the strikingly consistent effects of the dominant fAD mutations in our assay further strengthen the evidence that fAD is a ‘nucleation disease’ ultimately caused by an increased rate of amyloid nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aprile et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cohen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Knowles et al., 2009</xref>). This accelerated nucleation can be caused by the direct effects of mutations in Aß — such as those quantified here — or by changes in upstream factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Szaruga et al., 2017</xref>). If this hypothesis is correct, then nucleation is the key bioph step to target to prevent or treat AD. We suggest that the ‘genetic validation’ of assays by mutational scanning and comparison to sets of known disease-causing mutations will be increasingly important in assay development and drug discovery pipelines.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid library construction</title><p>The plasmid P<sub>CUP1</sub>-Sup35N-Aβ42 used in this study was a kind gift from the Chernoff lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chandramowlishwaran et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The Aβ coding sequence and two flanking regions of 52 bp and 72 bp, respectively, upstream and downstream of Aβ were amplified (primers MS_01 and MS_02, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) by error-prone PCR (Mutazyme II DNA polymerase, Agilent).

Hence, this work reports a rapid means to assign pathogenicity to Aβ variants in high throughput screens and will help in assigning function to variants of unknown significance.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The genetic landscape for amyloid beta fibril nucleation accurately discriminates familial Alzheimer's disease mutations&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Huda Zoghbi as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper reports a deep scanning mutagenesis screening to test the effects of over 14,000 single and double mutations in Aβ42, the proteolytic product from the amyloid precursor protein associated with Alzheimer disease, on the aggregation properties of the peptide. In contrast to previous work, the current study is based on an aggregation gain-of-function screen, where a construct expressing Aβ42 fused to yeast sup35 is used to trigger prion conversion of full length sup35. The authors make a number of sensible arguments (but also some overstatements) that differentiate their assay from that used in previous work. The findings include the identification of mutations that enhance or suppress Aβ nucleation as well as modular regions in the peptide. The assay also is able to identify the fAD mutations and the conclusion is therefore that this would be a great assay for quick assessment of pathogenicity to Aβ variants of unknown significance.

In fact, the most aggressive mutations in APP (such as the Iberian or Autrian) and mutations in Presenilin share a common mechanism that results in the enhanced generation of longer Aβ peptides (Szaruga et al., 2017). How do the authors incorporate these findings into their model?

It is interesting to see that the data seem to differentiate solubility/hydrophobicity and nucleation, suggesting that two factors may contribute to Aβ aggregation.</p><p>The data also indicate that mutations that decrease nucleation are enriched in the C-terminus of Aβ while mutations that increase it are enriched in the N-terminus, suggesting that the formation of a hydrophobic C-terminal core mediates nucleation. Furthermore, the data reveal that decreasing both the net charge of the peptide and the total number of charged residues increases nucleation. In fact, most of the negative charges present in Aβ42 are proposed to be “gatekeepers” of nucleation.</p><p>Notably, mutating the negatively charged gatekeepers to the polar, positively charged or small side chain (G and A) amino acids increases nucleation; while substituting them for hydrophobic residues generally reduced nucleation. The authors thus proposed a model in which &quot;the negative charge at these positions acts to limit nucleation, but that the overall polar and unstructured nature of the N-terminus must be maintained for effective nucleation.&quot;.</p><p>Finally, the authors concluded that the Aβ nucleation accurately discriminates familial AD (fAD) mutations.

Data in Figure 2D does not clarify this point: data for H13 or Q15 do not seem to be much different from the positions selected. Furthermore, only few mutations seem to have been tested at position A42 and an equal number of mutations increase or decrease nucleation, is this residue/position truly a gatekeeper?</p><p>• In the last part of the manuscript, the authors analysed the nucleation of fAD-linked mutations in Aβ. The figures display &quot;ROC curves built using 12 fAD mutants versus all other single aa mutants in the 484 datasets for variant effect and aggregation predictors&quot;.

A common effect of these mutations is to enhance the generation of Aβ42 over shorter versions of the peptide (Szaruga et al., 2017), therefore increasing Aβ42 relative and/or absolute concentration and facilitating nucleation. In addition, the substrate-enzyme destabilization caused by some mutations in PSEN1 and PSEN2 leads to an increase in the representation of longer Aβ peptides (≥Aβ42) displaying increased nucleation propensity and increased neurotoxicity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Benitova et al., 2012; Vandersteen et al., 2012; Conicella et al., 2014). We cannot exclude that also some of the mutations in our library, especially those in the very first or last residues of the peptide, could impact cleavage of APP in humans and lead to over-representation of longer Aβ peptides.</p><p>We have added the following sentences to the text:</p><p>“Several mutations in <italic>PSEN1</italic> and <italic>PSEN2</italic>, the genes coding for the secretases performing sequential cleavage of APP, also lead to autosomal dominant forms of AD.”</p><p>“The other variant, A2V, does not have a dominant effect on nucleation in our assay (Figure 2C), consistent with a recessive pattern of inheritance and a different mechanism of action, such as reduced ß-cleavage and increased Aß 42 generation, as previously proposed (Benilova et al., 2014).”</p><p>“That accelerated nucleation is a common cause of fAD is also supported by the effects of mutations in <italic>APP</italic> outside of Aß42 and by the effects of mutations in <italic>PSEN1</italic> and <italic>PSEN2</italic>.

This accelerated nucleation can be caused by the direct effects of mutations – such as those quantified here – or by changes in upstream factors (Szaruga et al., 2017).

How can antagonistic or synergistic effects be excluded?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree these are very important questions in relation to this specific assay. We state that Aβ is rate limiting in this assay because the nucleation domain of Sup35 (SupN) alone leads to no nucleation and no yeast growth in selective conditions (lacking adenine). These control experiments are presented in Chandramowlishwaran et al. (2018) and have been repeated by us for further validation (now included as new Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). Finally, the ability to grow without adenine depends on the recruitment and function of endogenous Sup35. Consistent with this, expression of Aβ42 alone also results in no detectable growth (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A).</p><p>Work from the Lindquist and Chernoff labs showed that amyloid sequences forming many unstable aggregates lead to more growth in the lack of adenine compared to sequences that instead could form highly stable amyloids (Frederick et al., 2014; Chandramowlishwaran et al., 2018). In line with this we observe one of the highest nucleation scores for a variant known to populate persistent oligomeric species, while very low nucleation scores for variants such as Aβ40, which are known to slowly nucleate long fibrils (Bolognesi, 2014, Sanagavarapu, 2019).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The sup35 fragment is N-terminally fused to Aβ42 and the data show biggest effects on the aggregation propensity at the C-terminus.

In addition, we would like to argue the following:</p><p>If the mutational effects we measure were biased by the N-terminal fusion, then one would expect a gradient of effects: small changes in NS close to the fusion and larger changes in NS further away from it.

Specifically, we quantified the nucleation of three C-terminal fragments of the peptide (aa 22-42, 24-42, 27-42) with Sup35 fused at their N-terminus and found that they nucleate similarly or better than full length Aß42.

Our point, which we think is an important one, is that only by testing many disease-causing mutations and many random (or non-disease causing) mutations in an assay can one properly quantify how well the effects of mutations on the biochemical process(es) that it reports on match the effects of mutations in causing a human genetic disease. Based on our and other labs’ deep mutagenesis of multiple human disease proteins now, we think it can be dangerous to make strong conclusions about the validity of an assay by testing the behaviour of 1 or 2 disease-causing mutations and 1 or 2 control mutations.

However, it is difficult to draw strong conclusions from negative results because of several confounders so we prefer not to highlight specific examples and have removed the second sentence quoted above. Our aim in this section is simply to raise a discussion point that more groups or companies should use deep mutational scanning to quantify how well there in vitro and cell-based assays “genetically agree” with specific human genetic diseases.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We believe that the other comments are straightforward to address with further changes to the text.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…]</p><p>• The selection assay (reporting on nucleation) seems to be highly reproducible, as supported by data presented in Figure 1B. Nevertheless, this reviewer wonders about the potential impact of the Sup35N fusion on Aβ solubility/hydrophobicity and aggregation. In addition, Aβ aggregation has been reported to be concentration dependent and it is not clear from the data whether the mutant peptides are, or not, expressed at similar levels.</p><p>Could peptide fusion and/or expression levels have changed the intrinsic attributes of Aβ42 and could these potential alterations explain -at least to some degree- the mismatch observed between nucleation and hydrophobicity (Figure 1D, 3F)?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this is a limitation of our assay and at the moment cannot exclude that the possible variability in expression levels among different Aβ42 variants may have an influence on the nucleation scores that we quantify. This is a limitation of most deep mutation scanning assays, as it is particularly challenging to accurately track expression levels of thousands of protein variants in parallel. This was achieved in some cases by fluorescent-tagging the mutagenized protein and analyzing the library by flow cytometry (Staller et al., 2017), a solution which is unfortunately not possible to adopt in the conditions of our assay. We have added the following sentence to acknowledge this limitation.</p><p>“It is possible that the effects of some of the mutations reported here on nucleation are also mediated by a change in the concentration of Aß42 rather than by an increase in a kinetic rate parameter. In addition, some of the variants evaluated here may have additional effects, for example altering cleavage of APP. Future work will be needed to test these hypotheses.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Figure 2 presents the effects of the amino acid changes on the nucleation of Aβ. The authors mention that all possible amino acid changes in Aβ42 were introduced; however, there are several white spots corresponding to non-existing mutants. Why these mutants are missing?</p></disp-quote><p>The sentence refers to nt substitutions, rather than codon substitutions. Indeed, our library contains all the possible 378 nt changes to the Aβ sequence. In order to build the Aβ mutant library we used an error-prone PCR approach which introduces changes at the nucleotide level, thus limiting the complete coverage of all codon substitutions. However, we optimised the approach to ensure the coverage of all single nt substitutions and to maximise the number of double nt substitutions (47.2%). The “white spots” in Figure 2 therefore represents codons substitutions not represented in our library.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• The authors proposed and discussed the presence of gatekeepers of nucleation. How precisely these have been selected? Is there any cut-off score? Data in Figure 2D does not clarify this point: data for H13 or Q15 do not seem to be much different from the positions selected. Furthermore, only few mutations seem to have been tested at position A42 and an equal number of mutations increase or decrease nucleation, is this residue/position truly a gatekeeper?</p></disp-quote><p>Gatekeeper positions were defined as those where as many (or more) single aa substitutions increase as decrease nucleation for FDR=0.1. For the definition of gatekeepers, we only considered those positions where most mutations are significantly different from WT (FDR=0.1), i.e.: If the majority of mutations at a specific position are WT-like then this position is not considered a gate-keeper according to our definition. In this line, we defined position 42 as a gatekeeper. This is now directly stated in the Materials and methods.</p><p>In this revised version of the manuscript we have also updated Figure 2D and Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B because we found a minor error in the script that generated the plot in the previous version. As can be easily seen in the new figures, this change does not affect any of our results or conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• In the last part of the manuscript, the authors analysed the nucleation of fAD-linked mutations in Aβ. The figures display &quot;ROC curves built using 12 fAD mutants versus all other single aa mutants in the 484 datasets for variant effect and aggregation predictors&quot;. This reviewer would appreciate a figure where data for each specific fAD variant is displayed; or alternatively a table presenting the key data from a case by case analysis. It would be also interesting to see how the data relates to clinical onset.</p></disp-quote><p>Data for each fAD variant is now included in Supplementary file 1. We also included a new figure reporting on the relation between nucleation scores and clinical onset age for a subset of six mutations (Figure 4—figure supplement 1E). However, the age-of-onset data is too noisy for us to draw any conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• The conclusions that &quot;the rate of nucleation in a cell-based assay accurately identifies mutations that cause dominant familial Alzheimer's disease&quot; and &quot;AD is actually a nucleation disease&quot; should be reviewed, while considering that several other “very aggressive” mutations in APP and in Presenilins (γ secretase) do not generated mutant, but wild type Aβ peptides. In fact, the most aggressive mutations in APP (such as the Iberian or Autrian) and mutations in Presenilin share a common mechanism that results in the enhanced generation of longer Aβ peptides (Szaruga et al., 2017). How do the authors incorporate these findings into their model?</p><p>In addition, it is known that pathogenic mutations in Aβ1-42 do not only affect its aggregation propensity but also the cleavage of APP by β-secretase. The protective, Icelandic APP variant is one of these cases.</p><p>In short, the Discussion would benefit from a broader perspective.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have expanded the Introduction and the discussion of our results. The importance of accelerated nucleation as the cause of fAD is actually also in line with the proposed mechanism explaining the effect of fAD mutations beyond Aβ, such as the ones in PSEN1, PSEN2, and in APP outside of the Aβ region. A common effect of these mutations is to enhance the generation of Aβ42 over shorter versions of the peptide (Szaruga et al., 2017), therefore increasing Aβ42 relative and/or absolute concentration and facilitating nucleation. In addition, the substrate-enzyme destabilization caused by some mutations in PSEN1 and PSEN2 leads to an increase in the representation of longer Aβ peptides (≥Aβ42) displaying increased nucleation propensity and increased neurotoxicity (Veugelen et al., 2016; Benitova et al., 2012; Vandersteen et al., 2012; Conicella et al., 2014). We cannot exclude that some of the mutations in our library, especially those in the very first or last residues of the peptide, could impact cleavage of APP in humans and lead to over-representation of longer Aβ peptides.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• The authors should note that the pathogeneicity of the H6R is unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>A comment on H6R has been added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…]</p><p>More specifically:</p><p>1) The specific purpose of this work is to map the genetic landscape for nucleation of Aβ42. Yet the reporter used here is the ability of a fragment of another amyloid (prion) protein sup35 to nucleate endogenous sup35. This is a totally different aggregation prone sequence than Aβ (Q/N rich instead of hydrophobic) with different intrinsic kinetics. What are the controls guaranteeing that a)Aβ42 is indeed rate limiting, b) that sup35 seeding is scaling along with Aβ42 nucleation (some Aβ mutations might lead to many small seeds while other to less but bigger seeds) and c) that both Aβ42 and sup35N domain aggregation are independent of each other in this fusion. How can antagonistic or synergistic effects be excluded?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree these are very important questions in relation to this specific assay. We state that Aβ is rate limiting in this assay because the nucleation domain of Sup35 (Sup35N) alone leads to no nucleation and no yeast growth in selective conditions (lacking adenine). These crucial control experiments are presented in Chandramowlishwaran et al. (2018) and have been repeated by us for further validation (now included as Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). Finally, the ability to grow without adenine depends on the recruitment and function of endogenous Sup35. According to this, expression of Aβ42 alone also results in no detectable growth (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A).</p><p>The Lindquist and Chernoff labs showed that amyloid sequences forming many unstable aggregates lead to more growth in the lack of adenine compared to sequences that instead could form highly stable amyloids (Frederick et al., 2014; Chandramowlishwaran et al., 2018). In line with this we observe one of the highest nucleation scores for a variant known to populate persistent oligomeric species, while very low nucleation scores for variants such as Aβ40, which are known to slowly nucleate long fibrils (Bolognesi, 2014).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The sup35 fragment is N-terminally fused to Aβ42 and the data show biggest effects on the aggregation propensity at the C-terminus. Is the fact that the 16-23 fragment is less prominent not a bias resulting of transforming the N-terminal unstructured part of Aβ42 into a linker in the fusion thereby underestimating effect towards the N terminal part of the domain?</p></disp-quote><p>That mutations in the C-terminus more often reduce nucleation is highly expected given that the C-terminus forms the hydrophobic amyloid core in most of the published Aβ42 fibrillar structures. In addition, we would like to argue the following:</p><p>If the mutational effects we measure were biased by the N-terminal fusion, then one would expect a gradient of effects: small changes in NS close to the fusion and larger changes in NS further away from it. However the effect we see is instead modular and several mutations with large effects on nucleation also exist at the N-terminus (examples: H14I, Q15P, E22G)</p><p>Known fAD mutations are located mostly at the N-terminus, they all have significant effects on nucleation and are all correctly classified by this assay (Figure 2 and Figure 4)</p><p>We have tested whether fusing the Sup35 fragment next to the C-terminal core interferes with nucleation and it does not. Specifically, we quantified the nucleation of three C-terminal fragments of the peptide (aa 22-42, 24-42, 27-42) with Sup35 fused at their N-terminus and found that they nucleate similarly or better than full length Aß42. These data are included as Figure 3—figure supplement 1C and are reported in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors validate their assay by showing that previously measured nucleation rates of disease mutants correlate with their “nucleation” enrichment scores. The problem is that this only represents a handful of mutants (5 mutants) the majority of which are situated along positions 21/22/23 of the Aβ peptide. There is no guarantee that mutants in very different contexts such as in the flexible N-terminal part of the region or the C-terminal aggregation prone region will respond in such a nicely correlated manner.</p><p>Overall therefore the absence of bias in the current experimental setup needs to be addressed by a more rigorous validation. Mutants that increase/decrease nucleation along different parts of the sequence should be experimentally validated in the same manner than the Yang et al., 2018 paper currently used to show correlation.</p><p>Finally, the authors conclude that their results are more relevant to disease because they better report on nucleation than the study of Gray et al. They also conclude that they report on another mode of aggregation. I don't think there is evidence for that in this manuscript. First, although nucleation plays an important role in amyloid diseases this is not necessarily all of it. Second, the study of Gray et al. -although not correlating well with nucleation data- still identifies the importance of the 16-23 region and the C-terminal region in a more balanced manner. Both region are known to be crucial in determining Aβ nucleation.</p></disp-quote><p>The quantitative data (Yang et al., 2018) that we compare to consists of mutations at positions 21, 22, 23.</p><p>In addition to this quantitative data, the qualitative effects of 16 different mutations have previously been analyzed in vitro across ten previous publications (Supplementary file 1). Our quantitative data agrees with these previously reported effects of mutations in 14 out of 16 cases. These include mutations in the N-terminus, such as H6R and E11K. In two cases our data disagree with the literature:</p><p>D7H, an fAD variant, increases nucleation in our assay but showed a longer lag phase in the only in vitro kinetics assay that we could find in the literature (Chen et al., 2012).</p><p>A21G, another fAD variant, increases nucleation in our assay but has been reported to have various effects in vitro in different papers: it was reported to aggregate similarly to wild-type Aβ42 (Yang et al., 2018), to have a decreased aggregation rate (Thu et al., 2019), and appears to accelerate aggregation in Vandersteen et al., 2012. Our results suggest that A21G does, at least in certain conditions, increase nucleation like all the other dominant fAD mutations in our assay.</p><p>In relation to this point, we have added an additional table (Supplementary file 1) and the following sentence to the text:</p><p>“Comparing our in vivo enrichment scores to the qualitative effects of 16 mutations analyzed in vitro across ten previous publications validated the assay, with mutational effects matching the effects on in vitro nucleation previously reported for 14 Aß variants out of 16. (Supplementary file 1).”</p><p>Finally, there are some discrepancies in the mutation effects reported in the literature for A2V. Recent kinetics analysis reports a decrease both in primary and secondary nucleation for this variant (Meisl et al., 2016, Murray et al., 2016), in line with our results. However, previous work found the overall nucleation rate for A2V to be similar to wild-type Aβ42 (Benilova et al., 2014). Interestingly, the same study shows an increase in nucleation for A2V Aβ40, compared to wild-type Aβ40. This difference in mutation effect actually encourages the use of a deep mutagenesis approach for the study of mutation effects on Aβ40. We should add that A2V is a recessive AD mutation, suggesting that the mechanism by which it leads to toxicity may differ from that underlying dominant fAD mutations and, for example, may involve modulation of B-cleavage efficiency with increased Aβ production, as suggested by Benilova <italic>et al.</italic> A sentence on this has been added to the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors use an in vitro nucleation assay to assess the aggregation properties of 14 483 mutated forms of Aβ, encompassing all possible single amino acid changes as well as double amino acid mutations. They identify mutations that both enhance and suppress Aβ nucleation, and define modular regions of Aβ linked to various aggregation properties. Importantly, the assay is able to identify known fAD mutations. Based on these results, the authors conclude that their system provides a rapid, cost effective means to assign pathogenicity to Aβ variants of unknown significance.</p><p>Although I find the work to be technically sound, and to provide interesting insights into the biochemical properties of Aβ, I think the conclusions, particular with regards to disease relevance, to be somewhat overstated in part and there are some omissions of relevant literature. Some specific points are listed below:</p><p>1) The authors state that &quot;Moreover, given the human mutation rate and population size, it is likely that nearly all of these possible variants in Aβ actually exist in at least one individual currently alive on the planet&quot; – however, these mutations may not be compatible with life, and as the majority (14015) examined are double mutations, how likely are these to exist in people? I am not sure that the species with double amino acid alterations bear relevance to disease or are likely to exist in individuals</p></disp-quote><p>The comment refers to all possible single nucleotide changes. Given the human germline mutation rate (~5*10<sup>-8</sup>) (Scally et al., 2016) and the number of individuals currently alive (~8*10<sup>9</sup>), all of the Aβ42 variants that are compatible with life are likely to currently exist in at least one individual currently alive on the planet simply from de novo mutations each generation.</p><p>We included double nt changes for two reasons: (1) to increase the number of amino acid substitutions and (2) to include double amino acid changes to provide larger changes in physico-chemical parameters. The advantage of this can be seen for example in the analysis of the effects of charge where the double mutants allow us to quantify the effects of varying both the net charge and total charge (Figure 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The manuscript states that it is not clear why APP/Aβ mutations cause AD, but it would be good to see a discussion of recent mechanistic work demonstrating that fAD mutations destabilise APP-GSEC complexes, resulting in the release of longer Aβ peptides (PMID: 28753424). Thus, the mutations could be shifting the profile of Aβ species produced as well as influencing aggregation, this should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the following sentences to the Discussion:</p><p>“That accelerated nucleation is a common cause of fAD is also supported by the effects of mutations in <italic>APP</italic> outside of Aß42 and by the effects of mutations in <italic>PSEN1</italic> and <italic>PSEN2</italic>. These mutations destabilize enzyme-substrate complexes, increasing the production of the longer Aß42 peptide that more effectively nucleates amyloid formation (Szaruga et al., 2017; Veugelen et al., 2016). In addition, Aß42 oligomers are hypothesized to be more toxic (Michaels et al., 2020; Bolognesi et al., 2010). It is possible that the effects of some of the mutations reported here on nucleation are also mediated by a change in the concentration of Aß42 rather than by an increase in a kinetic rate parameter. Some of the variants evaluated here may have additional effects, for example altering cleavage of APP. Future work will be needed to test these hypotheses.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Relating to point 2, I think the Introduction should include a description of the tripeptide cleavage pathways that result in multiple forms of Aβ, and also recent work that Aβ 43 is more neurotoxic and aggregation prone than 42.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the following sentences to the Introduction, in addition to the extended text in the Discussion reported in point 2:</p><p>“Several mutations in <italic>PSEN1</italic> and <italic>PSEN2</italic>, the genes coding for the secretases performing sequential cleavage of APP, also lead to autosomal dominant forms of AD.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) I find the Discussion to be unnecessarily dismissive of animal models and other model systems. Particularly &quot;this simple system is now better-validated as a model of fAD than any other, including animal models where the effects of only one or a few mutations (including control mutations) have ever been tested.&quot;. The current paper models only one aspect of Aβ biology, aggregation, and doesn't take into account Aβ generation nor the mechanisms linking Aβ to neurodegeneration. Thus I think this required rewriting to acknowledge that each model has its strengths/limitations</p></disp-quote><p>As stated above, we have rephrased the Discussion to tone down some of these statements and to correctly acknowledge the importance of other models. Apologies for this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Likewise there is an omission of other cell based and cell free models that have been used for assigning significance to pathological variants and should be incorporated into the Discussion, e.g. PMID: 32032730, PMID: 27100199</p></disp-quote><p>We have rephrased the Discussion to tone down some of these statements and to acknowledge the relevance of other models and assays, such as these ones, which are now cited in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The statement &quot;Many in vitro and in vivo assays are proposed as 'disease models' in biomedical research with their relevance often justified by how 'physiological' the assays seem or how well phenotypes observed in the model match those observed in the human disease.
