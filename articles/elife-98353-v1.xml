dynamics is underexplored. It is well recognized that cold acclimations enhance adipocyte functions, including white adipose tissue lipid lipolysis and beiging, and brown adipose tissue thermogenesis in mammals. However, it remains unclear whether and how lipid metabolism in the brain is also under the control of ambient temperature. Here, we show that cold exposure predominantly increases the expressions of the lipid lipolysis genes and proteins within the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH) in male mice. Mechanistically, by using innovatively combined brain-region selective pharmacology and in vivo time-lapse photometry monitoring of lipid metabolism, we find that cold activates cells within the PVH and pharmacological inactivation of cells blunts cold-induced effects on lipid peroxidation, accumulation of lipid droplets, and lipid lipolysis in the PVH. Together, these findings suggest that PVH lipid metabolism is cold sensitive and integral to cold-induced broader regulatory responses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cold</kwd><kwd>lipid metabolism</kwd><kwd>paraventricular of hypothalamus</kwd><kwd>photometry</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK112759</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Yunlei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK135717</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Yunlei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>It is of significance in identifying temperature sensitive brain regions in brain energy metabolism, as which might provide potential targetable sites in the treatment of brain lipid metabolism-associated neurological disorders.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lipid metabolism in peripheral tissues has been extensively studied, including white adipose tissue lipolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Grabner et al., 2021</xref>), beiging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartelt and Heeren, 2014</xref>), and brown adipose tissue thermogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carpentier et al., 2023</xref>; however, an essential but poorly understood element is that of lipids in the central nervous system, particularly in the hypothalamus which plays a crucial role in the regulation of systematic energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Waterson and Horvath, 2015</xref>) and glucose homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Pozo and Claret, 2018</xref>). The brain is highly thermal sensitive in that 1Â°C or less temperature changes can lead to functional alterations of the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brooks, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Lipids provide a major source of energy and heat in the body, however, the mechanism underlying brain lipid metabolism regulations remains a mystery. There is evidence to show that the brainâs energy metabolism largely depends on the temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guyton and Hall, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Yu et al., 2012</xref>). We therefore assume that cold modulates brain lipid metabolism in brain regions that express the genes encoding lipid metabolic enzymes sensitive to ambient temperature. Identifying the brain regions and genes modulated by ambient temperature is of significance in our understandings of the mechanisms of maintaining brain lipid metabolism homeostasis.</p><p>Here, we combine cold exposure and brain region-selective genetic, molecular, and lipid metabolic assays, coupled with in vivo real-time two-color fiber photometry monitoring of lipid metabolic activity, to define cold-sensitive brain region(s) and lipid metabolism and to elucidate the involved cellular mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cold-induced brain region-selective gene expressions of lipid lipolytic markers in males</title><p>To investigate a potential for cold exposure to modulate gene expressions for lipid lipolysis and thermogenesis in the hypothalamus, mice were exposed to a cold (4Â°C) chamber for 4â6 hr, a more physiologically relevant condition. Immediately after the cold challenge, mouse brains were acutely extracted and sectioned in ice-cold oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluids (ACSFs). Hypothalamic sections that, respectively, include the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH), lateral hypothalamus (LH), dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), and arcuate nucleus (ARC) were transferred to ACSF-containing incubators. Micro-punches of these brain regions were subsequently made for gene assays of lipid metabolic markers.</p><p>To evaluate the effects of cold on the gene markers of lipid lipolysis, we measured the mRNA levels of two key lipolytic markers adipose triglyceride lipase (<italic>Pnpla2</italic>) and hormone-sensitive lipase (<italic>Lipe</italic>). We observed that cold-challenged male mice showed a significant increase in the gene expressions of the both of <italic>Pnpla2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A<sub>1</sub></xref>) and <italic>Lipe</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A<sub>2</sub></xref>) selectively in the PVH but not in other brain regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1BâE</xref>). We also assayed the gene expressions of thermogenic marker uncoupling protein 2 (<italic>Ucp2</italic>) and additional thermogenic factors (<italic>Cidea</italic>, <italic>Prdm16</italic>). Cold did not significantly affect mRNA expressions of these thermogenic markers in all the examined regions in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Cold did not significantly affect gene expressions of these lipolytic and thermogenic markers in female mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). These results suggest that cold exposure (4â6 hr) could induce a rapid lipolytic activity to release fatty acids primarily in the PVH in males. Because cold did not significantly affect lipolytic markers in other regions and did not affect thermogenic markers, we next focused on studying cold-induced lipid mobilization and lipolysis in the PVH in male mice.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Brain region-selective responses to cold.</title><p>Micro-punches of paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH), lateral hypothalamus (LH), dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), and arcuate nucleus (ARC) were made from male mice exposed to a cold chamber for 4â6 hr, which were directly used for real-time qPCR (RT-qPCR) of the gene markers of lipolysis and thermogenesis.

Extensively studies have been focused on lipid metabolism in peripheral tissues particularly in adipose tissues, while little or nothing was known about that in the brain. This was probably in part because of limited techniques. By taking advantage of combined coordinated neurobiology methods and lipid metabolic assays, we provided in this study the in vivo evidence that cold is capable to induce acute cell activity-dependent central nervous system lipid metabolic activities, including lipid peroxidation and mobilization, LD formation, and lipid lipolysis in the hypothalamus. These results fill in a missing but important gap in our understanding of brain region-selective lipid metabolism in physiological conditions, such as cold applied in this study. Also, our in vivo time-lapse fiber photometry approach detecting probe-labeled lipid metabolites would provide a powerful alternative method or technique to evaluate the dynamics of lipid metabolism in live animals. We believe that our studies will also be paradigmatic for understanding abnormal lipid metabolism in brain regions that modify energy metabolism in metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes.</p><p>The third ventricle adjacent PVH is a conserved brain region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Machluf et al., 2011</xref>), composed of different cell populations including those multiple brain regions-projecting parvocellular neurons and magnocellular neurons. Particularly, PVH plays varied crucial roles in modulating the hypothalamicâpituitaryâadrenal (HPA) axis and the hypothalamicâpituitaryâthyroid (HPT) axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Swanson and Sawchenko, 1983</xref>). This determines a key role of the PVH in modulating body functions, energy metabolism and glucose homeostasis in health and disease. Our findings in this study show that cold increases the expressions levels of Fos, lipid peroxidation, LD accumulation, and lipolytic markers in the PVH. These findings reveal a new role for the PVH in preventing fatty acid toxicity in pathological conditions and in integrating cold-induced broader regulatory responses.</p><p>Activated neurons would induce phospholipid peroxidation to release toxic fatty acids. One recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ioannou et al., 2019</xref>) shows that nearby astrocytes have the capacity to endocytose neuron-released fatty acids, store fatty acids in LDs, and liberate fatty acids from LDs through lipolytic processes to mitochondria for Î²-oxidation. Consistently, our data in this study demonstrate that cold-induced lipid peroxidation and lipolysis in the brain are also under the control of cell activities. Our data show that cold increases expressions of ATGL and HSL in both neurons and astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>).

Excitation lights were generated through fiber-coupled two connectorized LEDs (CLED_560 for 560 nm; CLED_505/490 for 505 or 490 nm; CLE_405 for 405 nm; Doric Lenses) driven by a four-channel LED driver (LEDD_4; Doric Lenses). The LEDD_4 was controlled by a fiber photometry console (Doric Lenses) connected to a computer. Excitation lights were passed through two fluorescence MiniCubes (iFMC6_IE(400-410)_E1(460-490)_F1(500-540)_E2(555-570)_F2(580-680)_S)-6 ports with two integrated photodetector heads. The single detector measures both signals within the fluorescence detection windows from 500 to 540 nm and 580 to 680 nm band. The combined excitation light was sent into a patch cord made of a 400-Âµm core, 0.48 NA, low-autofluorescence optical fiber (Doric Lenses). The patch cord was connected to the implanted OmFC consisting of a 1.25-mm diameter optic fiber via a sleeve (Doric Lenses; Zirconia Sleeve 1.25 mm with black cover; Sleeve_ZR_1.25-BK). Both green and red fluorescence signals were collected through the same patch cord and passed through the same Minicube and focused onto a Fluorescence Detector Head (FDH; Doric Lenses). The photometry experiments were run in a Lock-in mode, and the acquisition rate was set to 12.0 ksps*C controlled by Doric Neuroscience Studio software (Doric Lenses). The fiber photometry experiments were performed 5 min after connecting the optic fibers to the animals. We processed the signals using the Doric Neuroscience Studio software (V5.3.3.14) to calculate the normalized fluorescence variation of the images (Î<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic>), and averaged the signals at 1 s bins. To avoid or minimize bleaching over time, we performed patch cord photobleaching for 12 hr before each experiment, reduced the illumination power outputs as much as possible, and recorded the signals for 30 s every 5 min. We used a rotary joint for long-term photometry recordings in freely moving animals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Brain histology and immunofluorescence</title><p>Mice were euthanized and transcardially perfused with 1Ã phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer (PFA, pH 7.2).

The authors point out that in comparison to the extensive literature on the effects of cold exposure in peripheral tissues, we know relatively little about its effects on the brain. They specifically focus on the hypothalamus, and identify the PVH as having changes in Atgl and Hsl gene expression changes during cold exposure. They then go on to show accumulation of lipid droplets, increased Fos expression, and increased lipid peroxidation during cold exposure. Further, they show that neuronal activation is required for the formation of lipid droplets and lipid peroxidation.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>A strength of the study is trying to better understand how metabolism in the brain is a dynamic process, much like how it has been viewed in other organs. The authors also use a creative approach to measuring in vivo lipid peroxidation via delivery of BD-C11 sensor through a cannula to the region in conjunction with fiber photometry to measure fluorescence changes deep in the brain.</p><p>Comments on revised version:</p><p>The authors have attempted to address concerns brought to their attention in the initial review. They have performed one or two additional experiments to address concerns (e.g. adding fiber photometry of PVH neurons and trying to manipulate lipid peroxidation) though many of the concerns from the original review stand. The authors have also revised the text to limit the extent of their claims and to improve clarity, which is appreciated.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.98353.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Min</surname><given-names>Hyeonyoung</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Albert Einstein College of Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bronx</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Yale Y</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Friends Seminary</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Yunlei</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Albert Einstein College of Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p><p>We were pleased that many of the critical comments of the reviewers have allowed us to improve our manuscript. In addition to revise the originally submitted figures, we performed new experiments (e.g. new Fig.2, Fig.3, Fig.4, and Fig.6) and revised the manuscript substantially following the reviewersâ comments and suggestions to our initial submission. A point-by-point response to the reviewersâ critiques are summarized below, and new supportive data are provided in this revised manuscript. Per the Reviewersâ comments and revisions, we revised the title to be âCold induces brain region-selective cell activity-dependent lipid metabolismâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1</bold>:</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>A strength of the study is trying to better understand how metabolism in the brain is a dynamic process, much like how it has been viewed in other organs.

While this is not easily doable for all experiments, it can be done for some. For example, the Fos experiments in Figure 3 would be more conclusive if done with the labeling of neuronal nuclei with NeuN, as glial cells can also express Fos. To similarly show more conclusively that neurons are being activated during cold exposure, the calcium imaging experiments in Figure S3 can be done with cold exposure.</p></disp-quote><p>We agreed with the Reviewersâ comments. We revised the original Figure 3 (new Figure 6) and Figure S3 (new Figure S4). Our data show that cold increased Fos-positive cells in the PVH (Figure 6) and increased neuronal Ca2+ signals (new Figure S4). As it is difficult to exclude the involvements of astrocytes in the cold-induced lipid metabolism, and to address this reviewerâs questions, we revised the title and the text with replacing âneuronalâ with ââcellâ activity, and we concluded that cold induced lipid metabolism depending on âcell activityâ instead of âneuronal activityâ. Studying cell type-specific contributions to the cold-induced effects on lipid metabolism will require many efforts beyond the scope of this study, to which we assumed that both neurons and glial cells contribute.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, many experiments are only done with the minimal three animals required for statistics and could be more robust with additional animals included.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this reviewer for the comments. We added the sample sizes accordingly in this revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another weakness is that the authors do not address whether manipulating lipid droplet accumulation or lipid peroxidation has any effect on PVH function (e.g. does it change neuronal activity in the region?).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this reviewer for bringing up this interesting point. The focus of this study was to examine how cold modulates lipid metabolism in the brain, while it is another interesting project studying how brain lipid metabolism (e.g. manipulating LD accumulation or lipid peroxidation) modulates neuronal activity, which however will require many efforts beyond the scope of this study. Manipulating LD or peroxidation would affect multiple cellular signaling pathways and physiological experimental conditions need to be developed. However, to address this reviewerâs questions, we performed preliminary studies with treating brain slices with the lipid peroxidation inhibitor a-TP and recorded PVH neurons, but did not observe differences in firing rates in a-TPtreated brain slices and controls (Data not shown).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2</bold>:</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>A set of relatively novel and interesting observations. Creative use of several in vivo sensors and techniques.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer so much for the positive comments on our studies in both concept and techniques.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The physiological relevance of lipolysis and thermogenesis genes in the PVH. The authors need to provide quantitative and substantial characterizations of lipid metabolism in the brain beyond a panel of qPCRs, especially considering these genes are likely expressed at very low levels. mRNA and protein level quantification of genes in Fig 1, in direct comparison to BAT/iWAT, should be provided. Besides bulk mRNA/protein, IHC/ISH-based characterization should be added to confirm to cellular expression of these genes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agreed with the Reviewerâs comments and thank this reviewer for the constructive suggestions. To address this reviewerâs comments and suggestions, we performed additional experiments to verify cold-induced expressions of lipid lipolytic genes and proteins. For example, we stained ATGL and HSL in both neurons and astrocytes in the PVH. Matching with the increased gene expressions, cold increased protein expressions of ATGL (new Figure 2) and HSL (new Figure 3) in both neurons and astrocytes. We also performed western blots of p-HSL and HSL and observed that cold increased the expression level of p-HSL (new Figure 4). These new results support our conclusions and further demonstrate that cold increases lipid metabolism in the PVH.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The fiberphotometry work they cited (Chen 2022, Andersen 2023, Sun 2018) used well-established, genetically encoded neuropeptide sensors (e.g., GRABs). The authors need to first quantitatively demonstrate that adapting BD-C11 and EnzCheck for in vivo brain FP could effectively and accurately report peroxidation and lipolysis. For example, the sensitivity, dynamic range, and off-time should all be calibrated with mass spectrometry measurements before any conclusions can be made based on plots in Figures 4, 5, and 6. This is particularly important because the main hypothesis heavily relies on this unvalidated technique.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this reviewerâs comments. Fiber photometry has been well demonstrated to detect fluorescent-labelled biomolecules in my laboratory and other labs, as indicated in the above stated publications. In this study, we combined photometry with the well commercially developed and validated lipid metabolic fluorescent-labelled biomarkers to monitor lipid metabolic dynamics in vivo. We indeed verified this approach in both brain (this study) and peripheral adipose tissues (another project). Particularly, our data in this study show that lipid peroxidation inhibitor a-TP blocked the cold-induced lipid peroxidation signals (Fig. 7A-C) and the pan-lipase inhibitor DEUP blocked the cold-induced lipolytic signals (Fig. 8A-C). These results demonstrate that the signals detected by photometry indeed reflect lipid peroxidation and lipolysis respectively in the brain. Meanwhile, we agreed with the reviewerâs suggestions on mass spectrometry measurements, while it is not feasible for us to perform the spectrometry in the brain in vivo at this moment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Generally, the histology data need significant improvement. It was not convincing, for example, in Figure 3, how the Fos+ neurons can be quantified based on the poor IF images where most red signals were not in the neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this reviewer for this comment. We performed additional experiments to add sample size and presented high quality images.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The hypothesis regarding the direct role of brain temperature in cold-induced lipid metabolism is puzzling. From the introduction and discussion, the authors seem to suggest that there are direct brain temperature changes in responses to cold, which could be quite striking. However, this was not supported by any data or experiments. The authors should consolidate their ideas and update a coherent hypothesis based on the actual data presented in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this reviewer for bringing up this comment and constructive suggestions. To make this study more concise on the cold-induced lipid metabolism, we removed the statements related to the brain temperature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>An additional minor weakness is that the authors are redundant in their discussion, sometimes repeating sections from the introduction (e.g. this line in the discussion &quot;Evidence shows that the brain's energy expenditure efficiency largely depends on the temperature (Yu et al., 2012), and temperature gradients between different brain regions exist (Anderson and Moser, 1995; Delgado and Hanai, 1966; Hayward and Baker, 1968; McElligott and Melzak, 1967; Moser and Mathiesen, 1996; Thornton, 2003)&quot;).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for these comments.
