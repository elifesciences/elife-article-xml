processing units that rely on voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Ca<sub>v</sub>) channels to trigger Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent neurotransmitter release. Ca<sub>v</sub> channels also play Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent roles in other biological contexts, but whether they do so in axon terminals is unknown. Here, we addressed this unknown with respect to the requirement for Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 L-type channels for the formation of rod photoreceptor synapses in the retina. Using a mouse strain expressing a non-conducting mutant form of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4, we report that the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 protein, but not its Ca<sup>2+</sup> conductance, is required for the molecular assembly of rod synapses; however, Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are needed for the appropriate recruitment of postsynaptic partners. Our results support a model in which presynaptic Ca<sub>v</sub> channels serve both as organizers of synaptic building blocks and as sources of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions in building the first synapse of the visual pathway and perhaps more broadly in the nervous system.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>photoreceptor</kwd><kwd>retina</kwd><kwd>calcium</kwd><kwd>synapse</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY 026817</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Amy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>McPherson Eye Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hoon</surname><given-names>Mrinalini</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001818</institution-id><institution>Research to Prevent Blindness</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hoon</surname><given-names>Mrinalini</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY 029953</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maddox</surname><given-names>J Wesley</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY 026477</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>Brittany</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY010843</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Artemyev</surname><given-names>Nikolai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY012682</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Artemyev</surname><given-names>Nikolai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Ca2+ influx through Cav1.4 channels is required for the structural, but not the molecular organization of the rod photoreceptor synapse.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>It is well established that the primary function of voltage-gated Ca<sub>v</sub> Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels within axon terminals is to serve as a conduit for Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions that trigger the fusion of neurotransmitter-laden vesicles with the presynaptic membrane (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dolphin and Lee, 2020</xref>). Mutations in genes encoding presynaptic Ca<sub>v</sub> channels cause neurological disorders such as epilepsy, migraine, and ataxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pietrobon, 2010</xref>). When studied in animal models, these mutations lead to aberrant synaptic transmission and alterations in network excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tottene et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eikermann-Haerter et al., 2011</xref>). Due to the steep Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependence of neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dodge and Rahamimoff, 1967</xref>), factors that modulate Ca<sub>v</sub> channel function can dramatically alter synaptic output. Thus, efforts to understand the pathophysiological consequences of disease-causing mutations have largely centered on how they affect biophysical parameters of channel opening, closing, or inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pietrobon, 2010</xref>).</p><p>However, Ca<sub>v</sub> channels are known to engage in pathways that do not involve their Ca<sup>2+</sup> conductance. For example, voltage-dependent changes in the conformation of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.1 channels, rather than the incoming Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, initiate skeletal muscle contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 1990</xref>). Despite its importance for understanding fundamental cell biological processes in health and disease, the prevalence of non-conducting roles of Ca<sub>v</sub> channels in neurons is poorly understood. Analyses of Ca<sub>v</sub> knockout (KO) mice have helped illuminate the physiological functions of Ca<sub>v</sub> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pietrobon, 2005</xref>), however, this approach does not distinguish between the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent contributions of these channels. Moreover, complex double and triple-KO approaches are needed given that most synapses in the nervous system utilize more than one Ca<sub>v</sub> subtype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dolphin and Lee, 2020</xref>).</p><p>To overcome these hurdles, we focused on the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 L-type channel, which is the predominant Ca<sub>v</sub> subtype in rod and cone photoreceptors in the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mansergh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). More than 140 mutations in the human <italic>CACNA1F</italic> gene encoding Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 have been identified, many of which cause heterogeneous forms of vision impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Waldner et al., 2018</xref>). The absence of photoreceptor synaptic responses in Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mice has been attributed to a requirement for Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 in the presynaptic release of glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mansergh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). However, an additional contributing factor is that photoreceptor synapses do not form in Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zabouri and Haverkamp, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Regus-Leidig et al., 2014</xref>). Does this developmental failure reflect a requirement for Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals or an alternative, non-conducting role for the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 protein in organizing the photoreceptor synapse? Here, we generated a mouse strain that expresses a non-conducting mutant form of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 to answer this question.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>Rod and cone photoreceptors communicate visual information via a triadic ‘ribbon’ synapse containing postsynaptic neurites of a depolarizing (ON) bipolar cell and two horizontal cells (HCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Masland, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The ribbon, an organelle that critically regulates the properties of glutamate release, is a morphological hallmark of this and other sensory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Matthews and Fuchs, 2010</xref>). During the first postnatal week in mice, ribbons develop from spherical precursors and are concentrated in the outer plexiform layer (OPL) where mature rod and cone synapses are localized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blanks et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Regus-Leidig et al., 2009</xref>). In Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mice, the development of these synapses appears stunted in that spheres, rather than ribbons, are present at all developmental ages and often found in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) that normally contains only photoreceptor somas. The terminals of rods and cones (i.e., spherules and pedicles, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mice are misshapen, and a number of proteins typical of mature synapses are absent or aberrantly localized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Raven et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zabouri and Haverkamp, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Regus-Leidig et al., 2014</xref>). If Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are needed for the assembly of photoreceptor synapses, then ribbons and key synaptic proteins should be lacking from photoreceptors of a mouse strain expressing a non-conducting mutant form of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4, just as in Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mice.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Characterization of G369i KI mouse strain to study the requirement of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in rod synaptogenesis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>), potential roles of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 in the assembly of rod synapses.

The mutation results in the insertion of a glycine residue into transmembrane segment 6 of domain I (G369i, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and prevents Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through the channel during membrane depolarizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baig et al., 2011</xref>). We determined if this mutation has a similar effect in Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 in electrophysiological recordings of transfected human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T). The wild-type (WT) and G369i mutant channels were co-expressed with β<sub>2</sub> and α<sub>2</sub>δ−4 subunits which are the major Ca<sub>v</sub> auxiliary subunits forming Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 complexes in photoreceptor synaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). G369i mutant channels were associated with the plasma membrane but did not mediate significant inward Ba<sup>2+</sup> currents (<italic>I<sub>Ba</sub></italic>) like WT channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To functionally verify that G369i mutant channels reached the cell-surface, we analyzed ON gating currents (<italic>I<sub>gating</sub></italic>), which result from the movement of charged voltage-sensing domains prior to channel opening. For this purpose, we utilized the α<sub>2</sub>δ−1 subunit which we find to produce larger current densities and better resolution of gating currents than with α<sub>2</sub>δ−4. Compared to robust peak <italic>I<sub>Ba</sub></italic> densities mediated by WT channels (−20.70 ± 5.31 pA/pF), those in cells transfected with G369i mutant channels were negligible (−1.14 ± 0.11 pA/pF, p=0.03) and not significantly different from that in cells transfected only with β<sub>2</sub> and α<sub>2</sub>δ−1 as negative controls (−0.56 ± 0.15 pA/pF, p=0.72, by Kruskal-Wallis test and post-hoc Dunn’s test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). <italic>I<sub>gating</sub></italic> was evident for both WT and G369i mutant channels, but not in the negative control cells. To estimate the number of channels with functional voltage-sensors in the membrane, we analyzed the time integral of <italic>I<sub>gating</sub></italic> evoked at the reversal potential (<italic>Q<sub>max</sub></italic>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wei et al., 1994</xref>]). When normalized to cell size, <italic>Q<sub>max</sub></italic> did not differ for WT (4.22 ± 1.34 fC/pF) and G369i mutant channels (3.22 ± 0.48 fC/pF, p=0.57 by unpaired t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Thus, G369i prevents Ca<sup>2+</sup> conductance but not cell-surface trafficking or voltage-sensor movements in Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4.</p><p>Armed with this knowledge, we incorporated the G369i mutation into Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 channels in vivo by genome editing in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). In agreement with our findings in the heterologous expression system, inward currents such as those measured in rods of WT mice, were not evident in those of the knock-in mouse strain (G369i KI). The absence of depolarization-evoked currents was similar in G369i KI mice and a mouse strain completely lacking Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 expression (Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). However, Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 protein was detected in retinal lysates of G369i KI mice by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Moreover, immunofluorescence corresponding to G369i mutant channels was abundant in the OPL, where photoreceptor synapses normally form, and juxtaposed near the ribbon as in WT mouse retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Therefore, while it does not mediate voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents, the G369i mutant channel is expressed and targeted appropriately in photoreceptors of G369i KI mice. Electroretinograms (ERGs) of dark-adapted G369i KI mice lacked b-waves at all but the highest light intensities, consistent with a disruption of rod synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). A-waves, which represent light-dependent hyperpolarization of photoreceptors, were not significantly different in WT and G369i KI mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Thus, G369i KI mice show defects in photoreceptor function that are largely restricted to synaptic terminals.</p><p>To define the contribution of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals to the organization of the photoreceptor synapse, we compared the molecular composition and structure of photoreceptor synapses in the retinas of WT, G369i KI, and Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO mice. We focused on rod terminals due to their simpler synaptic organization (i.e. one large, arc-shaped ribbon and a single type of postsynaptic bipolar cell) as compared to cones (i.e. multiple short ribbons and types of postsynaptic bipolar cells). Furthermore, rod synapses are more severely disrupted than cone synapses when the presynaptic abundance of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 is compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ball et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Katiyar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kerov et al., 2018</xref>).

We restricted analyses to CtBP2-labeled structures in rod spherules by excluding those in cone arrestin-labeled cone pedicles. The minimum ribbon length was arbitrarily set at 0.95 μm based on the absence of values higher than this in Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO retina. While shorter on average than in WT retina, arc-shaped ribbons were plentiful in the OPL of G369i retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>) and co-clustered with proteins characteristic of mature rod synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) such as PSD-95 and β-dystroglycan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Koulen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blank et al., 1997</xref>), which were undetectable in the OPL of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,G</xref>).

At the depolarized voltage of photoreceptors in darkness, Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4-dependent glutamate release activates a metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR6), which suppresses the activity of TRPM1-dependent channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shiells et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shen et al., 2009</xref>). Light-dependent hyperpolarization of photoreceptors reduces Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, which slows the rate of glutamate release, thus disinhibiting the postsynaptic conductance and enabling excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) that communicate light signals via the ON pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shiells et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In agreement with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Koike et al., 2010</xref>), mGluR6 was clustered postsynaptic to rod ribbons, and TRPM1 was situated at the tips of RBC dendrites in WT retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>). Although the subcellular distribution of the postsynaptic proteins was partially obscured by the diffuse pattern of TRPM1 labeling, arc-shaped ribbons in apposition to colocalized TRPM1 and mGluR6 could clearly be distinguished in G369i KI retina but not in Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>). To test if this signaling pathway was functional in RBCs of G369i KI mice, we used an agonist and antagonist of mGluR6 (L-AP4 and CPPG, respectively) to simulate light responses in RBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

To further analyze the seemingly normal organization of these synapses in the OPL and ONL, we performed 3-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of spherules in G369i KI retina via serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–G</xref>). Each of the four rod terminals sampled from G369i KI retina had a single ribbon that was anchored at the presynaptic membrane and was apposed to a triad of postsynaptic partners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F–G</xref>). However, several peculiarities were observed. First, three of the four spherules that were analyzed contained more than one ribbon, rather than the single ribbon characteristic of rod terminals in the WT mouse retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blanks et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–G</xref>). Second, some ribbons appeared club-shaped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Third, at least one of the extraneous ribbons was ‘floating’ rather than anchored near the presynaptic membrane. These alterations of ribbon architecture in G369i KI rod spherules resemble the types of ribbon plasticity caused by reductions in presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> in mouse rods due to light or Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Spiwoks-Becker et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dembla et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, the lack of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in G369i KI rods could have caused fragmentation of the anchored ribbon, leading to the appearance of additional short, floating ribbons.</p><p>A particularly prominent anomaly of the reconstructed spherules was an alteration in postsynaptic architecture. Normally, within the invagination of mouse rod spherules are two HC neurites and an intervening RBC neurite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Compared to HCs, the RBC neurite tip and the resident mGluR6 receptors are maintained relatively distant—hundreds of nanometers—from the release site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rao-Mirotznik et al., 1995</xref>). This complex organization is thought to be critical for controlling glutamate release volume and spillover dynamics, allowing for differential activation of distinct glutamate receptor populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Petralia et al., 2018</xref>). For spherules in the OPL as well as in the ONL of G369i KI retina, branching neurites of HCs and RBCs formed non-invaginating triadic contacts close to the anchored presynaptic ribbon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F,G</xref>), rather than invading rod spherules as in WT retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Nevertheless, immunolabeling for mGluR6 remained clustered near ribbons in G369i KI retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that pre and postsynaptic apposition is maintained even in the absence of the normal spacing between RBC tips and the release sites. In agreement with these findings, mGluR6 labeling was significantly closer to that for ribbons in G369i KI than in WT retina as revealed by nearest-neighbor analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, while dispensable for postsynaptic partner selection at rod synapses, Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are required for the invaginating arrangement of the corresponding neurites within the rod spherule and their proximity to release sites.</p><p>Like other presynaptic Ca<sub>v</sub> channels, Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 is expected to interact directly or indirectly with a diverse array of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dolphin and Lee, 2020</xref>), some of which are required for ribbon formation in photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">tom Dieck et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kiyonaka et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 complex could act as a central scaffold for protein interactions that drive the assembly of the ribbon and associated components of the active zone. Alternatively, but not mutually exclusively, voltage-dependent conformational changes in the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 protein, which are intact in G369i mutant channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), could be involved. For example, Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 could conformationally couple to intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> release channels, as Ca<sub>v</sub>1.1 does in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 1990</xref>), which could represent a Ca<sup>2+</sup> source that aids presynaptic development.</p><p>A limitation of our study is that the mutant G369i channel was expressed in all retinal cell-types that normally express Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4. In addition to photoreceptors, Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 appears to be expressed in bipolar cells and at much lower levels in other cell-types in mouse retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yan et al., 2020</xref>). Because we find specific immunoreactivity for Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 in the outer retina to be limited to photoreceptor terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu et al., 2013</xref>), we favor the interpretation that Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 protein is not present to any large extent within bipolar cell soma or dendrites and that the postsynaptic structural defects of G369i KI rod synapses result primarily from the absence of presynaptic Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in rods. In addition to supporting glutamatergic transmission, presynaptic Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals could strengthen trans-synaptic signaling via cell-adhesion molecules such as NGL-2 in HCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Soto et al., 2013</xref>) and ELFN1 and pikachurin in RBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sato et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), which collectively enable the invagination of the corresponding neurites into the rod terminal. Considering that rod ribbons are shorter in G369i KI than in WT retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals may also regulate the activities of Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitive proteins such as GCAP2, which binds to Ribeye and controls ribbon stability in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schmitz, 2014</xref>).</p><p>There are notable parallels and distinctions in the rod phenotypes of G369i KI mice and those lacking expression of either of the auxiliary subunits of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4, β<sub>2</sub> or α<sub>2</sub>δ−4. Ca<sub>v</sub>β and α<sub>2</sub>δ subunits are known to facilitate the forward trafficking and maintenance of Ca<sub>v</sub> channels in the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dolphin and Lee, 2020</xref>). Thus, it is not surprising that β<sub>2</sub> KO and α<sub>2</sub>δ−4 KO mice exhibit severely diminished Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, and similar to G369i KI mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1G–I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A–C</xref>), there is evidence for a loss of rod synaptic transmission in ERGs, and significant sprouting of postsynaptic RBCs and HCs into the ONL in these mouse strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ball et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Katiyar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kerov et al., 2018</xref>). However, a striking difference is that ribbons and other aspects of the presynaptic complex are preserved in G369i KI but not in β<sub>2</sub> KO or α<sub>2</sub>δ−4 KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ball et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Katiyar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kerov et al., 2018</xref>). Because we find significant levels of the mutant Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 protein within rod terminals of G369i KI mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>), which is not the case in β<sub>2</sub> KO or α<sub>2</sub>δ−4 KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ball et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Katiyar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kerov et al., 2018</xref>), we propose that a minimal complement of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 channels is needed to enable ribbon morphogenesis.</p><p>How synapses achieve their diverse forms and functions remains a fundamental question in neuroscience. Current evidence indicates that most synapses are assembled by intrinsic programs involving a variety of scaffolding proteins and cell-adhesion molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kurshan and Shen, 2019</xref>), with ensuing patterns of neurotransmitter release needed primarily to instruct further refinements in synapse morphology and connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sando et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sigler et al., 2017</xref>).

Ca<sub>V</sub>1.4 knockout mice have presynaptic and postsynaptic morphological abnormalities in the retina that had previously been described. This manuscript reports the use of a knock in mouse model to disambiguate the effects of the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel from those of calcium itself on synapse structure in the OPL. To do so, the authors make use of a KI mouse where the WT Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 channel is replaced by a channel with a point mutation that renders it unable to conduct calcium. Interestingly, the authors find a small change in the size of and relatively moderate disorganization of presynaptic structures in the KI mouse model, more significant disruptions were observed in postsynaptic cells. The authors conclude that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel protein is needed for proper formation and maintenance of the pre-synaptic structure, but calcium entry through channels are necessary for proper recruitment of post-synaptic partners. Overall, the results are novel and the conclusion is well supported by the data.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) The experiments in this paper focused on the synapses in rods. In WT, rod ribbons are easily distinguishable from cone ribbons based on size and shape. In the KI model, rod ribbons become smaller and one cannot assume that they will maintain their normal shape. Indeed, the authors describe multiple ribbons (some misshapen) in some rods in EM. Is the assumption that all spots are rod ribbons in the KO and KI, but only the crescent shaped ones are rod ribbons in the WT? If some are mis-assigned, how might this affect the quantification of the effects on ribbon size. If they can't be convincingly distinguished, then wouldn't it be fairer comparison to analyze all ribbons in the OPL regardless of genotype?</p><p>2) If there is a reliable way to distinguish rod ribbons from cone ribbons, there seems to be a missed opportunity here to look at effects on cone ribbons and their post-synaptic partners, at least at the level of IHC.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript by Maddox et al. presents a study of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 in retinal synapse development. The central issue addressed is differentiating the signaling / organizational role(s) of the channel protein from those of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through the channel during retinal rod photoreceptor synapse development. The authors generated a non-conducting channel (G369i KI) that appears to be trafficked normally to synapses and assessed differences between G369i mutants, Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO, and wild-type animals. They found substantial differences between G369i mutants and Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 KO retinas, with the G369i mutant more closely resembling the wild-type.

As illustrated in Figure 3, the postsynaptic rod bipolar cells do appear to have developed mGluR6-mediated signaling cascades, but the authors' interpretation of the result, that the postsynaptic signaling can develop in the complete absence of presynaptic glutamate release, is not supported by the data presented. As well, the efficiency of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-exocytosis coupling at the rod presynapse is incredibly high, and it is worth noting that Ca<sup>2+</sup> from sources other than voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels could give rise to enough glutamate release to modulate synapse development.</p><p>With regard to the pre- and postsynaptic organization of the synapse, as illustrated in Figure 4: it seems a bit counterintuitive to me that the absence of an invaginating synapse would result in a closer apposition of ribeye and mGluR6 proteins, given that mGluR6 normally is located at the dendritic tips inserted in the very center of the invagination. The authors should clarify their explanation of this observation. As well, it is worth commenting that the authors addressed the integrity of the presynaptic active zone by visualizing ribeye and bassoon proteins using fluorescence immunohistochemistry, but neither protein-to my knowledge-interacts directly with Cavs. Is there a reason that the authors did not examine Rim / RimBP or CAST/ELKS expression as an assay of active zone organization?

To perform this study, the authors created knockin mice that express a non-conducting form of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.4.

A key detail relevant to the reviewer’s concern is that we restricted our analyses to rod ribbons using double-labeling with cone-arrestin antibodies to generate 3-D binary masks in order to eliminate the confounding influence of the shorter ribbons that characterize cone terminals. We then used a Matlab-based routine (ObjectFinder) to determine the lengths along the major axis all Ctbp2-labeled structures in the portion of the OPL. Because this was done in confocal z-stacks with more than 30 optical sections (voxel size of 0.09 𝜇𝑚 × 0.09 𝜇𝑚 × 0.2 𝜇𝑚 (𝑋 × 𝑌 × 𝑍)), we were able to capture the full-dimensions of each Ctbp2-labeled structure. Thus, we are confident that we are not mistaking cone ribbons for rod ribbons in the KO or KI, and that our approach allowed us to quantitate differences in the distribution of ribbons and spheres specifically in rod terminals of the 3 genotypes. We have added more details regarding ribbon analysis to the Materials and methods section and Results and Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) If there is a reliable way to distinguish rod ribbons from cone ribbons, there seems to be a missed opportunity here to look at effects on cone ribbons and their post-synaptic partners, at least at the level of IHC.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an important future direction, but a bit more complicated to address given the diversity of cone bipolar cells and types of synaptic contacts that cones make with them.

We added this text to the Discussion:</p><p>“Like other presynaptic Ca<sub>v</sub> channels, Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 is expected to interact directly or indirectly with a diverse array of proteins (Dolphin and Lee, 2020), some of which are required for ribbon formation in photoreceptors (tom Dieck et al., 2005; Kiyonaka et al., 2012). Thus, the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 complex could act as a central scaffold for protein interactions that drive the assembly of the ribbon and associated components of the active zone. Alternatively, but not mutually exclusively, voltagedependent conformational changes in the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 protein, which are intact in G369i mutant channels (Figure 1C), could trigger signaling pathways that promote synapse maturation. For example, Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 could conformationally couple to intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> release channels, as Ca<sub>v</sub>1.1 does in skeletal muscle (Adams <italic>et al.</italic>, 1990), which could represent a Ca<sup>2+</sup> source needed for synapse development.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>With regard to the pre- and postsynaptic organization of the synapse, as illustrated in Figure 4: it seems a bit counterintuitive to me that the absence of an invaginating synapse would result in a closer apposition of ribeye and mGluR6 proteins, given that mGluR6 normally is located at the dendritic tips inserted in the very center of the invagination. The authors should clarify their explanation of this observation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the text accordingly:</p><p>“A particularly prominent anomaly of the reconstructed spherules was an alteration in postsynaptic architecture. Normally, within the invagination of mouse rod spherules are two HC neurites and an intervening RBC neurite (Figure 4E). Compared to HCs, the RBC neurite tip and the resident mGluR6 receptors are maintained relatively distant—hundreds of nanometers—from the release site (Rao-Mirotznik <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995). This complex organization is thought to be critical for controlling glutamate release volume and spillover dynamics, allowing for differential activation of distinct glutamate receptor populations (Petralia et al., 2018). For spherules in the OPL as well as in the ONL of G369i KI retina, branching neurites of HCs and RBCs formed non-invaginating triadic contacts close to the anchored presynaptic ribbon (Figure 4F,G), rather than invading rod spherules as in WT retina (Figure 4E). Nevertheless, immunolabeling for mGluR6 remained clustered near ribbons in G369i KI retina (Figure 4C), suggesting that pre- and post-synaptic apposition is maintained even in the absence of the normal spacing between RBC tips and the release sites. In agreement with these findings, mGluR6 labeling was significantly closer to that for ribbons in G369i KI than in WT retina as revealed by nearest-neighbor analyses (Figure 4—figure supplement 2). Thus, while dispensable for postsynaptic partner selection at rod synapses, Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are required for the invaginating arrangement of the corresponding neurites within the rod spherule and their proximity to release sites.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As well, it is worth commenting that the authors addressed the integrity of the presynaptic active zone by visualizing ribeye and bassoon proteins using fluorescence immunohistochemistry, but neither protein-to my knowledge-interacts directly with Cavs. Is there a reason that the authors did not examine Rim / RimBP or CAST/ELKS expression as an assay of active zone organization?

Similar detailed studies of this mutation in Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 are complicated by the notoriously low current amplitudes produced upon transfection of this channel, relative to other Ca<sub>v</sub> channels, in HEK293T cells. However, we have added experiments showing that gating currents, which represent voltage-sensor movements, are relatively normal in G369i mutant channels (Figure 1C).
