non-membrane bound cellular compartments that contain RNA and RNA binding proteins. The molecular mechanisms that regulate the spatial distribution of RNA granules in cells are poorly understood. During polarization of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> zygote, germline RNA granules, called P granules, assemble preferentially in the posterior cytoplasm. We present evidence that P granule asymmetry depends on RNA-induced phase separation of the granule scaffold MEG-3. MEG-3 is an intrinsically disordered protein that binds and phase separates with RNA in vitro. In vivo, MEG-3 forms a posterior-rich concentration gradient that is anti-correlated with a gradient in the RNA-binding protein MEX-5. MEX-5 is necessary and sufficient to suppress MEG-3 granule formation in vivo, and suppresses RNA-induced MEG-3 phase separation in vitro. Our findings suggest that MEX-5 interferes with MEG-3’s access to RNA, thus locally suppressing MEG-3 phase separation to drive P granule asymmetry. Regulated access to RNA, combined with RNA-induced phase separation of key scaffolding proteins, may be a general mechanism for controlling the formation of RNA granules in space and time.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21337.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21337.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21337.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Animal cells contain many smaller compartments known as organelles that perform particular roles. For example, a compartment called the nucleus stores most of the cell’s genetic information. The nucleus and many other organelles form inside layers of membrane that physically separate them from the rest of the cell. However, some organelles, such as the germ granule, do not have a membrane. It is thought that these organelles may form in the same way that oil droplets tend to come together when mixed with water. However, oil droplets form in water spontaneously and do not fall apart, so it is not clear how cells could control the assembly and destruction of such organelles.</p><p>The germ granules inside the cells of a worm called <italic>C. elegans</italic> are destroyed and reassembled in cycles. Smith et al. investigated how the worm cells control these cycles. The experiments show that a protein called MEG-3 is required to allow the components of granules to transition from behaving like individual molecules dissolved in water (similar to being dissolved in cell fluid) to assembling into droplets. When MEG-3 is mixed with molecules of ribonucleic acid (RNA) it can bind very tightly to the RNA and then separate out from the rest of the fluid to form distinct droplets.</p><p>Smith et al. also show that another protein called MEX-5 can destroy these droplets by attaching itself to RNA in place of MEG-3, which causes MEG-3 to dissolve back into the rest of the fluid. The physical properties of the MEG-3 droplets are still not known and so the next step following on from this work will be to find out whether germ granules behave like liquids, gels or hard solids.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21337.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21337.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>RNA granules</kwd><kwd>P granules</kwd><kwd>phase separation</kwd><kwd>MEX-5</kwd><kwd>MEG-3</kwd><kwd>germline</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HD37047</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Calidas</surname><given-names>Deepika</given-names></name><name><surname>Schmidt</surname><given-names>Helen</given-names></name><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Tu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Seydoux</surname><given-names>Geraldine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A competition for RNA drives the localized assembly of RNA granules in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>RNA granules are concentrated assemblies of RNA and RNA-binding proteins that form without a limiting membrane in the cytoplasm or nucleoplasm of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Courchaine, 2016</xref>). RNA granules are ubiquitous cellular structures and several classes of cytoplasmic RNA granules have been described, including stress granules, P bodies, neuronal granules and germ granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson and Kedersha, 2006</xref>). Cytoplasmic RNA granule components typically exchange rapidly between a highly concentrated pool in the granule and a more diffuse, less concentrated pool in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Weber and Brangwynne, 2012</xref>). In addition to RNA-binding domains, proteins in RNA granules often contain prion-like, low complexity, or intrinsically-disordered regions (IDRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Courchaine, 2016</xref>). In concentrated solutions, IDRs spontaneously de-mix from the aqueous solvent to form liquid droplets (liquid-liquid phase separation or LLPS) or hydrogels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Weber and Brangwynne, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Elbaum-Garfinkle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo and Shorter, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nott et al., 2015</xref>). Like RNA granules in vivo, proteins in LLPS droplets and hydrogels exchange with the solvent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kato et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Elbaum-Garfinkle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lin et al., 2015</xref>). These findings have suggested that LLPS or reversible gelation drives the assembly of RNA granules in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo and Shorter, 2015</xref>).</p><p>In cells, RNA granule assembly is regulated in space and time. For example, stress granules assemble within seconds of exposure to toxic stimulants that require the temporary removal of mRNAs from the translational pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson and Kedersha, 2006</xref>). In eggs, germ granules assemble in the germ plasm, a specialized area of the cytoplasm that is partitioned to the nascent germline during the first embryonic cleavages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Voronina et al., 2011</xref>). How phase separation, a spontaneous process in vitro, is regulated in vivo to ensure that RNA granules form at the correct place and time is not well understood.</p><p>The germ (P) granules of <italic>C. elegans</italic> are an excellent model to study the mechanisms that regulate granule assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Updike and Strome, 2010</xref>). For most of development, P granules are stable perinuclear structures, but in the transition from oocyte-to-embryo, P granules detach from the nucleus and become highly dynamic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pitt et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). As the oocyte is ovulated in the spermatheca, P granules disassemble and release their components in the cytoplasm. After fertilization, P granule proteins reassemble into dynamic granules that undergo repeated cycles of assembly and disassembly in synchrony with cell division. Live imaging in the 1-cell zygote has revealed that these cycles are spatially patterned along the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo: granule assembly is favored in the posterior and granule disassembly is favored in the anterior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brangwynne et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gallo et al., 2010</xref>). By the first mitosis, P granules are found exclusively in the posterior cytoplasm together with other germ plasm components. As a result, P granules are segregated to the posterior germline blastomere P<sub>1</sub> and excluded from the anterior somatic blastomere AB.</p><p>P granule asymmetry is under the control of the PAR polarity network which divides the zygote into distinct anterior and posterior domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Motegi and Seydoux, 2013</xref>). The PAR-1 kinase is enriched in the posterior cytoplasm and restricts the RNA-binding protein MEX-5 (and its redundant homolog MEX-6) to the anterior cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Griffin et al., 2011</xref>). MEX-5 and MEX-6 in turn restrict P granules to the posterior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schubert et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gallo et al., 2010</xref>). In <italic>mex-5 mex-6</italic> double mutants, P granule still undergo cycles of assembly and disassembly but these are no longer patterned along the anterior-posterior axis, and small granules remain throughout the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gallo et al., 2010</xref>). An attractive hypothesis is that MEX-5 blocks phase separation of P granule components in the anterior cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brangwynne et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). The mechanism of MEX-5 action and the critical P granule component(s) regulated by MEX-5, however, are not known.</p><p>P granule assembly in zygotes requires several P granule proteins, including the RNA-binding protein PGL-1 (and its redundant paralog PGL-3) and the intrinsically-disordered protein MEG-3 (and its redundant paralog MEG-4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hanazawa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). PGL-1 and PGL-3 are RGG domain proteins that self-associate and recruit other RNA-binding proteins to the granules, including the GLH family of RNA helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Updike and Strome, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hanazawa et al., 2011</xref>). MEG-3 and MEG-4 are redundant, serine-rich proteins that bind to PGL-1 in vitro and are essential for P granule assembly in embryos. In zygotes lacking <italic>meg-3</italic> and <italic>meg-4</italic>, PGL-1 and GLH-2 form transient assemblies that do not segregate asymmetrically and are not maintained in later stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Phosphorylation of MEG-3 by the DYRK kinase MBK-2 promotes granule disassembly in zygotes, but the mechanism that favors disassembly specifically in the anterior cytoplasm is not known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). In this study, we use a combination of in vivo and in vitro experiments to examine the contribution of the MEX, MEG, and PGL proteins to P granule assembly and asymmetry. We show that MEG-3/4, but not PGL-1/3, are essential for granule assembly and asymmetry, and that MEX-5 localizes MEG-3 in a posterior-rich gradient. We demonstrate that MEG-3 is an RNA-binding protein that is stimulated by RNA to undergo phase separation. MEX-5 is sufficient to block MEG-3 phase separation in vitro and to block MEG-3 granule formation in vivo. Our findings are consistent with a model whereby MEX-5 antagonizes MEG-3’s access to RNA to inhibit MEG-3 condensation in the anterior cytoplasm.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Hierarchical regulation of P granule assembly</title><p>To determine the genetic hierarchy that controls granule asymmetry, we first compared the distributions of MEX-5, MEG-3, PGL-1 and GLH-1 during the earliest stages of zygote polarization. We monitored MEX-5, MEG-3 and GLH-1 localization using tagged alleles generated by genome editing (Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> ) and PGL-1 localization using a polyclonal antibody that recognizes PGL-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Strome and Wood, 1983</xref>).</p><p>Before polarization, MEX-5, MEG-3, PGL-1 and GLH-1 were all distributed evenly throughout the cytoplasm. MEX-5 appeared mostly diffuse in the cytoplasm with a few foci, whereas MEG-3, PGL-1, and GLH-1 appeared both diffuse and enriched in many small (&lt;1 micron diameter) foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). During polarization (pronuclear formation and migration), MEX-5 and MEG-3 began to redistribute into opposing cytoplasmic gradients along the long axis of the zygote (anterior-posterior axis) with MEG-3 beginning to form large (~1 micron) granules in the posterior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Total levels of MEG-3 do not change during this period, consistent with redistribution of existing MEG-3 protein from anterior to posterior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast to MEX-5 and MEG-3, PGL-1 and GLH-1 remained uniformly distributed during polarization. After polarization (mitosis), all proteins were localized, with MEX-5 in the anterior cytoplasm and MEG-3, PGL-1 and GLH-1 in large granules in the posterior cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21337.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Localization of P granule proteins during zygote polarization.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Photomicrographs of live wild-type (mCherry::MEX-5 and GLH-1::eGFP) or fixed <italic>meg-4</italic> zygotes (MEG::3 OLLAS and PGL-1) at three different stages: before polarization (pronuclear formation), during polarization (pronuclear migration) and after polarization (mitosis). <italic>meg-4(ax3052)</italic> zygotes were co-immunostained for MEG-3::OLLAS (anti-OLLAS, Novus Biological), and PGL-1 (K76, DSHB). <italic>meg-</italic>4 is required redundantly with <italic>meg-3</italic> for P granule assembly, and each is sufficient to support localized granule assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2014</xref>).

MEX-5 interferes with MEG-3 access to RNA in the anterior, which promotes MEG-3 phase separation in the posterior where MEX-5 concentration is low.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>MEG-3 is an RNA-binding protein that is stimulated by RNA to phase separate</title><p>MEG-3 contains a long N-terminal IDR but no recognizable RNA-binding domain. We have found that MEG-3 binds RNA (poly-U30) with nanomolar affinity in vitro (K<sub>d,app</sub> = 32 nm). The MEG-3<sub>IDR</sub> is essential for binding, but on its own binds with lower affinity (K<sub>d,app</sub> = 460 nm). One possibility is that the MEG-3 IDR extends beyond the region predicted by IUPRED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dosztányi et al., 2005</xref>). The region immediately C-terminal scores close to the IUPRED cut-off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2014</xref>), and may contribute to RNA binding. IDRs are over-represented among RNA-binding domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Varadi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Castello et al., 2016</xref>). Electrostatic interactions between positively-charged amino acids and the negatively-charged RNA backbone are often invoked as a possible mechanism for RNA binding by IDRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo and Shorter, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basu and Bahadur, 2016</xref>). MEG-3 is rich in basic residues, but shows a strong preference for poly-U over poly-C and poly-G, suggesting that non-charged interactions are also involved.</p><p>Several recent studies have demonstrated that RNA-binding proteins containing IDRs phase separate in aqueous solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo and Shorter, 2015</xref>). MEG-3 follows this paradigm: MEG-3 readily formed condensates within minutes of dilution from urea to an aqueous buffer (150 mM NaCl). MEG-3 phase separation could be stimulated by RNA: addition of poly-U30 to the phase separation buffer increased the number of MEG-3 condensates especially at 1 μM and lower protein concentrations. MEG-3<sub>IDR</sub> behaved similarly to full-length MEG-3, except that MEG-3<sub>IDR</sub> required higher concentrations of RNA to phase separate at low protein concentrations. Consistent with this in vitro behavior, MEG-3<sub>IDR</sub> did not form large granules in wild-type zygotes, but could be induced to do so in zygotes defective in mRNA deadenylation and turnover (RNAi depletion of the LET-711/NOT1). These observations suggest that the IDR confers on MEG-3 an intrinsic tendency for phase separation that is tunable by RNA. RNA-induced phase separation has also been observed for Whi3, a fungal RNA-binding protein, and for hnRNPA1, a stress granule protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). In these proteins, the IDR and RNA-binding domain are distinct and RNA-induced phase separation requires both domains. It will be interesting to determine whether the MEG-3<sub>IDR</sub> in fact contains separable domains for phase separation and RNA binding.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>MEX-5 patterns MEG-3 by limiting access to RNA</title><p>MEX-5 has been hypothesized to regulate P granule asymmetry by creating a supersaturation gradient of critical granule component(s) along the anterior-posterior axis of the zygote (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). Our observations suggest that the critical component regulated by MEX-5 is RNA. MEX-5 binds RNA with nanomolar affinity (K<sub>d,app</sub>= ~ 29 nM, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pagano et al., 2007</xref>) and is 10-fold more abundant than MEG-3 in embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In our in vitro phase separation assay, the MEX-5 RNA-binding domain was sufficient to inhibit RNA-induced phase separation of MEG-3. Similarly, in vivo, uniform MEX-5 was sufficient to inhibit MEG-3 granule assembly throughout the cytoplasm and this activity was disrupted by mutations that lower MEX-5’s affinity for RNA. Together, these results support a model where MEX-5 suppresses MEG-3 phase separation by limiting MEG-3’s access to RNA.</p><p>How MEX-5 regulates MEG-3’s access to RNA in vivo remains to be determined. As suggested by the in vitro observations, MEX-5 could compete directly with MEG-3 for RNA binding. Alternatively, MEX-5 could function indirectly by recruiting factors to MEG-3/RNA complexes that reduce MEG-3’s affinity for RNA. The MEX-5 gradient arises as a consequence of phosphorylation by the posteriorly-enriched kinase PAR-1, which decreases the size of MEX-5 complexes and increases MEX-5’s diffusion rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Griffin et al., 2011</xref>). One possibility is that phosphorylation by PAR-1 prevents MEX-5 from binding RNA creating a pool of ‘MEX-5-free’ RNA available to phase separate with MEG-3 in the posterior cytoplasm.</p><p>While MEX-5 was sufficient to inhibit the RNA-induced phase separation of MEG-3 in vitro, it was not able to reverse it. Addition of MEX-5 to preformed MEG-3 condensates was not sufficient to dissolve them (data not shown). In contrast, in vivo, MEG-3 granules dissolve in the anterior cytoplasm as MEX-5 concentration increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We showed previously that, in vivo, P granule dynamics are also regulated by phosphorylation. The MBK-2 kinase and the PP2A phosphatase promote granule disassembly and assembly, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). One possibility is that cycles of MEG phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation promote cycles of granule disassembly and re-assembly throughout the cytoplasm. By limiting RNA access, MEX-5 inhibits the re-assembly of MEG-3 condensates in the anterior cytoplasm freeing more MEG-3 for granule assembly in the posterior cytoplasm.</p><p>MEX-5’s high affinity for poly-U stretches, which are present in 91% of <italic>C. elegans</italic> 3’ UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pagano et al., 2007</xref>), suggests that MEX-5 interacts with most mRNAs in zygotes and thus could function as a general ‘mRNA sink’. Consistent with this view, the MEX-5 gradient patterns the distribution of three other RNA-binding proteins that, like MEG-3, form posterior-rich gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). The observation that blocking mRNA turnover stimulates MEG-3 coalescence into macroscopic granules is consistent with the idea that the mRNA pool accessible to MEG-3 is limiting in zygotes. A limiting mRNA pool has also been suggested to regulate the balance of P bodies and stress granules in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buchan and Parker, 2009</xref>). We propose that regulated access to mRNAs, combined with RNA-induced phase separation of key scaffolding proteins, may be a general mechanism for controlling the formation of RNA granules in space and time.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>MEG-3 and MEG-4 scaffold P granules in zygotes</title><p>A recent theoretical study has suggested that MEX-5 patterns P granules by regulating the phase separation of a different P granule protein: PGL-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Saha et al., 2016</xref>). This model is based on the assumption that PGL-3 is essential to assemble P granules and on three in vitro observations: (1) PGL-3 binds RNA using a C-terminal RGG domain, (2) RNA-binding via the RGG domain stimulates phase separation of PGL-3 and (3) MEX-5 can interfere with the formation of PGL-3/RNA condensates. Using estimates for the in vivo concentrations and diffusion rates of PGL-3, MEX-5 and RNA, Saha et al. built a mathematical model that simulates a competition for RNA between MEX-5 and PGL-3. In the simulation, introduction of the MEX-5 gradient is sufficient to dissolve PGL-3 granules in the anterior cytoplasm. This model is inconsistent with several in vivo observations. First, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hanazawa et al. (2011)</xref> have reported that PGL-3 lacking the RGG domain still forms asymmetric granules in zygotes. Second, the formation of the MEX-5 gradient does not correlate temporally with, and is not sufficient for, PGL-3 asymmetry in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Third, PGL-3 and its paralog PGL-1 are not required to assemble or localize MEG granules in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The in vivo data demonstrate that, contrary to the model proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Saha et al. (2016)</xref>, PGL-3 does not require RNA binding to localize to the granules, does not sense the MEX-5 gradient directly, and does not drive granule assembly or asymmetry. The in vivo data indicate instead that MEG-3/4 are responsible for P granule asymmetry and recruitment of PGL-3 to P granules. In vitro, MEG-3 binds to PGL-1 and PGL-1 binds to PGL-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hanazawa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2014</xref>), raising the possibility that the MEGs recruit the PGLs by direct protein-protein interactions. We showed previously that MEG-3 overlaps but does not co-localize perfectly with PGL-3 in P granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Formation of stable PGL assemblies in embryos also requires LAF-1, a DEAD-box RNA helicase that phase separates in vitro independently of RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Elbaum-Garfinkle et al., 2015</xref>). P granules therefore appear to comprise multiple phases, each with distinct properties and components that have an affinity for one another but do not fully mix. We suggest that MEG-3 and MEG-4 form the main RNA-dependent phase of P granules. The MEG phase functions as a scaffold that recruits other P granule components to build multi-phasic assemblies. An important question will be to determine the physical and biochemical properties of the MEG phase. The conclusion that P granules are liquid droplets was based mostly on observations of the PGL phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brangwynne et al., 2009</xref>). Whether the MEG phase is also liquid or is a more ordered gel-like or solid condensate remains to be determined. How the MEG scaffold specifies the unique RNA/protein composition of P granules will be an exciting area for future inquiry.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>CRISPR genome editing</title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> was cultured according to standard methods at 20°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brenner, 1974</xref>).

Previous work has shown that a series of asymmetric protein gradients are established after fertilization, culminating in the anterior enrichment of an RNA-binding protein called MEX-5 in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> zygote prior to mitosis. MEX-5 is necessary to block phase separation of P granules, but posterior MEX-5 is destabilized so P granules phase separate and segregate with the nascent germline. P granules consist of a heterogeneous mix of MEG, PGL, and GLH proteins (among other things), but the link between MEX-5 and P-granule proteins was unknown. Recently, a separate group (Saha, et al. Cell 2016) reconstituted P granule-like droplets in vitro, demonstrated that competition between PGL-3 and MEX-5 for mRNA can regulate droplet formation, and used theory to show that a MEX-5 gradient can drive PGL-3 and P-granule assembly in vivo. Smith et al. complement the findings of Saha et al., confirming that MEX-5 does act as an RNA sink to prevent phase separation, but in contrast they also demonstrate that the mRNA binding competition in the zygote is between MEX-5 and MEG-3 instead of MEX-5 and PGL-3. These findings make a significant contribution to what drives phase separation and P-granule assembly in the cytoplasm.</p><p>1) The findings in this paper are a significant departure from the conclusions this same group published two years ago in <italic>eLife</italic> showing that MEG-3 is a substrate of the kinase MBK-2 and the phosphatase PPTR-1/2 (Wang, et al.).

Nomenclature and labels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> need improved to better sync with the text.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript by Smith et al. 2016, the nature of RNA dependent phase separation in relation to P granules in the early <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo is studied. Recent work by these authors demonstrated that a group of intrinsically disordered, serine-rich proteins (specifically the MEG proteins) regulates the dynamics of P granule assembly and disassembly. Here, with a combination of in vivo and in vitro work, the authors describe a model in which RNA binding competition between MEX-5 and MEG-3 results in P granule asymmetry. in vivo, the authors first show the opposing localization patterns of MEX-5 and MEG-3, and through mutational studies show that MEX-5 gradients drive MEG-3 granule asymmetry. in vitro, the authors show that purified MEG-3 (and its disordered region) can phase separate, and that this phase separation is greatly enhanced by addition of RNA through MEG-3 RNA binding. Finally, it is shown that addition of MEX-5 in vitro inhibits phase separation of MEG-3. These findings dovetail nicely with recent work showing a similar phenomenon with MEX-5 and PGL-3 (Saha et al. 2016). Overall, this study provides a clear and logical presentation of experimental work to support the majority of its conclusions, and I fully support its publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Spatial patterning of P granules by RNA-induced phase separation of the intrinsically-disordered protein MEG-3&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

In particular, in vitro Pgl proteins can phase separate and recruit other granule components but apparently in vivo granule formation depends on Meg3/4. Can this be related to a functional significance for germ line development?</italic> </p><p>We have now included a more complete discussion of the Hyman paper in the Discussion. The Hyman paper is a theoretical study that makes several predictions that are not consistent with in vivo observations. For example, the Hyman model predicts that the RNA binding domain of PGL-3 is essential for PGL-3 to form granules in the posterior cytoplasm in response to MEX-5. In fact, Hanazawa et al., showed in 2011 that PGL-3 lacking its RNA binding domain still forms posterior granules in vivo. The Hyman model also predicts that PGL-3 responds directly to the MEX-5 gradient. In fact, we find that PGL-3 asymmetry requires <italic>meg-3/4</italic> and does not correlate temporally with the MEX-5 gradient. Finally, the Hyman model assumes that PGL-3 is the driver of P granule asymmetry. In fact, neither PGL-3 (nor its paralog PGL-1) are required for P granule asymmetry: zygotes lacking PGL-1 and PGL-3 still assemble MEG granules in the posterior. Future genetic studies will be needed to compare the different contributions of MEG and PGL proteins to germline development, but with respect to P granule asymmetry in zygotes, the MEG proteins are the drivers.</p><p><italic>3) The findings in this paper are a significant departure from the conclusions this same group published two years ago in eLife showing that MEG-3 is a substrate of the kinase MBK-2 and the phosphatase PPTR-1/2 (Wang, et al.). In the Wang study, phosphorylation of MEG-3 by MBK-2 in the anterior of the C. elegans zygote promoted P-granule disassembly, while dephosphorylation by PPTR-1/2 promoted P-granule assembly. Attempts to reconcile these findings with the new discovery that asymmetric MEG-3 distribution and assembly now depends on an mRNA-binding competition with MEX-5 need to be included.</italic> </p><p>The Wang et al. paper showed that assembly/disassembly of P granules requires the activities of MBK-2 and PPTR-1/2. That study, however, did not claim that these regulators function in a spatially-restricted manner. In fact, in the Discussion section of Wang et al., we discussed the possibility that MBK-2/PPTR-1/2 act only <italic>permissively</italic> to stimulate granule assembly/disassembly throughout the cytoplasm and that MEX-5 is responsible for the patterning. We now clarify this point in the Introduction.</p><p><italic>4) A central argument that distinguishes this paper from Saha et al. is that MEX-5 drives P-granule disassembly through MEG-3 instead of PGLs. Two findings support this. The first is that posterior enrichment of MEG-3::OLLAS is observed before posterior enrichment of PGL-1. PGL-3 is not examined and should be as the Saha et al. paper showed a specific PGL-3 response. There are available PGL-3 antibodies to test this. The second finding is that MEG-3 is still enriched in the posterior of pgl-1/3 RNAi embryos; however, the degree of knock down is not confirmed so PGL-1/3 may still be present.

Using anti-PGL-3 antibodies, we show that, like PGL-1, PGL-3 does not localize properly in <italic>meg-3/4</italic> zygotes. Second, we clarify that the <italic>pgl-1/3</italic> zygotes shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> are derived from <italic>pgl-3(bn104)</italic> hermaphrodites treated with <italic>pgl-1(RNAi)</italic> and we include the control staining with anti-PGL-1 to demonstrate loss of PGL-1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These data demonstrate unequivocally that PGL-1 and PGL-3 are neither necessary nor sufficient for granule asymmetry.</p><p><italic>5) Findings presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref> need clarification. It is not immediately clear that anterior MEX-6 is sufficient to prevent MEG-3 granules in the text. Nomenclature and labels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> need improved to better sync with the text.</italic> </p><p>We now include an additional control figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) that shows that MEX-6 is sufficient to localize MEG-3 in the absence of MEX-5. We also clarify this in the text. We have also made sure labels match between figures and text.</p><p><italic>6) It is not obvious as to why the ZF- mutated MEX-5 (R247E and K318E) also does not form a gradient, even though it has the necessary serine at position 404.</italic> </p><p>Griffin et al., 2011 reported that the MEX-5 RNA binding domain is required for gradient formation. We have added an explanation of this to the text.</p><p><italic>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> – should specify for clarity what timepoint this is (before, during, or after polarization).</italic> </p><p>Done.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>We are satisfied with your revisions except for your response to point 3, which needs to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</italic> </p><p><italic>The single sentence included in the Introduction is not sufficient to address point 3, requesting that you reconcile the findings in this paper with your study of MEG-3 in Wang et al. (eLife). Please explain (at least briefly) in the Discussion how the new results in this paper fit with your results in Wang et al. on MBK-2 and PPTR-1/2, for example, including your ideas above that MBK-2/PPTR-1/2 may act permissively. It will be confusing to readers that you have only in passing mentioned your previous results on MEG-3 in this paper.</italic> </p><p>We now have incorporated a discussion of our earlier findings to explain how phosphorylation and RNA-induced phase separation cooperate to regulate P granule dynamics.</p><p>We have also expanded the last paragraph of the Discussion to outline remaining questions for future investigations.</p></body></sub-article></article>
