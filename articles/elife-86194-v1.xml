Protein homeostasis (proteostasis) depends on a core network of factors directly influencing protein production, folding, trafficking, and degradation. Cellular proteostasis also depends on the overall composition of the proteome and numerous environmental variables. Modulating this cellular proteostasis state can influence the stability of multiple endogenous proteins, yet the factors contributing to this state remain incompletely characterized. Here, we performed genome-wide CRISPRi screens to elucidate the modulators of proteostasis state in mammalian cells, using a fluorescent dye to monitor endogenous protein aggregation. These screens identified known components of the proteostasis network and uncovered a novel link between protein and lipid homeostasis. Increasing lipid uptake and/or disrupting lipid metabolism promotes the accumulation of sphingomyelins and cholesterol esters and drives the formation of detergent-insoluble protein aggregates at the lysosome. Proteome profiling of lysosomes revealed ESCRT accumulation, suggesting disruption of ESCRT disassembly, lysosomal membrane repair, and microautophagy. Lipid dysregulation leads to lysosomal membrane permeabilization but does not otherwise impact fundamental aspects of lysosomal and proteasomal functions. Together, these results demonstrate that lipid dysregulation disrupts ESCRT function and impairs proteostasis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>aggregation</kwd><kwd>lipid dysregulation</kwd><kwd>ESCRT</kwd><kwd>CRISPR</kwd><kwd>lysosome</kwd><kwd>proteostasis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genome-wide CRISPRi screens and proteome profiling of lysosomes link lipid dysregulation to ESCRT disruption and proteostasis defect.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein aggregation is a hallmark of aging and age-related pathologies, including multiple neurodegenerative diseases and amyloidoses that affect individual or multiple organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiti and Dobson, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eisenberg and Jucker, 2012</xref>). Dozens of proteins that are normally soluble may form aggregates that are traditionally associated with specific diseases – e.g. tau tangles and amyloid plaques with Alzheimer’s Disease, and transthyretin deposits with transthyretin amyloidosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiti and Dobson, 2017</xref>). Although specific pathogenic proteins are often studied in isolation, a more complex relationship among different aggregation-prone proteins exists, either directly or through interaction with the cellular machinery regulating proteostasis. For instance, experiments in yeast, worms, and mammalian cell culture have demonstrated considerable cross-talk and cross-sensitization between classic aggregation-prone proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gidalevitz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guo et al., 2013</xref>). Further, a diverse set of proteins exhibit reduced solubility and lose their native structure during normal aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">David et al., 2010</xref>). Intriguingly, these insoluble age-associated proteins can seed the formation of classical amyloids in vitro, and contribute to functional decline in aging animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2019</xref>). Together, the evidence suggests that systemic changes in the state of cellular proteostasis may underlie proteinopathy and highlights the importance of expanding the scope of studies beyond specific disease-associated protein species.</p><p>The core proteostasis network is well described and involves the synthesis, folding, trafficking, and degradation of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hipp et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaushik and Cuervo, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Labbadia and Morimoto, 2015</xref>). Most of these components closely follow the life cycle of proteins, including (1) pathways that modulate protein synthesis and degradation, such as mTORC, ribosome biogenesis, the ubiquitin proteasome system, and autophagy; (2) molecular chaperones, which aid protein folding; and (3) stress response pathways that regulate the activity of (1) and (2) in response to accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins, such as ER-associated degradation and the unfolded protein response. Nevertheless, the components and network topology vary depending on cell type and cell state. Furthermore, mechanisms that underlie shifts in cellular proteostasis state, especially ones that do not directly involve core nodes of the proteostasis network, remain largely unknown.</p><p>Unbiased, whole-genome screening is a powerful tool for discovering cellular components and pathways that are involved in modifying a specific phenotype. Previous studies have applied genetic screens in different cell models to uncover, for specific proteins, modifiers of their aggregation, toxicity, or propensity for aggregation to propagate from seeds. These systems are often driven by overexpressing aggregation-prone proteins and/or seeding with extracellular pre-formed fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kramer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Willingham et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, while much progress has been made in understanding the homeostasis of several discrete proteins, the mechanisms influencing the broader cellular proteostasis network remain largely unknown. In particular, we are interested in cellular mechanisms that affect the aggregation state of endogenously expressed proteins, as these may be the most germane to age-associated loss of proteostasis.</p><p>To uncover novel components and pathways that regulate endogenous protein homeostasis, we applied CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) technology to perform unbiased, genome-wide screens on K562 cells using an aggresome-staining dye. ProteoStat is known to label both experimentally induced aggresomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shen et al., 2011</xref>) and aggregates that accumulate with age in the CNS of mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leeman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gefen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vonk et al., 2020</xref>). To our knowledge, ours are the first CRISPRi genome-wide screens performed on unmodified mammalian cells to interrogate endogenous protein aggregation. These screens revealed a link between lysosomal lipid homeostasis and proteostasis. Increased levels of sphingomyelins and cholesterol esters, either as a result of increased lipid uptake or decreased lysosomal degradative capacity, lead to increased protein aggregation predominantly colocalized with the lysosomes. Proteomic analysis of isolated lysosomes revealed accumulation of detergent-insoluble ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) components, indicating potential impairment of lysosomal membrane repair and microautophagy. Lipid dysregulation induces or potentiates lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP), the rescue of which partially restores proteostasis. Other aspects of lysosomal and proteasomal functions essential for proteostasis (lysosomal pH, lysosomal protease activity, and proteasome activity) were unaffected by lipid dysregulation. Together, this work provides strong evidence that supports an emergent role of lipid dysregulation in driving protein aggregation through disruption of the ESCRT pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Measurement of endogenous proteostasis state by flow cytometry</title><p>ProteoStat is used to stain endogenous protein aggregates in fixed cells.

To verify that ProteoStat can report changes in proteostasis in human cell culture, we inhibited proteasomes in K562 cells and stained them for microscopy or flow cytometry analysis. As expected, proteasome inhibition by MG132 increased ProteoStat intensity, with numerous bright puncta around the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). ProteoStat-high cells obtained by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from cells treated with a lower dose of MG132 – which generated mixed phenotypes – likewise showed numerous bright puncta, whereas ProteoStat-low cells displayed diffuse staining of lower intensity, indicating that this tool can be used to report and isolate cells in different proteostasis states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>CRISPRi screens identified major cellular proteostasis components and implicated lipid uptake and metabolism pathways.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) ProteoStat validation: MG132-treated cells were stained, sorted into top and bottom quartiles (ProteoStat-high and ProteoStat-low, respectively), and imaged.

Briefly, cells carrying individual sgRNAs were fixed, stained, and sorted by ProteoStat intensity into top and bottom quartiles (ProteoStat-high and ProteoStat-low, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Illumina sequencing was used to quantify the frequency of each sgRNA in each of these two populations. We performed this experiment twice and evaluated the effect of each gene’s knockdown (KD) on proteostasis using the MAGeCK package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>KDs of 239 genes increased ProteoStat, whereas KDs of 607 genes decreased it (out of 20,704 protein-coding genes targeted by the sgRNA library; FDR &lt;0.05). We validated the results of a subset of genes by repeating the screen at a reduced scale (batch retest; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) captured ontologies in which genes showed consistent effects in the same direction, even though individual genes may fall below an artificial threshold. Many of these genes and pathways are known proteostasis modifiers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>). These include ribosomal proteins (both small 40 S and large 60 S subunits), ribosome biogenesis and processing, proteasome subunits, lysosomal proton pump subunits (vATPases), and certain chaperones. KD of many ribosomal proteins and ribosome assembly factors decreased ProteoStat, consistent with reduced input of proteins into the proteostasis network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stein and Frydman, 2019</xref>). Knocking down subunits of the proteasome complex increased ProteoStat, consistent with MG132 treatment in our validation experiments. Disrupting vATPases similarly increased ProteoStat, likely via deacidification and impairment of lysosomes, an important center where multiple catabolic processes converge. These effects on ProteoStat following inhibition of proteasome and lysosomal acidification were replicated using pharmacological inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In contrast, KD of many chaperones, including HSPA4, HSP90AB1, DNAJB6, and several subunits of TRiC chaperonins, paradoxically reduced ProteoStat. Perturbing chaperones can trigger the newly described safeguard against protein aggregation mechanism that targets certain newly synthesized aggregation-prone proteins to the lysosome, notably before large visible aggregates are formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jung et al., 2020</xref>). Alternatively, initial HSP70 or HSP90 inhibition can upregulate heat shock response as a negative feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kijima et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akerfelt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ali et al., 1998</xref>). Indeed, pharmacological inhibition of chaperones increased ProteoStat after 30 min, but decreased after 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, KD of most of the major components directly involved in macroautophagy did not affect ProteoStat in either direction. These include the core autophagosome formation components (e.g. ATG5, ATG10, ATG12, and the ATG8 protein family) and the autophagy adaptors (NBR1, TAX1BP1, OPTN, SQSTM1 etc). Although we performed our screens under nutrient-replete conditions, perturbations of these macroautophagy genes in K562 under similar growth conditions have previously been demonstrated to influence autophagic flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shoemaker et al., 2019</xref>). These results suggest that basal macroautophagy plays a negligible role in clearing endogenous amyloid-like structures in this system.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Lipid uptake and metabolism modulate proteostasis</title><p>The strong association of lysosomal vATPases with Proteostat phenotype is likely due to the need to maintain a lysosomal pH of ~4.5–5.0 for optimal activity of the hydrolases that break down proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. Failure to maintain this acidic pH can cause lysosomal storage of undegraded macromolecules. Accordingly, in addition to the vATPases, several genes that broadly regulate lysosomal function impacted ProteoStat. These include genes that modulate the delivery or activity of multiple lysosomal enzymes (e.g. GNPTAB, IGF2R, LYSET, and PSAP) or lipid uptake and metabolism (e.g. LDLR, MYLIP, and SCAP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). However, no perturbations of more discrete activities (e.g. individual cathepsins, lipid hydrolases – e.g. GBA, LIPA, and GALC – or solute carriers) did so, suggesting that proteostasis is generally resilient and becomes impaired only in response to pleiotropic perturbations.</p><p>KD of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) reduced ProteoStat. Correspondingly, KD of the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase MYLIP, which targets LDLR for sterol-regulated degradation, led to one of the strongest signal increases. MYLIP KD increased ProteoStat via upregulating LDLR levels rather than through other MYLIP targets, as the effect of LDLR KD was epistatic to MYLIP in cells with double KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Cultured cells take up LDL – lipoproteins rich in cholesterol esters – through LDLR and the endo-lysosomal pathway. Once inside the acidic environment of lysosomes, cholesterol ester is hydrolyzed into free fatty acid and cholesterol, the latter of which is trafficked to the ER. Excess cholesterol exerts negative feedback on LDLR levels via two mechanisms: (1) oxysterols (oxidized derivatives of cholesterol) activate the liver X receptor (LXR), in turn increasing MYLIP expression and LDLR degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zelcer et al., 2009</xref>); (2) high ER cholesterol sequesters the SCAP-SREBPs complex, suppressing its activity and in turn reducing LDLR expression as well as de novo cholesterol synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goldstein et al., 2006</xref>). Two positive regulators of the SREBP pathways (SCAP and MBTPS2) also reduced ProteoStat when knocked down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In contrast, genes along the mevalonate – de novo cholesterol synthesis – pathway did not consistently score in our screen, indicating the difference between cholesterol that is taken up vs synthesized de novo.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Accumulation of sphingolipid and cholesterol ester can impair proteostasis.</title><p>(<bold>A &amp; D</bold>) Comparing effects on ProteoStat of single vs double KDs (n≥2) (<bold>B</bold>) Effects of gene KDs on ProteoStat in cells maintained in media with regular or delipidated FBS (DL media).

We also examined the possibility that ProteoStat may directly stain cholesterol by acutely extracting cholesterol using methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MBCD).

Furthermore, in an in vitro biphasic lipid bilayer system (giant unilamellar vesicles, GUVs), ProteoStat stained the lipid bilayer poorly and was not brighter at the cholesterol-rich phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Together, the evidence suggests that increased flux of LDL uptake and/or the levels of lipid metabolites generated during the process increases protein aggregation.</p><p>KD of genes involved in lysosomal sphingolipid metabolism and lysosomal protein trafficking (GNPTAB, IGF2R, LYSET, and PSAP) increased ProteoStat in our screens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). GNPTAB encodes two subunits of a Golgi-resident enzyme, GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase, which catalyzes the first step to form mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) markers on lysosomal enzymes and is stabilized by the recently characterized LYSET (also named TMEM251; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Richards et al., 2022</xref>). IGF2R (also known as the cation-independent M6P receptor) binds to these lysosomal enzymes and facilitates their transport from golgi to lysosome. PSAP, or prosaposin, is the precursor to saposin peptides, which are required to activate lysosomal sphingolipid catabolizing enzymes. The effect of PSAP KD was dramatically exacerbated by MYLIP KD and alleviated by LDLR KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), indicating that lipid uptake can impinge on proteostasis through its interaction with lipid catabolism in lysosomes. The individual lysosomal hydrolases activated by saposins, such as GBA, GALC, and LIPA, did not rise above the detection threshold in our screen, again suggesting that the proteostasis network, as measured by ProteoStat, is generally resilient to perturbations of discrete functional nodes or changes in individual lipid species.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Sphingolipids and cholesterol esters mediate the effect of lipid perturbations on proteostasis</title><p>Having demonstrated that lipid metabolism could influence proteostasis, we wondered if specific lipid species might be involved. To address this question, we performed lipidomic analysis on cells in which lipid metabolism was perturbed, either genetically by CRISPRi, or environmentally by lipid depletion. These perturbations were selected from the screen results to represent a range of effects on ProteoStat staining. When considering perturbations that directly affect lipid uptake and metabolism, we found remarkable correlation between ProteoStat staining and individual levels of most lipids in the sphingomyelin (SM) and cholesterol ester (CE) classes (<italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> of up to 0.968 and 0.843, for SM and CE, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Indeed, lipids belonging to these two classes were better correlated with the ProteoStat phenotype when compared with the full collection of lipid compounds assayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref> for the lipid classes ceramides [Cers], lactosylceramides [LacCers], or hexosylceramides [HexCers] as counterexamples). In contrast, KD of targets that do not impinge directly on lipid metabolism (e.g. AMBRA1 or CHMP2A) or else expected to have strong pleiotropic effects beyond lipid metabolism (e.g. ATP6V1E1) did not induce strong correlations between SMs/CEs and ProteoStat (insets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). These results further highlight the multimodality of proteostasis regulation, where lipid dysregulation represents one, among other, major components.</p><p>To determine if any lipid species alone contributed critically to protein aggregation induced by lipid dysregulation, we leveraged the modularity of the highly conserved PSAP. Upon delivery to the lysosome, the proprotein is cleaved proteolytically into four active peptides, saposins (Saps) A, B, C, and D. Saps are involved in the hydrolysis of glycosphingolipids (GSLs) as enzymatic activators, facilitating the interaction between soluble lysosomal hydrolases and GSLs embedded in the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kolter and Sandhoff, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Xu et al., 2010</xref>). Distinct residues within the Sap-hydrolase interface confer hydrolase specificity on each saposin (e.g. SapA binds to Galactocerebrosidase, GALC, and stimulates galactosylceramide hydrolysis, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hill et al., 2018</xref>). Deficiency in full-length PSAP or individual Saps (by truncation, inactivating mutations, or reduced expression) lead to various lysosomal storage disorders, with neuropathology and often dysfunction of other organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schulze and Sandhoff, 2011</xref>). Depending on which Sap is deficient, distinct GSL species are found to accumulate in the storage cells. We therefore performed rescue experiments using different PSAP variants to perturb turnover of individual GSLs more specifically. We expressed full length PSAP or variants with either a single Sap or all-but-one Sap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Full-length PSAP largely rescued the increase in ProteoStat induced by PSAP KD (p=0.07 vs non-targeting, no-rescue control), while the variant with all four Saps inactivated (PSAP ΔABCD) failed to rescue (p=0.74 vs PSAP KD, no-rescue control; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Furthermore, addition of any single Sap did not fully rescue the KD phenotype. Accordingly, inactivating any single Sap also did not fully abrogate PSAP’s ability to rescue. Together, the evidence suggests that proteostasis impairment from sphingolipid accumulation is pleiotropic and is likely attributable to the action of multiple but not a single lipid. This is consistent with the observation that, in our CRISPRi screens, none of the individual GSL hydrolases significantly increased ProteoStat level.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Lipid dysregulation leads to accumulation of insoluble lysosomal protein aggregates</title><p>Lipid-related perturbations that impair proteostasis suggested a central role for lysosomes, prompting us to further characterize ProteoStat staining, especially its subcellular localization. Aggresomes are reportedly composed of misfolded and aggregated proteins that are poly-ubiquitinated and transported along microtubules to coalesce into perinuclear assemblies. These aggresomes can be recognized by autophagy receptors to undergo canonical macroautophagy and lysosomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kocaturk and Gozuacik, 2018</xref>). Alternatively, cytosolic or organelle cargo may be recruited and directly delivered into endolysosomal compartments in a process termed microautophagy that is dependent on the ESCRT pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kuchitsu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Oku et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schäfer et al., 2020</xref>). ProteoStat was initially reported to colocalize with mono-/poly-ubiquitinated proteins, p62, and LC3, and has been used as a general reporter for protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bohnert and Kenyon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leeman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vonk et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, lysosome-accumulating ProteoStat-positive aggregates were reported in quiescent neural stem cells but not their activated counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leeman et al., 2018</xref>), nor in other rapidly dividing cell types.</p><p>We initially characterized aggresomes induced by pharmacological proteasome inhibition. Treatment with MG132 for 4 hr induced ProteoStat puncta that colocalized predominantly with the lysosomes, in addition to a diffuse but weaker signal in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). A similar distribution was observed after 20 hr of treatment. In contrast, mono-/poly-ubiquitinated proteins increased only modestly at 4 hr; at 20 hr these signals increased globally and did not concentrate in the lysosomes. Punctate structures of mono-/poly-ubiquitinated proteins became more apparent at a higher dose of MG132. These puncta were non-lysosomal and ProteoStat-positive, though their ProteoStat intensities were lower than the lysosomal ProteoStat puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>, white arrowheads). In comparison, proteasome inhibition by Bortezomib led to proportionally stronger cytoplasmic ProteoStat and mono-/poly-ubiquitination and less pronounced lysosomal puncta. Finally, when lysosomes were deacidified with Bafilomycin A1, we observed strong overlapping signals of ProteoStat and mono/poly-ubiquitination that were partially colocalized with the lysosomes, consistent with impaired ability to remove and degrade ubiquitin chains or ubiquitinated proteins. Patterns of Thioflavin T staining were similar to ProteoStat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>). These results with diverse inhibitors demonstrate subtle pharmacological biases – with MG132 favoring lysosomal puncta and Bortezomib causing both classical aggresomes and lysosomal phenotypes – and the ability for ProteoStat to capture these variations. These observations of lysosomal ProteoStat-high ubiquitination-low puncta, together with the aforementioned lack of evidence of macroautophagy involvement, are consistent with the microautophagy pathway where cargos are processed by deubiquitinating enzymes (STAMBP and UBPY) associated with ESCRT during transport into lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hanson et al., 2009</xref>). Under mild proteostatic stress, ubiquitinated proteins accumulate and are transported into lysosomes by microautophagy, while being deubiquitinated in the process. When proteostatic stress prolongs or intensifies, deubiquitinating capacity may be overwhelmed, resulting in increased accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins both inside and outside lysosomes. Indeed, UBPY KD increased lysosomal signals of both ProteoStat and mono-/poly-ubiquitinated proteins, consistent with a role for microautophagy in delivery of misfolded proteins to the lysosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E–F</xref>).</p><p>Cells with lipid impairment (MYLIP or PSAP KD) exhibited lysosomal ProteoStat puncta that were non-ubiquitinated, in addition to occasional cytoplasmic double-positive puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>, white arrowheads). This suggests a moderate level of proteostatic stress that does not overwhelm the capacity to deubiquitinate. Accordingly, cells with MYLIP and PSAP KD did not exhibit growth defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). To verify the presence of protein aggregates in lysosomes under the above conditions, we isolated lysosomes using Lyso-IP (Lysosome Immunoprecipitation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abu-Remaileh et al., 2017</xref>). HA epitopes are targeted to the lysosomal surface by TMEM192, which enable lysosomal isolation, followed by differential extraction into RIPA (detergent-soluble) and Urea/SDS (detergent-insoluble) fractions. This orthogonal approach confirmed that lipid-perturbation (MYLIP and PSAP KDs) resulted in accumulation of detergent-insoluble protein aggregates in the lysosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Within the Lysosomal Insoluble fraction, 35 proteins were over-represented (q-value &lt;0.05) in MYLIP KD cells versus control. Remarkably, 9 of the top 12 insoluble proteins induced by MYLIP KD were components involved in the ESCRT pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), including multiple ESCRT-III subunits (e.g. CHMP2A, CHMP4A &amp; B), accessory proteins (ALIX and PTPN23), and ESCRT-III disassembling enzymes (VPS4A and VTA1). The ESCRT machinery is involved in multiple cellular processes that involve membrane scission with a negative curvature (membrane bending out and away from the cytoplasm), including cytokinesis, ciliogenesis, multivesicular body formation, microautophagy, and lysosomal membrane repair. Accordingly, GSEA of insoluble lysosomal proteins enriched in MYLIP KD compared to control highlighted the Multivesicular Body gene set (GO:0005771; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Nevertheless, lipid-modifying KDs – MYLIP, PSAP, and LDLR – did not significantly shift pHLys, suggesting their effects on proteostasis were not mediated via lysosomal deacidification.</p><p>We investigated the level of lipid peroxidation and lysosomal content (size and/or number) under lipid-modifying perturbations. Using a fluorescent indicator, LiperFluo, we found that perturbations that increased or decreased SM and CE levels (MYLIP and PSAP KDs, vs LDLR KD) increased or decreased lipid peroxidation, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Interestingly, these lipid peroxidation phenotypes mirrored changes in total LysoTracker signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). As we did not observe these perturbations substantially altering pHLys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), the LysoTracker result suggested changes in lysosomal content, potentially to compensate for lysosomal impairment that may or may not be a consequence of lipid peroxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kirkegaard et al., 2010</xref>). We tested if lipid peroxidation is necessary for the increased protein aggregation and lysosomal content using media with antioxidants. A cocktail of five antioxidants (5AO) is commonly included in the media for culturing neurons – a cell type that is particularly sensitive to oxidative stress. While 5AO was effective in reducing lipid peroxidation, it did not rescue the Proteostat or Lysotracker phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We therefore conclude that protein aggregation and lysosomal content increase are likely upstream or independent of lipid peroxidation.</p><p>Finally, we investigated if the other major arm of protein catabolism, the proteasome, is regulated by changes in lipid metabolism. A recent report suggested that high CE levels in cells may hinder phospho-Tau degradation due to proteasome inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">van der Kant et al., 2019</xref>). We labeled active proteasomes using a fluorescent probe, Me4BodipyFL-Ahx3Leu3VS (Me4BoVS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berkers et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berkers et al., 2007</xref>), which covalently binds to catalytically active proteasome β-subunits in live cells. MG132 and Bortezomib treatments reduced the fluorescent signal from Me4BoVS in both live cell flow cytometry and in-gel analysis of cell lysates, validating its use as a proteasome activity probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Flow cytometry analysis of CRISPRi cells showed that HMGCR KD increased proteasome activity, consistent with the reported effect of statin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">van der Kant et al., 2019</xref>). Nevertheless, in conditions that strongly modulated SM or CE levels (KD of MYLIP, PSAP, or LDLR), we did not see significant increase or decrease of proteasome activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). In contrast, KD of IDI1, an enzyme downstream of HMGCR along the mevalonate pathway (but not FDFT1), strongly increased proteasome activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>). We conclude that the proteasome modulating effect of statin likely arises from changes in other metabolites along the mevalonate pathway.

Despite extensive studies, factors modifying cellular proteostasis state, which has the potential to affect the state of many endogenous proteins, remain incompletely characterized. In this study, we performed genome-wide CRISPRi screens using a fluorescent dye sensitive to endogenous protein aggregation and uncovered links between lipid homeostasis and proteostasis. We discovered and characterized how changes in the uptake and metabolism of lipids, particularly SMs and CEs, lead to accumulation or depletion of these lipids and alter homeostasis of endogenous proteins.</p><p>SM and CE dysregulation has been implicated in various age-associated diseases. Intracellular sphingolipid accumulation has long been associated with lysosomal storage diseases, which share many features with age-related neurodegenerative diseases both at the level of physiology and cellular mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lloyd-Evans and Haslett, 2016</xref>). Elevated extracellular LDL cholesterol is associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mortensen and Nordestgaard, 2020</xref>), where modifications, including oxidation, and misfolding of apoB-100 can trigger the formation of Thioflavin-T-positive fibrils of aggregated LDL and stimulate uptake by macrophages and catabolism within their lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Khoo et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Parasassi et al., 2008</xref>). Consistent with our observations, MYLIP deficiency in mice leads to upregulated LDLR expression and increased cellular uptake of lipoprotein ApoE in brain tissues, but also increased uptake and clearance of extracellular aggregated Aβ peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choi et al., 2015</xref>). These data affirm biological connections between lipoproteins and amyloidogenesis.</p><p>What are the molecular mechanisms that impair proteostasis in response to lipid perturbation? Accumulation of sphingolipid or cholesterol due to either direct enzyme deficiency or impaired lipid transport was previously linked to reduced cellular proteostasis via impairment of lysosomal function, manifested variously as reduced lysosomal proteolytic capacity, LMP, lipid peroxidation, and aberrant mTORC1 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kirkegaard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gabandé-Rodríguez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Platt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davis et al., 2021</xref>). Surprisingly, the lipid perturbations associated with ProteoStat-positive aggregates did not impinge on general features of lysosomal health. More recently, Tian and colleagues discovered in iPSC-induced neurons that PSAP KD severely impairs GSL catabolism, leading to the accumulation of these lipids and, in turn, lipofuscin formation, lipid peroxidation, and eventual cell death by ferroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tian et al., 2021</xref>). Lipofuscins are lysosomal deposits of heterogeneous nature, consisting mainly of oxidized proteins, lipids, metal ions, and sugar residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moreno-García et al., 2018</xref>). These deposits are largely seen in post-mitotic and senescent cells, and their accumulation is observed in aged tissues but also associated with many age-related degenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moreno-García et al., 2018</xref>). PSAP KD did not induce lipofuscin in rapidly dividing K562 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>), likely due to continuous dilution of damaged biomolecules by rapid cell divisions before their levels can reach a threshold to form crosslinked and undegradable granules. Despite no visible accumulation of lipofuscin, we nonetheless observed an increase in lipid peroxidation and concomitant increase in lysosomal content, similarly to what’s reported in iPSC-derived neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tian et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting that granular lipofuscin formation may be dispensable for ROS generation. Furthermore, antioxidants could uncouple lipid peroxidation from lysosomal protein aggregation induced by lipid dysregulation, thus ruling out a causal relationship.</p><p>ESCRT impairment was previously linked to LMP and ESCRT-III knockdown was shown to promote the escape of exogenous tau seeds from endolysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that cholesterol and sphingolipid dysregulation can disrupt ESCRT function at the lysosome, leading to accumulation of detergent insoluble components that resist the action of VPS4A. Lipid composition might directly interfere with ESCRT function and intraluminal vesicle formation. While ESCRT-III polymerization can curve membranes and drive vesicle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McCullough et al., 2015</xref>), membrane curvature is also influenced by the shape and structure of lipid species present in the bilayer. Remarkably, enzymatic conversion of SM into ceramide (promoting neutral and negative membrane curvature, respectively) is sufficient to trigger spontaneous vesicle budding into the lumen of giant unilamellar vesicles in the absence of ESCRT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Trajkovic et al., 2008</xref>). Accordingly, formation of intraluminal vesicles in a mouse cell line is impaired when SM hydrolysis is inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Trajkovic et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, SM hydrolysis promotes lysosomal repair in HeLa cells regardless of ESCRT status, and sphingomyelinase inhibition is detrimental to the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Niekamp et al., 2022</xref>). Hence, an overabundance of SM may hinder the coalescence of ceramide-rich domains and prevent negative membrane curvature, thereby thwarting ESCRT resolution and vesicle budding. We show that this can in turn impair proteostasis and lead to aggregate accumulation, presumably as misfolded proteins are recruited to endolysosomal surfaces through microautophagy but fail to be degraded in the lumen.</p><p>Taken together, the data presented here demonstrate that, despite the general resilience of the proteostasis network, it is sensitive to pleiotropic changes in lysosomal lipid metabolism. Proteostasis is thus impacted by both changes in cell-intrinsic function and systemic lipid metabolism that can influence circulating lipids. This axis is of particular interest in the context of aging physiology in its ability to link processes that operate at the organismal and tissue levels to cellular proteostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">K562</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CCL-243</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">K562 CRISPRi</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line used to perform CRISPRi screen</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">K562 CRISPRi +TagBFP-Gal3</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line used to assay lysosomal membrane permeabilization</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">K562 CRISPRi +pHLARE</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line used to assay lysosomal pH</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">K562 CRISPRi +LysoIP</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line used to perform lysosomal proteomics</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">anti-human-LAMP1 (mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Abcam</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ab25630</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IF(1:50)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">anti-mono/polyubiquitinated conjugates (mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Enzo</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BML-PW8810-0100</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IF(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Alexa Fluor Plus 647-conjugated anti-mouse (goat polyclonal secondary)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Invitrogen</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">A32728</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IF(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PSAP overexpression variant series</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Lentiviral constructs to interrogate the effect of individual saposins.

Cells were maintained in suspension at a density between 125 K to 1 M cells/mL in RPMI complete media (with 10% FBS and 1 x GlutaMax). 500 million stable CRISPRi cells were transduced with a sgRNA lentivirus pool (hCRISPRi_v2.1_top5 library, which includes 102,640 gene-targeting and 4590 non-targeting sgRNAs) at an MOI of 0.3 for single integrants. After 6 days in culture, including antibiotic selection for cells carrying the sgRNAs with 2 µg/mL puromycin, these cells were stained with fixable blue dead cell stain (Molecular Probes), then fixed, permeabilized and stained with ProteoStat Aggresome detection kit (Enzo) according to manufacturer’s protocol. Stained cells were sorted by FACS (BD FACSAria) into top and bottom quartiles (ProteoStat-high and ProteoStat-low, respectively), using gates that excluded dead cells and corrected for correlation between cell size and staining intensity. Sorted cell populations were pelleted, from which genomic DNA was extracted with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol and ethanol precipitation. sgRNA-containing sequences were amplified from the genomic DNA with two rounds of PCR, introducing multiplexing barcodes and sequencing adaptors in the process.

To measure the effect of gene KDs on LMP, these reporter cells were transduced with corresponding sgRNA-expressing lentiviruses and selected with 2 µg/mL puromycin. 5 days after sgRNA transduction, cells were plated on poly-D-lysine-coated CellCarrier Ultra 96-well plates (Perkin Elmer) at 12 K cells in 200 µL regular media per well. 2 days after plating, cells were treated with 60 uM LLOMe (or left untreated) and imaged on Opera Phenix imaging platform (Perkin Elmer) at 15 minute intervals for 4 hr, with excitation laser at 375 nm and bandpass emission filter at 435–550 nm. Images were analyzed with Harmony software (Perkin Elmer) by cell segmentation and spot detection. The number of GAL3 puncta in each field of view (6 fields per condition) is normalized by the total segmented cell area and scaled to match the average cell area, to correct for cell density and averaged across replicates. The maximal response for each sample over the 4 hr time course was reported.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>pHLys quantification by pHLARE</title><p>Stable pHLys reporter cells were generated by transducing K562 CRISPRi cells with a lentiviral vector expressing pHLARE (a fusion protein consisting of prolactin signal sequence, superfolder GFP [sfGFP]), rat LAMP1, and mCherry developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Webb et al., 2021</xref>, and selected with 10 µg/mL blasticidin.</p><p>For validation, reporter cells were pelleted at 500 × <italic>g</italic> for 5 min and resuspended in a buffer series at pHs ranging from 4 to 7.5 (140 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 5 mM glucose and 10% citrate-phosphate-borate buffer at the target pH; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carmody, 1961</xref>) in the presence of ionophores (10 µM nigericin, 2 µM monensin). Non-reporter cells were treated in parallel to correct for changes in background autofluorescence under various perturbations. After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, cells were analyzed with flow cytometry (Fortessa, BD), using excitation-bandpass emission settings of 488 nm-525/50 nm and 561 nm-610/20 nm for sfGFP and mCherry, respectively. To elucidate the effect of gene KDs on pHLys, CRISPRi cells with or without stable pHLys reporter were transduced with sgRNA-expressing lentiviruses, selected with 2 µg/mL puromycin, and analyzed similarly with flow cytometry, 7 days after sgRNA transduction.</p><p>Cytometry data was analyzed in FlowJo software (BD). Median background fluorescence in each channel in the cognate non-reporter controls was subtracted from the sfGFP and mCherry fluorescence intensities in the pHLys reporter samples. The ratio of adjusted sfGFP intensity vs adjusted mCherry intensity was reported.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) and ProteoStat staining</title><p>GUVs with binary mixtures of saturated and unsaturated lipids were obtained by electroformation. Briefly, DOPC, DPPC, and free cholesterol were mixed in equal molar parts to a final concentration of 1 mg/mL. TopFluor Cholesterol (Avanti Polar Lipids Inc) was included at 1% of total lipids. The lipid mix was spread onto ITO-coated glass coverslips and dried overnight under vacuum. Dried lipids were hydrated with 300–400 ul of a 100 mM sucrose solution while applying a sinusoidal voltage (1.2 Vp-p and 10 Hz) for 1 hr at 60 °C. GUVs were harvested, diluted 20-fold in 200 µL of a 100 mM glucose solution supplemented with either no ProteoStat, or ProteoStat at a final dilution of 10,000 x and 500 x and imaged at 30 °C in a spinning disk confocal fluorescence microscope (Nikon), using excitation/emission at 488 nm/525±18 nm (TopFluor) or 561 nm/605±35 nm (ProteoStat).

The main tool used is the ProteoStat stain to assess protein aggregate burden in native cells (i.e. cells under no exogenous or endogenous stress). They initially use CRISPR-based genome-wide screens to identify several genes that affect this aggregate burden. Interestingly, knockdown of genes involved in lysosomal acidification was a major signature which led to identification of other culprit lysosome-associated genes that included ones involved in lipid metabolism. Subsequent CRISPR screen focused on lipidomic analysis led to identification of sphingolipid and cholesterol esters as lipid classes with effects on proteostasis.</p><p>Comments on revised version:</p><p>They did a decent job addressing most of my comments and the new data (including LysoIP) makes for much more plausible conclusions.</p><p>They propose the idea that microautophagy is mediating the delivery of these aggregates to lysosomes.</p><p>It appears there are enough experiments and support now for their premise.</p><p>The lysosomal lipid metabolism link to proteostasis is still a lingering question in this work but they addressed each of the points I raised regarding it and revised the manuscript accordingly with pertinent discussion.</p><p>It is difficult to truly address the lipid link and I think we have to acknowledge that.

At the highest level, this revision provides (i) orthogonal biochemical measurements that yield concrete evidence of lysosomal protein aggregates, and (ii) a plausible mechanism linking lysosomal lipid handling and protein aggregation through disruption of ESCRT function. We believe these additions significantly improve the completeness of this study and the conclusions that can be drawn from the data.</p><p>Below are more specific highlights on the addition in this revision:</p><p>- We included orthogonal techniques (thioflavin-T staining and Lyso-IP followed by differential extraction) and confirmed the accumulation of RIPA-insoluble protein aggregates at the lysosomes in cells under lipid perturbation (Figure 3).</p><p>- We performed TMT-Proteomics and identified accumulation of insoluble ESCRT components at the lysosomes under lipid perturbation (Figure 4). Two new authors involved in this effort are added onto the manuscript.</p><p>- The ESCRT result prompted us to revisit lysosomal membrane integrity. With improved imaging conditions and analysis we were able to see increased membrane permeabilization under lipid perturbation. VPS4A overexpression partially rescued this phenotype, suggesting that lipid accumulation impairs ESCRT disassembly (Figure 5).</p><p>- Together, the results suggest that lipid perturbation impairs ESCRT function, compromising both lysosomal membrane repair and microautophagy, resulting in the accumulation of endogenous protein aggregates at the lysosomes (Graphical Abstract).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Perhaps the most prominent limitation of this work is the unilateral focus on native cells (i.e. cells under no endogenous or exogenous stress) as the model for protein aggregate formation. Furthermore, although the ProteoStat stain has been utilized by many investigators before, the sole reliance on this stain as the read-out for their assays is concerning. To compound the concern, the ProteoStat-positive puncta co-localize with lysosmal markers which was surprising even to the authors. All in all, it behooves the authors to test proteostasis in multiple parallel ways to actually define what they are studying. How is it possible that protein aggregates under native conditions are only co-localized with lysosomes? Are we really studying protein aggregates which should predominantly be cytoplasmic insoluble aggregates?</p><p>(a) They need to get away from a simple stain like ProteoStat and conduct co-stainings with other markers such as poly-ubiquitin antibodies and other chaperones to define what and where else exactly are these aggregates.</p></disp-quote><p>Co-staining with poly-ubiquitin was included in the original manuscript. We added orthogonal staining with another widely used amyloid dye, Thioflavin-T, and provided fine-grained quantification of lysosomal vs cytosolic localization of various signals (Figures S4A-C &amp; 3A-B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(b) They need to do Immunoblots with and without triton insolubility to see if these aggregates are insoluble as most would predict. They can do lysosomal isolation vs cytoplasmic to see if the insoluble aggregates are really lysosomal.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed Lyso-IP followed by differential detergent extraction to confirm the accumulation of insoluble proteins at the lysosomes (Figure 3C). Proteomic analysis identified some of these insoluble proteins as ESCRT subunits (Figure 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(c) They should compare aggregate formation in the native state versus cells with lysosomal inhibition via Bafilomycin or chloroquine versus cells with proteosomal inhibition. The lysosomal inhibition experiments are particularly informative given the lysosomal relevance they have uncovered.</p></disp-quote><p>We included other small molecule inhibitors and at different time points to compare the effect of different modes of proteostasis challenge (Figure S4A-D). Together with the ESCRT finding, our results suggest the role of microautophagy in our system, and provide a model of how ProteoStat- and/or ubiquitin- positive substrates become partitioned between the cytoplasm and lysosomes under different perturbations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(d) Many protein aggregates which are too bulky for proteosome degradation will traditionally be dealt with by aggrephagy. Why is this not observed?</p></disp-quote><p>Knockdown of core macroautophagy components did not impact Proteostat intensity in our CRISPRi screen, suggesting that basal macroautophagy plays a negligible role in clearing endogenous amyloid-like structures in our experimental system. We provide an alternative model that these aggregates instead arrive at the lysosomes via microautophagy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) After addressing #1, they can validate if the genes they identified by CRISPR screens are also important in modulation of protein aggregate burden in other systems. For example, if they inhibit lysosomes by Bafilo or Chloroquine to obtain protein aggregates and then Knockdown the identified genes in the CRISPR screens, will they get the same results?</p></disp-quote><p>We addressed the effect of different modes of proteostasis challenge as recommended above. Deacidifying the lysosomes alone causes intense protein aggregation (Figure S4A-D) and eventually cell death, and was thus not combined with other perturbations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) They identify lysosomal lipid metabolism genes/pathways as the culprit for inducing proteostasis. In particular sphingolipid and cholesteryl ester species appear to be operational here. However, there are no specific lipids species or specific lipid metabolism gene that is causative. Rather, you have to knockdown entire processes to have an effect. This suggests that the focus on lysosome health (i.e. permeability, proteolysis, etc) is rudimentary. When you have to knockdown entire classes of lipids, this would indicate more broad effects on cellular lipids (including membrane lipids beyond the lysosome) and related cellular health?</p></disp-quote><p>We included data on the effect of knocking down MYLIP, PSAP, and as a comparison PSMD2 on the growth rate of K562 cells (Figure S5A). MYLIP and PSAP KDs, which cause predominantly an accumulation of lipids, do not impede cell growth. Increasing lipid uptake by MYLIP KD increases cell proliferation under our culture conditions, suggesting a general negative impact on cell health was not required for the association between lipid levels and protein aggregates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(a) They conduct a superficial methyl-beta-cyclodextrin experiment with equivocal results. The use of MBCD for different time-courses to deplete various membrane cholesterol pools including the plasma membrane pool is important to ascertain what aspect of the cellular cholesterol is affecting proteostasis. MBCD +/- cholesterol reintroduction time-courses for rescue will also be key to determine the culprit cellular cholesterol pool.</p></disp-quote><p>The MBCD / Filipin experiment helped us determine that ProteoStat doesn’t directly stain cholesterol, nor any major plasma membrane components. Free cholesterol was implicated in neither the screen nor the lipidomics and was not the subject of targeted experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(b) The same concept can be applied to sphingolipids. There are sphingolipids in abundance in multiple membrane compartments. Which ones are causal here? More nuanced evaluation of this with sphingolipid staining/tracking can be conducted.</p></disp-quote><p>We attempted experiments where sphingolipids were added back to cells grown in FBS-depleted media. Nevertheless, we were not able to consistently deliver these lipid species and doing so while ensuring the correct subcellular localization at physiologically relevant level would require substantial methods development.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(c) As part of this, are lipid rafts and/or caveolae being affected by the perturbations in cholesterol and sphingolipids? Lipid rafts are highly enriched in these 2 lipids which could link to their preteostasis observation.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, ceramides released from SM hydrolysis are proposed to self-assembled into microdomains with negative curvature that can promote the formation of intralumenal vesicles (Alonso and Goni, 2018; Niekamp et al 2022). We propose that SM accumulation may hinder this process by counteracting the negative membrane curvature and impede microautophagy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(d) How about ER membrane lipids? The UPR and subsequent effects on proteostasis are intricately involved with ER lipid bilayer composition.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not perform lipidomics on ER membranes in this study, though we note that at steady state, sphingolipids and cholesterol esters are not expected to be enriched at the ER (Ikonen and Zhou, 2021). We checked whether lipid-related genetic perturbations induced the UPR in published perturb-seq data in K562 cells. Neither MYLIP nor PSAP knockdown induced a UPR.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In conclusion, the manuscript is interesting but the excitement over a link between lysosome-related lipid metabolism and proteostasis needs to be tamped until a more robust experimental approach is employed to generate supportive and corroborating results.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>- The paper has a number of grammatically awkward sentences. Editing these would enhance clarity.</p><p>- It is important to show the co-localization of aggregates with the lysosome. This is shown in supplements but should be in a main figure. Here the authors cite previous work indicating that ProteoStat puncta co-localize with ubiquitinated proteins and state that they do not see this, then essentially just move on. Is there an explanation for this discrepancy and can it be resolved? What do they think is really going on? What happens to levels of ubiquitinated proteins when lipid metabolism is perturbed as in these experiments?</p></disp-quote><p>We have included the lipid-induced lysosomal protein aggregation data in the main text (Figure 3A-B), and provided fine-grained quantification of the cytosolic-vs-lysosomal ProteoStat / Ub / ThT signals under different aggregate-inducing conditions (Figure S4A-D). We discuss these results in the main text and propose a model involving ESCRT-mediated microautophagy in the main text. This is supported further by the LysoIP-proteomics and LMP analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Please add an indicator of amino acid numbers to Fig. 3C.</p></disp-quote><p>These annotations are now included (now Figure S3C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The legend for 3D is mislabelled.</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected the legend (now Figure S3D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Protein homeostasis and lipid homeostasis are both are important for maintaining cellular functions. However, the crosstalk remains largely unknown. The manuscript entitled as &quot;Impairment of lipid homoeostasis causes accumulation of protein aggregates in the lysosome&quot; deals with this interesting topic. An important link between lysosomal protein aggregation and sphingolipids/cholesterol esters metabolism were discovered. The topic belonging to the Cell Biology domain also falls into the aims and scope of eLife. Here are the revisions I recommend:</p><p>(1) From lipidomics analysis, a remarkable correlation between levels of sphingomyelin and cholesterol ester and ProteoStat staining was found. Could the authors explain how sphingomyelin and cholesterol ester are quantified? The two lipids are not included as internal standards from the lipidomics experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>Sphingomyelin and cholesterol ester internal standards are included in the Avanti 330707 SPLASH LIPIDOMIX Mass Spec Standard, which was supplied at 3% v/v to the MeOH/H2O cell lysis buffer. We have amended the Methods section to clarify this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Could the authors perhaps delete Figure 1B and show it on Figure 2A only? There is no need to show the same figure two times. The threshold of both False Discovery Rate and Median Enrichment needs to be added. From Figure 2A, the Lysosomal hydrolases (GBA, LIPA, GALC) seems located in statistically insignificant region. Based on previous studies, the GBA could have an effect on sphingolipid levels, then how to explain that sphingomyelin was highly correlated with ProteoSate staining?</p></disp-quote><p>We have combined the two volcano plots into a single figure (now Figure 1D), and added a line to help visualize the gene effects while considering the combined contribution of FDR and enrichment. Individual lysosomal hydrolases indeed have insignificant effects on ProteoStat and this is discussed in the main text as having relatively constrained impacts on the general lipidome. For example, while GBA and GALC KDs can lead to accumulation of their immediate substrates (glucosylceramide and galactosylceramide, respectively), they do not directly impinge on sphingomyelin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors show the corelation between ProteoState staining and different lipids/lipid classes in Figure 3B and Figure S3A. It is not necessary to show the corelation with individual lipids (such as sphingomyelin(d18:1/24:0) and cholesterol ester(18:2)). The corelation with full collection of lipid classes would be more representative, which is only list in Figure 3B and Figure S3A. It is suggested to add the information of how many individual lipids in each chass are used for the correlation analysis. Replace Figure 3A to Figure S3A, and put Figure 3A as supplementary figure are suggested.</p></disp-quote><p>We decided to retain the correlation of two individual lipids (a sphingomyelin and a cholesterol ester species) with ProteoStat as examples to illustrate with clarity how we obtained the class-wide comparison. The number of individual lipids included in each class for correlation analysis is now included in Figures 2F and S3A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors state that lipid uptake and metabolism modulate proteostasis. However, only cholesterol and LDL were tested. It would be more precise to state as cholesterol uptake and metabolism modulate proteostasis. In addition, sphingolipids and cholesterol esters accumulate with increased lysosomal protein aggregation. It would be interesting to see the effects of sphingolipids uptake, since sphingolipids are correlated with proteostasis better than cholesterol.</p></disp-quote><p>We attempted to add back specific sphingolipids to assess sufficiency. However, we found it challenging to ensure that these lipids were distributed to the correct subcellular locations at physiologically relevant levels. Without this crucial information, it was difficult to draw any conclusions about the sufficiency of the sphingolipids we tested to impair proteostasis.</p><p>Alonso A, Goñi FM. 2018.
