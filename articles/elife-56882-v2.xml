cytomegaloviruses (CMVs), through pattern-recognition receptor (PRR) pathways involving MyD88 or STING constitute a first-line defense against infections mainly through production of type I interferon (IFN-I). However, the role of these pathways in different tissues is incompletely understood, an issue particularly relevant to the CMVs which have broad tissue tropisms. Herein, we contrasted anti-viral effects of MyD88 versus STING in distinct cell types that are infected with murine CMV (MCMV). Bone marrow chimeras revealed STING-mediated MCMV control in hematological cells, similar to MyD88. However, unlike MyD88, STING also contributed to viral control in non-hematological, stromal cells. Infected splenic stromal cells produced IFN-I in a cGAS-STING-dependent and MyD88-independent manner, while we confirmed plasmacytoid dendritic cell IFN-I had inverse requirements. MCMV-induced natural killer cytotoxicity was dependent on MyD88 and STING. Thus, MyD88 and STING contribute to MCMV control in distinct cell types that initiate downstream immune responses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cytomegalovirus</kwd><kwd>MyD88</kwd><kwd>STING</kwd><kwd>type I interferon</kwd><kwd>NK cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-AI131680</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yokoyama</surname><given-names>Wayne M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Rubicon grant 825.11.004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Piersma</surname><given-names>Sytse J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cytomegaloviruses are recognized by distinct sensors depending on the infected cell type and together these sensors are essential for viral control and downstream immune responses.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Viral infections can be detected by specialized pattern recognition receptors, which recognize viral structures that are unique or otherwise absent in the subcellular location where they are detected. Nucleic acids from DNA-viruses can be detected in various organelles during infection. Some DNA viruses pass through endolysosomes where viral DNA can be recognized by toll-like receptors (TLRs), in particular TLR9, which signals through MyD88 and induces a type I interferon (IFN-I) response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hemmi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Motwani et al., 2019</xref>). In the cytosol, infection results in exposure of viral DNA that can be recognized by cytosolic DNA sensors including cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bürckstümmer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schoggins et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tan et al., 2018</xref>). cGAS signals through STING and initiates an IFN-I response, whereas AIM2 activates caspase I and instigates an IL-1β and IL-18 responses. The TLRs and AIM2 pathways are primarily active in specific immune cell types. In contrast, the STING-cGAS pathway appear to be active in a broader range but not all cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Motwani et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thomsen et al., 2016</xref>). Yet, it is unclear how activation of these pathways in different cell types contributes to viral control.</p><p>The IFN-I that is produced in response to viral recognition plays a central role in protection against acute infection. IFN-I mediates its anti-viral effects through stimulation of the interferon receptor, comprising of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, and downstream STAT molecules. The resulting IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) induce an anti-viral state, affecting cell survival and viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">González-Navajas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McNab et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, IFN-I is critical for orchestrating the subsequent innate and adaptive immune responses, through modulation of cell attraction, activation, and priming. Although human deficiencies in the IFN-I pathway are very rare, evidence suggest that IFN-I could protect against viral infections in humans. Individuals with mutations in <italic>IFNAR2</italic> and <italic>STAT2</italic> have relatively mild symptoms after infection, even though they can develop severe illness in response to live vaccines and can have recurrent viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duncan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hambleton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moens et al., 2017</xref>). However, these deficiencies likely do not completely nullify IFN-I effects because IFNβ can signal through IFNAR1 without requiring IFNAR2 and IFN-I can signal through STAT2-independent pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Weerd et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">González-Navajas et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, other loss-of-function mutations that affect the IFN-I pathway have been described to enhance susceptibility to virus infection, including IRF7, IRF3, IRF9, and STAT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bravo García-Morato et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chapgier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ciancanelli et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hernandez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Thomsen et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Thomsen et al., 2019b</xref>). Thus, IFN-I is critical to control viral infections, but it remains unclear what pathways contribute to viral control.</p><p>In this regard, studies of infections with the beta-herpesvirus cytomegalovirus (CMV), have been informative. Infection with human CMV (HCMV) is nearly ubiquitous worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cannon et al., 2010</xref>). HCMV is controlled and establishes latency in healthy individuals, but HCMV can cause life-threatening disease in immunocompromised patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Griffiths et al., 2015</xref>). Despite a broad tropism that allows CMV to infect a wide range of cell types, CMV is highly species-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krmpotic et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sinzger et al., 2008</xref>). Murine CMV (MCMV) in particular shares key features with HCMV and has been instructive for dissecting cytomegalovirus pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krmpotic et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Picarda and Benedict, 2018</xref>). Indeed, a recent case study described a patient with deficiencies in both <italic>IFNAR1</italic> and <italic>IFNGR2</italic> who presented with bacteremia and CMV viremia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hoyos-Bachiloglu et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with these findings, mice deficient in <italic>Ifnar1</italic> and <italic>Ifngr1</italic> are highly susceptible to MCMV in 129Sv and C57BL/6 strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gil et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Presti et al., 1998</xref>). <italic>Ifnar1</italic> deficiency in isolation resulted in a 100-fold increased MCMV susceptibility whereas <italic>Ifngr1</italic> deficiency did not, indicating that IFN-I plays a dominant role in controlling acute CMV infections. IFN-I production during acute MCMV infection is biphasic; initial IFN-I production peaks at 8 hr post infection (p.i.) with a second peak at 36–48 hours p.i. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Delale et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schneider et al., 2008</xref>). STING has been implicated in the initial IFN-I response. STING-deficient mice have decreased systemic IFNβ at 12 hours p.i. and 5-fold increased viral load at 36 hours p.i. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lio et al., 2016</xref>). A recent study implicated Kupffer cells to be the main source for IFNβ in the liver 4 hours p.i. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tegtmeyer et al., 2019</xref>). Besides the aforementioned immune cells, stromal cells are thought to be a major source for IFN-I in the spleen at 8 hours p.i. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schneider et al., 2008</xref>). By contrast, MyD88-dependent pathways have been implicated in IFN-I production during the second wave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Delale et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Krug et al., 2004</xref>). IFN-I production by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) is dependent on TLR7 and TLR9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hokeness-Antonelli et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Krug et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zucchini et al., 2008b</xref>). Consistent with the role of pDCs in IFN-I production, MyD88 is required in the hematological compartment in bone marrow chimeras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Puttur et al., 2016</xref>). However, it has been unknown which sensing pathway is responsible for IFN-I induction in the stroma and how each contributes to control MCMV infection in different tissues.</p><p>Besides its direct anti-viral effects, IFN-I is crucial for optimal NK cell function during viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Orange and Biron, 1996</xref>). NK cells play a critical role in controlling MCMV infection in C57BL/6 mice, which is dependent on interactions between the Ly49H NK cell activation receptor and its MCMV-encoded ligand m157 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arase et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smith et al., 2002</xref>). However, this interaction is not sufficient to allow NK cell control of MCMV infection. IL-12 and IFN-I produced early during MCMV infection induce granzyme B and perforin protein expression in NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fehniger et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nguyen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Parikh et al., 2015</xref>), which allows them to efficiently kill virus-infected cells upon recognition of m157 through Ly49H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Parikh et al., 2015</xref>). IL-12 and IFN-I also induce IFNγ transcription, which is required for activation receptor-dependent IFNγ production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Piersma et al., 2019</xref>). In the absence of MyD88, Ly49H<sup>+</sup> NK cells can compensate for suboptimal IFN-I production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cocita et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that low levels of IFN-I can still enhance NK-mediated control of MCMV. However, which MCMV-sensing pathway contributes to the NK cell response is still unclear.</p><p>In the current study, we analyzed survival, viral titers, IFN-I production and NK cell responses in mice deficient in MyD88, STING or both. We also determined the contribution of both signaling pathways in different tissues to their anti-viral effects, and elucidated a role for cGAS in these responses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MyD88 and STING-dependent pathways control MCMV infection in vivo</title><p>We set out to investigate the relative contribution of STING- versus MyD88-dependent pathways in controlling MCMV infection by analyzing the morbidity and mortality in wildtype C57BL/6 (WT), MyD88-deficient (MyD88 KO), and STING-deficient (STING GT) mice as well as mice deficient in both MyD88 and STING (DKO) that were infected with 50,000 PFU MCMV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Consistent with previously published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lio et al., 2016</xref>), WT mice lost approximately 10% of weight by 3 days p.i. after which they recovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Here we observed that STING GT mice showed more pronounced weight loss compared to WT mice, but were also able to recover. Consistent with previously published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Delale et al., 2005</xref>), MyD88 KO mice showed delayed weight loss as compared to WT mice, indicating that the initial weight loss in WT mice was caused by immunopathology mediated by MyD88. The weight curves of DKO mice overlapped with MyD88 KO mice, suggesting that STING-mediated responses do not contribute to immunopathology. Both WT and STING GT mice were able to control and survive viral infection upon challenge with MCMV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). MyD88 KO mice were moderately resistant to the infection as 37% of the mice died between days 6 and 7. In contrast, the majority (70%) of DKO mice succumbed to the infection. Thus, both STING and MyD88 significantly contribute to control of MCMV infection in vivo.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>MyD88 and STING control morbidity and mortality during MCMV infection.</title><p>Mice were infected with 50,000 PFU MCMV WT-1, weight loss and survival was monitored over time.

In the spleen, we observed a modest but significant increase (6.9-fold) in viral load in MyD88 KO mice two days p.i., whereas the spleens of DKO mice contained 84-fold higher viral copies compared to WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lio et al., 2016</xref>), we observed a 3.5-fold increase in viral load in the spleens of STING GT versus WT controls, but this difference did not reach statistical significance.

We did not observe significant differences in STING-deficient animals, but we observed a 23-fold increase in viral load in DKO spleens compared to MyD88 KO, indicating that STING contributes to viral control in the absence of MyD88. In the liver, we were unable to detect significant differences in viral load at 2 days p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

We also observed that the contribution of MyD88 in the hematological compartment was particularly overt in the absence of STING, revealed by comparison of DKO BM into STING GT host versus STING GT BM into STING GT host, which resulted in a 3882-fold difference in the spleen and 344-fold in the liver, respectively. STING also had anti-viral effects in the hematological compartment, evident by comparing DKO BM into STING GT host versus MyD88 KO BM into STING GT host, which revealed a 59-fold difference in the spleen. STING played also a role in the radio-resistant compartment in both spleen and liver, revealed by comparison of DKO BM into WT host versus DKO BM into STING GT host, for which we observed a 49-fold and 24-fold differences in the spleen and liver, respectively. Jointly, the BM chimeras reveal an evident role for MyD88 in the hematological compartment, while STING contributes to viral control in both the hematological and radio-resistant compartments, most explicitly in the spleen.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Multiple cell populations produce IFN-I in response upon MCMV infection</title><p>Type I IFNs are induced in response to triggering of pathogen recognition receptors that signal through MyD88 and STING and are key players in the initial anti-viral response. To investigate the IFN-I response in virus-infected cells we made use of a reporter virus that expresses GFP under the IE1 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Henry et al., 2000</xref>). We analyzed initial times (8- and 36 hours p.i.) and focused on stromal cell and CD11c+ dendritic cell (DC) populations, which are the major cell types infected at these timepoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hsu et al., 2009</xref>). Consistent with previous published data, we detected infection of the stromal cell but not CD45+CD11c+ compartment at 8 hours p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). At 36 hours p.i., the percentage of infected stromal cells increased substantially and infected CD45<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells were detected as well. Infected CD45<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells included among others conventional dendritic cells (cDC) and plasmacytoid DC (pDC) populations. Based on these data, we sorted and analyzed infected and uninfected populations at 36 hours p.i. for IFNα and IFNβ transcripts by quantitative PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

By contrast, here we found that STING GT mice did not significantly affect pDC IFNβ production, indicating that MyD88 functions in these cells without requiring STING-dependent pathways.

Indeed, splenic fibroblasts readily expressed 8000-fold increase in <italic>Ifnb1</italic> transcripts by qPCR at 8 hours p.i. To determine the role of key innate sensing components, we used mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) that were genetically deficient in these components. Consistent with primary splenic fibroblasts, MEF expressed <italic>Ifnb1</italic> transcripts upon MCMV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), reaching levels similar to those detected in primary splenic fibroblasts. We further observed that <italic>Ifnb1</italic> expression was independent of MyD88 and TRIF, indicating that TLRs do not contribute to IFNβ production in fibroblasts even though <italic>Ifnb1</italic> expression was dependent on IRF3/7 and TBK1, which is consistent with cytosolic sensing of MCMV. Using MEF lines with two different mutations in STING (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ishikawa and Barber, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sauer et al., 2011</xref>), we found that the IFNB1 response was instead dependent on STING. However, IFNB1 production was independent of MAVS (also known as CARDIF and IPS-1), suggesting that the IFN-response is independent of the cytosolic RNA sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tan et al., 2018</xref>). Finally, we investigated the role of cytosolic DNA sensors and found that fibroblast sensing of MCMV was dependent on cGAS, but independent of ZBP1 and DNA-PK. To confirm that the cGAS pathway is involved in adult splenic stromal cells, we analyzed <italic>Ifnb1</italic> expression in cGAS-deficient primary splenic fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Indeed, cGAS-deficient splenic fibroblasts were unable to express <italic>Ifnb1</italic> in response to MCMV challenge, indicating that the STING-cGAS-dependent pathway is responsible for the IFNβ response in the stromal cell compartment. To validate that these pathways are also involved in IFNβ protein production and secretion, we analyzed cell culture supernatants at 48 hours p.i. with MCMV MOI 0.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). WT MEF secreted IFNβ in response to MCMV infection, but neither STING nor cGAS-deficient MEFs produced IFNβ.

Moreover, IL-12 production in response to MCMV has been reported to be dependent on MyD88 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Krug et al., 2004</xref>), and thus contributed to the phenotypes observed in MyD88 KO mice independent of IFN-I. Here we investigated the role of MyD88 and STING in increasing NK cell reactivity during MCMV infection. Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fehniger et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Orange et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Parikh et al., 2015</xref>), we observed increased levels of NK cell GzB, Prf and IFNγ at 48 hours p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). At this time point, NK cell production of IFNγ is reportedly dependent on IL-18, which signals through MyD88 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adachi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pien et al., 2000</xref>). Indeed, NK cell IFNγ production was dependent on MyD88, whereas STING did not impair IFNγ production, and rather increased the IFNγ response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This potentially could be due to a relatively small increase in viral load at these timepoints. Expression of both GzB and Prf followed a similar pattern, as the vast majority of increased expression was dependent on MyD88, whereas STING did not overtly contribute to the production of these lytic proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Finally, we analyzed NK cell cytolytic capacity using a 3 hr in vivo target cell rejection assay. We previously reported that MCMV increased m157-target cell rejection in an IL-12- and IFN-I-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Parikh et al., 2015</xref>). Consistent with our previous data, m157-specific target cell rejection increased 3 days post-MCMV infection from 50% to 80% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). MHC-I-deficient cell (‘missing self’) rejection was higher and increased from 30% to 90%. MyD88 KO or STING GT mice did not display substantial differences in target cell rejection, but DKO mice substantially decreased NK cell cytolytic capacity with m157-specific rejection showing levels of uninfected mice. Similarly, MHC-I-deficient rejection was decreased in double versus single deficient mice. Together, these data indicate that both MyD88 and STING-dependent pathways contribute to NK cell cytolytic potential, albeit that MyD88 predominantly affects production of Prf and GzB.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>MyD88 and STING are required for NK cell cytolytic capacity during MCMV infection.</title><p>(<bold>A and B</bold>) Mice deficient in MyD88 and/or STING were infected with MCMV and 2 days later splenocytes were harvested and analyzed for GzmB, Prf1, and IFNγ expression by FACS.

While we confirmed the strong role of MyD88 in the hematological compartment, especially in splenic pDCs, we found that STING contributes in both the hematological and the previously unappreciated stromal cell compartment. Using primary splenic stromal cell cultures, we identified a role for cGAS-STING-dependent, but MyD88-independent IFN-I production in response to MCMV infection. Finally, we found that both MyD88 and STING-dependent pathways contribute to increased NK cell cytolytic function during infection. Thus, our findings indicate that cytomegalovirus infection is sensed by distinct sensing pathway depending on the infected cell type and that these pathways constitute a multi-layer antiviral defense.</p><p>Cytomegaloviruses have a broad tropism and a broad range of infected cell types have the capacity to produce IFN-I in response to infection. However, IFN-I production has been most well characterized in myeloid cells, including pDCs and Kupffer cells. IFN-I production by pDCs upon MCMV infection in vitro and in vivo is dependent on TLR9 and MyD88 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Krug et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tomasello et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zucchini et al., 2008b</xref>). Using IFNβ reporter mice, we were able to confirm that pDCs were the major source of IFNβ in the spleen and that this was dependent on MyD88. Furthermore, we observed that this IFN-I production was independent of STING. Early after infection, Kupffer cells in the liver produce IFN-I in a STING-dependent, but TLR-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tegtmeyer et al., 2019</xref>). Hepatocytes are a major target for infection by MCMV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sacher et al., 2008</xref>), yet they do not induce detectable levels of IFNβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tegtmeyer et al., 2019</xref>). However, hepatocytes do not express STING (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thomsen et al., 2016</xref>), likely explaining the lack of IFNβ production in hepatocytes in response to MCMV infection. In our bone marrow chimeras, we observed a role for STING in the radioresistant compartment in the liver. Hepatic stromal cells, including endothelial cells, are infected with MCMV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sacher et al., 2008</xref>), providing likely contributors, apart from hepatocytes per se, to control MCMV in a STING-dependent manner in the liver.</p><p>MCMV is known to induce strong MyD88-dependent IFN-I responses in pDCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Krug et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zucchini et al., 2008a</xref>). Consistent with these results, we observed both <italic>Ifna</italic> and <italic>Ifnb1</italic> transcripts, particularly in infected CD45<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells. We also observed equal expression of <italic>Ifna</italic> in the uninfected compartment. IFNα as well as IL-12 have been shown previously to be primarily produced by purified pDCs that were not productively infected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dalod et al., 2003</xref>). Intriguingly, <italic>Ifnb1</italic> transcripts were much lower in the uninfected compartment as compared to the infected compartment. There was a trend in increased <italic>Ifnb1</italic> transcripts in uninfected CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells from infected versus uninfected mice, but this did not reach statistical significance. The observed difference in IFNα versus IFNβ production is remarkable; specifically, the IFN-I production by the pDCs that are not productively infected could be due to multiple reasons. IFN-I can act to produce more IFN-I as part of a positive feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McNab et al., 2015</xref>). However, this loop does not appear to play a major role in pDC after MCMV infection, as IFN-I receptor-deficient pDC in mixed bone marrow chimeras express similar levels of <italic>Ifna</italic> and <italic>Ifnb1</italic> as WT pDC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tomasello et al., 2018</xref>). The <italic>Ifna</italic> production by the uninfected CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells could be the result of non-productive infection that did not result in IE1expression that was used to detect infected GFP<sup>+</sup> cells. Alternatively, pDC may take up apoptotic bodies from infected cells or pDC may receive other signals delivered by neighboring infected cells. Which of these or other causes underlie IFN-I production by uninfected (GFP<sup>-</sup>) cells warrants further investigation.</p><p>We observed a stronger effect of STING in the splenic stromal cell compartment compared to the liver stromal cell compartment. IFN-I produced by splenic stromal cells have previously been reported to be dependent on lymphotoxin (LT) β expression by B cells, independent of TLR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sacher et al., 2008</xref>). Consistent with these findings, our findings revealed that stromal cell IFN-I is cGAS-STING-dependent. Besides the anti-viral role for STING in the stromal cell compartment, we observed that IFN-I production by infected primary splenic stromal cells was cGAS-STING-dependent. The primary stromal cells did not require interactions with B cells to produce IFN-I in vitro. However, it remains to be determined how LT intersects with the STING pathway in vivo, particularly since LT has been reported to be required for cell survival during MCMV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banks et al., 2005</xref>), potentially providing a window where infected stromal cells survive long enough to produce IFN-I. Additional studies are required to further define these experimentally complex interactions.</p><p>Herpesviruses dedicate a large part of their genome to immune evasion strategies, including strategies that act on cellular immunity and intrinsic cellular defenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Powers et al., 2008</xref>). MCMV has been reported to interfere with the DNA sensing pathway at different steps, m152 binds to STING and interferes with its trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stempel et al., 2019</xref>), whereas m35 targets NFκB-mediated transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2017</xref>). Deletion of these ORFs individually in MCMV resulted in stronger IFN-I responses upon infection in vivo. Infection with MCMV deleted in both ORFs potentially increased STING-dependent viral control and may facilitate visualization of the IFN-I production by the cell types under study. Despite these immune evasion strategies, WT MCMV induced an IFN-I response that was potent enough to control infection, therefore we chose to use WT MCMV in the current study.</p><p>Infection with lethal dose of MCMV resulted in about a third of the MyD88-deficient mice succumbing to infection, which is consistent with previously published results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Delale et al., 2005</xref>). The impact of MyD88-deficiency on mortality and viral load was greater than STING-deficiency, which coincided with a bigger proportion of the IFN-I response was dependent on MyD88 as compared to STING. Consistent with these findings, markers for NK cell activation were mostly MyD88-dependent, whereas STING did not have a strong effect. Taken together, our data suggest that MyD88 induces a strong IFN-I response, whereas STING mediates a more moderate IFN-I response, likely contributing to more moderate morbidity in its absence as compared to MyD88-deficency. A recent study did not observe a lethality phenotype in mice deficient in MyD88 and TRIF, unless mice also lacked MAVS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tegtmeyer et al., 2019</xref>). The latter study utilized tissue culture-derived MCMV in contrast to salivary gland extracted MCMV in the former and our study. Additionally, Tegtmeyer et al. used a mutant MCMV that lacked m157, whereas we used m157-sufficient virus for infections monitoring survival. Since IFN-I impacts NK cell-dependent MCMV-control via m157 recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Parikh et al., 2015</xref>), the use of WT MCMV allowed us to evaluate the effect of the virus-sensing pathways on NK cell function.</p><p>MyD88 KO mice have been reported to have a delay in initial weight loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Delale et al., 2005</xref>), we observed a similar delay in weight loss in MyD88 KO and in DKO mice. STING did not cause any such overt immunopathology, indicating that this phenomenon may be specific to MyD88-dependent pathways. Moreover, the immunopathology is likely independent of IFN-I as a recent study showed that IFNAR-deficient mice still displayed early weight loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tegtmeyer et al., 2019</xref>). Additional research is required to better understand the MyD88-mediated initial weight loss in MCMV infected animals.</p><p>IFN-I and IL-12 produced in response to MCMV infection are required for full NK cell cytolytic capacity, through induction of GzB and Prf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Parikh et al., 2015</xref>). Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Krug et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Puttur et al., 2016</xref>), we found that MyD88-deficient mice expressed low levels of NK cell GzB, Prf and IFNγ in response to MCMV infection but NK cytolytic potential in vivo was not substantially affected, consistent with previously published results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cocita et al., 2015</xref>). However, MCMV-infected mice deficient in both STING and MyD88 displayed reduced NK cell cytolytic activity against m157-expressing and MHC-I-deficient target splenocytes. Thus, MyD88- and STING-dependent sensing of MCMV both contribute to signal to NK cells to enhance their cytolytic function in order to efficiently clear MCMV-infected target cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, C57BL/6 background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>C57BL/6</td><td>Charles River Laboratories</td><td>556; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:2160593">MGI:2160593</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, BALB/c background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>BALB/c</td><td>Charles River Laboratories</td><td>555; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:2160915">MGI:2160915</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, C57BL/6 background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>STING golden ticket</td><td>Jackson Laboratories</td><td>017537; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:017537">IMSR_JAX:017537</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, C57BL/6 background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>IFNβ-YFP reporter mice</td><td>Jackson Laboratories</td><td>010818; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:010818">IMSR_JAX:010818</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, C57BL/6 background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>DNA-PK SCID</td><td>Jackson Laboratories</td><td>001913; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:001913">IMSR_JAX:001913</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, C57BL/6 background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>Β2m KO</td><td>Jackson Laboratories</td><td>002087; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:002087">IMSR_JAX:002087</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, C57BL/6 background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>M157-Tg</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tripathy et al., 2008</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, C57BL/6 background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>H-2K<sup>b</sup> x H-2D<sup>b</sup> KO</td><td>Taconic</td><td>4215; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_TAC:4215">IMSR_TAC:4215</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, C57BL/6 background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>MyD88 KO</td><td>S.

the role of TLR-MyD88 and cGAS-STING pathways in control of cytomegalovirus infection in different cells/tissues. Using the model of bone marrow chimeras, the authors demonstrated the capacity of both pathways in virus control in hematopoietic cells, while virus control in splenic stromal cells was dependent on cGAS-STING pathway, but independent of TLR-MyD88 pathway. Also, CMV-induced NK cell cytotoxicity in vivo depends on both the cGAS-STING and the TLR-MyD88 pathway. While the role of MyD88-TLR pathway in hematopoetic cells was previously shown, the novelty of present study lies in the fact that MyD88 and STING contribute to virus control in distinct cell types that initiate downstream immune responses.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Virus infection is controlled by cell type-specific sensing of murine cytomegalovirus through MyD88 and STING&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been evaluated by three reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers and editors.</p><p>Based on these discussions and the summary of reviews below, we reached the conclusion that your study is of general interest for <italic>eLife</italic>. However, although all reviewers are essentially positive, they raised several queries which require your attention and additional information before the manuscript can be considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The major concern of the reviewers is whether your study has sufficient novelty compared to published work to warrant publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Therefore, please address all the queries raised by reviewers. Below please find the summary from reviewer's and editor's comments.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Previous studies have already shown cell type-dependent differences in the necessity of distinct pattern recognition receptors to sense MCMV infection, whereas this study specifically focuses on the role of STING- and MyD88-mediated responses in hematological and non-hematological cells. Using STING-deficient goldenticket, MyD88-/- and double knockout mice, the authors have shown that both pathways are critical to elicit an immune response strong enough to control MCMV infection. Moreover, in accordance with previous publications, the authors present data that stromal cells induce cGAS-STING-dependent responses to MCMV infection, while plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) rely on the presence of the adaptor protein MyD88 to combat infection. Furthermore, by analyzing NK activity markers, such as Perforin and Granzyme B, the authors showed that NK cell cytolytic activity is dependent on both, STING- and MyD88-mediated responses. Altogether, the main findings can be summarized as follows: (i) BM chimeras show dependence on two distinct pathways in hematopoietic cells triggered by endosomal and cytosolic recognition, mediated by the TLR-MyD88 and cGAS-STING pathways; (ii) stromal cells (mainly splenic) contribute to the cGAS-STING IFN-I pathway, but not TLR-MyD88 pathway; (iii) hematopoietic dendritic cells (mainly pDC) contribute to the TLR-MyD88-dependent IFN-I pathway, but not cGAS-STING pathway; (iv) NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity of m157+ and MHC-I- targets in MCMV-infected mice was dependent upon both the cGAS-STING and TLR-MyD88 pathways to facilitate enhanced clearance in vivo. In addition, they show that cell-autonomous production of IFNb can be distinguished from paracrine effects related to secondary IFNa production in hematopoietic cells, such as pDC, in the fact that the former is TLR-MyD88-dependent but cGAS-STING-independent.</p><p>The manuscript is well written and the experiments performed are solid. However, the reviewers seriously question the novelty as compared to current knowledge in the field (Schneider et al., Krug et al., Lio et al., Tegtmeyer et al.). Although the results on cytosolic sensing can be considered as novel, the results on MyD88-dependent sensing by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) are more confirmatory and therefore the authors should pay attention to properly cite important previous studies as well as accordingly interpret their own data.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 1A/B: In Figure 1A, the authors display weight loss over 10 days post MCMV challenge, however, 70% of the DKO mice die after 6 days (Figure 1B). The figure legend states that 14 DKO mice were used for this figure. Of course, these are different data sets, however, mortality rate will be comparable. Are these data points shown in Figure 1A combined from 14 individual mice monitored over 10 days, or were 14 mice used in the beginning of the experiment and the later days only display the weight loss of the surviving mice?</p><p>2) Figure 2B and Figure 2—figure supplement 1A: The increased replication of MCMV in MyD88-deficient mice 5 dpi is not consistent. While Figure 2B shows a clear and significant increase in MCMV IE1 copy numbers in MyD88-/- mice, this difference is not apparent in Figure 2—figure supplement 1A. Can the authors clarify these differences, are there any other experimental changes (besides the viral dose which should not affect the results this much) which can cause these varieties.</p><p>3) Figure 3C: The IFNa transcription in uninfected GFP-DCs is very interesting. While the authors have concluded a potential feedforward loop, it would be straightforward to test if this response is induced due to the initial burst of type I IFN (IFNb) in other cell types. IFNAR KO mice would indicate if DCs are initiating IFNa transcription depending on type I IFN or if other cytokines are involved in this induction. The induction of IFNa in uninfected cells is underappreciated and suggests an important role to combat MCMV infection. This should be investigated further.</p><p>4) The vast majority of the pDC producing IFN-I and IL-12 during MCMV infection are not infected. The authors state in several instances that the pDC sensing MCMV in vivo to produce IFN-I are infected but the paper does not contain any clear and robust data supporting this statement. &quot;we investigated anti-viral effects.… in distinct cell types that are infected.…&quot;, &quot;findings indicate that cytomegalovirus infection is sensed by distinct sensing pathway depending on the infected cell type.…&quot;. The data used to document pDC infection is largely insufficient. In Figure 3A, pDC are defined as CD45+ CD11c(low) cells. This is not proper. Many other cell types share the same phenotype in the spleen, after MCMV infection, encompassing a sizeable fraction of classical monocytes, some macrophages, NK cells and mature classical DCs that have downregulated CD11c. Even if a fraction of pDC were infected, no data is shown to prove that these are the one producing IFN-I. The vast majority of the pDC sensing MCMV in vivo during the infection to produce IFN-I and IL-12 were previously shown not to be infected (Dalod et al., 2003. Hence, the authors must correct their wrong statements and cite this paper. This comment could be dealt by properly editing text in manuscript.</p><p>5) Uninfected pDC produce high levels of IFN-β. The authors state that &quot;<italic>Ifnb1</italic> transcripts are specifically produced in response to viral detection in infected DCs as well as stromal cells&quot;. This is a misinterpretation of the data shown on Figure 3B. First, expression of the <italic>Ifnb1</italic> transcripts in GFP- CD45+CD11c+ cells is at least as high as in the CD45-GFP+ cells. Second, only a fraction of the GFP- CD45+CD11c+ cells are IFN-I-producing pDC, leading to an large underestimation of their <italic>Ifnb1</italic> expression. <italic>Ifnb1</italic> transcripts are highly expressed in pDC properly purified from the spleen of MCMV-infected mice (Zucchini et al., 2008a). Moreover, later in the paper, by using <italic>Ifnb1</italic>-EYFP reporter mice, the authors do show that &quot;Approximately 20% of the pDCs were YFP+, indicating at least this percentage of infected pDCs produced IFNβ in response to MCMV infection, whereas much fewer cDCs produced IFNb because less than 1% of cDCs were YFP+ (Figure 4B)&quot;. Hence this observation from the authors combined with the known fact that IFN-I-producing pDC are not infected shows that uninfected pDC are the major expressers of <italic>Ifnb1</italic>. This comment could be dealt by properly editing text in manuscript.</p><p>6) Uninfected pDC do not require a feedforward loop to produce high levels of IFN-I.</p><p>The authors state &quot;These data suggest that <italic>Ifna</italic> transcripts in uninfected DCs are produced (in part) as a feedforward loop (McNab et al., 2015)&quot;. This is incorrect. The vast majority of <italic>Ifna</italic> transcripts produced around 36 hours during MCMV infection arise from uninfected pDC that have been rigorously proven not to require the IFNAR1-dependent feedforward loop for this function (Tomasello et al., 2018). This comment could be dealt by properly editing text in manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56882.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] The manuscript is well written and the experiments performed are solid.

As pointed out by the editor, the novel findings of the manuscript included the following: contribution of both TLR-MyD88 and cGAS-STING pathway in the hematopoietic compartment on viral control using bone marrow chimeras; the role of mainly splenic stromal cells in viral control dependent on the cGAS-STING pathway, but not the TLR-MyD88 pathway; absence of the requirement of the cGAS-STING pathway for pDC IFN-I production; and MCMV-induced NK cell cytotoxicity in vivo depends on both the cGAS-STING and the TLR-MyD88 pathway.</p><p>We described the role of the MyD88-TLR pathway in pDC in this manuscript specifically to contrast with the cGAS-STING pathway, revealing its role in other cell types. As such, we agree that the findings on the role of the MyD88-TLR pathway in pDC are largely confirmatory. To better make our points, we de-emphasized the findings on the MyD88-TLR pathway in pDC by changing the title of the manuscript; indicating that the findings on pDC are confirmatory, for example in the Abstract; and including a new paragraph in the Discussion section that discusses additional references on pDC that were suggested by the reviewers.</p><p>As pointed out by the editor, our findings on the cGAS-STING pathway in stromal cells is novel. The role of the cGAS-STING pathway in control of MCMV infection has previously been reported by Lio et al. and by Tegtmeyer et al., but its role in different cellular compartments on viral control was not investigated in those studies. Schneider et al. previously investigated MCMV-induced IFN-I production by stromal cells. Our work now shows that stromal cell IFN-I is dependent on the cGAS-STING pathway and robustly contributes to viral control, in particular in the absence of MyD88 in the hematological compartment.</p><p>Taken together, we believe that our work provides new understanding of viral sensing, in particular in non-immune stromal cells, and its effects on viral control.</p><p>Our response to the specific comments from the reviewers are given below:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 1A/B: In Figure 1A, the authors display weight loss over 10 days post MCMV challenge, however, 70% of the DKO mice die after 6 days (Figure 1B).

Delale et al. reported that a 2.5-fold increase in MCMV dosing increased mortality in MyD88 KO and in TLR9 KO mice from 50% to 100% and from 20% to 100%, respectively (Delale et al., 2005). The experiments in Figure 2B and Figure 2—figure supplement 1 were independent experiments performed on different days. We did use the same batch of virus, the mice were all similar age, and both graphs are made up of 50% males and females, with no overt differences between sexes. We included these details in Author response table 1. We hypothesize that these findings are a result of the viral doses used in our studies, that are likely around the threshold to control infection.</p><p>The experimental details for these experiments were as follows:</p><p>Author response table 1</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 3C: The IFNa transcription in uninfected GFP-DCs is very interesting.

Of note, as pointed out by the reviewer in comment 4, the sorted CD11c+ cells include more cell types than just DCs. In similar experiments, GFP- DCs have previously been reported to secrete IFNα and IL-12 (Dalod et al., 2003). Yet, unresolved is what could potentially underly differences between IFNa and IFNb. As pointed out by the reviewer in comment 6, the IFNa production has been reported to be independent of a feedforward loop (Tomasello et al., 2018). Several other causes may underly the IFNα production in GFP- DCs, including non-productive viral infection that did not result in IE1 expression, uptake of apoptotic bodies from infected cells, or other signals delivered by neighboring infected cells. These hypotheses warrant further investigation, but were beyond the scope of this manuscript. Also, please note that we have restrictions on laboratory work at our institution due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>We revised the Discussion to address these comments as well as comments 4-6 and added the following paragraph which also contains statements related to these other comments below.</p><p>“MCMV is known to induce strong MyD88-dependent IFN-I responses in pDCs (Krug et al., 2004; Zucchini et al., 2008a). […] Alternatively, pDC may take up apoptotic bodies from infected cells or pDC may receive other signals delivered by neighboring infected cells. Which of these or other causes underlie IFN-I production by uninfected (GFP<sup>-</sup>) cells warrants further investigation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The vast majority of the pDC producing IFN-I and IL-12 during MCMV infection are not infected. The authors state in several instances that the pDC sensing MCMV in vivo to produce IFN-I are infected but the paper does not contain any clear and robust data supporting this statement. &quot;we investigated anti-viral effects.… in distinct cell types that are infected.…&quot;, &quot;findings indicate that cytomegalovirus infection is sensed by distinct sensing pathway depending on the infected cell type.…&quot;. The data used to document pDC infection is largely insufficient. In Figure 3A, pDC are defined as CD45+ CD11c(low) cells. This is not proper. Many other cell types share the same phenotype in the spleen, after MCMV infection, encompassing a sizeable fraction of classical monocytes, some macrophages, NK cells and mature classical DCs that have downregulated CD11c. Even if a fraction of pDC were infected, no data is shown to prove that these are the one producing IFN-I.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the CD45+CD11c+ sorted population includes more cell types than just pDC. We changed DC designations to CD11c+ in the following paragraph of the Results section to avoid misinterpretations as pointed out by the reviewer:</p><p>“At 36-hours p.i. , the percentage of infected stromal cells increased substantially and infected CD45+CD11c+ cells were detected as well.

Hence, the authors must correct their wrong statements and cite this paper. This comment could be dealt by properly editing text in manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We commented on the IFN-I production by uninfected pDCs in the new paragraph mentioned in comment 3 above which includes sentences relevant to the production of IFN-I by GFP- CD45+CD11c+ cells.</p><p>“MCMV is known to induce strong MyD88-dependent IFN-I responses in pDCs (Krug et al., 2004; Zucchini et al., 2008a).

The authors state that &quot;Ifnb1 transcripts are specifically produced in response to viral detection in infected DCs as well as stromal cells&quot;. This is a misinterpretation of the data shown on Figure 3B. First, expression of the Ifnb1 transcripts in GFP- CD45+CD11c+ cells is at least as high as in the CD45-GFP+ cells. Second, only a fraction of the GFP- CD45+CD11c+ cells are IFN-I-producing pDC, leading to an large underestimation of their Ifnb1 expression. Ifnb1 transcripts are highly expressed in pDC properly purified from the spleen of MCMV-infected mice (Zucchini et al., 2008a). Moreover, later in the paper, by using Ifnb1-EYFP reporter mice, the authors do show that &quot;Approximately 20% of the pDCs were YFP+, indicating at least this percentage of infected pDCs produced IFNβ in response to MCMV infection, whereas much fewer cDCs produced IFNb because less than 1% of cDCs were YFP+ (Figure 4B)&quot;. Hence this observation from the authors combined with the known fact that IFN-I-producing pDC are not infected shows that uninfected pDC are the major expressers of Ifnb1. This comment could be dealt by properly editing text in manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that there seemed to be an increase in <italic>Ifnb1</italic> in GFP-CD45+CD11c+ cells in MCMV infected mice.

This is incorrect. The vast majority of Ifna transcripts produced around 36 hours during MCMV infection arise from uninfected pDC that have been rigorously proven not to require the IFNAR1-dependent feedforward loop for this function (Tomasello et al., 2018). This comment could be dealt by properly editing text in manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer to bring this issue to our attention. We removed this sentence from the Results section.
