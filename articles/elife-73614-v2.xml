However, the underlying mechanism of mechanical stimulation promoting injury repair is still unknown. In this study, we found that <italic>Prrx1</italic><sup>+</sup> cell was essential for murine rotator cuff enthesis development identified by single-cell RNA sequence and involved in the injury repair. Proper mechanical stimulation could promote the migration of <italic>Prrx1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells to enhance enthesis injury repair. Meantime, TGF-Î² signaling and primary cilia played an essential role in mediating mechanical stimulation signaling transmission. Proper mechanical stimulation enhanced the release of active TGF-Î²1 to promote migration of <italic>Prrx1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells. Inhibition of TGF-Î² signaling eliminated the stimulatory effect of mechanical stimulation on <italic>Prrx1</italic><sup>+</sup> cell migration and enthesis injury repair. In addition, knockdown of <italic>Pallidin</italic> to inhibit TGF-Î²R2 translocation to the primary cilia or deletion of <italic>Ift88</italic> in <italic>Prrx1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells also restrained the mechanics-induced <italic>Prrx1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells migration. These findings suggested that mechanical stimulation could increase the release of active TGF-Î²1 and enhance the mobilization of <italic>Prrx1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells to promote enthesis injury repair via ciliary TGF-Î² signaling.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>enthesis</kwd><kwd>mechanical stimulation</kwd><kwd>primary cilia</kwd><kwd>Prx1+ cells</kwd><kwd>TGF-Î²</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>No. 81730068</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Hong Bin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Major Science and technology progect of Changsha Science and Technology Bureau</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>No. 41965</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Hongbin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81902192</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Can</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021JJ20093</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Can</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The proper mechanical stimulus could promote the migration of Prrx1<sup>+</sup> cells to the injury site to enhance enthesis injury repair.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rotator cuff (RC) tear is common in modern sports activity, which often causes persistent shoulder pain and dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meislin et al., 2005</xref>). Surgical repair has been a well-established and commonly accepted treatment for severe RC tear, especially when conservative treatment fails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Galatz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chung et al., 2013</xref>). It has been reported that approximately 450,000 patients were accepted RC repairs surgery annually in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Thigpen et al., 2016</xref>). However, the results of surgical repair are not always satisfactory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). Previous studies have shown structural failure of the RC repair ranging from 16% to 94%, with poor outcomes associated with failed microstructure regeneration of RC enthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Thigpen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hein et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galatz et al., 2004</xref>). Histologically, the RC enthesis has been consisted of four distinct yet continuous tissue layers: bone, calcified cartilage, uncalcified cartilage, and tendon. This kind of structure can subtly transfer force from muscle to bone, while enthesis functional injury repair remains an insurmountable challenge in sports medicine.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2019</xref> Therefore, how to promote regeneration of the enthesis is an urgent problem for clinicians.</p><p>Moderate mechanical load is essential for enthesis development and maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Thampatty and Wang, 2018</xref>). Meanwhile, the clinical application of mechanobiological principles following enthesis injury forms the basic rehabilitation protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Thomopoulos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Galloway et al., 2013</xref>). However, there is a debate about the initiating time and strength of mechanical stimulation during enthesis healing procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2015</xref>). In clinical treatment, a traditional rehabilitation program after RC repair has been suggested to delay mechanical exercise (immobilization for about 6 weeks) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Keener et al., 2014</xref>), while an accelerated protocol suggests that an immediate exercise with limited range of motion would be better for tendon healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). Zhang et al adopted treadmill training at postoperative day 7 on murine enthesis injury repair model and found that mechanical stimulation could improve enthesis fibrocartilage and bone regeneration and obtained better mechanical parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Although we know that there is a correlation between appropriate mechanical stimulation and high quality of enthesis healing, the uncovering mechanism is poorly understood. Revealing the cellular and molecular processes of enthesis healing with mechanical stimulation after surgical repair will allow clinicians to implement preventative interventions and prescribe proper therapeutics to improve clinical outcomes.</p><p>During the wound regeneration procedure, soluble inflammatory mediators bind to cell surface or cytoplasmic receptors, and lead to recruitment of immune cells, stem cells and tissue-resident cells by activating signaling cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wynn and Vannella, 2016</xref>). As we known, stem cells are essential for enthesis regeneration. <italic>Prrx1</italic> is a paired-related homeobox gene that is expressed in undifferentiated mesenchymal stem cells in the developing limb buds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kawanami et al., 2009</xref>). A previous study showed that <italic>Prrx1</italic> transgene marked osteochondral progenitors in the periosteum and played an essential role in skeletal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ouyang et al., 2014</xref>). Mice lacking <italic>Prrx1</italic> transgenes would show craniofacial defect, limb shortening, and incompletely penetrant Spina bifida (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martin and Olson, 2000</xref>). Considering <italic>Prrx1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells are indispensable stem cell lineage for the musculoskeletal system, we want to specificlly reveal the role of <italic>Prrx1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells in enthesis injury repair and uncover the mechanism of mechanical stimulation on improving enthesis injury repair in this study.</p><p>Primary cilia is an antenna-like sensory organelle based on immotile microtube, and present on nearly every cell type, including mesenchymal stem cells, endothelial cells (ECs), epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and other cells in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nauli et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bowie and Goetz, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hilgendorf et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vion et al., 2018</xref>). Primary cilia contains a distinct subset of receptors and other proteins, which make it a sophisticated signaling center functioning as mechanosensor and chemosensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nauli et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hua and Ferland, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guemez-Gamboa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anvarian et al., 2019</xref>). Previous study also found that translocating receptors to the primary cilia could enhance the signaling transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>). Defect or dysfunction of primary cilia could lead to severe disorders of the body, which is known as ciliopathies, such as polycystic kidney disease, primary ciliary dyskinesia, retinopathies, combined developmental deficiencies, and other sensory disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bisgrove and Yost, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miyamoto et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bergmann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">May-Simera et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Robichaux et al., 2019</xref>). Genetic deletion of <italic>Ift88</italic>, an encoded protein closely associated with cilia formation and maintenance, could decrease the load-induced bone formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moore et al., 2018</xref>). At the same time, the primary cilia is a hub for transducing biophysical and hedgehog signals to regulate tendon enthesis formation and adaptation to loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yuan and Yang, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fang et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, we wonder if primary cilia also plays an important role in mechanical stimulation signal transmission during enthesis healing procedure.</p><p>In this study, we first revealed the characteristics of <italic>Prrx1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells in the developing enthesis by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and examined the dynamic pattern of <italic>Prrx1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells in murine RC enthesis at different ages. Then, we used the murine enthesis injury model to find out the mechanism of proper mechanical stimulation on stimulating <italic>Prrx1</italic><sup>+</sup> cell migration and enthesis injury repair. Our data demonstrated that appropriate mechanical stimulation could increase the release of active TGF-Î²1 and enhance mobilization of <italic>Prrx1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells to promote enthesis injury repair via ciliary TGF-Î² signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>scRNA-seq analysis reveals the cell populations in the developing enthesis</title><p>To determine the cellular composition of the developing enthesis, we isolated and sequenced transcriptomes of individual live CD45<sup>-</sup>Ter119<sup>-</sup> cells from the murine enthesis (from the fully patterned limb at E15.5 to early maturity of enthesis with appearance of a modest 4-zone structure at P28) based on 10 Ã Genomics system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a and b</xref>). After sequencing and data quality processing, we got high-quality transcriptomic data from 21,532 single-cells, including 8,919 E15.5 cells, 7489 P7 cells, and 5124 P28 cells. The single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data had high read depth for most of the single cell samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). We carried out unbiased clustering analysis for all single-cells and identified 23 major cell populations in the developing enthesis by Seurat analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Through differential gene expression analysis, we annotated 15 clusters into distinct cell types or states based on the expression of genes uniquely or in combinations represented individual cluster identities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Feature plot showed the canonical marker genes, which enriched in seven enthesis related clusters: BMSCs, Fibroblastic cells, Tenocytes, Chondrocytes, Proliferative stromal cells, Osteoblast/Osteocyte (OB/Ocy), Lepr<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Cell fraction related to enthesis development showed that the rate of OB/Ocy and Lepr<sup>+</sup> cells increased significantly in P7 and P28, which was consistent with the enthesis mineralization procedure. At the same time, chondrocytes were high in E15.5, P7 and decreased significantly in P28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). These data suggested that the maturation of enthesis was higly correlated with osteochondrogenesis procedure.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>scRNA-seq analysis reveals the cell populations in the developing enthesis.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The flow chart of scRNA-seq analysis.

However, their role in enthesis regeneration is poorly understood. In this study, we identified that <italic>Prrx1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells are involved in enthesis development, but may not be important player in adult enthesis. However, during injury repair, <italic>Prrx1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells could migrate to the injury area to participate in enthesis healing. Proper mechanical stimulation could increase the release of TGF-Î²1 to immobilize <italic>Prrx1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells and promote enthesis injury repair. Ciliary TGF-Î²R2 was essential for TGF-Î² signaling transmission during proper mechanical stimulation promoting enthesis injury repair procedure. As far as we known, this is the first report uncovering the characteristics of <italic>Prrx1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells on enthesis development and injury healing, and provided new insights into the progenitor source for enthesis injury repair. Meanwhile, this study found a new mechanism about the mechanical stimulation signal transmission, and had pieced together a mechanical conduction mechanism.</p><p>The microstructure regeneration of enthesis is a difficult issue considering the complicated structure of enthesis consisting of four continuous gradient layers: bone, calcified fibrocartilage, uncalcified fibrocartilage and tendon, and low self-regeneration ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, current treatments aim to regenerate enthesis microstructure to acquire reliable long-term clinical results. A previous study found that low-intensity pulsed ultrasound stimulation after autologous adipose-derived stromal cell transplantation could improve the fibrocartilage and bone regeneration, leading to a better enthesis healing quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lu et al., 2016</xref>). Recently, tissue engineering was prevalent for repairing enthesis injury and showed promising results of fibrocartilage and bone regeneration, associated with better mechanical testing results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tang et al., 2020</xref>). In the present studies, we found that better regeneration of fibrocartilage was higly correlated with the number of <italic>Prrx1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells and was accompanied by better mechanical testing results, which was consistent with previous reports.These data suggested that the fibrocartilage regeneration directly influenced the enthesis healing quality and could be a reliable indicator for the enthesis regeneration.</p><p>Mechanical stimulation is a common therapy in the clinic, while it is a double-edged sword for enthesis healing. On one hand, appropriate mechanical load could stimulate local blood circulation, promote mesenchymal stem cell differentiation, and help releasing anti-inflammatory factors to improve tissue healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Olesen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jonsson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ohberg et al., 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2017</xref> reported if the training started early, such as 96 hr after acute patellar tendon enthesis injury, it will lead to better recovery results with fibrocartilage and mechanical test parameters in a rabbit model. On the other hand, excessive mechanical loading in the early healing phase might delay or even inhibit tissue healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). Rodeo et al found that immediate excessive treadmill training at the early stage causes delayed enthesis healing in the murine enthesis repair model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wada et al., 2019</xref>). These reports suggested that enthesis could only respond favorably to controlled loading after injury. In the present studies, we chose a 7 days delayed mechanical stimulation and tested three sets of mechanical intensity. We found that 20 min per day mechanical stimulation (7 days delayed, 10 m/min, 5 days per week) could enhance <italic>Prrx1</italic><sup>+</sup> cell migration, improve the quality of fibrocartilage and bone regeneration in the enthesis, resulting in better biomechanical results. Our finding suggested that appropriate mechanical stimulation (7 days delayed, 10 m/min, 20 min per day, 5 days per week) indeed improve early enthesis healing, and this model was reliable to uncover the mechanism of mechanical stimulation-induced enthesis healing. Still, we should notice that we didnât figure out the best mechanicla stimulation intensity here, which could be further explored in future studies.</p><p>Our results showed that proper mechanical stimuli could enhance the migration of <italic>Prrx1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells and <italic>Prrx1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells could differentiate in cartilage and bone cells which play a critical role in enthesis healing. We know that <italic>Prrx1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells are important in skeletal development, especially during the embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kawanami et al., 2009</xref>). However, their role in enthesis development and contribution to skeletal tissue regeneration was poorly understood. In this study, we found that GFP<sup>+</sup> cells (active <italic>Prrx1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells) were abundant in the enthesis during early stage and disappeared at adulthood. The tdtomato<sup>+</sup> cells mainly localized within the periosteum, perichondrium, and growth plate at adulthood, which indicated that <italic>Prrx1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells confined at these places were active in young age and quiescence, but not completely disappear at adulthood. Meanwhile, there were no <italic>Prrx1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells at the enthesis area in adult mice. When enthesis injury happens, <italic>Prrx1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells could migrate to the injury area to participate in the healing process. Besides, our results showed that <italic>Prrx1</italic><sup>+</sup> cell numbers at the enthesis were related to the healing quality, suggesting that <italic>Prrx1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells were pivotal for enthesis healing. One limitation of this study is that we did not investigate other mesenchymal sub-population in the current study.</p><p>How did mechanical stimulation enhance the migration of <italic>Prrx1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells to the healing site? As we known, TGF-Î² signaling plays an essential role in tissue homeostasis and injury healing and TGF-Î² signaling activation is in precise spatial and temporal manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhen and Cao, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Delaney et al., 2017</xref>). The level of TGF-Î²1 was relatively high at the healing interface and TGF-Î²1 could promote the migration of MSCs to modulate bone remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tang et al., 2009</xref>). Robertson et al reported that TGF-Î²1 function is mainly regulated by its activation rather than synthesis or secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Robertson and Rifkin, 2016</xref>). Hence, we mainly focused on the activation of TGF-Î²1. Our results showed that TGF-Î² signaling is involved in enthesis healing. During this process, active TGF-Î²1 concentration was elevated, and was further enhanced by mechanical stimulation. In vitro,we found that mechanicla stimulation couldnât indipendently improve <italic>Prrx1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells migration ability, while it could enhance the sensitivity of the <italic>Prrx1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells to TGF-Î²1. Although we did not further reveal its effects on <italic>Prrx1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells migration in vivo, it still provided new insights in new mechanisms about the mechanical stimulation signal transmission. At the same time, we could not rule out the involvement of other signaling pathways in this process.</p><p>Primary cilia have been recognized as an essential cellular mechanoreceptor and mechanosensitive channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bangs and Anderson, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hoey et al., 2012</xref>). Still, the regulatory mechanism of primary cilia in mechanical stimulation transmission remains unclear, even controversial. Polycystin-1 (PC1) and polycystin-2 (PC2), co-distribution in the primary cilia of kidney epithelium, was reported to be involved in the regulation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and transfer mechanical stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nauli et al., 2003</xref>). In addition to PC1 and PC2, another primary cilia-based calcium channels-transient receptor potential (TRP) could also sense mechanical stimuli via conducting Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Luo et al., 2014</xref>). Nonetheless, many calcium channels are not only localized in the ciliary membrane, but also other parts of the cells, so it is difficult to differentiate the difference between ciliary and cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> in response to the same mechanical stimuli. Delling et al found that cilia-specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> influxes were not observed in physiological or even highly supraphysiological levels of fluid flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Delling et al., 2016</xref>). In this study, we found that knocking out Ift88 prevented the mechanotransduction. Inhibition of ciliary TGF-Î² signaling could decrease the mechanotransduction, suggesting that primary cilia could regulate mechanical stimuli via ciliary TGF-Î²R2. This finding provides new insights into the role of primary cilia in mechanical stimuli transmission. However, we didn't exclude ciliary Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling or other ciliary signaling pathway participating in this mechanical stimulation transmission process in this study.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, <italic>Prrx1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells were an essential subpopulation of progenitors for enthesis development and injury repair.

The skin and deltoid muscles were closed in layer. To block the TGF-Î²1, hydrogel loading with the TGF-Î²1 neutralizing antibody was used. Mice were allowed free cage activities. At postoperative 4 weeks and 8 weeks, the mice receiving treadmill exercise or not were sacrificed, and the supraspinatus-humeral head composites were harvested for further study.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Mechanical load in vivo and in vitro</title><p>A motorâpowered treadmill with 12 lanes was used to generate a mechanical load to the enthesis in vivo. Treadmill exercise was conducted as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wada et al., 2019</xref>). All the mice underwent 1âweek adaptive training to get familiar with the lane environment before surgery. Treadmill speed was increased daily until all mice tolerated running at 10 âm/min for 30 âmin per day. At postoperative day 7, the mice in the treadmill group ran at a speed of 10 âm/min on a 0Â° declined lane for 10 min, 20 min, or 30 min, 5 days per week.</p><p>A cell load system (CellLoad-300, Hao Mian, China) was used to generate tensile mechanical load on <italic>Prrx1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells. <italic>Prrx1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells were seeded on a plate which could expand and contract under external forces, at a density of 1.5 Ã 10<sup>4</sup> /cm<sup>2</sup>.

After decalcified and dehydrated, samples were embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. Compound (SAKURA, Torrance, USA) and cut into 10 Î¼m thickness of sagittal sections. Cell samples were fixed in the 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Both the parts and cell samples were blocked in 5% BSA for 40 min at room temperature and incubated with the primary antibodies anti-DMP1 (Abcam, 1:400, ab13970), anti-GFP (Abcam, 1:400, ab13970 or 1:400, ab290), anti-Sox9 (Abcam, 1:400; ab185966), anti-TGF-Î²R2 (Abcam, 1:400, ab186838) at 4 Â°C overnight. After washing, the sections were then incubated with the respective secondary antibodies (1:500, Abcam) for 1 hr at room temperature and sealed with DAPI.

The tendon was secured in a clamp using sandpaper, while the humerus firmly clamped with a vice grip. The specimens were tested at room temperature, and samples were preconditioned with 0.1 N and then loaded to failure at a rate of 0.1 mm/s. A consistent gauge length was used throughout the test. Data were excluded if the tendon slipped out of the grip or did not fail at the supraspinatus tendon attachment site.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>ELISA</title><p>The supraspinatus tendon insertion specimens and femeral head were harvested at postoperative 0 day, and 3 days, and 1, 2, 4, 8, and 10 weeks. We removed the muscle belly and kept the tendon and the portion of the humeral head proximal to the growth plate near the tendon attachment. The femeral head cavity was removed by a drill.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, including Fayez Safadi as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #2, and the evaluation has been overseen by Mone Zaidi as Senior Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The objective of this manuscript is to investigate the role of ciliary TGF-Î² signaling in the enthesis injury repair, and the mechanical stimulation regulates the release of TGF-Î². These findings would be important both with regards to our understanding of ciliary TGF-Î² signaling and for therapeutical purposes.

Proper mechanical stimulation seems to increase the release of TGF-Î²1 to immobilize Prx1+ cells and promote enthesis injury repair.

In this part, we mainly want to reveal the stem cell that was highly participated in the RC injury repair. Until now, which subtype of stem cells essential for RC repair has not been revealed. We thought that revealing the cell atlas during the BTI development would provide us a new sight about the stem cells/progenitors which could take part in BTI repair. So, we committed the single cell sequencing and then found Prx1<sup>+</sup> cells played an essential role in enthesis development.</p><p>To further investigate whether it is involved in injury repair, we used the lineage tracing mice and found that Prx1<sup>+</sup> cells were disappeared in the 12 weeks old mice, but located at the nearby perichondrium and periosteum.

The aim of this part study is to look for potential subtype of stem cells/progenitors during the BTI development, which were closely related to the RC repair.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.
