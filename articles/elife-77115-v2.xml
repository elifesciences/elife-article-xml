Prior works linked large glutamatergic populations in the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) to defensive freezing and flight, and established that the overarching functional organization axis of the PAG is along anatomically-defined columns. Accordingly, broad activation of the dorsolateral column induces flight, while activation of the lateral or ventrolateral (l and vl) columns induces freezing. However, the PAG contains diverse cell types that vary in neurochemistry. How these cell types contribute to defense remains unknown, indicating that targeting sparse, genetically-defined populations may reveal how the PAG generates diverse behaviors. Though prior works showed that broad excitation of the lPAG or vlPAG causes freezing, we found in mice that activation of lateral and ventrolateral PAG (l/vlPAG) cholecystokinin-expressing (CCK) cells selectively caused flight to safer regions within an environment. Furthermore, inhibition of l/vlPAG-CCK cells reduced predator avoidance without altering other defensive behaviors like freezing. Lastly, l/vlPAG-CCK activity decreased when approaching threat and increased during movement to safer locations. These results suggest CCK cells drive threat avoidance states, which are epochs during which mice increase distance from threat and perform evasive escape. Conversely, l/vlPAG pan-neuronal activation promoted freezing, and these cells were activated near threat. Thus, CCK l/vlPAG cells have opposing function and neural activation motifs compared to the broader local ensemble defined solely by columnar boundaries. In addition to the anatomical columnar architecture of the PAG, the molecular identity of PAG cells may confer an additional axis of functional organization, revealing unexplored functional heterogeneity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>periaqueductal

in numerous functions, including pain modulation, vocalization, breathing, heart rate, hunting, freezing, and flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Behbehani, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Keay and Bandler, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Motta et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Silva and McNaughton, 2019</xref>). For decades, a great deal of effort has been put toward understanding how columnar subdivisions of the PAG control or contribute to distinct defensive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bandler et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bandler and Carrive, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bandler and Shipley, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carrive, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Andrade Rufino et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gross and Canteras, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Leman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Morgan and Clayton, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tomaz et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Walker and Carrive, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang et al., 1990</xref>). Prior work indicates that the ventrolateral (vl) PAG column is necessary for conditioned freezing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tovote et al., 2016</xref>). Though less studied than the vlPAG, optogenetic and electrical excitation of the lateral (l) PAG column also produces freezing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Assareh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bittencourt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bittencourt et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yu et al., 2021</xref>). The dorsolateral (dl) PAG has a key role in controlling innate defensive behaviors. Indeed, dlPAG cells encode numerous defense behaviors, including freezing, escape, and risk assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Del-Ben and Graeff, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reis et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reis et al., 2021b</xref>), and activation of glutamatergic vGlut2+ dlPAG cells induces escape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Evans et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tovote et al., 2016</xref>). More recent work employing methods with genetic specificity has focused on large PAG populations positive for broadly expressed markers such as <italic>Vgat</italic>, <italic>Vglut2,</italic> or <italic>CaMKIIa</italic>. For example, optogenetic activation of PAG neurons expressing <italic>CaMKIIa</italic>, which is ubiquitous in the region, elicited both freezing and flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deng et al., 2016</xref>). Though these findings provided important insights, they leave open the question of whether sparser PAG populations might control and encode more specific behavioral metrics.</p><p>Indeed, the PAG contains a diverse array of sparse cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Keay and Bandler, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Silva and McNaughton, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yin et al., 2014</xref>). These cell types exhibit different neurochemical profiles and vary in anatomical location, often spanning more than a single column (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Silva and McNaughton, 2019</xref>). For example, substance P-producing <italic>Tac1</italic>+ cells and enkephalin-releasing <italic>Penk</italic>+ cells are concentrated in dorsomedial and ventrolateral posterior PAG, while somatostatin-expressing cells can be found in dorsomedial and lateral columns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen Institute for Brain Science, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Silva and McNaughton, 2019</xref>). It is possible that distinct cell types contribute to specific phenotypes controlled by the PAG. Accordingly, genetically identified populations have been more deeply studied in other regions such as the lateral hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2018</xref>) or the central amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fadok et al., 2017</xref>), leading to unprecedented insights on their function. However, cell-type-specific dissections of sparse PAG populations remain scarce, and the functions of specific molecularly defined cell populations are largely uncharacterized.</p><p>One population of interest is composed of cholecystokinin-releasing PAG (PAG-CCK) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen Institute for Brain Science, 2021</xref>). Intriguingly, intra-PAG infusion of CCK in rats induces defensive behaviors and potentiates one-way escape behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Netto and GuimarÃ£es, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zanoveli et al., 2004</xref>). Additionally, CCK excites PAG neurons at both pre- and postsynaptic loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yang et al., 2006</xref>), suggesting that PAG-CCK cells may have widespread effects on local cell activity dynamics. However, despite these tantalizing results, to date PAG-CCK cells have not been directly studied and their function remains unknown.</p><p>Here, we specifically target, manipulate, and monitor the neural activity of PAG-CCK cells. We show that lateral and ventrolateral (l/vl) PAG-CCK cells are a small subset of glutamatergic cells, and that they selectively control flight to a safe location within an environment without affecting other defensive behaviors such as freezing or other l/vlPAG-mediated processes such as analgesia. Furthermore, though decades of prior work has consistently shown that PAG cells are activated by proximity to danger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguiar and GuimarÃ£es, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Canteras and Goto, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Evans et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mobbs et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mobbs et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Watson et al., 2016</xref>), we find that l/vlPAG-CCK cells are more active far from threat. In contrast, pan-neuronal activation of cells in the same l/vlPAG region induced freezing, and these cells closely encoded threat proximity and escape initiation. Thus, we show that characterization of sparser, genetically defined PAG populations may reveal cells that have unique functional roles and that may even show opposing patterns of neural activation relative to the broader local ensemble. Deciphering how molecularly defined PAG populations complement and interact with the well-established anatomical columnar functional framework is a key step in understanding how this ancient structure controls a constellation of vital behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CCK+ cells comprise a sparse glutamatergic subset of l/vlPAG neurons</title><p>The neuropeptide CCK is expressed primarily in two clusters within the PAG: one located in the dorsomedial column and one spanning both the lateral and ventrolateral columns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen Institute for Brain Science, 2021</xref>). Here, we focused on the latter population, which is more prevalent in the posterior than anterior PAG. To quantify the proportion of CCK+ neurons in the posterior l/vlPAG column, we used cre-dependent viral vectors to express GFP in CCK+ cells of <italic>Cck-ires-cre</italic> mice. We then immunostained posterior PAG slices against the pan-neuronal marker NeuN and quantified Neun/GFP overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

We developed the latency to enter (LTE) assay, a novel paradigm that measures flight to the safest region within an environment. The LTE is a square arena illuminated to 80 lux and contains a dark burrow (2 lux) in one corner. Mice were habituated to the arena for 10 min. To verify that mice perceived the burrow as a safer area within the assay, only mice that exhibited a preference for the burrow over the other three corners during habituation continued to test on the following day (91.3%; 63 of 69 mice showed burrow preference). During test, mice were placed in the LTE for a 1 min context reminder prior to 10 consecutive trials. For optogenetic manipulation within the LTE, light delivery was alternated across the 10 trials, beginning with a light-off trial. Prior to the start of each trial, mice were confined to the corner opposite of the burrow, the holding zone, with a transparent barrier for 15 s. For light-on trials, light was delivered for the last 5 s of the 15 s period in the holding zone and continued until the end of the trial. The start of a trial (after 15 s in holding zone) was marked by barrier removal and the trial ended upon burrow entry or 60 s had passed. If a mouse entered the burrow, they could remain in the burrow for 10 s prior to being returned to the holding zone. If they did not enter, they were immediately returned to the holding zone. The LTE allows assessment of the LTE a burrow from a fixed start location within an arena and enables structured sampling across regular trials that is not dependent on mice traversing to a start location to initiate a trial, minimizing variability in inter-trial intervals.</p><p>To study if activation of PAG subpopulations can bias mice to flee to the burrow, we optogenetically manipulated dlPAG, l/vlPAG, and l/vlPAG-CCK neurons in the LTE assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>).

To test this hypothesis, we delivered blue light (473 nm, 5 ms, 20 Hz) to the l/vlPAG of mice expressing YFP or ChR2-YFP in CCK+ cells during live predator exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Light was delivered in alternating 2 min epochs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>). Light activation of CCK+ cells reduced time spent in the threat zone and increased distance from the live rat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F and G</xref>; eYFP, n = 10; ChR2, n = 9; time in threat zone: t(17) = 3.808, p=0.0014; distance: t(17) = 3.24, p=0.0048). Mice exhibit increased stretch-attend postures during exposure to predatory rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2021b</xref>). This measure was reduced as a result of optogenetic activation, demonstrating that not all defensive behaviors are promoted by CCK+ cell activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>; eYFP, n = 10; ChR2, n = 9; t(17) = 2.441, p=0.0259). Optogenetic activation of CCK+ cells also induced a trend toward reduced number of approaches toward the rat and did not alter freezing or locomotion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H, J, and K</xref>; eYFP, n = 10; ChR2, n = 9; approaches: t(17) = 1.965, p=0.066; freezing: t(17) = 0.4696, p=0.6446; locomotion: t(17) = 1.682, p=0.1109). Escape velocity can be an informative measure of threat avoidance; however, ChR2 mice did not exhibit enough escapes during light activation to compute this measure as they did not consistently approach the rat (see representative exploration track in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, bottom row), which decreased escapes from the rat as escapes cannot occur without prior approach. These results demonstrate that activation of l/vlPAG-CCK cells selectively enhanced avoidance of a live predator without altering freezing.</p><p>Importantly, these same results were not observed with CCK+ activation during exposure to a control toy rat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Activating CCK+ cells in this condition induced the same type of thigmotaxis seen during CCK+ activation in an open field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). In the presence of the toy rat, thigmotaxis was uniformly induced throughout the environment periphery, both near and far away from the toy rat (see representative exploration track in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Thus, in the presence of the toy rat, CCK+ activation induced avoidance of open spaces, rather than avoidance of the toy rat. In contrast, in the presence of the rat, activation of CCK+ cells induced thigmotaxis only in the corners furthest away from the live rat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). These data show that l/vlPAG-CCK cell activation increases avoidance of a live predator, but not of a control safe toy rat, showing that these cells may serve to minimize threat exposure by directing exploration toward safer regions within an environment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>l/vlPAG-CCK inhibition reduces avoidance of a live predator</title><p>To evaluate the necessity of l/vlPAG-CCK cells for threat avoidance in a high-threat environment, we bilaterally expressed cre-dependent inhibitory hM4di-mCherry in the l/vlPAG of <italic>Cck-ires-cre</italic> mice to chemogenetically inhibit CCK+ cells during live predator exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1A</xref>).

This pattern is consistent with previous reports coupling increased PAG activity with threat proximity and escape initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Evans et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reis et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Watson et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Conversely, in CCK-GCaMP6f mice, population activity was modulated during both approaches and escapes. CCK+ activity ramped down as mice moved closer to the rat and ramped up as mice escaped away from the rat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>; approach: r(8) = â0.792, p=0.006; escape: r(8) = â0.703, p=0.023).</p><p>Syn-GCaMP6f activity was tightly time-locked with escapes, increasing prior to and peaking soon after escape initiation. CCK+ activity also increased prior to escape but exhibited sustained heightened activity post-escape onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8J and K</xref>). Our optogenetic experiments showed that increasing activity in l/vlPAG-syn cells robustly induced freezing; however, we did not observe increased syn-GCaMP6f activity related to freeze bouts during predator exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8J</xref>). Finally, syn-GCaMP6f activity was greater in the threat zone than safe zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8L</xref>; n = 9; t(8) = 4.375, p=0.0024) while CCK-GCaMP6f activity was decreased in the threat zone relative to the safe zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8M</xref>; n = 12; t(11) = 2.658, p=0.0223).</p><p>Importantly, these effects were not due to a correlation between speed and df/F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8âfigure supplement 2</xref>) and were not observed during exposure to a toy rat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Together, these results suggest that though the syn-expressing l/vlPAG population was particularly attuned to more threatening aspects of both the EPM and live predator exposure, CCK population activity was negatively modulated by threat proximity and increased during escape movements away from threat.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study identifies a small, sparse, genetically defined subset of cells within the PAG, cholecystokinin-expressing neurons (CCK+) that control avoidance of threat in multiple contexts.</p><p>Activation of l/vlPAG CCK+ cells induced evasion of open spaces and a live predator, which are, respectively, low- and high-intensity threats. Conversely, inhibition of CCK+ cells delayed entry into a dark burrow and increased time spent near a live predator, showing that these cells bidirectionally control avoidance measures in both low- and high-threat environments. Importantly, our manipulations did not alter freezing in any condition, demonstrating a specific role for CCK+ cells in escape and avoidance. CCK+ cells also display increased activity with greater threat avoidance in both the low-threat EPM and the high-threat predator exposure.</p><p>We show that these features are specific to CCK+ cells and oppose the broader local ensemble, as pan-neuronal activation of the same lPAG and vlPAG region drove robust freezing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>), and pan-neuronal activation patterns show increased activity with greater threat proximity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8L</xref>), consistent with prior reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Assareh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bittencourt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Evans et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mobbs et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mobbs et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reis et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tovote et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Watson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yu et al., 2021</xref>). Importantly, though our strategy of synapsin-specific transfection does not exclude CCK+ cells, we show that CCK+ cells are a small, sparse population, making up only about 5% of l/vlPAG neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), and are unlikely to be significantly driving fluorescence in pan-neuronal photometry recordings. Together, these data suggest that l/vlPAG CCK+ cells are selectively driving and signaling a behavioral state of threat avoidance and diverges from pan-neuronal l/vlPAG function.</p><p>We also characterized the effect of l/vlPAG CCK+ activation in pupil size, a physiological measure that is modulated by threat exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2021b</xref>). To do so, we used lower blue laser light intensity (1.5 mW for pupil measurements versus 3â3.5 mW in all behavioral experiments). This was in order to avoid escape attempts, which may result in damage and dislocation of the fiber optic cannula when mice try to escape while head-fixed. These data suggest that lower l/vlPAG CCK+ stimulation is sufficient to produce a defensive state with physiological changes, while higher stimulation yields a more intense state that includes escapes, which are likely also accompanied by physiological changes.</p><p>One inconsistency in our findings is a lack of increase in pan-neuronal activity during freeze bouts in the predator assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), despite ChR2 activation of this population driving robust freezing in an open field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and LTE assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This may be due to several factors including ChR2 activation may stimulate more ventral cells than are being recorded using fiber photometry. Another possibility is that ChR2 activation may drive activity in some cells that are responsible for driving the robust freezing observed, and the fluorescence of these sparse cells was washed out in Ca<sup>2+</sup> recordings. Finally, it is possible that l/vlPAG activity reflected complex population dynamics related to the heightened behavioral state induced by high-threat predator exposure, resulting in endogenous activity that is more complex than is elicited with artificial activation in a low-threat environment.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>l/vlPAG CCK cell activity may drive the threat-avoidance behavioral state</title><p>It is noteworthy that in all assays used in this work mice voluntarily chose when to avoid or approach threats, which consisted of either open spaces or a predator. Threat exposure is thus driven by internal state switches of threat approach and threat-avoidance states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">La-Vu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reis et al., 2021b</xref>). In the threat approach state, mice decrease distance to threats and perform risk-evaluation behaviors, such as stretch-attend postures. Conversely, in the threat-avoidance state, mice stay away from threats and initiate evasive escape.</p><p>We show that l/vlPAG CCK+ cells were active away from threats and during evasion from threats. Furthermore, activity of these cells was sufficient and necessary for threat avoidance and escape. We thus propose that l/vlPAG CCK+ cells are a key driver of the threat avoidance behavioral state. One intriguing question arising from this view is that if CCK+ activity causes escape when the mouse is near threat, then why does increased CCK+ activity in the safe region not elicit escape when the mouse is away from threat as well? In other words, why did CCK+ activity not render the safe region aversive, and thus cause escape from this safe location? When the mouse approached the rat, it was in the threat approach state, and thus CCK+ activity was low. Immediately prior to escaping, the mouse switched to the threat-avoidance state and then escaped to the region far from the rat, and this action was accompanied by high CCK+ activity that presumably drove the escape. However, CCK+ activity remained high far from the rat in the safe zone. The âsafe regionâ in the rat assay was not truly danger-free, but was only safer in relation to the rat âthreat zoneâ (see scheme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Even in the safe zone, it is likely that the mouse was motivated to further increase distance from the rat, as it was in the avoidance state, and this motivation may be related to the increased CCK+ activity seen away from the rat. However, there was no better or safer place for the mouse to occupy in this assay, so it remained in the âsafe zoneâ even though this region was still more aversive and dangerous than would be ideal for the mouse. This was also seen in our ChR2 activation of CCK+ cells during rat exposure, in which increased CCK+ activity did not cause indiscriminate escape from the safe zone, but rather strong thigmotaxis between the two safest corners within the safe zone. Thus, CCK+ activity did not cause escape from the safe zone because CCK+ activity is not predictive of simply escaping away from the current location, but rather it may increase the motivation to escape to the safest region within the environment. Furthermore, chemogenetic vl/lPAG CCK inhibition increased time near the predator, further supporting the view that CCK activity drives the threat avoidance state. Previously, we reported distinct synapsin-expressing PAG ensembles that consistently encode both threat approach and threat-avoidance states across different threat modalities, such as open spaces and predators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reis et al., 2021b</xref>). This work suggests that CCK+ cells may be a genetically identified ensemble that promotes the threat-avoidance state during exposure to these same stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Role of CCK cells in the l/vlPAG</title><p>Long-standing evidence links increased PAG activity with higher threat exposure. Following predator exposure, the rodent PAG exhibits increased Fos expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguiar and GuimarÃ£es, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Canteras and Goto, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mendes-Gomes et al., 2020</xref>). Pharmacological blockade of NMDA receptors in the dorsal or ventrolateral PAG increased open arm exploration in the EPM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">GuimarÃ£es et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Molchanov and GuimarÃ£es, 2002</xref>). Single-unit recordings show that dPAG and vPAG units display significant increases in firing rate after exposure to cat odor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Watson et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, the dPAG is sensitive to sensory aspects of threat distance and intensity, displaying increased activity with greater proximity to an awake predator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deng et al., 2016</xref>). In humans, PAG activity is positively correlated with threat imminence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mobbs et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mobbs et al., 2007</xref>). Within the dPAG, glutamatergic neurons are key for escape initiation and vigor, and dPAG flight-related cells exhibited prominent firing early during flight and declined as mice fled further from a predator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Evans et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Similarly to previous reports of the PAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Assareh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bittencourt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tovote et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yu et al., 2021</xref>), we also observed higher pan-neuronal PAG activity during threat proximity. However, in contrast, CCK+ activity was reduced with threat proximity. To our knowledge, this is the first PAG cell type identified in which endogenous activity is reduced with threat proximity.</p><p>Pan-neuronal optogenetic activation of l/vlPAG cells produced strong freezing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>), in agreement with prior reports showing that electrical or optogenetic excitation of the lPAG or vlPAG produced freezing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Assareh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bittencourt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bittencourt et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yu et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, activation of glutamatergic vlPAG neurons powerfully elicited freezing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tovote et al., 2016</xref>), and vlPAG lesions curtailed freezing during predator exposure and conditioned fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Andrade Rufino et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fanselow et al., 1995</xref>). Taken together, a plethora of data link lPAG and vlPAG activation with freezing. The identification of l/vlPAG CCK+ neurons as a population that drives escape, rather than freezing, thus opposes the canonical function of this region.</p><p>Prior data have suggested that the PAG participates in relaying aversive unconditioned stimulus information to the amygdala to inform associative plasticity, and this feature is critical to prediction error coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Herry and Johansen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johansen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McNally et al., 2011</xref>). Though studies have identified a role of vlPAG neurons in prediction error coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ozawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Walker et al., 2020</xref>), our inhibition of CCK+ cells during fear acquisition did not alter freezing during acquisition nor retrieval, suggesting that a role in prediction error coding may be carried out by other vlPAG cells. It is, however, possible that these cells have a role in controlling learned fear under other conditions that were not tested in this work. Our l/vlPAG activation studies reaffirm the lPAG and vlPAG roles in freezing and concurrently highlight the non-canonical role of CCK+ cells in driving flight.</p><p>The PAGâs role in flight has historically been attributed to the dorsal PAG. Dorsal PAG stimulation in rodents has been shown to induce marked escape responses such as explosive vertical jumping, running, aversion, and panic-related sympathetic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Del-Ben and Graeff, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Depaulis et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fanselow, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jenck et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Perusini and Fanselow, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Valenstein, 1965</xref>). The present findings suggest the role of the PAG in avoidance extends beyond the dorsal PAG column, in part, to the l/vlPAG. Interestingly, the flight pattern observed from l/vlPAG CCK+ activation is characteristically different from escape canonically described in PAG studies as they are void of robust protean vertical jumping seen in dlPAG activation in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>) and prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ullah et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, our work draws attention to two distinct types of escape: flight to escape the environment as seen by jumps induced by pan-neuronal activation of dlPAG cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>) and flight to safer regions within the environment, as shown by l/vlPAG CCK+ cell activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Further studies are needed to identify how l/vlPAG CCK+ cells affect downstream targets to produce escape as dissecting region-to-region connectivity can extend insight into defense circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bang et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Complementing columnar functional organization</title><p>Columnar organization in the PAG is supported by functional and anatomical similarities along the rostrocaudal axis. Broad activation of the dorsolateral column induces flight, hypertension, and tachycardia, while activation of the ventrolateral column induces freezing, hypotension, and bradycardia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Keay and Bandler, 2015</xref>). Neurotransmitter and receptor expression profiles and afferent/efferent connections are also generally (but not always) homogeneous within a single column along the anteroposterior axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Silva and McNaughton, 2019</xref>).</p><p>However, to achieve a more complete understanding of PAG function, there may be other considerations in addition to columnar organization. There are exceptions to homogeneity along the anteriorâposterior axis of columnar boundaries in PAG afferent and efferent connectivity. For example, adrenergic and noradrenergic medullary afferents preferentially target the rostral vlPAG and the central amygdala receives input from cells highly concentrated in the caudal but not rostral vlPAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Silva and McNaughton, 2019</xref>). Furthermore, there are genetic markers that do not span an entire column; GABA-immunopositive cells are more prevalent in caudal than rostral cat vlPAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barbaresi, 2005</xref>). Tachykinin-1 (i.e., tac1), which is a marker of substance P-expressing cells, broadly spans multiple columns rostrally but concentrates in dorsolateral and ventrolateral columns caudally in the rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu and Swenberg, 1988</xref>). Expression of rat endocannabinoid and glycine receptors also varies rostrocaudally, becoming more present in caudal PAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Araki et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Herkenham et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Silva and McNaughton, 2019</xref>). It is likely that exploration of these genetically defined PAG populations will reveal novel insights. Indeed, inhibition of lPAG VGAT and lPAG VGlut2+ neurons impairs the chase and attack of prey, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yu et al., 2021</xref>), and glutamatergic vlPAG neurons project to the medulla to control freezing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tovote et al., 2016</xref>).

To calculate the percentage of CCK-GFP+ neurons in the l/vlPAG, we divided CCK-GFP+ cells quantified in both lPAG and vlPAG by NeuN+ cells quantified in lPAG and vlPAG.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>vGlut2 immunostaining</title><p>Fixed brains were kept in 30% sucrose at 4Â°C overnight and then sectioned on a cryostat (40 Î¼m slices). Sections were washed in PBS-T (0.3% Triton-X) and incubated in a blocking solution (5% normal donkey serum and 0.3% Triton-X in PBS) for 1 hr at room temperature. Sections were then incubated at 4Â°C for 16 hr with polyclonal anti-VGLUT2 antibody (#AGC-036, Alomone Labs) made in rabbit (1:500 dilution) in blocking solution. Following primary antibody incubation, sections were washed in PBS-T three times for 10 min per wash and then incubated with anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) antibody (1:1000 dilution) conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 (red) (CAT# 8889S, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cellsignal.com/">cellsignal.com</ext-link>) in blocking solution for 2 hr at room temperature. Sections were washed in PBS-T three times for 10 min per wash, incubated with DAPI (1:50,000 dilution in PBS), and washed again in PBS-T and mounted in glass slides using PVA-DABCO (Sigma). Sections were imaged at Ã10 magnification using a ZEISS LSM 900 confocal microscope. All imaging were done using standardized laser settings, which were held constant for samples from the same experimental dataset. For each animal, l/vlPAG was imaged and quantified using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health) for DAPI+, vGlut2+, GFP+, and GFP+/vGlut2+ cells. Fraction of vGlut2-labeled cells also GFP-labeled was calculated as (vGlut2+ and GFP+)/vGlut2+. Fraction of GFP-labeled cells also vGlut2-labeled was calculated as (vGlut2+ and GFP+)/GFP+.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>In situ hybridization</title><p>Mice were euthanized with 5% isoflurane followed by cervical dislocation. Brains were harvested and snap-frozen in 2-methylbutane at â20Â°C and tissue was sectioned at 18 Î¼m. The workflow was performed in accordance with the manufacturerâs protocol for the RNAScope Multiplex Fluorescent Assay (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Newark, CA). Riboprobes selective for sequences were labeled as follows: CCK (Mm-CCK, Cat# 402271) or VGLUT2 (Mm-Slc17a6-C3, Cat# 319171-C3). Images were obtained with a ZEISS LSM 900 confocal microscope at Ã40.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Behavior video capture</title><p>All behavior videos were captured at 30 frames/s in standard definition (640 Ã 480) using a Logitech HD C310 webcam. To capture fiber-photometry synchronized videos, both the calcium signal and behavior were recorded by the same computer using custom MATLAB scripts that also collected timestamp values for each calcium sample/behavioral frame. These timestamps were used to precisely align neural activity and behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Behavioral timeline</title><p>The order of behavior assays for optogenetic and fiber photometry experiments is as follows (if applicable): open field, EPM, LTE, real-time place preference, toy rat exposure, real rat exposure, and pupil dilation. The order of behavior assays for chemogenetic experiments is as follows: toy rat exposure, live rat exposure, hot plate, and cued fear conditioning.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Light delivery for optogenetics</title><p>For all ChR2 experiments, blue light was generated by a 473 nm laser (Dragon Lasers, Changchun Jilin, China) at 3â3.5 mW with the exception of pupil dilation recordings in which a 1.5 mW power was used to avoid overt escape responses during head fixation. For the Arch experiment, green light was generated by a 532 nm laser (Dragon Lasers) and bilaterally delivered to mice at 5â6.6 mW. A Master-8 pulse generator (A.M.P.I., Jerusalem, Israel) was used to drive the blue laser at 20 Hz. This stimulation pattern was used for all ChR2 experiments. The laser output was delivered to the animal via an optical fiber (200 mm core, 0.22 numerical aperture, Doric Lenses, Canada) coupled to the fiberoptic implanted on the animals through a zirconia sleeve.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Open-field assay with optogenetics</title><p>The open field is a square arena (34 Ã 34 Ã 34 cm) illuminated to 105 lux. Mice had no prior experience in the arena prior to exposure. Exposures are 8 min total, with alternating 2 min epochs of laser off or on (OFF, ON, OFF, ON).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>LTE assay with optogenetics</title><p>The LTE assay was carried out across two consecutive days in a square (47 Ã 47 Ã 36 cm) arena. The arena is illuminated to 80 lux and contains a dark burrow (7 Ã 13 Ã 11 cm, 2 lux) in one corner. On day 1, mice are habituated to the entire arena for 10 min. Only mice that spent more time in the burrow compared to the other three corners continued to day 2. Out of 69 mice from all cohorts, only 6 were excluded due to not showing preference for the burrow. On day 2, a transparent barrier is placed in the corner opposite of the burrow to create a holding zone. Mice were placed in the arena for 1 min as a context reminder prior to placement in the holding zone. Then, 10 trials were carried out, with 5 laser-off and five laser-on trials interleaved. Prior to all trials, mice were confined to the holding zone for 15 s prior to barrier removal. For light-on trials, laser is delivered for the latter five of the 15 s and continues until the end of the trial. The start of the trial is marked by barrier removal and ends when the mouse enters the burrow or when 60 s have passed. If mice enter the burrow, they are given 10 s in the burrow prior to being returned to the holding zone. If mice do not enter the burrow, they are immediately returned to the holding zone. The procedure is similar between ChR2 activation and Arch inhibition in the LTE, except for laser wavelength and pulse length. Mice were handled for a minimum of days. This habituation to handling served to decrease any potential anxiety or stress caused by the handling involved in placing the mouse in the holding zone.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Place aversion test with optogenetics</title><p>Mice were placed in a two-chamber context (20 Ã 42 Ã 27 cm) for 10 min to freely explore the environment. Both chambers are identical. The following day, mice were introduced into the two-chamber context and blue laser was delivered to the l/vlPAG of CCK-cre mice expressing either ChR2 or YFP (20 Hz, 5 ms pulses) when they occupied one of the chambers. Laser stimulation was only delivered during exploration of the stimulation chamber. The amount of time mice explored both chambers was tracked across both the baseline and stimulation epochs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>EPM with optogenetics and fiber photometry</title><p>The arms of the EPM were 30 Ã 7 cm. The height of the closed arm walls was 20 cm. The maze was elevated 65 cm from the floor and was placed in the center of the behavior room away from other stimuli. Arms were illuminated to 8â12 lux. Mice were placed in the center of EPM facing a closed arm. For optogenetic experiments, blue light was delivered in alternating 2 min epochs for five epochs, totaling 10 min exposure. The fifth epoch was excluded from analyses. ChR2 activation was only run in l/vlPAG-CCK group as overt freezing in the l/vlPAG-syn group would not be informative and the assay is not feasible with robust jumping exhibited by ChR2 activation of dlPAG-syn mice. For fiber photometry recordings, mice were free to explore the EPM for 10 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Pupil size measurements with optogenetics</title><p>Pupil size was measured with the same set-up and methods described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lovett-Barron et al., 2017</xref>) Briefly, a camera (AVT Manta, G-032B) coupled to a 24 mm/F1.4 lens was used to image the eye under infrared illumination (Thorlabs M780F2). Video was acquired at 60 Hz using pymba, a Python wrapper for AVT camera control. Frame acquisition times and the behavioral task were synchronized with a National Instruments DAQ (NIPCIe-6323). Pupil size was measured from the video using custom-written MATLAB scripts. Each trial lasted 30 s. A 473 nm laser (1.5 mW) was delivered to the l/vlPAG of CCK-cre mice at 20 Hz, 5 ms pulses for 10 s following a 10 s baseline recording. Another 10 s were recorded post-stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Live rat exposure assay with optogenetics, chemogenetics, and fiber photometry</title><p>We used a long rectangular chamber (70 Ã 25 Ã 30 cm). Mice were acclimated to this environment for at least 2 days for 10 min each day. During rat exposure, a live rat is restrained to one end of the chamber using a harness attached to a cable with one end taped to the chamber wall. As a behavioral control, we exposed mice to a toy rat (similar in shape and size to a live rat) to assess behavior elicited by visually similar stimuli without actual predatory threat. For the optogenetic experiment, mice were presented with the toy rat for one trial prior to exposure to live rat one day after. On each day, 473 nm laser alternated off or on in 2 min epochs for five epochs, totaling in a 10 min trial. Only the first four epochs (OFF, ON, OFF, ON) were included in analyses. For the chemogenetic experiment, mice were exposed to two toy rat trials on consecutive days followed by two live rat exposures on consecutive days. Mice either received CNO or saline prior to exposures. All trials were 10 min. For fiber photometry recordings, all mice underwent toy rat exposure followed by live rat exposure the following day for 10 min each.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Chemogenetics</title><p>Mice used for all chemogenetic experiments (with the exception of cued fear conditioning) were exposed to each threat and control stimuli twice, once following treatment with saline and once following treatment with CNO (10 mg/kg, injected intraperitoneally) 40 min prior to the experiment. Only one control or threat-exposure assay was performed per day with each mouse. For cued fear conditioning, all mice received CNO prior to training.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Heated plate assay with chemogenetics</title><p>Heated plate assay was performed on top of a metallic heating plate (14 Ã 14 cm) (Faithful Magnetic Stirrer model SH-3) across two sequential days on mice expressing AAV8-hSyn-DIO-mCherry or AAV8-hSyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry. On both days, mice received either CNO (i.p., 10 mg/kg) or saline 40 min prior to heated plate exposure. The order of drugs was counterbalanced. Plate was heated to 50Â°C and enclosed by tall, transparent walls (14 Ã 14 Ã 24 cm). Mice were closely monitored for pain response. The latency to display a pain-related reaction (hind paw lick or jump) was recorded. All mice showed pain responses within 30 s. After pain response, mice were immediately removed from assay. Pain latency was measured as CNO minus SAL (CNO â SAL).</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Fear conditioning with chemogenetics</title><p>Standard mouse fear conditioning chambers from Coulbourn Instruments were used. The chamber dimensions were 7 Ã 7 Ã 12 inches (width Ã length Ã height). Cued fear conditioning was performed across two sequential days on mice expressing AAV8-hSyn-DIO-mCherry or AAV8-hSyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry. Mice were habituated to the fear conditioning room for 2 days prior to the start of the experiment. Mice were handled by the same experimenter during habituation as well as days 1â2 of the experiment. On day 1 (training), all mice received CNO (i.p., 10 mg/kg). Then, 40 min later, mice were exposed to a context consisting of metal bar flooring and bare gray walls, and cleaned with 70% ethanol. Training context was illuminated with warm-colored white lighting at 40 lux. Mice received 10 CS-US pairings pseudo-randomly presented across a 14 min trial. CS was a 10 s pure tone at 70 dB and US was a 1 s, 0.6 mA shock. CS and US coterminated. The first CS-US pairing began 100 s after the start of the trial. Following training, mice were returned to their home cage. On day 2 (retrieval test), mice were exposed to a context consisting of rounded white walls and gray smooth flooring and cleaned with Strike-Bac (Chino, CA). These changes assure that visual and olfactory cues are different between the training and testing contexts. Retrieval test context was illuminated with blue lighting at 40 lux. Mice received 10 CS-only presentations (same CS configuration as training) across a 14 min trial. Freezing during CS presentation was scored in an automated manner using FreezeFrame 5 (Actimetrics, IL). Freeze bouts were at minimum 0.33 s in duration. This same 0.33 s freeze bout duration was used throughout all assays. Percent time freezing showed a correlation of over 0.95 when calculated using either 0.33 or 1 s minimum bout duration.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Fiber photometry</title><p>Photometry was performed as described in detail previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, we used a 405 nm LED and a 470 nm LED (Thorlabs, M405F1 and M470F1) for the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent isosbestic control measurements. The two LEDs were band-pass filtered (Thorlabs, FB410-10 and FB470-10) and then combined with a 425 nm long-pass dichroic mirror (Thorlabs, DMLP425R) and coupled into the microscope using a 495 nm long-pass dichroic mirror (Semrock, FF495-Di02-25 3 36). Mice were connected with a branched patch cord (400 mm, Doric Lenses, QC, Canada) using a zirconia sleeve to the optical system. The signal was captured at 20 Hz (alternating 405 nm LED and 470 nm LED). To correct for signal artifacts of a nonbiological origin (i.e., photobleaching and movement artifacts), custom MATLAB scripts leveraged the reference signal (405 nm), unaffected by calcium saturation, to isolate and remove these effects from the calcium signal (470 nm).</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>Perfusion and histological verification</title><p>Mice were anesthetized with Fatal-Plus (i.p., Vortech Pharmaceuticals, Dearborn, MI) and transcardially perfused with PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Extracted brains were stored for 12 hr at 4Â°C in 4% paraformaldehyde before transfer to 30% sucrose for a minimum of 24 hr. Brains were sectioned into 40 Âµm coronal slices in a cryostat, washed in PBS, and mounted on glass slides using PVA-DABCO. Images were acquired using a Keyence BZ-X microscope (Keyence Corporation of America, Itasca, IL) with a Ã4, Ã10, or Ã20 air objective.</p></sec><sec id="s4-23"><title>Behavioral quantification</title><p>To extract the pose of freely behaving mice in the described assays, we implemented DeepLabCut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nath et al., 2019</xref>), an open-source convolutional neural network-based toolbox, to identify mouse nose, ear, and tail base xy-coordinates in each recorded video frame. These coordinates were then used to calculate velocity and position at each time point, as well as classify behaviors such as threat approaches, escape runs, stretch-attend postures, and freeze bouts in an automated manner using custom MATLAB scripts. Freezing was defined as epochs when head and tailbase velocities fell below 0.25 cm/s for a period of 0.33 s. âStretch-attend posturesâ were defined as epochs for which (1) the distance between mouse nose and tail base exceeded a distance of approximately 1.2 mouse body lengths and (2) mouse tail base speed fell below 1 cm/s. Approach and escape were defined as epochs when the mouse moved, respectively, toward or away from the rat at a velocity exceeding a minimum threshold of 3 cm/s. All behaviors were manually checked by the experimenters for error.</p></sec><sec id="s4-24"><title>Statistics</title><p>Unpaired <italic>t</italic>-tests of ON minus OFF or CNO minus SAL transformations were used unless otherwise stated. Normality of data was tested with the Lilliefors test. Two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-tests were used throughout with É = 0.05. Correlations were calculated using Pearsonâs method. Asterisks in the figures indicate the p-values for the post-hoc test. Standard error of the mean was plotted in each figure as an estimate of variation. Multiple comparisons were adjusted with the false discovery rate method.</p></sec><sec id="s4-25"><title>Behavioral cohort information</title><p>Each primary experiment included at least one replication cohort. Each mouse was only exposed to each assay once as defensive behavior assays cannot be repeated. Thus, there are no technical replicates. No outliers were found or excluded. All mice were used. Sample sizes were determined based on comparisons to similar published papers.</p><p>For chemogenetic and optogenetic experiments, mice in each cage were randomly allocated to control (mCherry or YFP-expressing mice) or experimental conditions (hM4Di, ChR2, or Arch-expressing mice). Data collection was done blinded to treatment group in mice. For mouse fiber photometry neural activity recordings, all data were obtained from subjects in identical conditions, and thus they were all allocated to the same experimental group. There were no experimentally controlled differences across these subjects and, thus, there were no âtreatment groupsâ.</p></sec><sec id="s4-26"><title>Data and code availability</title><p>Custom analysis scripts are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/schuettepeter/l-vlPAG_ActiveAvoidance">https://github.com/schuettepeter/l-vlPAG_ActiveAvoidance</ext-link>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">La-Vu, 2022</xref> copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:8d812c39ef8a1030273c15ebe296103b8c8bb549;origin=https://github.com/schuettepeter/l-vlPAG_ActiveAvoidance;visit=swh:1:snp:282dd8c676e6543f12571af0d59cd936a84ddfc2;anchor=swh:1:rev:e77591414eade868e6f5459df18b6ce777d3905a">swh:1:rev:e77591414eade868e6f5459df18b6ce777d3905a</ext-link>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Mihaela D Iordanova as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The optogenetic and photometry data need to be better reconciled, including accounting for why the activity is high in safe zones away from threat but stimulation leads to aversion. Given the aversive effect of cck neuron stimulation in the RTPP that is reported in the manuscript, one would hypothesize that stimulating those neurons in any other context will also evoke aversiveness. So this begs the question: why under unperturbed conditions as shown by photometry, neuronal activity of CCK cells is enhanced in low threat areas, while the same cells mediate aversion when optogenetically activated? Essentially, this would render the safe zone aversive, which appears counterintuitive.</p><p>2) More in-depth discussion of past literature: Prior data in the field provide strong support that dPAG, not vPAG, mediates flight, as well as a role for vlPAG in prediction error in fear.</p><p>3) Current statistical reporting is minimal. The authors need to be back each result statement by statistics in the text. Asterisks and p values denoting significance are not sufficient.</p><p>4) The conclusion that CCK neuronal activity does not affect learning is somewhat premature given the data. The result could be explained in terms of ceiling levels of responding, so this conclusion should be softened.</p><p>5) Methodological concerns:</p><p>a. A discussion of the effect of sub-selecting high anxiety mice that preferred the burrow during habituation as well as creating a high-anxiety situation by moving the animals every 60s in the LTE task on CKK neuron activity.</p><p>b. Include an assessment of which part of the apparent CCK clusters was targeted. This should include at the very least fiber positions, and ideally also viral spread maps.</p><p>c. Include information on cell counting procedure, data reduction and analysis.</p><p>d. Add information on how many VGluT2<sup>+</sup> neurons were also CCK<sup>+</sup>.</p><p>e. Add information on parametric/non-parametric nature of the data, and usage of the adequate stats.</p><p>f. Information of conditioning setup and experimental design is missing.</p><p>g. Explain the choice of a very short and unconventional freezing duration criterion, as well as varying freezing criteria across behavioral tests.</p><p>h. Figure 8 J and K are missing the number of mice in the legend, and single data points on the graphs.</p><p>i. Revise the pupil dilation experiment either interpretation-wise or add new data. Our concern is, that if radically different stimulation parameters are used, such as intentionally by the authors here to get rid of behavioural responses, how can we assume that the results can be generalized over apparently different defensive states? A comparison of the behavioural responses for the two intensities (high intensity, as reported for behaviour, and low intensity, as for the pupil dilation) in the same animals can help clarify this issue.</p><p>j. Stimulation in the EPM follows a 2min ON 2min OFF order. It would be important to know when stimulation occurs â when the animal is in the open or closed arm and whether this correlates with the percent time spent in the open arm. To explain, if stim of CCK neurons is aversive as suggested by the RPTP task then there could be a summation of aversiveness when stimulation occurs in the open vs closed arm.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77115.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The optogenetic and photometry data need to be better reconciled, including accounting for why the activity is high in safe zones away from threat but stimulation leads to aversion.

We agree with the Reviewers that at first glance the optogenetic and photometry data may appear to be conflicting. However, both datasets can be interpreted as a reflection that CCK cells are controlling avoidance states during threat exposure. During exploration of the rat assay, mice alternate between threat approach and threat avoidance behavioral states. In the approach state, mice decrease their distance to the rat, by approaching it. During the avoidance state, mice increase distance to the threat and engage in evasive actions, such as escape. The photometry data show CCK cells are active during both escape and during moments of increased distance to threat, and thus seem to reflect a threat avoidance state. In line with this interpretation, CCK activation increases distance to threat. According to this interpretation, higher CCK activity creates higher distance to threat, and thus it would be expected to elicit escape and to be higher during avoidance of the rat. L/vlPAG CCK cell activity also decreases during approach to the rat because during these moments the mouse is in the threat approach state, not in the threat avoidance state.</p><p>We also note that the âsafe zoneâ in the rat assay (see Figure 7c) is not comfortable, but rather it is safe relative to the more dangerous âthreat zoneâ near the rat. We thus argue that this âsafe zoneâ away from the rat is indeed still aversive as noted by the Reviewer, (though less aversive than the threat zone). Thus, if possible, the mouse would likely escape from this less aversive âsafe zoneâ and go to a truly danger-free location, but there is no better location for the mouse to choose, so it continues to stay as far as possible from the rat within the confines of the box. Higher CCK activity thus does not elicit escape from the current location, but rather signals the motivation to escape to the safest place available. If the current location is aversive but is still the safest possible place then higher CCK activity would not change the mouseâs location, even though escape to a truly safe place would be desirable despite being impossible.</p><p>We interpret the optogenetically-induced aversion and flight to safety as well as the enhanced neuronal activity in CCK cells in low threat areas to be, respectively, driving and reflecting avoidance. As we show that activation of CCK cells produced strong thigmotaxis in the open field, urgent flight to a dark burrow, and bias toward the closed arms in the epm, we interpret that CCK activation under low-threat conditions induces evasion of bright, open spaces. Relatedly, CCK activation in high-threat conditions (predator exposure) caused evasion of the most salient perceived threat, the predator.Â Additionally, CCK inhibition increased time near the predator, further suggesting that CCK activity drives the threat avoidance state.</p><p>The Reviewer has highlighted that this interpretation was not previously made clear, and we have thus adjusted the wording of our interpretation throughout the manuscript as well as significantly expanded our interpretation in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) More in-depth discussion of past literature: Prior data in the field provide strong support that dPAG, not vPAG, mediates flight, as well as a role for vlPAG in prediction error in fear.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer that these points are important and warrant further discussion. Accordingly, we have revised our Discussion to emphasize these points.</p><p>Regarding the role of dPAG in mediating flight, we emphasize that escape has historically been attributed to the dorsal PAG. We now mention that such robust and urgent flight has been reported in the dPAG by a number of studies including Jenck et al., (1995), Valenstein (1965), Perusini and Fanselow (2015), Del-Ben and Graeff (2009), Depaulis et al., (1992), and Fanselow (1991), and we conclude that our present findings suggest that the PAG role in escape extends beyond the dPAG column to the l/vlPAG.</p><p>Regarding the vlPAG role in prediction error, we discuss conceptual models described in McNally et al., (2011) and Herry and Johansen (2014) that suggested the PAG sends information regarding unconditioned stimulus information to the amygdala, and that this feature is critical for prediction error coding. Though Ozawa et al., (2017) and Walker et al., (2020) show that vlPAG neurons are indeed critical for prediction error coding, our CCK<sup>+</sup> cell inhibition during conditioned fear acquisition did not alter freezing during acquisition nor retrieval. Therefore, we conclude that prediction error coding is carried out by other vlPAG cells in the conditioning protocol we used. However, as discussed in Review question 4 below, it is entirely possible that CCK cells can affect fear conditioning in other protocols that we did not test.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Current statistical reporting is minimal. The authors need to be back each result statement by statistics in the text. Asterisks and p values denoting significance are not sufficient.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this oversight, and we have now included complete descriptive statistics throughout the main text and figure legends including name of statistical test, n for each group and exact p value.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The conclusion that CCK neuronal activity does not affect learning is somewhat premature given the data. The result could be explained in terms of ceiling levels of responding, so this conclusion should be softened.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this comment, and have now changed the text to include this consideration. However, please note that during retrieval freezing levels were around 80% (Figure 7, figure supplement 2), and thus freezing was not at ceiling levels of 100%. Nevertheless, we agree with the Reviewer that it certainly is possible that the CCK cells may have a role in fear learning when using different experimental parameters. We have changed the text to discuss this important possibility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Methodological concerns:</p><p>a. A discussion of the effect of sub-selecting high anxiety mice that preferred the burrow during habituation as well as creating a high-anxiety situation by moving the animals every 60s in the LTE task on CKK neuron activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We note that only 6 out of a total of 69 mice run in this assay were excluded for not showing a preference for the burrow during habituation. The vast majority of mice (91.3%) that underwent LTE habituation continued onto testing, thus the results are not derived from a subset of highly anxious mice. We removed these 6 mice, because if the mouse does not recognize the burrow as a safest region within the assay (and thus spends more time in the burrow than the other corners) prior to optogenetic stimulation, then the assay cannot be interpreted as a measure of flight to safety as the main metric is latency to enter the burrow.</p><p>It is true that the experimenter had to manually replace animals in the holding zone; however, mice were well-habituated to handling prior to the assay for a minimum of 5 days in order to decrease anxiety responses caused by handling by the experimenter. Furthermore, identical handling happened in both light OFF and ON trials, thus anxiety or changes in CCK cell activity caused by handling does not account for our bidirectional optogenetic effects.</p><p>We have added discussions in the text to include these important considerations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Include an assessment of which part of the apparent CCK clusters was targeted. This should include at the very least fiber positions, and ideally also viral spread maps.</p></disp-quote><p>We targeted the entire CCK lPAG/vlPAG population, and thus did not investigate any subset of this cluster. These cells span a small volume of tissue, thus our experiments were able to consistently target the whole region containing lPAG/vlPAG CCK cells. We have added viral spread maps and fiber tip positions to more clearly demonstrate this point, as requested by the Reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. Include information on cell counting procedure, data reduction and analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided information on post-histological procedures including confocal imaging parameters, cell counting methods within specific brain regions and how each metric was defined and calculated in the two Methods sections, âNeuN immunostainingâ and âvGlut2 immunostaining.â For NeuN cell counting procedures, we imaged the dlPAG, lPAG, and vlPAG at two different sites within each region and quantified NeuN+ and CCK-GFP+ cell for each site. To calculate the percentage of neurons that were CCK-GFP+ in the l/vlPAG and dlPAG, we normalized CCK-GFP+ cells by NeuN+ cells. For vGlut2 cell counting procedure, we obtained confocal imaging of the l/vlPAG and quantified DAPI+ cells, vGluT2<sup>+</sup> only cells, CCK-GFP+ only cells, and vGluT2<sup>+</sup>/GFP+ cells. To obtain the fraction of vGluT2<sup>+</sup> cells that were also GFP+, we normalized vGluT2<sup>+</sup>/GFP+ by vGluT2<sup>+</sup> only cells. To calculate the fraction of GFP+ cells that were also vGluT2<sup>+</sup>, we normalized vGluT2<sup>+</sup>/GFP+ by GFP+ only cells. All counting was done using the freely available ImageJ software.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d. Add information on how many VGluT2<sup>+</sup> neurons were also CCK<sup>+</sup>.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this oversight and appreciate the opportunity to provide more information. To address this comment we injected a cre-dependent virus encoding YFP in the l/vlPAG of CCK-cre mice, resulting in YFP expression in CCK<sup>+</sup> cells. We then performed an antibody stain against the glutamatergic marker vGlut2. We performed the requested quantification and found that 9.6% of vGluT2<sup>+</sup> cells in the l/vlPAG are also CCK-GFP+ (see Figure 1e). Additionally, we performed in situ hybridizations to confirm this result and found that 8.6% of vGlut2-expressing cells are also CCK-positive (Figure 1, figure supplement 1). Thus, two different methods of quantification provide converging evidence that CCK cells are a sparse population comprising less than 10% of l/vlPAG vGlut2 cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e.

Explain the choice of a very short and unconventional freezing duration criterion, as well as varying freezing criteria across behavioral tests.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this astute observation and apologize for the oversight. While the minimum freezing bout duration scored using custom MATLAB scripts was 0.33 s, the minimum freezing bout scored using the FreezeFrame 5 software program for the fear conditioning experiment was 0.5 s. This oversight has been corrected and, now, freezing reported in all behavioral experiments has been scored using the 0.33 s minimum bout duration. Importantly, this rescoring did not alter the findings previously reported in the fear conditioning experiment (Figure 7, figure supplement 2).</p><p>We agree with the Reviewer that 0.33 s is a relatively short freezing bout duration compared to conventional reporting methods. Historically, minimum freezing bout lengths were greater because behavioral data was largely humanly scored, which generally limited minimum bout durations to 1 second.</p><p>However, for this manuscript, we aimed to leverage the sensitivity of automated scoring methods. It remains important, however, to note that our behavioral data does not vary appreciably due to differences in scoring methodology. Thus, we show that freezing duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref>) and number of freeze bouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B</xref>) scored when minimum freeze bouts were set at 1 s or 0.33 s is highly correlated. Furthermore, we show that the median bout duration is 1.4 s and the average bout duration is approximately 2 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1C</xref>; 682 freeze bouts).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Scatterplot shows the correlation between scored freeze duration (A) and scored freeze bouts (B) when minimum freezing bout duration is 1s and 0.</title><p>33 s.

Figure 8 J and K are missing the number of mice in the legend, and single data points on the graphs.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this oversight. The purpose of those plots was to show that CCK activity was higher far from the threat during either escape or approach to the rat. To show this effect, we had compared neural activity in the left and right side of the enclosure during those behaviors. While this approach produced a significant effect, during the revision we realized that this method arbitrarily separated the environment into two locations. Thus, now, to show the relationship between CCK activity and distance to the rat we show that CCK activity is negatively correlated with proximity to the threatening ra (Figure 8I)t. This method is better than the previous version of the plots because the correlation does not require separating arbitrarily the environment into two subregions, and is a more unbiased way of illustrating that CCK activity is lower when the mouse is closer to the rat, in both approach and escape. The nâs are n=9 syn mice and 13 CCK mice, and this information has now been added to the legend. We refrained from plotting individual data points for each of the spatial bins because this would result in a cluttered graph with an unreasonably large number of points in each plot (90 syn points and 130 CCK points, as there are 10 spatial bins in the correlation). Nevertheless, we are glad to add these extra data points if the reviewers feel they are necessary.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>i. Revise the pupil dilation experiment either interpretation-wise or add new data. Our concern is, that if radically different stimulation parameters are used, such as intentionally by the authors here to get rid of behavioural responses, how can we assume that the results can be generalized over apparently different defensive states? A comparison of the behavioural responses for the two intensities (high intensity, as reported for behaviour, and low intensity, as for the pupil dilation) in the same animals can help clarify this issue.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment and for the opportunity to clarify why we chose to employ a lower-intensity stimulation protocol for the optogenetic pupil dilation experiment. We first note that behaviors and pupil dilation were done, respectively, at 3.5 mW and 1.5 mW. These values are different, but we respectfully disagree with the Reviewerâs statement that these are âradically different stimulation parameters.â We also note that the same stimulation frequency and pulse length were used.</p><p>We used lower-intensity stimulation for the pupil diameter assay because 1.5 mW power did not elicit the overt escape responses observed at higher-intensity stimulation (3-3.5 mW). It is not possible to use high intensity stimulation in the head-fixed setup, as our preliminary attempts to do so showed that optogenetic stimulation of CCK cells at 3.5 mW induced vigorous escape motion, almost causing the headcap implant to be pulled out. Furthermore, lower-intensity stimulation allowed us to avoid movement-related arousal or stress (from attempting to escape but not being able to) that could have indirectly increased pupil dilation as a secondary effect and potentially confounded the measurements. Thus, our experiment shows that changes in pupil size are a consequence of the optogenetic stimulation, rather than a consequence of increased locomotion caused by the stimulation.</p><p>Although it is not possible to measure pupil size at 3.5 mW for the reasons outlined above, it is very probable that the pupil size would also increase at 3.5 mW. It is fairly unlikely that the pupil size would not be increased when the animal receives higher stimulation causing behavioral manifestations of escape. In our initial attempts we observed that clear behavioral escape responses were not elicited at 1.5 mW, which prompted us to increase the stimulation power to the minimum amount that induced observable behavioral changes.</p><p>Thus, indeed, as stated by the Reviewer, stimulation at different intensities may create distinct behavioral states. We have thus changed the interpretation of the data as requested, and now state that lower simulation is sufficient to induce physiological changes, while higher stimulation produces behavioral escape responses. This interpretation fits the data, and indicates small increases in l/vlPAG CCK cells induce the physiological pupil size change first, indicating higher alertness, which may serve as a useful pre-emptive preparation for eventual escape if CCK activity increases further.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>j. Stimulation in the EPM follows a 2min ON 2min OFF order. It would be important to know when stimulation occurs â when the animal is in the open or closed arm and whether this correlates with the percent time spent in the open arm. To explain, if stim of CCK neurons is aversive as suggested by the RPTP task then there could be a summation of aversiveness when stimulation occurs in the open vs closed arm.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this important observation. It is true that with a fixed duration ON/OFF laser delivery protocol as was used here to apply optogenetic manipulation to the elevated plus maze assay, we are unable to control whether laser onset coincides with occupation of the open or closed arms. As we show that stimulation of CCK cells is aversive in the real-time place test assay, it is possible that stimulation of CCK cells while in a certain arm may lead to a summation of aversion of said arm. To address this, we show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref> that a majority (60 Â± 10%) of laser onsets occur while ChR2 mice (n=10) occupy a closed arm, and the same mice also spend a majority of laser delivery in the closed arms (68.16 Â± 3.39%). Thus, while a majority of laser onsets occurred while mice occupied the closed arms, mice also spent a majority of time in the closed arms, suggesting that arm occupancy during laser onset did not result in a summation of aversion to the closed arms.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Data from ChR2 mice (n=10) receiving stimulation to l/vlPAG-CCK cells during elevated plus maze assay.</title><p>(A) Bar plot showing mice occupied a closed arm during 60% of laser onsets.
