However, the within-host dynamics that underlie pathogen spread to and clearance from systemic organs remain largely uncharacterized. In animal models of infection, the observed pathogen population results from the combined contributions of bacterial replication, persistence, death, and dissemination, each of which can vary across organs. Quantifying the contribution of each these processes is required to interpret and understand experimental phenotypes. Here, we leveraged STAMPR, a new barcoding framework, to investigate the population dynamics of extraintestinal pathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, a common cause of bacteremia, during murine systemic infection. We show that while bacteria are largely cleared by most organs, organ-specific clearance failures are pervasive and result from dramatic expansions of clones representing less than 0.0001% of the inoculum. Clonal expansion underlies the variability in bacterial burden between animals, and stochastic dissemination of clones profoundly alters the pathogen population structure within organs. Despite variable pathogen expansion events, host bottlenecks are consistent yet highly sensitive to infection variables, including inoculum size and macrophage depletion. We adapted our barcoding methodology to facilitate multiplexed validation of bacterial fitness determinants identified with transposon mutagenesis and confirmed the importance of bacterial hexose metabolism and cell envelope homeostasis pathways for organ-specific pathogen survival. Collectively, our findings provide a comprehensive map of the population biology that underlies bacterial systemic infection and a framework for barcode-based high-resolution mapping of infection dynamics.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>bacteremia</kwd><kwd>barcodes</kwd><kwd>bottlenecks</kwd><kwd>clonal expansion</kwd><kwd>systemic infection</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Waldor</surname><given-names>Matthew K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hullahalli</surname><given-names>Karthik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1 F31 AI156949-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hullahalli</surname><given-names>Karthik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AI-042347</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Waldor</surname><given-names>Matthew K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>During <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> systemic infection, the replication of a minuscule fraction of the inoculum drives organ-specific clearance failures, systemic dissemination, and stochastic infection outcomes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sustained bacterial survival in the bloodstream and establishment within otherwise sterile organs is often fatal and severely burdens healthcare infrastructure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Christaki and Giamarellos-Bourboulis, 2014</xref>). In healthy individuals, bacteria frequently breach epithelial barriers and enter into the circulatory system, but are rapidly eliminated by complement and other humoral factors and/or captured and killed by liver- and spleen-resident phagocytic cells, clearing the infection and preventing sustained bacteremia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jenne and Kubes, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Krenkel and Tacke, 2017</xref>). However, some pathogenic bacteria can at least temporarily evade or resist these host defenses to potentially enable subsequent dissemination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Smith et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Armbruster et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holmes et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ercoli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gresham et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Siggins et al., 2020</xref>). Extraintestinal pathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ExPEC)<italic>,</italic> a set of pathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> isolates that cause disease outside of the intestine, are the leading causes of bacteremia in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dale and Woodford, 2015</xref>). In mouse models of systemic infection, ExPEC strains exhibit markedly delayed clearance from the liver and spleen compared to commensal <italic>E. coli</italic>, suggesting that despite their eventual clearance, ExPEC possess strategies to persist longer within organs, thereby delaying the resolution of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Smith et al., 2010</xref>). However, when and where these clearance delays manifest is not fully understood. More broadly, the pathogen population dynamics of systemic infections is highly complex and not well characterized, and understanding the interplay between bacterial spread, replication, persistence, and clearance can help inform therapeutic interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abel et al., 2015b</xref>).</p><p>A variety of immunological and microscopy approaches have been employed to investigate the host factors that regulate bacterial dissemination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ercoli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Siggins et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jorch et al., 2019</xref>). For example, replication of <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> within CD169<sup>+</sup> splenic macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ercoli et al., 2018</xref>) or <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> within GATA6<sup>+</sup> peritoneal macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jorch et al., 2019</xref>) have been shown to enable systemic dissemination. However, such approaches require infection models with very large bacterial burdens and are not easily amenable to high-throughput or population- and animal-wide analyses. Furthermore, these methodologies require prior understanding of within-host pathogen population dynamics during infection, which then enable hypothesis generation to dissect underlying mechanisms of infection.</p><p>Several different bacterial population-level approaches have been employed to study infection dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abel et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fiebig et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grant et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blundell and Levy, 2014</xref>), including systemic infection in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa, S. aureus,</italic> and <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bachta et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pollitt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gerlini et al., 2014</xref>). Most of these methodologies involve barcoding otherwise identical bacteria and enumerating the abundance of barcodes to follow lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blundell and Levy, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jasinska et al., 2020</xref>). One approach known as STAMP (Sequence Tag-Based Analysis of Microbial Populations) leverages deep sequencing of bacteria barcoded with random DNA sequence tags and population genetics frameworks to quantify bottlenecks, dissemination patterns, and, more recently, replication rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abel et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mahmutovic et al., 2021</xref>). STAMP was initially developed to study <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> intestinal colonization, and subsequently applied to <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> dissemination from the intestine, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> bacteremia, and <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> nasopharyngeal colonization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bachta et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). We recently created STAMPR, a successor to STAMP that relies on a new computational framework and employs additional metrics to study infection population dynamics at higher resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hullahalli et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Previous analyses of infection population dynamics have often been limited by either a small number of barcodes, organ samples, or time points. Here, we leveraged STAMPR to comprehensively map ExPEC population dynamics following dissemination in blood after intravenous (i.v.) inoculation using ~1100 barcodes across over 400 samples from 6 time points and 12 within-animal compartments. Intravenous bacteremia models vary in outcome depending on strain, dose, and length of time post inoculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Smith et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pollitt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Diabate et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McAdow et al., 2011</xref>). We adopted a nonlethal dose of ExPEC to investigate the delayed clearance of this pathogen and monitored the clearance phase to uncover the population dynamics that underlie delayed clearance. Although ExPEC is largely cleared by most organs, some organs, most notably the liver, stochastically fail to clear the pathogen. We show that these failures are attributable to the massive expansion of very few bacterial cells from the inoculum and explain the marked variation in bacterial burden observed between animals and organs. In certain instances, these clones disseminate and alter the population structure within distal organs. Despite these dramatic clonal expansion events, the magnitude of host bottlenecks remains consistent within organs between animals. However, bottleneck sizes are plastic and highly sensitive to experimental conditions. Both macrophage depletion and increased dose widen bottleneck sizes, but stochastic clonal expansion events can obscure colony forming unit (CFU)-based detection of these phenotypes. Finally, guided by our granular assessment of population dynamics, we identify ExPEC genes required for the establishment of and persistence through infection as well as clonal expansion; unexpectedly, bacterial hexose metabolism distinguishes these processes in an organ-specific manner. Collectively, our findings explain the population-level phenotypes that underpin ExPEC systemic dissemination and deepen our understanding of the origins of within-host bacterial populations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experimental design and analyses</title><p>A key metric for understanding within-host population dynamics is the founding population size (FP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abel et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mahmutovic et al., 2021</xref>). FP quantifies the number of unique cells from the inoculum that give rise to the pathogen population at a sampling point. Higher FP values are indicative of wider (more permissive) bottlenecks. FP can be measured by an equation derived by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Krimbas and Tsakas, 1971</xref>, the output of which is referred to as N<sub>b</sub>. The greater the difference in barcode frequencies between input and output samples, the smaller the N<sub>b</sub>. In STAMPR, an algorithmic adjustment is made to N<sub>b</sub> that limits the influence of disproportionately abundant barcodes, resulting in a new metric called N<sub>r</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hullahalli et al., 2021</xref>, mSystems). The degree to which N<sub>b</sub> is biased by these ‘outliers’ can be exploited by calculation of the N<sub>r</sub>/N<sub>b</sub> ratio, providing a measure of uniformity of barcode frequencies; this ratio is larger in samples where a few bacterial clones have markedly expanded.</p><p>We introduced ~1150 20 nt random and unique sequence barcodes into the ExPEC strain CFT073 (rpoS<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Welch et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ristow and Welch, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hryckowian and Welch, 2013</xref>) <italic>lacZ</italic> locus.

Deep sequencing of the barcodes at different known bottleneck sizes (i.e., plated CFU) revealed that N<sub>r</sub> and N<sub>b</sub> both accurately quantified in vitro bottlenecks up to 10<sup>5</sup> CFU for this library, confirming the fidelity of these metrics and the absence of substantial technical artifacts during library preparation (e.g., PCR jackpots, contaminating barcodes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>Mice were injected intravenously with 10<sup>7</sup> CFU of the barcoded ExPEC library and were sacrificed beginning 4 hr post infection (hpi) and then daily up to 5 days post infection (dpi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The blood, bile, left and right halves of the spleen, left and right kidney, left and right lung, and all four lobes of the liver were harvested at each time point. 4 mice each day were sacrificed from 0 to 4 days post infection, and 12 mice were sacrificed at 5 dpi, collectively yielding 384 CFU measurements across 12 suborgans and 6 time points. Sequencing for STAMPR calculations was carried out on 322 samples that had nonzero CFU. Organs containing as few as 1 CFU were sequenced and analyzed because such samples served as important within-run sequencing controls, yielding information about the level of noise due to technical artifacts (such as index hopping), as they should only possess one highly dominant barcode.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental design and metrics and CFU dynamics.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The experimental schematic depicts the extraintestinal pathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ExPEC) barcoded library as colored bacteria, where colors indicate unique barcodes; the library was injected intravenously (i.v.) into mice, after which organs were harvested, homogenized, and plated for enumeration of CFU.

As observed in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Smith et al., 2010</xref>), the highest CFU values were found in blood and most organs 4 hpi (0 dpi) and a few bacteria remained detectable in blood after 1 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The kidneys displayed a similar trend, although some bacteria were detected up to 5 dpi in some animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). The spleen contained more bacteria than the kidneys but still trended towards clearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). In the lung, however, even at 5 dpi, several hundred bacteria were present, suggesting that the lung has lower clearance capacities compared to the other organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). The rapid pathogen elimination from blood likely reflects clearance by filtrative organs like the liver and spleen, which had the highest bacterial burdens 4 hpi, rather than killing by blood (e.g., complement), since mouse blood is permissive for <italic>E. coli</italic> growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marcus et al., 1954</xref>).</p><p>Clearance failures were most prominent in the liver, which yielded the highest CFU values 5 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Hepatic bacterial burdens were bimodal, with some mice containing ~10<sup>6</sup> bacterial cells while littermates had ~10<sup>4</sup>-fold fewer bacteria. Notably, animals with high CFU had visible abscesses in the liver. Lobes of the liver that lacked visible abscesses did not have high CFU, arguing against the presence of occult abscesses. While CFU were usually cleared from organs outside the liver, high CFU were also occasionally observed in additional organs; for example, in one animal, the bacterial burden in the left and right lungs differed by 100-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Unlike the liver, the organs with elevated CFU did not harbor visibly apparent abscesses. We also observed three animals with very high bacterial burdens in the bile (~10<sup>7</sup> CFU/ml) aspirated from gallbladder samples from 4 and 5 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Taken together, measurements of bacterial burden alone suggest a model whereby the pathogen distribution early during infection is highly predictable; however, by 5 dpi there is substantial variability in burden, and the range of this variability is organ-specific. To generalize, we can identify at least two trajectories from CFU alone. The first is successful clearance, where very few bacteria survive or persist till 5 dpi with a general decrease in CFU over time. The second appears to be variable organ-specific clearance failure, the most dramatic of which result in liver abscesses but were also detected in ‘outlier’ animals at least once in all organs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Clearance failures are mostly driven by clonal expansion</title><p>To determine the ExPEC population structure within organs, barcode frequencies were determined and N<sub>b</sub> and N<sub>r</sub> were calculated from the 322 samples that had nonzero CFU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–J</xref> demonstrates examples of N<sub>b</sub> and N<sub>r</sub> values calculated from barcode frequency distributions. The distributions themselves provide intuitive snapshots of the bacterial population structure in single animals. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> demonstrates an animal with unusually high CFU in blood, where ~95% of reads corresponded to a single tag. The same barcode was highly abundant in the left lung of the same animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), accounting for more than 90% of reads. In addition, this sample had an underlying population that comprised 7% of reads. Therefore, the elevated bacterial burden in the left lung of this animal results from a clone that was also circulating in blood. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref> depicts bacteria from a spleen sample from a different animal than <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> in which ~80 barcodes represented ~100 CFU, revealing that there was very little apparent replication (low N<sub>r</sub>/N<sub>b</sub> ratio), similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>. In stark contrast, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref> represents a liver lobe with an abscess from a different animal than <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref> with &gt;10<sup>6</sup> CFU derived from only ~10 tags, an example of dramatic replication of very few cells.</p><p>The patterns described above (exemplified by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–E and G–J</xref>) can be distilled by comparisons of N<sub>b</sub>, N<sub>r</sub>, and CFU values. For example, when N<sub>b</sub> and N<sub>r</sub> are similar to each other and to CFU, we can deduce that the bacterial population has undergone very little replication (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). In contrast, organs with high CFU and low N<sub>r</sub> and N<sub>b</sub> values contain populations that resulted from expansion of very few cells (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>). At 4 hpi, when mice were still bacteremic, we observed that the number of blood CFU (~100) was nearly the same as the corresponding N<sub>r</sub> (~80), indicating that at this point most bacteria possessed different tags, suggesting that there has been little replication in blood following inoculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Like the blood, at early time points both kidneys had N<sub>r</sub> values similar to CFU, indicating minimal net replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Our approach also permits analysis of the underlying populations in animals that appear to be ‘outliers’ from others in the cohort. One example is an animal from 3 dpi where the left kidney possessed 0 CFU and the right had &gt;10,000 CFU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The population in the right kidney was represented by only eight tags, revealing that approximately eight bacterial cells from the inoculum had dramatically expanded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In the spleen at 4 hpi (0 dpi), N<sub>r</sub> and N<sub>b</sub> values were ~10<sup>4</sup>, slightly less than CFU values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). By 5 dpi, the CFU recovered (~20) was very close to values of N<sub>r</sub>, indicating that these remaining cells had not undergone substantial replication. One notable exception was a sample from 5 dpi (mouse 23) that had a much higher bacterial burden than other mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Since this animal also had a markedly elevated N<sub>r</sub> (wider bottleneck) as well as an elevated N<sub>r</sub>/N<sub>b</sub> (expanded clones over a diverse population), the increased bacterial burden can be attributed both to clonal expansion as well as a wider bottleneck, which is consistent with visual observations of barcode frequency distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). In the lungs, CFU approximated N<sub>r</sub>, indicating that the bacterial population had undergone very little replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). This is consistent with the longitudinal CFU measurements, which plateaued by 3 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Comparisons of barcode distributions in animals with or without clonal expansion events.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) CFU from the left half of the spleen 5 days post infection (dpi); points with the same fill and border color are derived from the same animal.

The elevated hepatic CFU values were associated with clonal expansion events since N<sub>r</sub> and N<sub>b</sub> were orders of magnitude lower than CFU in animals with abscesses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Even at 1 dpi, two animals had clonal expansion (N<sub>r</sub>/N<sub>b</sub> &gt;1000) in multiple lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>) where ~ 1% of barcodes comprised a large majority of the reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–H</xref>). Nevertheless, at 5 dpi all animals had similar N<sub>r</sub> values, despite some having abscesses and the concomitant 10,000-fold increase in bacterial burden (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Thus, the immune and physical factors that govern bottlenecks appear to be highly consistent between animals. Instead, the focal and stochastic expansion of a few clones within abscesses, rather than a general increase in bacterial survival, explains the wide variance in liver CFUs. In general, these analyses revealed that N<sub>r</sub> values were more consistent and lower than CFU across all organs particularly at 5 dpi, revealing that most observations of very high bacterial burden are driven by very few bacterial clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>). Apart from the lung, FP sizes decreased during the 5 days of observation. Therefore, the host forces that restrict the bacterial population in this model act throughout the infection and are not limited to the initial establishment of the pathogen population. However, each organ is associated with a specific and distinct probability of yielding clonal expansion, likely reflecting their underlying biological/compositional differences.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Patterns of inter- and intra-organ dissemination</title><p>Comparisons of barcode frequencies between two organ samples can be used to quantify the relatedness between two pathogen populations in the host, effectively revealing inter- and intra-organ spread. This metric, known as genetic distance (GD), is small when two samples are highly related and large when samples are not related. Low GD values (~0.1–0.2) require that the same barcodes be relatively abundant, not simply present, in both samples. Spreading event(s) therefore must have occurred prior to sampling to allow for sufficient time to result in the same barcode(s) being highly abundant in both samples or be substantial enough to where a large number of bacteria are transferred. GD is also influenced by outliers, and so a different metric, called RD (‘resilient’ genetic distance), quantifies the number of barcodes that contribute to the similarity between two populations in a manner that takes into account all detected barcodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hullahalli et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). For example, if both RD and GD are low, only a few barcodes contribute to the genetic similarity between samples. In contrast, if RD is high and GD is low, the samples are similar because they share many barcodes, which often occurs when samples closely resemble the inoculum through recent temporal separation. Therefore, RD provides a metric to distinguish between samples that are similar because they share few (low RD) or many (high RD) barcodes. RD can be normalized to the number of barcodes in a sample, and this ‘fractional’ RD (FRD) is a directional metric that quantifies the extent to which shared barcodes are represented by all barcodes in the sample. FRD<sub>A-B</sub> is low when the shared barcodes in samples A and B represent a small fraction of the total barcodes in sample B, and large when the shared barcodes represent a large fraction of the total barcodes in sample B. FRD<sub>B-A</sub> is the reverse, where the shared barcodes are normalized to the total barcodes in sample A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>To depict dissemination patterns across the entire animal, we display GD and FRD values as heatmaps, which permit rapid visualization of the degree to which samples are similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">6</xref>). At 4 hpi, all organs possess highly similar bacterial populations that share many barcodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) as they have only recently been separated from the inoculum. After this initial capture of bacteria, GD between organs generally increases over time, suggesting that the populations are not substantially disseminating and mixing, and that populations within organs are continually being antagonized by host defense processes, consistent with overall decreases in CFU.</p><p>In mice with expanded clones in the liver 1 dpi (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–H</xref>), the dominant barcodes were not detected in other organs or other lobes of the liver, indicating that these expanded clones were locally confined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, asterisks). Similarly, in animals with liver abscesses apparent 4 or 5 dpi, the bacterial populations in the lobe with the abscess were largely distinct from populations in other organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>). Dissection and comparison of individual abscesses from the same animal revealed that these populations were distinct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), suggesting that abscesses do not originate from the same bacterial population and do not substantially exchange bacteria. Surprisingly, multiple clones, rather than one, comprise a single abscess. In contrast to the liver, bacterial expansion events in other organs were associated with dissemination. The most significant spreading events were observed when ExPEC reached the bile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref> [mice 17, 20], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref> [mouse 31]). Each of the three animals with CFU in bile harbored a single highly dominant clone (&gt;99% of all reads) and these clones spread systemically to multiple organs; however, the precise organs to which the clone disseminated varied across mice, suggesting that spread of these clones is stochastic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplements 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">6</xref>). Furthermore, FRD<sub>organ-bile</sub> was significantly greater than the FRD<sub>bile-organ</sub>, confirming that systemic organs possess relatively more abundant nontransferred populations than bile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). More broadly, FRD values across all organs with some relatedness (GD &lt; 0.8) decreased significantly over time, indicating that relatedness at later time points was the result of relatively few barcodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, few barcodes relative to the total barcodes in a sample, not the entire library). Taken together, these results reveal that early genetic relatedness is driven by recent temporal separation (i.e., many barcodes), while later genetic relatedness is typically driven by the dissemination of a few clones.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Visualizing dissemination patterns.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Barcode frequency distribution from the right lobe of the liver in a single animal (mouse 24) is shown.

The GD-based heatmap identifies instances of transfer (bluer colors), and FRD-based heatmaps reveal the fraction of barcodes that contribute to transfer, a metric (in addition to FP) to gauge clonality.

In contrast, mouse 34 had substantial systemic sharing (relatively blue GD heatmap, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), where a single clone was dominant across all organs (blue/purple FRD heatmap, black colors indicate that no barcodes are shared). Bacterial burdens in the spleen and lungs were also two- to fivefold higher in mouse 34 than mouse 33. The presence of this clone highlights the substantial impact a single bacterium from the inoculum can have on pathogen distribution in the host. Thus, our approach enables detection and quantification of stochastic clonal expansion events; observing such events, which can remain localized or spread, deepens understanding of the origins of within-host pathogen burdens. Collectively, our data reveal that clearance failures and systemic dissemination are mostly attributable to ~0.0001% of the inoculum. The manifestation of these events is highly variable across mice but can fall into three trajectories: (1) complete clearance without dissemination, (2) clonal expansion without dissemination (e.g., liver abscesses), and (3) clonal expansion with dissemination (e.g., bile).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Host bottlenecks are widened by increased pathogen dose and macrophage depletion</title><p>The in-depth characterization of ExPEC systemic infection presented above served as a framework that enabled us to begin to investigate the factors and mechanisms that govern these dynamics. Many perturbations in infection models are known to alter bacterial burdens, although quantifying the degree to which changes in CFU result from wider (more permissive) bottlenecks and/or from increased replication has been challenging. The metrics employed in this study can be used to disentangle these processes.</p><p>We first assessed how bacterial burden and bottlenecks are influenced by infectious dose, which is fundamentally linked to infection outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sanchez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schmid-Hempel and Frank, 2007</xref>). The barcoded ExPEC library was i.v. inoculated at two doses (5E6 and 2E7) and the livers and spleens were harvested at 5 dpi. The relatively small difference in the sizes of these inocula further allowed us to assess the sensitivity of CFU and FP to modest differences in dose. Splenic CFU was highly consistent within groups, as observed above, and a fourfold increase in dose resulted in ExPEC burdens ~2.5-fold greater than in the low-dose group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). N<sub>b</sub> and N<sub>r</sub> in the spleen were also relatively similar within the groups, indicating relatively uniform barcode distributions, and both values were significantly larger in the high-dose group, suggesting that there is a general correlation between dose, CFU burdens, and FP sizes in the spleen. Hepatic bacterial burdens were much more variable, consistent with data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>. Unexpectedly, there was a reduction in the bacterial burden in the liver at the high dose; a greater incidence of abscesses in the low-dose group (6/10 animals) compared to the high-dose group (2/9 animals) led to a reduction in median CFU at the high dose. Despite the higher hepatic burdens in animals given the low dose, N<sub>r</sub> was significantly higher in animals given the high dose, reflecting the role of clonal expansion in elevated CFU. The scaling of FP with dose reveals that a fixed fraction, not number, of bacterial cells from the inoculum survive clearance mechanisms up to 5 dpi. However, in contrast to the spleen, the dramatic replication of very few clones in the liver obscures this relationship from being detected by CFU alone.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Inoculum size and macrophages regulate bottleneck sizes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) CFU, N<sub>b</sub>, and N<sub>r</sub> values from mice given a low (~5E6, circles) and high (~2E7, squares) dose of extraintestinal pathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ExPEC) intravenously (i.v.) 5 days post infection (dpi).

To assess the contribution of these cells in establishing the bottleneck to systemic ExPEC infection, mice were treated with clodronate-containing liposomes, which depletes macrophages from the vasculature, particularly in the liver and spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Van and Sanders, 1994</xref>). The next day, mice were i.v. inoculated with ExPEC at the low (~5E6) dose used above. We chose a dose of clodronate and control liposomes that only partially depletes macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tavares et al., 2017</xref>) because at higher, commonly used clodronate doses, animals rapidly succumb to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pollitt et al., 2018</xref>). There was an increase in splenic CFU 5 dpi in animals treated with clodronate, whereas this difference was more subtle in the liver, lungs, and kidneys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). N<sub>b</sub> and N<sub>r</sub> calculations revealed that macrophage depletion increased FP sizes in the liver, spleen, and kidneys, although the difference in the lung was not statistically significant. The significant increase in FP, but not CFU, after clodronate treatment in the liver is explained by two animals in the control group with the dramatic expansion of very few clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, red and black circles). Since clodronate treatment increased both FP and CFU, macrophage depletion widens the bottlenecks in the liver, spleen, and kidney. Taken together with the dosing experiment, these observations underscore how stochastic expansion of clones can obscure detection of biologically significant signals, highlighting the utility of using barcoded libraries during experimental infection for even subtle changes in experimental parameters. In addition to being able to detect these signals, barcoding approaches can reveal whether elevation in CFU burdens is attributed to heightened bacterial replication within organs or wider host bottlenecks. In this model, increased dose and macrophage depletion widened bottlenecks in the host but did not increase the levels of bacterial replication.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Bacterial genetic analyses disentangle organ-specific and temporal infection outcomes</title><p>Our STAMPR-based analyses uncovered several patterns of pathogen population trajectories in infected hosts, including eradication early during infection, survival/persistence until late in infection, and clonal expansion with or without dissemination. Moreover, each of these trajectories had organ-specific patterns. Since bacteria within these different trajectories likely encounter distinct host niches, we set out to identify bacterial genetic factors that distinguish these environments. We further reasoned that identification of organ-specific bacterial genes required for early survival, but not for subsequent expansion or persistence, would (1) signify that early and late survival/expansion are at least in part separable and (2) identify the pathways that distinguish them. To identify early pathogen survival determinants, we analyzed an ExPEC transposon library composed of ~150,000 unique transposon mutants 1 day after i.v. inoculation. As expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>), we detected highly dominant mutants (i.e., clones) in the livers and spleens of 3/5 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

This library was i.v. inoculated and the bile, spleen, right kidney, lungs, and all four lobes of the liver (separately) were harvested 1 and 5 dpi. Barcodes in each sample were then sequenced to determine the abundance of all 21 tags, and therefore each mutant.</p><p>1 dpi in the liver, stochastic clonal expansion was observed and manifest as a dramatic increase in the abundance of a few barcodes and the corresponding marked decrease in the abundance of all other tags in the sample, even those from the same genotype. Thus, clonal expansion explains the large variance in fitness measurements. For example, one animal had a substantial expansion of one of the three tags barcoding the <italic>mlaC, manA,</italic> and <italic>nagA</italic> mutants in the caudate lobe of the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, red asterisks), within an associated drop in the abundance of all other barcodes from the animal, even the other barcodes marking the same mutants.

Therefore, cell envelope and sugar metabolism genes likely contribute to distinct mechanisms that facilitate ExPEC survival, in the face of host factors that fluctuate over time and between organs. These results further reveal that the pathogen factors that are required for the initial establishment of infection differ from those required to survive later or clonally expand. Specifically, ExPEC requires hexose metabolism to establish populations within specific organs, but this pathway is not required by the subpopulations that ultimately persist later in the infection or clonally expand, suggesting that establishment, persistence, and expansion depend on distinct pathogen pathways. These data further highlight how understanding within host infection dynamics provides critical contextualization of pathogen virulence or fitness factors that vary in their importance across time and space.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, using pathogen barcoding and a high-resolution approach for comparing barcode frequency distributions, we describe the complex infection dynamics of systemic ExPEC infection (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Although we found that ExPEC is largely cleared by most organs, we observed organ-specific population dynamics and discovered that clearance failures are pervasive, particularly in the liver. These failures manifest as dramatic expansions of very few bacterial cells from the inoculum. Some expansions are not easily revealed by CFU alone (e.g., clonal expansion at 1 dpi in the liver), but our analytic approach readily detects and quantifies these events in addition to contextualizing them with populations at other sites. During experimental perturbations, our analyses also readily distinguished when increases in bacterial burden are due to widening of bottlenecks or to increased bacterial replication. We found that, despite clonal expansion, host bottlenecks were highly consistent between animals across all organs. However, bottlenecks are highly sensitive to subtle organ-specific changes in experimental parameters, including inoculum size and macrophage depletion. Furthermore, we identify a potential role for bacterial sugar metabolism that distinguishes early extraintestinal survival with later persistence or clonal expansion. Our analysis of population dynamics can also refine transposon-based studies of genetic requirements by contextualizing bacterial genes required for infection in the setting of temporal, organ-specific, and stochastic infection outcomes. In addition, understanding the population dynamics of an infection model facilitates the optimization of experimental designs in infection studies.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Schematic summary of key findings.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) and (<bold>B</bold>) schematize the most distinct trajectories of extraintestinal pathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ExPEC) population dynamics identified – one where bacteria are nearly cleared (<bold>A</bold>) and one where they expand clonally (<bold>B</bold>). Additional intermediate categories are also observed when clonally expanded populations disseminate systemically and alter bacterial burdens and population structure in distal organs (<bold>C</bold>). The probability of dissemination depends on the organ where clonal expansion occurred (<bold>D</bold>); for example, there was a much larger likelihood of disseminating when there was clonal expansion evident in bile versus from the liver. Every animal displays a unique pattern of expansion and dissemination.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-70910-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Infection bottlenecks are critical determinants of infection outcomes. This notion was appreciated as far back as the 1950s with the ‘independent action’ hypothesis, which posits that each organism from the inoculum possesses equal probability to cause infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Moxon and Murphy, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rubin, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shechmeister, 1950</xref>). The idea was based on observations that at lower infectious doses, but above the minimum infectious dose, the bacterial population in the animal was more likely to be derived from a single organism, whereas at higher doses the population was more likely to be derived from a several organisms from the inoculum. Through the lens of bottlenecks, this hypothesis can be reinterpreted to imply that each bacterium has an equal probability of passing through the bottleneck. If the nature of the bottleneck is fractional (i.e., a fraction the inoculum passes through), increasing the dose increases the number of organisms that go on to initiate infection. Our finding that FP, but not CFU, scales with infectious doses is consistent with the independent action hypothesis, suggesting that bottlenecks, rather than replication, are more directly influenced by the infectious dose. The current study sets the stage for future investigations to further explore the relationships between dose, FP, replication, and overall infection outcomes in diverse pathogens.</p><p>Our findings highlight the differential capacities of host organs to clear bacteria. In general, most organs continuously restricted the pathogen population over time, indicated by decreasing N<sub>r</sub> values over time. A notable exception to this trend was the lungs, where FP values largely plateaued by 2 dpi, explaining why this organ had among the highest FP sizes 5 dpi. In addition, clodronate had no effect on CFU in the lung and some mutants defective for survival in the liver were more abundant than WT in the lung. These three lines of evidence indicate that the lung microenvironment is less hostile to ExPEC, perhaps reflecting distinct cellular niches (e.g., different immune cell compositions and nutrient availabilities) occupied by ExPEC in the lungs relative to the liver or spleen. Furthermore, we discovered that ExPEC forms visible abscesses in liver at much higher frequencies than expansion events in other organs. Thus, the liver and lungs appear to differ markedly in their clearance defects; the liver appears more permissive for ExPEC replication, whereas the lung appears more permissive for bacterial survival. More broadly, STAMPR enables detection of these two distinct processes.</p><p><italic>E. coli,</italic> and more recently <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae,</italic> are among the leading causes of liver abscesses in humans, and patients with liver abscesses with associated bacteremia are at higher risk for mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Meddings et al., 2010</xref>). The infection model described here may therefore be a tractable experimental system to dissect the host and pathogen factors that underlie <italic>E. coli</italic> liver abscess formation. Since there are very few detectable bacteria in blood, i.v. administration of ExPEC may not represent a good model of human bloodstream infection per se; instead, this model may be more relevant for investigating the efficiency of organ clearance and capture of bloodborne bacteria in addition to within-organ replication. In humans, the source of bacteria in blood varies widely. Although tail vein injection in mice models a very specific route, the fate of bacteria after reaching the bloodstream regardless of the initial entry point may be similar. Furthermore, the i.v. doses used here do not directly model doses likely encountered by humans; however, mice are substantially more resistant to LPS than humans, and higher doses in mice may mimic the lower doses humans are likely to encounter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Copeland et al., 2005</xref>). The limitations and advantages of various bloodstream infection models have been recently reviewed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holmes et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Very few studies to date have reported on the population dynamics of systemic infections. In one study, i.v. inoculation of a <italic>S. aureus</italic> pool consisting of three differentially marked strains revealed several trends observed here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pollitt et al., 2018</xref>). Although the use of three markers limited the resolution, this study of <italic>S. aureus</italic> dissemination also found that bottlenecks (measured as the proportion of organs with less than two strains) widened in size with infectious dose and macrophage depletion. However, unlike ExPEC where expansion of clones in liver abscesses remained locally confined, <italic>S. aureus</italic> dissemination from the liver was thought to result in clonal abscesses in the kidney. In general, abscess formation is much more consistently observed for <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sx et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2009</xref>), whereas this outcome is apparently stochastic in this ExPEC model. Thus, pathogen-specific factors exert distinct roles in the determination of the organ-specific outcomes of clonal expansion events. Another study examining systemic <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> population dynamics with STAMP found that the pathogen consistently replicated in the bile and these cells became the source of bacteria in the intestinal tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bachta et al., 2020</xref>). In ExPEC, the most dramatic instances of dissemination also occurred in animals with ExPEC in bile. The FP of the bile population in our study was ~1, whereas we calculated that the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> FP was ~10 times greater (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hullahalli et al., 2021</xref>). The more restrictive bottleneck for ExPEC potentially explains why transit to the bile is stochastic with this pathogen. The mechanisms by which pathogens such as ExPEC and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> spread systemically from bile require further investigation but may be linked to the event(s) by which the pathogen seeds the bile to begin with.</p><p>The bacterial genetic determinants of systemic infection are of great interest as these may inform development of therapeutics for the treatment of these severe infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Armbruster et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Subashchandrabose et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Subashchandrabose et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 2017</xref>). In models of overwhelming bacteremia, these genetic determinants often encode surface structures, such as the capsule in K1 ExPEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McCarthy et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly, we found that most of the underrepresented genes in the liver and spleen encoded components of the cell envelope. Unexpectedly, there was little overlap between genes we identified to be underrepresented in the liver or spleen and genes identified as underrepresented in a previous study using a similar experimental system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Subashchandrabose et al., 2013</xref>). A potential explanation for this discrepancy is that Subashchandrabose et al. performed their experiments in a different mouse background (CBA/J), and different strains of mice impose distinct barriers to infection, altering the pathogen genetic requirements for infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cunrath and Bumann, 2019</xref>). In addition, it is unknown whether clonal expansion occurs in CBA/J mice. Our findings suggest that understanding population dynamics prior to determining genetic requirements can refine identification of genetic dependencies in the presence of genotype-independent expansion events. More broadly, the use of isogenic libraries (STAMPR) can complement mutant libraries (TIS) by providing important information about bottlenecks and can contextualize genetic requirements in the landscape of population dynamics. Furthermore, mutant libraries complement isogenic libraries by revealing further distinctions (e.g., bacterial genetic determinants) that distinguish broader population-level phenomena in the host, such as replication and persistence.</p><p>Analysis of barcode frequency distributions permits a more quantitative and deeper dissection of population dynamics in experimental infection models beyond enumerating bacterial burdens within organs. The eight metrics we used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hullahalli et al., 2021</xref>) to compare pairs of organs within an animal allow for delineation of patterns of expansion and dissemination. For example, we show how some expanded clones (i.e., in liver abscesses) appear to have relatively little influence on barcode frequencies in other organs in the animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In stark contrast, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> reveals an example in which a single clone in the bile profoundly alters the pathogen distribution in multiple organs. In many cases, we observed that CFU values were similar to FP values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>), suggesting that the respective bacterial population had not undergone substantial net replication. Heatmaps enable direct visualization of dissemination patterns and the degree to which these dissemination events manifest within an organ. Heatmaps from animals 5 dpi revealed marked heterogeneity in dissemination patterns that vary across organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>). Furthermore, these metrics reveal the variability between animals both in terms of clonal expansion within organs, bottlenecks between organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>), and dissemination within and between organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>). Beyond comparisons between animals, our metrics can be applied to single animals and revealed that stochastic expansion and dissemination of very few cells from the inoculum was pervasive.</p><p>Early stochastic clonal expansion events were detected in every experiment in our study using three independent libraries and distinct approaches (STAMPR, transposon libraries, and barcoded mutants). These expansion events underlie variation in infection outcomes. While dissection of the mechanism(s) that account for this stochasticity is beyond the scope of this study, our observations suggest that several factors account for and modulate clonal expansion. Such events appear to fall into two functional categories – those that are due to dissemination (e.g., from bile) and those that are not (e.g., liver abscesses). In the latter, we observed an apparent inverse correlation with infectious dose, although more animals are required to reach statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This trend suggests that more robust early immune induction (presumably elicited with a higher dose) disproportionately clears bacteria, a hypothesis that has also been generated by mathematical modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ellner et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Duneau et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, we observed apparent lobe (more frequent in the right lobe) and topological (all on the surface) biases in liver abscess formation, raising the possibility that anatomic differences between lobes and their relative locations contribute to apparently stochastic outcomes as some lobes may be more likely to be seeded (due to blood flow) and more permissive to bacterial replication. Furthermore, clonal expansion explains why bacterial burden is highly variable in ExPEC and may also explain high variability in systemic infection outcomes in other bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crépin et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Several lines of evidence suggest that causative genotypic changes are unlikely to be linked to pathogen clonal expansion in liver abscesses, but we cannot definitively exclude this possibility. Expanded clones in the liver arise as early as 1 dpi, which is relatively early in the infection processes when relatively little bacterial replication has occurred. If causative mutants existed in the inoculum prior to infection (e.g., in the colony that was picked to generate the barcoded strain), we would expect the same set of barcodes to expand; however, different sets of barcodes expanded across all three experimental barcoded libraries (e.g., abscess clones in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> are different). If we assume a fixed mutation rate, then we would expect a similar number of clones to expand across animals, as observed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jasinska et al., 2020</xref> and in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vasquez et al., 2020</xref>; however, we observe a bimodal distribution of either 0 expanded clones or ~5–100 expanded clones. Furthermore, since liver abscesses are relatively small and discrete but consist of multiple clones, causative mutations would have had to arise in different bacterial cells that were also clustered together in physical space, which seems extremely unlikely. Notably, despite tight bottlenecks, we predict that beneficial mutations would accumulate if bacteria isolated from abscesses were used to inoculate another set of mice and the process repeated for several passages, as has been observed with <italic>S. aureus</italic> passages in sheep over hundreds of days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bacigalupe et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The STAMPR analytic framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hullahalli et al., 2021</xref>) applied here to study infection population dynamics revealed how very few cells in a large inoculum disproportionally contribute to pathogen burdens in different host organs. By monitoring patterns of dissemination, we uncovered that these few cells can drastically alter pathogen distributions in distal organs. Our findings suggest that perturbations that impede the expansion of the few cells that clonally expand could profoundly alter the course of infection. Finally, our observations of organ-specific pathogen population dynamics and genetic requirements suggest that investigation of host tissue-specific factors that regulate these dynamics, perhaps centered around bacterial metabolism of host-derived sugars, may uncover novel facets of host-pathogen interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Media and antibiotics</title><p>Bacteria were routinely cultured in LB at 37°C.

Derivatives of pGuide were created with the appropriate spacer targeting the gene of interest and homology fragments. To generate deletions in a target gene, the recipient strain was first transformed with pCAS, which harbors a beta-lactamase gene conferring carbenicillin resistance. pGuide was then introduced into a pCAS-carrying recipient strain by conjugation and transconjugants were selected on plates containing chloramphenicol, carbenicillin, and 0.2% arabinose overnight at 37°C. The transconjugants were then scraped and replated on plates containing chloramphenicol, carbenicillin, and 0.2% arabinose overnight at 37°C. Single colonies from this second passage were streaked again on plates containing chloramphenicol, carbenicillin, and 0.2% arabinose. Single colonies from this passage were then streaked on LB plates containing 10% sucrose and lacking NaCl to counter-select both plasmids, which was confirmed by loss of the resistance markers.

Suspensions were spotted on 0.45 µm filters and incubated on plates containing DAP at 37°C for 3 hr, after which the cells were resuspended in PBS and plated on LB+ kanamycin. Barcodes in 10 individual colonies were Sanger-sequenced to confirm that each recipient colony had a single distinct barcode. Finally, 1152 individual colonies were inoculated in twelve 96-well plates in LB+ kanamycin, grown overnight, pooled, and frozen in PBSG.

Additionally, 30 colonies each day were patched from the plate lacking kanamycin onto LB+ kanamycin. All patched colonies on all 5 days were resistant to kanamycin, and thus possessed the barcode. To assess if the pDS132-STAMPR confers an in vitro growth defect, nine different barcoded strains along with CHS7 were growth overnight diluted 1/1000 and individually grown in triplicate in a 96-well plate overnight.

If the cultures yielded a high density of cells, they were scraped and resuspended in PBSG and aliquots were stored at –80°C. If the cultures yielded few cells, each colony was individually picked and resuspended into the same PBSG solution (one tube per sample). Suspensions were frozen at –80°C until processing. Frozen aliquots of cells were later thawed and 2 µl was diluted in 100 µl of water. Samples were then boiled at 95°C for 15 min and 1 µl was used as template for PCR. Cycling conditions for PCR were the following: initial denaturation 98°C 30 s, 25 cycles of 98°C 15 s, 65°C 30 s, and 72°C 15 s, and final extension of 72°C 5 min. Reactions were carried out with a total volume of 50 μl using Phusion DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). Amplified products were then run on 1% agarose gel to verify the presence of the amplicon, and all samples were pooled and purified using the GeneJet PCR Purification Kit (Fisher).

These samples were used to create a standard curve and serve as controls of known bottleneck sizes. All samples were prepared and sequenced as described above. Two replicates of the most undiluted sample were sequenced, and the dedupe plugin on Geneious (Biomatters) was used (k = 20, max substitutions = 2, max edits = 2) to deduplicate the reads to create a preliminary list of reference barcodes. Then, the two replicates used to create this list were combined with a third and mapped to the preliminary list of references in CLC Genomics Workbench (Qiagen) using the default mapping parameters. We then determined a depth threshold that corresponded to 97% of all reads. This was used to determine the set of 1329 barcodes that was used throughout this study. Note that this is slightly greater than the number of colonies picked (1152), thus providing a ‘cushion’ against errors in deduplication or mapping.

This new R-based TIS analysis (RTISAn) employs the resampling strategy used here to calculate FP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hullahalli et al., 2021</xref>) to accurately simulate infection bottlenecks from input TIS libraries. RTISAn serves as a successor to Con-ARTIST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pritchard et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hubbard et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hubbard et al., 2019</xref>). The RTISAn approach is functionally similar to the ‘resampling’ method used in the TRANSIT pipeline but is implemented in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Subramaniyam et al., 2019</xref>). The RTISAn pipeline begins with the user input of a FASTA file and locations of annotations or features. A ‘TAinfo’ file is generated that identifies the overlapping feature of each TA site. The TAinfo file is then used with a BAM mapping file to count the number of reads at each TA site, compiling this information in a ‘TAtally’ file.</p><p>The bulk of the RTISAn computation is used to compare two TAtally vectors, where one is an input and the other is an output. The goal is to identify genes for which insertions are either under- or overrepresented in the output relative to the input. First, both the input and output vectors are normalized via a sliding window approach for replication bias. We set a window and step size of ~100,000 nt, so ~50 windows will be made for the <italic>E. coli</italic> genome. The mean of the bottom 99% of insertions is used to normalize each window, preventing the effects of clonal expansion from influencing the normalization.</p><p>Next, the normalized input vector must be resampled to match the saturation of the output vector. To accomplish this, the normalized input vector is iteratively resampled from a multivariate hypergeometric distribution 100 times, starting from 1000 reads and ending at the number of reads in the normalized input vector. The saturation is plotted against the sampling depth; the sampling depth that best approximates the saturation in the output vector is determined with inverse linear interpolation. The output represents a single sampling depth that accurately simulates the bottleneck on the input such that the saturation matches the output. To refine this estimate, we take a similar approach used to identify local minima in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hullahalli et al., 2021</xref>; instead of identifying local minima, we resample the input vector for 200 iterations at various sampling depths such that the resampling yields saturations closer to the saturation of the output vector than the previous sampling depth. In doing so, 200 sampling depths are acquired from which a mean and standard deviation are obtained. These values are used to sample a normal distribution 100 times. These 100 values represent read depths that when used to resample the input vector result in a saturation that approximates the saturation of the output vector. The final 100 simulations are performed at these read depths on the input vector.</p><p>Each simulation is compared on a gene-by-gene basis to the normalized output vector. We calculate a geometric mean Mann–Whitney p-value and mean fold change across all simulations. We also determine the number of ‘informative sites,’ defined as the number of TA sites that are nonzero across the output and all simulations. Genes with few informative sites in the input will usually not pass significance cutoffs but can still display large fold changes.</p><p>Since both p-value and fold change are separate informative metrics, a script that combines both sets of information to ‘rank’ genes when multiple animal replicates are used was created. This approach is partly unbiased, in that the user supplies a desired p-value and fold change cutoff for significance but the relative position of each gene with respect to the entire data set is considered as well. The rank is first determined by creating a score, from 0 to 1, that measures how many instances a gene passed either the p-value or fold change (with cutoffs of 0.05 and –1 in this study, respectively). For example, if five animals are used, then a score of 0.9 implies that, out of 10 metrics (five fold changes and five p-values), 9 passed the user-specified cutoffs. A separate unbiased rank is created by the mean rank of the average p-value and fold change for each gene. The final rank is then generated from the mean of the unbiased rank and the score. In practice, this strategy ensures that genes that consistently pass the user-specified cutoff will always be ranked above genes that pass the cutoffs fewer times; this latter category can then be subdivided into the relative magnitude of fold change and p-value.</p><p>The entire RTISAn pipeline is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/hullahalli/stampr_rtisan">https://github.com/hullahalli/stampr_rtisan</ext-link> (copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:e0732e032f48933aa99e99ecfeecd762d3f6cd24;origin=https://github.com/hullahalli/stampr_rtisan;visit=swh:1:snp:b67e775c389d065505e4fd4fe108f56ccad4a8ec;anchor=swh:1:rev:d6eadda53c1ef7a78cebbebd09a2243674351091">swh:1:rev:d6eadda53c1ef7a78cebbebd09a2243674351091</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hullahalli and Waldor, 2021</xref>) including TAtally files to reproduce the comparisons in this study.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Analysis of barcoded mutant libraries in vivo</title><p>Barcoding of each mutant was performed by conjugation of the same donor library used to generate the CHS7 barcoded library.

By harvesting bacteria from different sites and times of infection and performing deep sequencing to define the distribution of specific tagged-strains the authors provide a highly detailed snapshot of populations, with discriminatory power superior to prior studies. The work paves the way to future such studies in other organisms that cause persistent infection in humans.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Pathogen clonal expansion underlies multiorgan dissemination and organ-specific outcomes during systemic infection&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Bavesh Kana as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Add a conclusion sentence at the end of abstract. In both the abstract and introduction, a clear articulation of the various objectives of the study would be helpful to orient readers. The abstract would also benefit from presenting specific results, rather than simply a descriptive summary. In particular, it would be useful to mention both hexose metabolism and cell surface gene contributions in the abstract, as summarized in the introduction.</p><p>2. Line 77-78: The ref is a preprint.

The authors show that changes in different parameters (i.e. inoculum) impact the trajectories followed by the pathogens. One can imagine that in a normal scenario, the number of bacterial cells that will arrive to the blood will be much lower than the inoculum used in these experiments.

Is there any evidence that liver infections are over-represented in patients suffering with <italic>E. coli</italic> bacteremia?</p><p>10. In the last part of the paper, the authors identified several genes involved in pathogen survival after infection (early stages).

Can the authors sequence some of the clones that expanded to clearly show if this process of clonal expansion was random (or conversely, was driven in some cases by mutations in specific genes)?</p><p>11. Please elaborate a bit on what is meant by &quot;distinct cellular niches&quot; in the lungs, and how these might account for organ specific results.</p><p>12.

However, since expanded clones comprised different barcodes across different mice and across independent creations of the barcode library, it is extremely unlikely that potential causative mutants were pre-existing in the library. It is also unlikely that mutations occurred in the animal prior to expansion, given that expansion is observed as early as 1 dpi when relatively few doublings have occurred. Furthermore, the discrete localization of liver abscesses would require that causative mutations occurred in different bacterial cells that were somehow also clustered together in physical space, which is extremely unlikely. We have expanded these points in the revised discussion (lines 531-544).</p><p>However, these points do not definitively disprove that mutations are involved in the expansion process. Whole genome sequencing individual clones would almost certainly identify mutations, but only secondary phenotypic validation will confirm that these mutations are linked to expansion. We plan to isolate clones within abscesses and reinfect mice with these clones. However, this experiment is beyond the scope of the present study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. There appears to be a disconnection between the STAMPR and TnSeq analysis, and it would be interesting to see the correlations or some discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>These sections are admittedly more disconnected than the rest of the manuscript, but there are important and practical parallels between STAMPR and TIS:</p><p>1. TIS is inherently limited by bottlenecks, which causes mutants to randomly drop out of the population by chance rather than through selection. Identifying the conditions (e.g., organs, time points, and replication) with the widest bottlenecks via STAMPR is ideally suited to optimize TIS experiments.</p><p>2. Since TIS is genome-scale, the rate of false positives is much higher than competitions between individual mutants. However, screening fitness determinants individually without barcodes is laborious. Barcoding mutants, however, is an approach that balances the tradeoff between false positives and throughput; multiple mutants can be validated simultaneously without false positives. Since a single PCR reaction can be used to simultaneously evaluate the fitness of several mutants, barcoding also enables rapid multiorgan and temporal analyses.</p><p>3. STAMPR (and barcodes more broadly) helps contextualize genetic determinants in the broader population-level landscape. For example, hexose metabolism is specific in both temporal and spatial contexts, whereas cell envelope homeostasis appears to be a more ubiquitous fitness factor in the host.</p><p>4. Since TIS requires the use of mutant libraries, STAMPR acts complementarily with isogenic libraries that can discern which population-level patterns are unlikely to be driven by genotypes pre-existing in the library.</p><p>5. STAMPR can identify discrete patterns of persistence and expansion, and TIS helps narrow down a set of bacterial pathways that could further distinguish these population-level phenomena.</p><p>We have included these points throughout the manuscript and more directly in Lines 493-497</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

Line 603-605, 611: It is unclear why individual colonies were analyzed separately. How were the amplicons pooled? Equal amounts? The steps may introduce variations for deep sequencing analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. Individual colonies were not analyzed separately, but individually picked and pooled together (line 646). This is purely for technical reasons – flooding a plate with 1-5 ml of PBSG when there are very few colonies will result in a relatively dilute bacterial suspension. Individually picking and pooling colonies into a small volume of PBSG is a simpler way of creating a denser bacterial suspension.</p><p>Amplicons were pooled in approximately equal amounts, as determined by band intensity on a gel. Differences in band intensities have a negligible impact on STAMPR measurements, since samples that amplify less efficiently were derived from a more diluted bacterial suspension, with often as little as 1 colony. Because the FP of these samples are so low, they require fewer reads to make accurate measurements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8.

It is highly unlikely that there is a genotypic change that permits clonal expansion, but as noted by reviewer 2, full investigation of the nature of expansion will require a future study.
