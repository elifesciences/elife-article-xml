To understand how temporal input information is encoded and decoded by the NF-κB system, we studied transcription factor dynamics and gene regulation under dose- and duration-modulated inflammatory inputs. Mathematical modeling predicted and microfluidic single-cell experiments confirmed that integral of the stimulus (or area, concentration × duration) controls the fraction of cells that activate NF-κB in the population. However, stimulus temporal profile determined NF-κB dynamics, cell-to-cell variability, and gene expression phenotype. A sustained, weak stimulation lead to heterogeneous activation and delayed timing that is transmitted to gene expression. In contrast, a transient, strong stimulus with the same area caused rapid and uniform dynamics. These results show that digital NF-κB signaling enables multidimensional control of cellular phenotype via input profile, allowing parallel and independent control of single-cell activation probability and population heterogeneity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08931.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08931.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08931.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells have communication systems called signaling pathways that enable them to detect and respond to changes in their surrounding environment. For example, in humans and other animals, a signaling pathway called NF-κB signaling is part of the immune system and regulates the inflammation that is caused by damage to cells, or by an invading microbe. Several signal molecules, including a protein called TNF—which is released by cells during an immune response—activate NF-κB signaling. However, the levels of TNF in the environment around a cell may fluctuate randomly even when there is no immune response. Therefore, the NF-κB pathway needs to be able to tell the difference between this ‘noise’ and a large increase in TNF associated with an immune response.</p><p>To get around this problem, many signaling pathways are activated in a switch-like manner so that only a strong signal that exceeds a particular threshold will lead to a response. These so called ‘digital’ responses help cells to filter out noise caused by random fluctuations in the amount of a signal molecule. NF-κB signaling responds to TNF in a digital manner, but it is not clear how information about the length of the signal can influence the degree to which NF-κB signaling is activated.</p><p>Kellogg et al. used a combination of mathematical modeling and microscopy techniques to study the activation of NF-κB signaling in mouse cells. The study shows that a molecule called LPS—which is produced by microbes known as bacteria—can also switch on the signaling pathway in a digital manner, but in a different way to TNF. In a population of cells, the fraction that activate NF-κB signaling in response to LPS or another signal is determined by the level of the signal (also known as its ‘concentration’) multiplied by the signal's duration. This is known as the signal's ‘area’.</p><p>On the other hand, the way that these cells respond to the activation of NF-κB signaling depends on the nature of the activity produced by the signal pathway. For example, a short but strong burst of LPS signal leads to rapid and uniform responses in the cells. A weaker but longer lasting signaling activity leads to slower, more varied responses in cells.</p><p>These findings reveal that such switch-like, digital responses do more than just filter out noisy signals. They can also integrate information about the timing and intensity of the signal to independently control different aspects of cell responses. The next challenge will be to extend this understanding to more complex scenarios, such as when signals contain several types of molecules at the same time.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08931.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08931.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>digital signaling</kwd><kwd>single-cell analysis</kwd><kwd>signaling dynamics</kwd><kwd>cell-to-cell heterogeneity</kwd><kwd>systems biology</kwd><kwd>innate immunity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council (ERC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Starting Grant (SingleCellDynamics)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kellogg</surname><given-names>Ryan A</given-names></name><name><surname>Tay</surname><given-names>Savaş</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung (SNF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>National Centres of Competence in Research (NCCRs) #NCH1668 - Molecular Systems Engineering</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kellogg</surname><given-names>Ryan A</given-names></name><name><surname>Tay</surname><given-names>Savaş</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004281</institution-id><institution>Narodowe Centrum Nauki (NCN)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2011/03/B/NZ2/00281</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lipniacki</surname><given-names>Tomasz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Digital NF-κB signaling achieves orthogonal control over the probability of activation (percentage of activated cells) and dynamic response heterogeneity in the population via the area and shape of the input profile.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cells must make decisions in noisy environments and have to decrease the chance of an errant response. One way cells can reduce sensitivity to noise is through digital or switch-like activation, such that only sufficiently strong signal exceeds an internal threshold and initiates a response. Switch-like activation occurs through diverse mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shah and Sarkar, 2011</xref>). For example, observations in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes showed that the MAPK pathway converted graded progesterone input to digital output in p42 MAPK that determined oocyte maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Petty et al., 1998</xref>). Subsequently, similar observations were seen for the JNK pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bagowski and Ferrell, 2001</xref>). The scaffolding protein Spe5 was found to mediate digital MAPK activation of mating in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Malleshaiah et al., 2010</xref>). More recently, it was found that inflammasome signaling leads to all-or-none caspase1 activation that mediates apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). Both amplitude (dose) and duration of input signals provide information that regulates cellular decisions. The duration of Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) stimulation modulates ERK dynamics and controls differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Santos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">von Kriegsheim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmed et al., 2014</xref>). Glucose sensing in plants showed that cells have gene regulatory network mechanisms to allow similar responses to a short, intense or sustained, moderate stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fu et al., 2014</xref>). Lymphocytes must precisely measure both antigen affinity and frequency to decide differentiation and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Iezzi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gottschalk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Miskov-Zivanov et al., 2013</xref>). Although digital pathway activation allows robust cellular decision across a wide range of systems, it is not clear how digital signaling impacts processing of dose and duration information.</p><p>NF-κB is a critical regulator of phenotype in immunity and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hayden and Ghosh, 2008</xref>) and responds digitally to Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tay et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Turner et al., 2010</xref>). NF-κB activation occurs for a multitude of cell stress and inflammatory signals that converge on the IKK (IκB Kinase) signaling hub, which induces degradation of the cytoplasmic inhibitor IκB and liberates NF-κB to enter the nucleus and regulate gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hayden and Ghosh, 2008</xref>). Multi-layered negative and positive feedback lead to complex pathway dynamics including oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hoffmann et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nelson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tay et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kellogg and Tay, 2015</xref>). Although it is not fully resolved how NF-κB coordinates gene and phenotype regulation, it is known that dynamic NF-κB activation is involved in input–output specificity and information transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Werner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashall et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Behar and Hoffmann, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Selimkhanov et al., 2014</xref>). The core IκB-NF-κB regulatory module is well-studied and appears largely consistent across multiple stimulation contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hoffmann et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nelson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tay et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hughey et al., 2014</xref>); however, the role of module upstream of IKK activation including receptor-ligand binding and adaptor protein assembly in input-encoding remains unclear.</p><p>To probe how diverse IKK-upstream signaling architectures impact NF-κB processing of pathogen- and host-associated inflammatory inputs, we used microfluidic cell culture to precisely modulate dose and duration of LPS and TNF stimuli and measured NF-κB dynamics using live cell imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Junkin and Tay, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kellogg et al., 2014</xref>). We found that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces NF-κB activation in a digital way where cells respond in an all-or-none fashion, but in a distinct manner from TNF, with greater ultrasensitivity and pronounced input-dependent activation delay. Computational modeling predicted and experiments confirmed that LPS integral over the stimulus or ‘area’ (concentration × duration) controls the percentage of cells that activate in the population. Importantly, dynamics of NF-κB activation depend on input temporal profile, so that a long duration, low-dose (LL) signal induces delayed, heterogeneous activation timing in the population while a short duration, strong amplitude (SS) signal with the same area causes rapid activation without cell-to-cell timing variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). These results reveal a function for digital signaling beyond simple noise filtering: digital activation controls fate along a two dimensional space by allowing an input signal to independently control the population response (percentage of responding cells) and single-cell response (transcription factor dynamics and gene expression phenotype) though modulation of signal area and shape.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08931.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>How does input profile determine digital signaling response?</title><p>Since the amplitude and time profile of input signals depends on biological context, such as distance to an infection site or pathogen loading, we use microfluidics to manipulate dose (<bold>A</bold>) and duration (<bold>B</bold>) of LPS and TNF input signals, which induces digital activation of NF-κB.

Each experimental condition is measured in duplicate chambers on the chip. We found that LPS-exposed cells activated NF-κB in an ultrasensitive, digital fashion. The population consisted of cells either responding or ignoring the LPS input, with the percentage of responding cells in the population scaling with LPS concentration, from 5% at 0.25 ng/ml to 100% at 500 ng/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,D</xref>). Amplitude is highly variable across doses. Median amplitude increases gradually with dose though this change is statistically less significant than change in response time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). NF-κB dynamics in activating cells showed small oscillations beyond the first peak. When ligand is flowed continuously through the chamber to replace ligand loss due to cellular internalization, oscillations sustain for the duration of the stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Under low intensity LPS stimulation, most cells did not respond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). This was a similar effect as previously observed under TNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tay et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Turner et al., 2010</xref>). While both LPS and TNF are digital in preserving first peak area, the TNF-induced NF-κB initial peak becomes flatter and wider with increasing response time but unchanging onset time for decreasing input dose, while LPS experiences greater dose-dependent onset delay and timing variability and maintains a consistent peak shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The dose-response curve for LPS was steeper than that for TNF (fitted to Hill dynamics reveals Hill coefficients of 2.3 and 1.5, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These results indicate that the LPS pathway activates in a switch-like manner, with increasing fraction of cells in the population responding as dose is increased, but with distinct activation dynamics compared to TNF input.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08931.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Digital, time-delayed NF-κB activation under varied LPS dose stimulation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cells process pathogen signal dose and duration to dynamically activate NF-κB, which induces gene expression and coordinates the innate immune response.

(<bold>C</bold>) Trajectories of NF-κB activation (intensity of nuclear p65-dsRed) tracked in single cells over time for LPS doses ranging from 500 to 0.25 ng/ml.

Notably, gene expression of early and intermediate genes exhibited a dose-dependent delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The extent and magnitude of the dose-dependent delay and heterogeneity differs from TNF stimulation of the same cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tay et al., 2010</xref>). While decreasing TNF dose altered the response slope, LPS response maintained a stereotypical peak shape that shifts later in time with lower dose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Delayed gene expression observed under LPS stimulation contrasts with TNF-α input that does not induce delayed induction of these genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tay et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pękalski et al., 2013</xref>). For early genes IκBα and A20, gene expression peak is shifted from 30 min to 1 hr after stimulation. IκBϵ expression shifts from maximum expression at 1 hr–2 hr and from 30 min to 2 hr for TNF mRNA under LPS input. Intermediate genes <italic>Ccl2</italic> and <italic>Icam</italic> shift expression peaks from 1 hr to 2 hr and from 1 hr to 3 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), respectively. Late genes <italic>Ccl5</italic> and <italic>Casp4</italic> do not reflect the delayed NF-κB activation due to slower induction kinetics. Both NF-κB dynamics in microfluidics and mRNA responses in tissue culture may be affected by autocrine signaling loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pękalski et al., 2013</xref>). Overall, these results indicate that LPS induces digital NF-κB activation with an input dose-dependent delay that carries through to gene expression dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Cooperative IKK activation underlies dose-dependent response delay</title><p>To study how various pathway components upstream of IKK influence input information transfer to NF-κB, we developed a model of LPS-induced NF-κB switch activation. LPS activates NF-κB by TLR4 engagement via CD14, leading to TLR4 dimerization. TLR4 dimers recruit MyD88, IRAK2/4, and other adaptor proteins leading to clustering and higher order assembly of Myddosome and TRAF6 lattice structures, which cooperatively activates IKK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zanoni et al., 2011</xref>).

To introduce variability in the model, we allowed fluctuation in the number of TLR4 receptor molecules between cells. TLR4 is expressed at relatively low level compared to CD14 and furthermore varies significantly between cells in the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zanoni et al., 2011</xref>). To account for cooperative activation due to Myddosome assembly and TRAF6 lattice formation, we model IKK phosphorylation by TRAF6 using Hill kinetics.

In agreement with simulation predictions, we found that precisely controlled stimulus duration regulated the activation of cells in the population in a strongly all-or-none manner, with 1- to 40-s duration LPS exposure (500 ng/ml) activating ∼3–88% of the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and Supplementary <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1 media2">Videos 1, 2</xref>). Short duration (i.e., 1 s) stimulation, mimicking very brief exposure to bacteria, activated a small percentage of cells in the population. Moreover, under short duration, strong amplitude (SS) input, responses were fast and uniform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, top row) in contrast to low, long (LL) stimulation that led to delayed, variable responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). For example, 3–5% activation occurred for both a 1-s short pulse at 500 ng/ml LPS (SS signal) and a 0.25 ng/ml constant input signal (LL signal) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). However, modulating duration of the SS signal from 1 s to 40 s (activating 3.3% and 87.5% the population, respectively) changes median response timing by less than 2 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). Statistical analysis indicates no significant difference in response time under varied pulse durations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). In contrast, modulating concentration of the LL signal from 0.25 to 500 ng/ml (activating 4.9% and 98% of the population, respectively) changes the response time more than 35 min (reduced from 80 to 43 min). Moreover, while the variability in the response time scales with dose under LL stimulation, timing variability remains low under duration-modulated SS stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figures 4D, 5C</xref>).

Therefore, duration sensing allows control of percentage of cells that produce a response without affecting response timing or heterogeneity. This contrasts to amplitude (concentration) sensing, where response dynamics in activating cells differs for high versus low amplitude.

Therefore, we tested two additional input profiles having the same area (5000 ng ml<sup>−1</sup>*s): 50 ng/ml for 100 s and 100 ng/ml for 50 s. In agreement with model prediction, each of these conditions also activates a similar fraction of the population (51% and 54%, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Together, experimental findings, simulations, and mathematical analysis demonstrate how cells integrate amplitude and duration of input signals in switch-like pathway activation. Stimulus integral (or area) determines the effective ‘probability’ that a given cell activates NF-κB (based on the percentage that activate in the population). These results indicate that the pathogen load (i.e., LPS dose) and duration of exposure (i.e., LPS pulse duration) are integrated by NF-κB system and together determine the population response.<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08931.020</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Stimulus area determines NF-κB population response.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Stimulus area determines fraction of active cells.

In contrast, modulating stimulus duration did not affect activation delay but changed the population variability. These findings indicate tradeoffs in dose versus duration sensing. Duration sensing allows for controlling only the population response while not affecting the single-cell response, so that it is possible to achieve homogeneous dynamics and uniform phenotype in a desired proportion of cells. In contrast, it may be useful to transmit information that can instruct different dynamics and phenotype, which is achieved by modulating dose. While dose information is transmitted through the NF-κB digital response, duration information is lost at the single-cell level.</p><p>However, transmitting information using only dose modulation necessarily changes the percentage of cells in the population that respond. In physiological settings, it may be desirable to transmit information without affecting population response, that is, for a signal to affect response dynamics in activating cells without impacting the proportion that activate. To achieve this requires modulating both dose and duration to maintain input area, leading to a shift in input temporal profile from a SS to a LL signal. Cells distinguish an SS versus LL signal profile based on NF-κB and gene expression dynamics. We show that an intense, brief (SS) signal induces distinct dynamics than a weak, sustained (LL) signal, but the percentage of cells responding is the same in both cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Response timing and intensity are dynamic features that provide information for discriminating input temporal profile. Indeed, plotting response delay as a function of stimulus area shows that SS and LL signals can be distinguished on the basis of response delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Cells can discern the category of the signal (whether SS or LL) for a given input area based on whether the response time falls above or below a separation line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Modulating input amplitude associated with higher timing variability than input duration modulation for controlling the fraction of active cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Because response amplitude exhibits high variability between cells, amplitude alone does not provide sufficient information to discriminate an SS versus LL signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Physiological cues are in fact commonly transmitted by changing from an SS to an LL input profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Iezzi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fu et al., 2014</xref>). Biological systems therefore appear to take advantage of the unique ability of digital signaling to separate control of population and single-cell dynamics, by modulating input area to determine the proportion of cells that activate in the population and input shape to instruct to determine phenotype outcomes in the activating subset of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study asked how stimulus amplitude and duration determine NF-κB digital activation. Modeling and experiments showed that NF-κB activation is achieved by integrating the input: stimulus integral or area (concentration × duration) controlled the percentage of cells that activated for both a ‘foreign’ pathogen signal LPS and a ‘self’ immune signal TNF (population response). However, switch dynamics and gene expression phenotype varied depending on the input dose (single-cell response), with rapid homogeneous responses at high dose and delayed heterogeneous responses at low dose. Dynamics of transcription factor activation determine the timing and specificity of gene expression and phenotype responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Werner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kobayashi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Purvis et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, intercellular signaling systems may achieve distinct phenotype outcomes by controlling the input shape or temporal profile (whether SS or LL), while input area determines percentage of cells that respond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Greater heterogeneity with decreasing dose and decreased heterogeneity under short duration input is measured by coefficient of variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>In lymphocyte signaling, T- and B-cells' cell fate depends on both antigen quality (affinity) and quantity (amount of presented antigen). Antigen quality is encoded in the duration of receptor-antigen contact, with characteristic interaction times on the order of seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Altan-Bonnet and Germain, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gottschalk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Miskov-Zivanov et al., 2013</xref>). T- and B-cell receptor binding with antigen-MHC triggers digital activation and cell fate control via NF-κB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kingeter et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oh and Ghosh, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gerondakis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shinohara et al., 2014</xref>). A reciprocal relationship is observed between antigen quality and quantity in lymphocyte activation: Higher antigen affinity requires lower dose of antigen to trigger T-cell proliferation, and inversely, lower affinity requires higher dose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gottschalk et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, an intense, transient compared to a weak, sustained signal induces positive versus negative selection of naive thymic T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Iezzi et al., 1998</xref>) and T helper cell differentiation into alternatively CD4 or CD8 status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adachi and Iwata, 2002</xref>). Therefore, analogous to our findings, while a combination of antigen dose and contact duration determines the probability of activation, input profile determined by relationship between antigen quality and quantity decides the phenotypic outcome of lymphocyte activation.</p><p>We show that switch-like signaling enables parallel and independent control over response probability and response dynamics: while stimulus area (concentration × duration or antigen quantity × quality) regulates the percentage of cells that respond, the stimulus temporal profile or shape (for example, whether short-strong or low-long or antigen quality/quantity ratio) determines the response timing and gene expression phenotype in responding cells. Dose and duration sensing may be beneficial in different contexts. Dose information is encoded in the delay timing and heterogeneity of NF-κB response. On the other hand, modulating duration on the sub-minute timescale does not regulate response dynamics. Indeed, achieving control of percentage active in a population without introducing heterogeneity requires modulating duration of a high-dose input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). It was shown that signaling dynamics mediates transfer of input dose information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Selimkhanov et al., 2014</xref>). We find that while dose information is transmitted through dynamics of NF-κB activation, on short (minute) time scales duration, information is lost in the single-cell response but retained in the population response (fraction of activated cells).</p><p>Between the innate immune signals TNF and LPS, we found that LPS exhibits greater ultrasensitivity (a steeper stimulus-response curve) and more pronounced activation delay than TNF. Both of these features are explained by higher coopertivity in IKK activation for LPS than for TNF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Distinct higher order adapter protein architectures may activate IKK with different effective coopertivities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kazmierczak and Lipniacki, 2010</xref>). We note that the LPS-signaling response in macrophages may differ from that in 3T3 cells, including effects due to stronger auto and paracrine TNF signaling.</p><p>While TNF signaling activates formation of a filamentous amyloid complex involving RIP1 and RIP3 kinases, LPS signaling is mediated through helical assembly of the Myddosome complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lin et al., 2010</xref>), which interfaces with a TRAF6 lattice structure to activate IKK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yin et al., 2009</xref>). Heterogeneity in switching threshold between cells may arise from cell-to-cell expression differences in signalosome components such as RIP1/3, MyD88, IRAK2/4, and TRAF6, leading to altered kinetics of signalosome assembly and IKK activation. Because the IKK hub mediates NF-κB responses for a multitude of input types and coordinates cross-talk with other signaling pathways, understanding how different signalosome architectures induce specific responses paves the way to interventions directed at switch-like signaling to modulate population and individual cell dynamics towards therapeutic outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Negro et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Behar et al., 2013</xref>). In this study, we have shown that the switch-like character of NF-κB activation enables orthogonal control over two critical aspects of the response—probability of activation (fraction of active cells) and the heterogeneity of response—through the integral and temporal profile of the input. Secretion of signaling molecules often occurs in discrete or quantized way in the form of secretory bursts, and particularly in the case of short range paracrine signaling, cells may produce brief but intense secretion to achieve, for example, low probability but high predictability responses (non-heterogeneous dynamics). Overall, these results expand the repertoire of functions for digital signaling beyond increasing robustness to also facilitate multidimensional phenotype control based on temporal information in input signals.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines</title><p>We used p65-knockout 3T3 fibroblasts (courtesy Markus Covert) modified using lentiviral vectors to express p65-DsRed under its endogenous promoter along with an H2B-GFP nuclear reporter, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2009</xref>).

All LPS doses were tested in parallel in a single chip. To produce LPS and TNF pulses, chambers were washed with media after incubation with ligand for the desired duration.

The pathway consists of two branches, namely the TLR4-MyD88-dependent branch and the TLR4-TRIF-dependent branch. Both branches converge at IKK, where they activate IKK and trigger the release of NF-κB molecules. The pathway downstream of the IKK activation (core NF-κB module) is well-studied and has been modeled extensively (a review is available in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheong et al.

The activated TRAF6 molecules then phosphorylate TAK1, which will activate IKK and trigger the response of NF-κB.

The current reviews about the TLR4-TRIF-dependent branch are conflicting. Lu et al. and Newton et al. claim that the LPS.CD14.TLR4 complexes first recruit TRIF through the adapter TRAM. Then, RIP1 is activated and TAK1 is phosphorylated. Finally, the phosphorylated TAK1 molecules activate IKK and trigger the response of NF-κB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Newton and Dixit, 2012</xref>). O'Neill et al. states that the RIP1 molecules first get activated by the LPS.CD14.TLR4 complexes, then TRAF6 is activated by RIP1, and finally TAK1 is phosphorylated by TRAF6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">O'Neill et al., 2013</xref>). Meanwhile, Kawai et al. claims that both RIP1 and TRAF6 can be activated by the LPS.CD14.TLR4 complexes and can both phosphorylate TAK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kawai and Akira, 2010</xref>). The TLR4-TRIF-dependent branch is shown to induce the late response.</p><p>In addition to these three views, Covert et al. proposed that the TLR4-TRIF-dependent branch activates NF-κB indirectly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Covert et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2009</xref>). The claim is that the TLR4-TRIF-dependent branch first activates the production of TNF<italic>α</italic>, then TNF<italic>α</italic> activates the response of NF-κB through the well-known TNF<italic>α</italic> signaling pathway. The time required for activating the TNF<italic>α</italic> production is the cause for the delay in the NF-κB response. However, we do not observe such phenomenon in our experiments and therefore ignore this mechanism when constructing the mathematical model.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s8" sec-type="appendix"><title>Model construction and simplification</title><p>In this section, we describe the procedure for constructing the mathematical model based on the existing experimental knowledge.

In order to provide with a unified framework, we model the reactions in the LPS-mediated NF-κB pathway in the same fashion: the equations for the core NF-κB module are identical to the ones in the TNF<italic>α</italic> model, and the equations for the pathways upstream of the IKK activation are described as follows.</p><sec id="s8-1"><title>TLR4-MyD88-dependent branch</title><p>We model the concentrations of LPS, CD14, LPS.CD14 complex, LPS.CD14.TLR4 complex, and TRAF6, and the reactions in this branch are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Appendix table 1</xref>. In the model, we attribute the cell–cell variability upstream of the IKK activation to the receptor-level, as we assume the abundances of CD14 and TLR4 follow lognormal distributions. We use mass action laws to model the association and dissociation of the ligands and receptors (LPS, CD14, and TLR4). The internalization and the externalization processes are modeled by mass action laws as well. We assume the activity of MyD88 is proportional to the concentration of LPS.CD14.TLR4 complex, therefore, the activation rate of TRAF6 is proportional to the product of the concentrations of LPS.CD14.TLR4 and TRAF6. We also use a Michaelis-Menten term to model the inhibitory effect of A20, as in the TNF<italic>α</italic> model. The inactivation of TRAF6a is modeled by a mass action law. Finally, we use a Hill term to model the clustering of activated TRAF6, with <italic>n</italic> representing the cluster sizes and <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>IKKK</italic></sub> representing a critical level, in order to illustrate the effect of clustering explicitly. The activation rate of IKK is then proportional to the product of the Hill term and the concentration of IKKn.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id

However, the model has approximately 20 free parameters, and it is practically impossible to perform a large-scale sampling in the parameter space. Hence, we introduce two assumptions to simplify the model.</p><sec id="s8-3-1"><title>Removing CD14 from the model</title><p>In humans, the quantity of CD14 is approximately 6.2 × 10<sup>5</sup> molecules per cell, and the quantity of TLR4 is approximately 10<sup>2</sup>–10<sup>3</sup> molecules per cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kitchens and Munford, 1998</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pawelczyk et al., 2010</xref>). Although to the authors' knowledge, there is no extensive measurement of the numbers in mouse NIH3T3 cells, we make the assumption that CD14 is excessive and the variability of CD14 abundance is not the main source of cell–cell variability. Hence, we remove CD14 from the model and assume LPS directly binds TLR4 receptors. We also assume that TLR4 abundance accounts for all the cell–cell variability upstream of the IKK activation. It is worth mentioning that the effect of CD14 can be compensated by the binding and unbinding rates and the effect of the internalization of LPS.CD14 can be compensated by a higher degradation rate of LPS. Therefore, this assumption will not restrict the performance of the model.</p></sec><sec id="s8-3-2"><title>Removing the TLR4-TRIF-dependent branch</title><p>In our model, the TLR4-MyD88-dependent branch and the TLR4-TRIF-dependent branch are identical in structure. Since the two branches have the same function of activating TRAF6, and we focus on the overall dynamical behavior of the LPS-mediated NF-κB pathway, it is not necessary to distinguish the two branches explicitly. To reduce the complexity the model, we assume the LPS.TLR4 complexes do not internalize and remove the TLR4-TRIF-dependent branch. In addition, except for the constantly perfused LPS experiments, we mostly focus on the first peak of the NF-κB response and such peak is triggered by the TLR4-MyD88-dependent branch. So only modeling this branch will not sacrifice the quality of the model with respect to predictive power in our experimental settings.</p></sec><sec id="s8-3-3"><title>Final model</title><p>With the two simplifications, we reduce the complexity of the full model and the number of free parameters is reduced to around 10.

The newly introduced reactions (in red) are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Appendix table 3</xref>. The final model significantly simplifies the pathway upstream of the IKK activation, and this simplification can be justified from the perspective of information flow. The two steps in the model, namely the binding/unbinding of ligands and receptors and the activation/inactivation of TRAF6, correspond to two important processing of the information flow: the first step encodes the cell–cell variability into the information flow, and the second step allows the analog information flow to trigger a digital decision. The reactions that are not covered in the final model process the information flow in a less important manner, so the final model can be justified within our scope of study.<table-wrap id="tbl3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08931.025</object-id><label>Appendix table 3.</label><caption><p>The reactions upstream of IKK activation in the final model</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08931.025">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08931.025</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reaction/Description</th><th>Rate laws</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><italic>LPS</italic> → ∅</td><td><italic>l</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub>[<italic>LPS</italic>]</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"> Degradation of LPS</td></tr><tr><td><italic>LPS</italic> + <italic>TLR</italic>4 → <italic>LPS</italic>.<italic>TLR</italic>4</td><td><italic>l</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub>[<italic>LPS</italic>][<italic>TLR</italic>4]</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"> Association of LPS and TLR4</td></tr><tr><td><italic>LPS</italic>.<italic>TLR</italic>4 → <italic>LPS</italic> + <italic>TLR</italic>4</td><td><italic>l</italic><sub><italic>f</italic></sub>[<italic>LPS</italic>.<italic>TLR</italic>4]</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"> Dissociation of LPS and TLR4</td></tr><tr><td><italic>TRAF</italic>6 → <italic>TRAF</italic>6<italic>a</italic></td><td><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mn>6</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mn>20</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mn>20</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mn>20</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"> Activation of TRAF6 by LPS.TLR4</td></tr><tr><td><italic>TRAF</italic>6<italic>a</italic> → <italic>TRAF</italic>6</td><td><italic>l</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>[<italic>TRAF</italic>6<italic>a</italic>]</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"> Inactivation of TRAF6a</td></tr><tr><td><italic>IKKn</italic> → <italic>IKKa</italic></td><td><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mn>6</mml:mn><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mn>6</mml:mn><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:msup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mi>K</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"> Activation of IKKn by TRAF6a</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s9" sec-type="appendix"><title>Parameter estimation</title><p>Despite simplification, the complexity of the model is high and the model is stochastic in its nature.

Microfluidic analysis is used to follow the behavior of single cells. The authors report the analysis of a dose response (under non-pulse conditions) and a pulse-length study with a high LPS dose together with simulation studies based on a mathematical model. The authors conclude that the fractional digital response to LPS is increased with both dose and pulse length. Please address the following points in a revised submission:</p><p>A) The experimental data requires statistical analysis. Error bars are missing in some Figure panels (or are present, but not defined in some other panels) and the number of biological replicates is not stated. Moreover, conclusions based on the experimental data are not supported by statistical tests.</p><p>B) The term “full response” should be to be clarified. A “full response” implies that most, if not all, NF-κB translocates to the nucleus (as in high dose stimulation), yet <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> (0.25ng/ml LPS) does not appear to show this. In addition, the authors state that the Nuc-NF-κB is constant on average, yet the single-cell traces clearly gives the impression that the amplitude increases with respect to the concentration. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and E</xref> (model) predicts quite striking amplitude changes as the dose is varied. Moreover, the simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>) uses different scales for different treatments (showing the amplitude decreasing with lowering the dose). In addition, the pulse-length study with TNF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1A</xref>) appears to show a graded response, but this is not represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>C) The conclusion of a Hill coefficient of 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) is problematic because of the absence of data between 1 and 5ng/ml. Moreover, if the Hill coefficient is 2, why is a Hill coefficient of 4 used in the model?</p><p>D) The criteria for inclusion/exclusion of NF-kB pathway characteristics in the model are unclear. Is variable TLR4/CD14 expression the mechanism of NF-κB dynamics variability? Is MyD88 the mechanism of non-linearity? What justifies the focus on these features of the NF-kB pathway?</p><p>E) The model simulation data are interesting, but the usefulness of the model is to generate hypotheses concerning signaling network behavior. The authors need to experimentally test a model-based prediction. In this case, the model is used to predict the response to different pulse length variations for intermediate LPS doses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

We do observe responses at lowest doses where nearly all NF-κB enters the nucleus (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Amplitude is highly variable across doses, and while median amplitude increases gradually with dose the change is statistically less significant than changes in response time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>) (subsection “NF-κB switch dynamics distinguish pathogen (LPS) and host (TNF) signals”).

We incorporated analysis of 3ng/ml LPS into <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, which activated 40.6% of the population. Refitting the Hill curve led to a steepness coefficient of 2.3, which we updated in the main text (subsection “NF-κB switch dynamics distinguish pathogen (LPS) and host (TNF) signals”).</p><p>The comment about hill coefficient of 4 in the model (subsection “Cooperative IKK activation underlies dose-dependent response delay”, last paragraph) refers to the cooperativity in IKK activation by TRAF6 (distinct from the slope in the fraction of activation as a function of dose). We now term this value cooperativity coefficient and add a note to avoid this confusion.</p><p><italic>D) The criteria for inclusion/exclusion of NF-kB pathway characteristics in the model are unclear. Is variable TLR4/CD14 expression the mechanism of NF-κB dynamics variability? Is MyD88 the mechanism of non-linearity? What justifies the focus on these features of the NF-kB pathway?</italic></p><p>Inclusion/exclusion of NF-κB pathway characteristics in the model is based on the available information about LPS-NF-κB signaling, maintaining model simplicity, and following methodology consistent with currently accepted NF-κB models. The mathematical supplement <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1 s2">sections 1 and 2</xref> contain substantial discussion of our process and decisions in constructing the model.</p><p>To explain observed heterogeneity in cell responses it is enough to assume that cells have different sensitivities to the signal, which can result from broad distribution of receptors. Receptor level variation is a major source of heterogeneity between cells, though we acknowledge that other sources of heterogeneity could contribute (subsection “Cooperative IKK activation underlies dose-dependent response delay”). The nonlinearity results from clustering and oligomerization of receptors and adapter proteins including MyD88 and TRAF6. Multiple studies support that clustering mediates digital activation in NF-κB signaling (discussed in the aforementioned subsection) though we discuss other cases where additional factors may contribute (Introduction, first paragraph). We have updated the supplemental mathematical materials for clarity and with additional details of the methodology and justification in building the model.</p><p><italic>E) The model simulation data are interesting, but the usefulness of the model is to generate hypotheses concerning signaling network behavior. The authors need to experimentally test a model-based prediction. In this case, the model is used to predict the response to different pulse length variations for intermediate LPS doses (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref><italic>). However, the experimental data shown is limited to a dose response (under non-pulse conditions) and a pulse-length study with a high LPS dose.</italic></p><p>We use the model to generate the hypothesis that integral of the input determines the fraction of activating cells, which is supported by the experimental dose response and high-dose pulse data. We now test this prediction in new experiments further by comparing inputs with different temporal profiles but equal integral (area). We observed 500ng/ml LPS pulsed for 10 s activated approximately half the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Therefore we tested two additional input profiles having the same area (5000 ngml<sup>-1</sup>/s): 50ng/ml for 100s and 100ng/ml for 50s. In agreement with model prediction, each of these conditions also activates a similar fraction of the population (51% and 54%, respectively). This is discussed in the main text (subsection “Integral of stimulus determines fraction of active cells in the population”, last paragraph) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> has been updated with trajectories and images from these experiments.</p></body></sub-article></article>
