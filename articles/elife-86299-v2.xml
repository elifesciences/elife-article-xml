Although understanding the neural mechanisms underlying behavior has been challenging in vertebrates, we previously identified two anatomically distinct central pattern generators (CPGs) that drive the fast and slow clicks of male <italic>Xenopus laevis,</italic> using an ex vivo preparation that produces fictive vocalizations<italic>.</italic> Here, we extended this approach to four additional species, <italic>X. amieti, X. cliivi, X. petersii, and X. tropicalis,</italic> by developing ex vivo brain preparation from which fictive vocalizations are elicited in response to a chemical or electrical stimulus. We found that even though the courtship calls are species-specific, the CPGs used to generate clicks are conserved across species. The fast CPGs, which critically rely on reciprocal connections between the parabrachial nucleus and the nucleus ambiguus, are conserved among fast-click species, and slow CPGs are shared among slow-click species. In addition, our results suggest that testosterone plays a role in organizing fast CPGs in fast-click species, but not in slow-click species. Moreover, fast CPGs are not inherited by all species but monopolized by fast-click species. The results suggest that species-specific calls of the genus <italic>Xenopus</italic> have evolved by utilizing conserved slow and/or fast CPGs inherited by each species.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>central pattern generator</kwd><kwd>vocalizations</kwd><kwd>motor programs</kwd><kwd>fictive preparation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS 1934386</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yamaguchi</surname><given-names>Ayako</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Although courtship vocalizations are unique to each species, the basic architecture of the neural circuitries underlying this behavior is conserved among closely related species of frogs, suggesting behavior can diverge while utilizing the homologous neural network inherited through evolutionary lineage.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Closely related species often exhibit dramatically different courtship behavior despite other similarities. This diversity of courtship behavior is a result of sexual selection, which leads to reproductive isolation and speciation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boughman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ritchie, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ryan, 2021</xref>). The nervous system of animals underlying courtship behavior is made up of both ancestral traits inherited through evolutionary lineage and derived traits selected to serve unique functions for a species. Identification of these traits can provide insights into the evolutionary trajectory underlying speciation. For instance, in crickets, the conserved and derived components of the courtship song neural circuitry are distributed along the abdominal ganglia, while in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the conserved components are the command neurons that initiate the courtship song, and the derived components are the downstream thoracic neural networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ding et al., 2019</xref>). However, the strategies employed by the nervous system to introduce behavioral diversity in vertebrates are not well understood, partly due to the lack of reduced preparation for detailed electrophysiological analyses.</p><p>The courtship vocalizations of the genus <italic>Xenopus</italic> offer a rare opportunity to explore the evolution of neural circuitry in vertebrates, as reduced preparations are available. All species of <italic>Xenopus</italic> produce species- and sex-specific vocalizations consisting of a series of clicks produced by the larynx specialized to generate sound under water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yager, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kwong-Brown et al., 2019</xref>). Male <italic>Xenopus</italic> use advertisement calls containing a species-specific rate of clicks (0.6–150 Hz) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tobias et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Evans et al., 2015</xref>) to attract females, many of which are monophasic (i.e., clicks are repeated at a monotonous rate), while a few are biphasic (i.e. trains of clicks with two distinct rates are contained in a call). In contrast, female <italic>Xenopus</italic> produce ‘release calls’ consisting of slow clicks (&lt;20 Hz) to escape from clasping males when not gravid. However, administering testosterone to adult female <italic>X. laevis</italic> results in the production of male-specific advertisement calls in 1–3 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Potter et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Previously, we developed an ex vivo, isolated brain preparation from which fictive vocalizations can be elicited in male and female African clawed frogs, <italic>X. laevis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rhodes et al., 2007</xref>). Vocalizations of <italic>X. laevis</italic> are generated by central pattern generators (CPGs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marder and Bucher, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rhodes et al., 2007</xref>), neural networks that autonomously produce rhythmic motor programs in the absence of rhythmic central or sensory input (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marder and Bucher, 2001</xref>). The advertisement calls of male X. laevis is biphasic and are made of fast and slow trills containing clicks repeated at 60 and 30 Hz, respectively. The male <italic>X. laevis</italic> vocal pathways consist of the premotor nuclei in the parabrachial nucleus (PBN, formerly known as dorsal tegmental area of the medulla, DTAM) and the laryngeal motor nuclei, the nucleus ambiguus (NA), with extensive reciprocal connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brahic and Kelley, 2003</xref>). The advertisement call of male <italic>X. laevis</italic> consists of fast and slow trills containing clicks repeated at 60 and 30 Hz, respectively. We discovered that the fast and slow trills are generated by a pair of anatomically distinct CPGs contained in left and right hemi-brain in male <italic>X. laevis</italic>: fast trill CPGs contain neurons in the PBNs and NAs, whereas the slow trill CPGs are contained in the caudal brainstem including NAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yamaguchi et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The aim of the study was to determine if fast and slow trill CPGs discovered in male <italic>X. laevis</italic> are unique to this species or conserved across species of <italic>Xenopus</italic>. To this end, we developed ex vivo preparations in males of three additional species, <italic>X. amieti, X. cliivi</italic>, and <italic>X. tropicalis</italic>. Using these preparations, we examined the electrophysiological activity of the vocal neural circuitry during fictive advertisement calling in males of four species, including <italic>X. petersii</italic> (for which a fictive preparation had been previously developed; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barkan et al., 2018</xref>), which produce calls containing clicks repeated at variable rates. We also investigated if female <italic>X. laevis</italic> acquire fast trill-like CPGs or modify an existing CPG network in response to testosterone. Furthermore, we explored whether fast trill-like CPGs are present but remain latent as an evolutionary vestige in species that only produce slow clicks by examining the synapses that serve the critical function of the fast trill-like CPGs. We found that the two CPGs with conserved function and location are shared among species to generate species-specific courtship fast or slow clicks. Additionally, we found that fast trill-like CPGs are present only in species that produce fast clicks and their presence appears to be regulated by testosterone in these species.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Isolated male brains of all species generate fictive advertisement calls resembling in vivo calls when exposed to appropriate stimuli</title><p>In this study, we used five species of <italic>Xenopus</italic> including <italic>X. laevis</italic>.

Previous studies had shown that application of serotonin (5HT) to the isolated brains of male <italic>X. laevis</italic> and <italic>X. petersii</italic> readily elicited fictive advertisement calls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rhodes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barkan and Zornik, 2019</xref>). In this study, we found that we could also induce fictive advertisement calls from the isolated brains of three additional species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, right column), but the types of stimuli required varied depending on species. For instance, 5HT alone did not elicit fictive calls from the brains of <italic>X. tropicalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, n=7), but a combination of 5HT and N-methylaspartate (NMA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, right column, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) was effective. In contrast, neither 5HT alone nor 5HT and NMA together induced fictive calls from the isolated brains of <italic>X. amieti</italic> and <italic>X. cliivi</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>, top trace, for example). However, trains of electrical pulses delivered to the rostral-lateral cerebellum (RLCB, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) readily evoked fictive advertisement calls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, right column, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The RLCB is the region in the brain where the ascending and descending axons of the projection neurons in the parabrachial nucleus (PB) and the nucleus ambiguus (NA) are located close to the surface of the brain. Dextran dye injected into NA that labeled anterograde and retrograde axons allowed us to visualize this location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Electrically stimulating RLCB likely activates a previously unidentified component of the central vocal pathways that initiates vocalizations. Interestingly, electrical stimulation delivered to the RLCB was effective in evoking fictive advertisement calls from all males tested in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>, for example), except for male <italic>X. tropicalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, n=6). The stimulus pulse duration used was 40us with a frequency ranging from 10 to 100 Hz, amplitudes varying from 0.7 to 6mA, and a pulse count ranging from 3 to 30. Effective stimulus parameters varied greatly between preparations, and there was no observable difference in the effective parameters between species.</p><p>The temporal structure of fictive advertisement calls closely resembled the calls recorded in vivo, as shown by comparing the sound amplitude envelope (top traces for each species) on the left column and the fictive call traces on the right column in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. Although the exact rate of compound action potentials (CAPs) is significantly slower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and the number of CAPs contained in fictive calls differ from the calls recorded in vivo in some species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), the overall temporal structure is well preserved in all species.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Parabrachial nuclei activity coincides with fictive advertisement calls that contain compound action potentials repeated at frequency above 50Hz</title><p>Previously, we found that in male <italic>X. laevis,</italic> the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) is active during fictive fast trills, but remains inactive or exhibits minimal activity (less than twice the amplitude of the noise) during fictive slow trills. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yamaguchi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Aiv</xref>). Here, we investigated whether this observation applies to males of other species including <italic>X. amieti, X. cliivi, X. petersii,</italic> and <italic>X. tropicalis</italic>. The results showed that in all these species, the PBN was predominantly active during fictive calls that contain compound action potentials (CAPs) repeated at rates faster than 50 Hz (indicated by traces with a green background in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), but not during fictive calls containing CAPs repeated at rates below 35 Hz (indicated by traces with blue background in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In male <italic>X. amieti, X. cliivi,</italic> and <italic>X. petersii</italic> a PBN local field potential (LFP) showed phasic activity that correlated with the CAPs during fictive calls containing CAPs faster than 50 Hz, similar to what was observed in male <italic>X. laevis</italic> during fictive fast trills (indicated by all traces with green background in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The mean power spectral density (PSD) of the PBN LFP waveform (normalized to the maximum power for each animal) showed a clear peak at the frequency corresponding to the CAP repetition rates, as was also observed in male <italic>X. laevis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). However, in specie with slow clicks in their advertisement calls (slow trills of male <italic>X. petersii</italic> and the advertisement calls of male <italic>X. tropicalis</italic>), the PBN activity was mostly absent during fictive slow clicks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, traces with blue background). In a few brains, some PBN LFP phase-locked to CAPs was observed during slow CAPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, see LFP during slow trills of male <italic>X. petersii</italic> and male <italic>X. laevis),</italic> but the LFP amplitude was significantly lower than that during fictive fast clicks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, see the amplitude of LFP during slow trills of male <italic>X. petersii</italic> and male <italic>X. laevis</italic> compared to that during fast trills).

Although the exact rate and the number of compound action potentials (CAPs) in the fictive calls are significantly different in some cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), the overall temporal structure resemble those of calls recorded in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B, D and E</xref>). In control females, the PBN remained silent during fictive release calls in all animals tested (n=13, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> bottom trace).

Thus, we conclude that testosterone enables the recruitment of female PBNs to generate the phasic activity that accompanies fictive fast trills.

When we unilaterally transected the projections between the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) and the nucleus ambiguus (NA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, left schematic), the brain still produced fictive advertisement calls, but the compound action potentials (CAPs) from the two nerves desynchronize during fast trill only, not during slow trills (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yamaguchi et al., 2017</xref>). Based on these results, we concluded that the fast trill CPGs span between the PBN and NA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> left, green oscillators), whereas the slow trill CPGs are confined to the caudal brainstem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> left, blue oscillators).

However, CAPs during slow trills of the transected brain remain unaffected since slow trill CPGs on both sides are functional.

These changes in CAP amplitude and latency were successfully fitted with exponential curves (mean ± s.e. cross-correlation coefficient of the fit = 0.781 ± 0.029 for CAP amplitude, 0.938+0.01 for CAP latency, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>) with mean τ of 6.90±0.995 pulses for CAP amplitude and 3.64±.515 (mean ±s.e.) pulses for CAP latency that was independent of stimulus frequencies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

The reduced responsiveness of the motoneurons to unilateral PBN stimulation is likely due to an increased spike threshold of neurons under the Hi-Di conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blitz and Nusbaum, 1999</xref>).

The results showed that the application of NBQX eliminated all PBN-evoked CAPs from both nerves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>), indicating that glutamate and AMPA receptors mediate the synaptic transmission between the parabrachial neurons and the laryngeal motoneurons.</p><p>Next, we extended the experimental approaches to other fast clickers to characterize their synapses between the PBN and the laryngeal motoneurons.

Mean τ for CAP amplitude potentiation and latency attenuation for all the fast clickers were 5.15±0.735 pulses, and 2.69±0.332 pulses (mean ± s.e.), respectively. The τ values for CAP amplitude and latency were frequency-independent in all species (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), did not differ significantly from those of male <italic>X. laevis</italic> (Mann Whitney U test, Z=–1.69,–1.254, p=0.0918, 0.210 for amplitude and latency tau, respectively), and did not differ across species (ANOVA, F<sub>3.17</sub> = 1.75, F<sub>3.15</sub> = 3.24, p=0.195, 0.0521 for CAP amplitude and latency tau, respectively).

These results indicate that the synapses between the PBN projection neurons and bilateral laryngeal motoneurons of all fast clickers including testosterone-treated females are monosynaptic and mediated by glutamate and AMPA receptors. Thus, the synapses between the PBN and laryngeal motoneuron of all fast clickers share similar characteristics.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>All slow clickers have weak and unreliable synapses between the parabrachial nucleus and the laryngeal motoneurons</title><p>Lastly, we examined the property of parabrachial nucleus (PBN) to nucleus ambiguus (NA) synapses in slow clickers. Because the synapses are crucial in producing fast clicks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zornik and Yamaguchi, 2012</xref>), we reasoned that the presence of synapses resembling those found in fast clickers in the brains of slow clickers provides evidence to support the idea that fast click central pattern generators (CPGs) are inherited, but remain latent in these species. When PBN of slow clickers were unilaterally stimulated, only about half of the brains responded with compound action pontentials (CAPs) from either one or both nerves (45% of female <italic>X. laevis</italic>, n=11, 57% of male <italic>X. tropicalis</italic>, n=7, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). In the remaining preparations, there was either no response or tonic activity from the laryngeal nerves in response to PBN stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). Even in the brains from which CAPs were elicited, some pulses within a stimulus train failed to evoke CAPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>), unlike in fast clickers where CAPs are elicited in response to almost every stimulus pulse (compare to male X. laevis <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref> left column). The mean minimum frequency required to elicit CAPs were &gt;10.6 + 3.86 Hz in female <italic>X. laevis</italic>, and &gt;30.0 + 8.17 Hz in male <italic>X. tropicalis</italic>. More importantly, in two female <italic>X. laevis</italic> brains and in one male <italic>X. tropicalis</italic> brain PBN needed to be stimulated at 20 Hz and 50 Hz, respectively, both of which are significantly higher than click rates of their vocalizations (female X. laevis ‘rapping’ contain clicks repeated at &lt;20 Hz, and the advertisement call of male <italic>X. tropicalis</italic> contains clicks at ~30 Hz). Moreover, PBN-evoked CAP amplitudes of male <italic>X. tropicalis</italic> and female <italic>X. laevis</italic> were significantly lower and higher than those observed during fictive calling, respectively (male <italic>X. tropicalis</italic>: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>, left graph, Wilcoxon Signed rank test, Z=–2.02, p=0.043, female X. laevis: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>, Wilcoxon Signed rank test, Z=–2.02, p=0.043), indicating that PBN-evoked CAPs differ from those produced during fictive calling. The amplitude of PBN-evoked CAPs in slow clickers were significantly smaller than those of fast clickers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>, ANOVA F<sub>1, 50</sub> = 8.766, p=0.0047), and the stimulus amplitude required to elicit CAPs from the laryngeal nerves was significantly higher in the slow clickers than in fast clickers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref>, ANOVA, F<sub>1, 52</sub> = 30.52, p&lt;0.0001), indicating that synapses between the PBN and the laryngeal motoneurons of slow clickers are weaker than those of fast clickers. We did not determine whether the synapses were monosynaptic and glutamatergic because PBN-evoked CAPs in the slow clickers were variable and unreliable. Finally, we found that the properties of synapses between the PBN and the laryngeal motoneurons changed dramatically in response to testosterone in female <italic>X. laevis</italic>, suggesting that female <italic>X. laevis</italic> acquire fast trill-like CPGs in response to testosterone. To summarize, our results suggest that slow clickers lack the strong synapses between the PBN and the laryngeal motoneurons that are observed in the fast clickers.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>The synapses between the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) and laryngeal motoneurons of slow clickers are weaker and unreliable compared to those of fast clickers.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>).

This observation is consistent with the idea that neuronal networks underlying behavior are well conserved across species because they are generalists rather than specialists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Katz and Harris-Warrick, 1999</xref>). The finding implies that the central nervous system of male <italic>Xenopus</italic> can generate sufficient variation in click rates using the pre-existing CPGs.

The results indicate that the basic architecture of the neural circuitry used to generate courtship advertisement calls appears to be conserved across species, even though the advertisement calls of each species differ in click repetition rates and the number of clicks within each call (in addition to the frequencies (i.e. pitch) of each click dictated by the anatomy of the larynx <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kwong-Brown et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The use of different populations of neurons to generate rhythmic motor programs at different frequencies may be common in vertebrates. For instance, in the zebrafish swimming network and mice locomotory network, which varies greatly in oscillatory frequency, interneurons in the locomotory circuits are recruited in a rate-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McLean et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McLean et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rancic et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Song et al., 2020</xref>). Specifically, in zebrafish, three different populations of interneurons that are recruited at slow, intermediate, and fast frequencies of undulations have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Song et al., 2020</xref>), and similar results are reported in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rancic et al., 2020</xref>). The recruitment of PBN neurons to generate fast, but not slow clicks in <italic>Xenopus</italic> may parallel the recruitment of fast-swim and slow-swim interneurons in zebrafish swim circuits. The use of different populations of interneurons to generate distinct frequency of motor programs driving the same muscle groups may be the most efficient strategy in vertebrates.</p><p>All the fast clickers included in this study use calls containing clicks repeated at a slow (&lt;35 Hz) rate such as amplectant clicks, release calls, and long-slow clicks. In contrast, the slow clickers (male <italic>X. tropicalis</italic> and female <italic>X. laevis</italic>) never generate calls containing fast clicks (&gt;50 Hz). This disparity in the frequency range of vocal repertoires may be due to differences in the effective organ of fast and slow clickers. Male <italic>X. laevis</italic> (fast clicker) laryngeal muscles have faster contractile properties compared to female <italic>X. laevis</italic> (slow clicker), corresponding with the differences in the click rates produced by each sex. The half-relaxation time of a single twitch of female laryngeal muscles is six times that of male laryngeal muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Potter et al., 2005</xref>), which means the female larynx is incapable of generating fast clicks even if the motoneurons fire at a high rate. To maintain fast twitch muscles, specialized mechanisms including increased expression of Ca2+-ATPase by the sarcoplasmic reticulum are required to handle high levels of myoplasmic Ca2+ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rome and Klimov, 2000</xref>), which may come at a high cost. Therefore, if slow clicks are sufficient to fulfill the primary purpose of acoustic communication, such as attracting females, it may be cost-effective use slow clicks exclusively.</p><p>Biphasic callers, including male <italic>X. laevis</italic> and <italic>X. petersii</italic>, produce fast and slow trills that are mutually exclusive. Although coordination of multiple oscillators has been extensively studied in other species, neural mechanisms that coordinate the timing of fast and slow trills are yet to be determined.

Molecular mechanisms underlying synaptic rewiring include modification of genes controlling axon guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersson et al., 2012</xref>) or synaptic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Charrier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schmidt et al., 2021</xref>), differential expression of surface molecules by synaptic target neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hong et al., 2012</xref>), and the presence or absence of microRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Johnston and Hobert, 2003</xref>). It is important to note that synaptic rewiring can occur without changing the behavioral output, indicating that natural selection can act upon the neural circuitry and motor outputs independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sakurai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sakurai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Katz, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Neuromodulators can alter the output of the CPGs by altering the intrinsic properties of the constituent neurons and their synaptic connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Katz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harris-Warrick, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miles and Sillar, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Golowasch, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blitz, 2023</xref>). Changes in the types, concentration, or the expression patterns of neuromodulators or receptors can all result in divergent behavioral output.

Divergence of key CPG neurons has been observed in the song/vocal CPGs of crickets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jacob and Hedwig, 2019</xref>) and <italic>Xenopus</italic> (see below <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barkan et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Although the exact location of slow click CPGs is not known, we have better understanding of the location and function of the fast click CPGs in <italic>Xenopus</italic>. However, we do not yet know whether synaptic wiring and changes in neuromodulations contribute to the divergence of fast clicks across species due to the insufficient resolution to detect subtle differences in synaptic wiring, and the use of a single type of neuromodulator (i.e. 5HT) to determine its impact on the CPG in this study. Nevertheless, we showed that, at a gross anatomical level, synapses between the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) and nucleus ambiguus (NA) are conserved across all fast clicker species. Additionally, we found that 5HT has species-specific effectiveness in activating fictive advertisement calls, indicating possible contribution of neuromodulators in the vocal divergence. In contrast, there is strong evidence that the intrinsic properties of a particular type of neuron in the fast CPG have diverged across species. Male <italic>X. laevis</italic>, <italic>X. petersii,</italic> and <italic>X. victorianus</italic> produce fast trills repeated at ~60 Hz with species-specific duration in their advertisement calls. Fast Trill Neurons identified in the parabrachial nucleus of these species fire at 60 Hz and exhibit long-lasting depolarization mediated by NMDA receptor activation, coinciding with the species-specific duration of fast trills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zornik and Yamaguchi, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barkan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barkan et al., 2018</xref>), indicating that the neurons code for the duration and click rates of fast trills in each species. Therefore, it is likely that fast click CPGs diverged across species by altering the intrinsic properties of key neurons in the parabrachial nucleus while conserving the basic synaptic wiring.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Species-specific effects of testosterone on the configuration of fast trill-like central pattern generators</title><p>In this study, we found that when adult female <italic>X. laevis</italic> were treated with testosterone, their central vocal pathway transformed to resemble that of males. This included the activation of parabrachial nucleus (PBN) during fictive fast trills and the emergence of male-like synapses between PBN and laryngeal motoneurons. However, this effect of testosterone appears to be limited to the fast clicker species. Male <italic>X. tropicalis</italic>, a slow clicker species, has been shown to have comparable plasma levels of testosterone to male <italic>X. laevis</italic> (mean plasma levels of testosterone of male X. laevis: 13–22 ng/ml <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hecker et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hayes et al., 2010</xref>, male X. tropicalis:~20 ng/ml <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Olmstead et al., 2009</xref>), yet the synapses between the PBN and laryngeal motoneurons in male <italic>X. tropicalis</italic> remained weak, and PBN showed little activity during fictive advertisement calls. These results suggest that testosterone acts differently on the central vocal pathways of fast and slow clickers, promoting the emergence of fast trill-like CPGs in <italic>X. laevis</italic> but not in <italic>X. tropicalis</italic>. Although further experiments with controlled testosterone levels are necessary to validate these results, we hypothesize that changes in the androgen receptors (e.g. expression patterns, ligand affinity) may have contributed to the divergence of fast and slow clickers. In line with this hypothesis, species-specific sensitivity to the gonadal hormones has been reported in a few species of <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leininger et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Fast trill-like central pattern generators are not latent in slow click species of <italic>Xenopus</italic></title><p>Latent neural networks, which are considered evolutionary remnants, have been observed in various animals. For example, female <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, which do not produce male-typical courtship songs, still possess song neural networks that can be artificially activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clyne and Miesenböck, 2008</xref>). Similarly, flight neural networks are present in flightless grasshoppers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arbas, 1983</xref>). Given that fast trill-like CPGs in the genus <italic>Xenopus</italic> are likely ancestral, wIn this study, we asked if the fast trill-like CPGs are inherited by all species within the genus <italic>Xenopus</italic>, despite being latent in slow clickers. Although we did not observe any fictive fast clicks from the brains of male <italic>X. tropicalis</italic> and female <italic>X. laevis,</italic> we could not rule out the possibility that the motor programs were not elicited because we failed to provide appropriate stimuli. To address this question, we examined the synaptic properties between the parabrachial nucleus and the laryngeal motoneurons, which are crucial for the fast trill-like central pattern generators (CPGs). Our results revealed that fast and potentiating synapses found in all fast clickers are absent in slow clickers. Instead, the synapses of slow clickers are weak and unreliable. Thus, we conclude that fast trill-like CPGs are present only in species that incorporate fast clicks in their vocal repertoire, possibly due to the high cost of maintaining such synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). If slow clickers produce fast-trill like motor programs, which is unlikely due to the limitation of the laryngeal contractile properties discussed above, the underlying neural circuitries likely differ from the fast trill-like CPGs. It is important to note that the addition of fast trill-like CPGs to the central vocal pathways can occur rapidly within an individual, as seen in the transformation of the central vocal pathways in adult female <italic>X. laevis</italic>.</p><p>In summary, we compared the central vocal pathways of five <italic>Xenopus</italic> species to better understand neural mechanisms underlying divergence of courtship behavior. We found that fast and slow trill-like CPGs have a conserved basic architecture across species. Fast trill-like CPGs are not shared by all <italic>Xenopus</italic> species, but present only in fast clickers. Exogenous testosterone appears to promote the acquisition of fast trill-like CPGs in fast clickers, but not in slow clickers. We suggest that changes in the role of testosterone in organizing the central vocal pathways resulted in the divergence between fast and slow clickers, and the alteration of the intrinsic properties of Fast Trill Neurons in the parabrachial nucleus led to species-specific rate and duration of clicks among fast clickers. Our findings indicate that courtship behavior in vertebrates can diverge across species even though the underlying neural circuits inherited through an evolutionary lineage are conserved. This behavioral divergence is likely achieved through species-specific modifications in the intrinsic properties of neurons, and potential changes in responsiveness to gonadal hormones.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Fifty-nine male <italic>X. laevis</italic>, 39 female <italic>X. laevis</italic>, 24 male <italic>X. tropicalis</italic> obtained from Nasco (Fort Atkinson, WI, average +std weight = 42.59 ± 3.04 g, 54.83±4.79 g, 10.13±0.32 g, length = 6.99 ± 0.18 cm, 7.63±0.20 cm, 4.48±0.05 cm), 13 male <italic>X. petersii</italic> obtained from the National <italic>Xenopus</italic> Resource (Woods Hole, MA, weight = 16.49 ± 0.70, length = 4.22 ± 0.09 cm), and 12 male <italic>X. amieti</italic>, 3 male <italic>X. cliivi</italic> generously provided by Dr. Darcy Kelley (Columbia University, weight = 7.24 ± 1.23 g, 16.4±0.144 g, length = 3.87 ± 0.2 cm, 5.33±0.2 cm) were used for this study.

All statistical tests were carried out using StatView software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendation in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institute of Health.

The main conclusion of the paper reveals that vocal CPGs, located in the brainstem, generating fast and slow clicks in Xenopus male courtship calls are conserved across various Xenopus species. But the development of the fast CPG depends on testosterone only in species producing fast-click courtship calls.</p><p>I did really appreciate reviewing this paper even if I'm not an expert in vocalization and involved neuronal networks. It's a real pleasure to read a manuscript submitted to a valuable journal like Elife that proposed clear results based on classical but robust and established methods to answer clear scientific questions with the appropriate model. At least, but unfortunately too few, it's the proof, that there is no need for so-called &quot;cutting edge&quot; novel technics and fashion transgenic models to produce valuable sciences. Actually, using in vitro neurophysiology to compare the functional organization of the same neuronal circuit across species is a real &quot;tour de force&quot; project for a laboratory. Moreover, such type of study that explores adaptive mechanisms in neuronal networks through their evolution to ensure a similar behavior constitutes an exciting question that is too few promoted in modern neurosciences. I truly think this paper represents a valuable study, that will inspire researchers beyond the vocalization field. I recommend this paper for publication in eLife.</p><p>The manuscript is well-written and easy to follow in general. I don't have major comments</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86299.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The protocols to elicit a fictive call differed.

We cannot rule out the possibility of a fast trill-like motor program being elicited from a slow clicker brain under a correct context. However, we indirectly addressed this question by examining the synapses between the parabrachial projection neurons and the laryngeal motoneurons, which are crucial for the function of fast CPGs. Our results showed that the synapses of male <italic>X. tropicalis</italic> and female <italic>X. laevis</italic> differ systematically from those of fast clickers. The findings suggest that even if slow clickers possess the neural circuitry capable of producing fast clicks, synapses between the parabrachial nucleus and the laryngeal motoneurons are unlikely to be part of the circuitry. Therefore, we concluded that male <italic>X. tropicalis</italic> female <italic>X. laevis</italic> do not have fast CPGs comparable to those seen in fast clickers. This point is now included in the Discussion section titled “Fast trill-like central pattern generators are not latent in slow click species of <italic>Xenopus</italic>” (p27, ln 8 – 16).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1, the two-color drops and lightning bolts are not as immediately informative as the text would be.

The figure highlights that in male <italic>X. tropicalis</italic> that generate fictive advertisement calls in response to a combination of 5HT and NMA, while 5HT alone or electrical stimulation to the rostral lateral cerebellum (RLCB) failed to elicit a fresponse. In male <italic>X. amieti,</italic> fictive calls are generated in response to electrical stimuli delivered to RLCB, but not in response to application of 5HT.

The updated sentence reads as follows: ‘These results suggest that, regardless of vocal repertoire of the species, the PBN does not play a significant role, if any, in producing fictive slow clicks (&lt; 35Hz) compared to its role in producing fast clicks (&gt;50Hz).’ (p9, ln 19 – 21).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>P. 8, lines 16-18.

The revised sentence reads as follows: ‘Our objective was to determine whether female <italic>X. laevis</italic> use slow trill-like CPGs, similar to those observed in male X. laevis, to produce release calls. Additionally, we aimed to determine if females acquire fast trill-like CPGs or continue to use the existing slow trill-like CPGs to produce masculinized fast click calls.’ (p10, ln 5 – 9)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>P. 11, line 6, change to &quot;of 2 testosterone-treated female <italic>X. laevis</italic>&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>This change has been made.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5.

The pyloric and gastric mill CPGs control distinct muscle groups and operate simultaneously, which is different from fast and slow CPGs in <italic>Xenopus</italic> that control the same muscle groups and are active at mutually exclusive timing. However, the coordination between the two CPGs is well characterized at the cellular and synaptic levels. In the Discussion section titled “Anatomically distinct organization of frequency-dependent CPGs, and their temporal coordination”, we have added a paragraph that speculates on how the timing of fast and slow trills in <italic>Xenopus</italic> nervous system may be coordinated using similar types of synapses the connect the pyloric and gastric mill CPGs”.
