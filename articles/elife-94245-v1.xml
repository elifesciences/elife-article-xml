PCC 6803, encoding bidirectional hydrogenase responsible for H<sub>2</sub> production, is transcriptionally upregulated under microoxic conditions. Although several regulators for <italic>hox</italic> transcription have been identified, their dynamics and higher-order DNA structure of <italic>hox</italic> region in microoxic conditions remain elusive. We focused on key regulators for the <italic>hox</italic> operon: cyAbrB2, a conserved regulator in cyanobacteria, and SigE, an alternative sigma factor. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing revealed that cyAbrB2 binds to the <italic>hox</italic> promoter region under aerobic conditions, with its binding being flattened in microoxic conditions. Concurrently, SigE exhibited increased localization to the <italic>hox</italic> promoter under microoxic conditions. Genome-wide analysis revealed that cyAbrB2 binds broadly to AT-rich genome regions and represses gene expression. Moreover, we demonstrated the physical interactions of the <italic>hox</italic> promoter region with its distal genomic loci. Both the transition to microoxic conditions and the absence of cyAbrB2 influenced the chromosomal interaction. From these results, we propose that cyAbrB2 is a cyanobacterial nucleoid-associated protein (NAP), modulating chromosomal conformation, which blocks RNA polymerase from the <italic>hox</italic> promoter in aerobic conditions. We further infer that cyAbrB2, with altered localization pattern upon microoxic conditions, modifies chromosomal conformation in microoxic conditions, which allows SigE-containing RNA polymerase to access the <italic>hox</italic> promoter. The coordinated actions of this NAP and the alternative sigma factor are crucial for the proper <italic>hox</italic> expression in microoxic conditions. Our results highlight the impact of cyanobacterial chromosome conformation and NAPs on transcription, which have been insufficiently investigated.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cyanobacteria</kwd><kwd>nucleoid-associated protein</kwd><kwd>hydrogenase</kwd><kwd>fermentation</kwd><kwd><italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp.

Cyanobacteria have multiple fermentation pathways according to the environment. For example, the freshwater living cyanobacterium <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. PCC 6803 (hereafter referred to as <italic>Synechocystis</italic>) produces acetate, lactate, dicarboxylic acids, and hydrogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stal and Moezelaar, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Osanai et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Hydrogen is generated in quantities comparable to lactate and dicarboxylic acids as the result of electron acceptance in the dark microoxic condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Iijima et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiyama and Osanai, 2023</xref>). Bidirectional hydrogenase is a key enzyme for H<sub>2</sub> production from protons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carrieri et al., 2011</xref>) and is commonly found in cyanobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Puggioni et al., 2016</xref>). Cyanobacterial hydrogenase comprises five subunits (HoxEFUHY) containing nickel and Fe-S clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cassier-Chauvat et al., 2014</xref>). This enzyme can utilize NADH, reduced ferredoxin, and flavodoxin as substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gutekunst et al., 2014</xref>). Hydrogenase mainly receives reduced ferredoxin from pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) in the microoxic condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gutekunst et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Artz et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Although hydrogenase and PFOR are O<sub>2</sub> sensitive, they can work under aerobic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burgstaller et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Appel et al., 2000</xref>). Therefore, uncontrolled expression of <italic>hox</italic> operon and <italic>nifJ</italic> (coding gene of PFOR) may hamper metabolism under photosynthetic conditions. Furthermore, genetic manipulations on <italic>Synechocystis</italic> have demonstrated that modulating the expression of certain enzymes including hydrogenase can alter fermentative metabolic flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Iijima et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiyama and Osanai, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Iijima et al., 2021</xref>). This provides evidence that transcription regulates the fermentative pathway. Thus, transcriptional regulation in response to the environment is essential for optimal energy cost performance.</p><p>Promoter recognition by RNA polymerases is an essential step in transcriptional regulation. Sigma factors, subunits of RNA polymerase, recognize core promoter sequences. Transcription factors can also bind to promoter regions to suppress or promote RNA polymerase transcription. As well as recruitment or blocking of RNA polymerase, some transcriptional factors, known as nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs), modulate chromosomal conformation to regulate transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">HoÅÃ³wka and Zakrzewska-CzerwiÅska, 2020</xref>). NAPs are common in bacteria, but cyanobacterial NAPs remain unidentified, and higher-order DNA structure in cyanobacteria is yet to be shown. A recent study suggested that the manipulation of chromosomal supercoiling impacts transcriptional properties in cyanobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Behle et al., 2022</xref>). There is room for consideration of NAPs modulating chromosomal conformation and regulating expression in cyanobacteria.</p><p>In <italic>Synechosysits</italic>, the coding genes of HoxEFUHY form a single operon (sll1220â1226), while PFOR is encoded in the <italic>nifJ</italic> (sll0741) gene. Both <italic>hox</italic> and <italic>nifJ</italic> operons are highly expressed under microoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Summerfield et al., 2011</xref>). Genetic analysis has revealed that multiple global transcriptional regulators control <italic>hox</italic> and <italic>nifJ</italic> expression. Sigma factor SigE (Sll1689) promotes the expression of <italic>hox</italic> and <italic>nifJ</italic> operons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Osanai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Osanai et al., 2011</xref>), while transcription factor cyAbrB2 (Sll0822) represses them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dutheil et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leplat et al., 2013</xref>). Positive regulators for the <italic>hox</italic> operon include LexA (Sll1626) and cyAbrB1 (Sll0359) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Oliveira and Lindblad, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gutekunst et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oliveira and Lindblad, 2005</xref>).</p><p>SigE, an alternative sigma factor, controls the expression of genes involved in glycogen catabolism and glycolysis, as well as PFOR/<italic>nifJ</italic> and hydrogenase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Osanai et al., 2005</xref>). SigE shows a high amino acid sequence similarity with the primary sigma factor SigA, which is responsible for transcribing housekeeping and photosynthetic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Imamura and Asayama, 2009</xref>). A ChIP-seq study revealed that, while most SigE binding sites are the same as SigA, SigE exclusively occupies the promoters of glycogen catabolism and glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kariyazono and Osanai, 2022</xref>).</p><p>CyAbrB2 and its homolog cyAbrB1 are transcription factors highly conserved in cyanobacteria. For example, cyAbrB homologs in <italic>Anabaena</italic> sp. PCC7120 is involved in heterocyst formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Higo et al., 2019</xref>). CyAbrB2 in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> regulates the expression of several genes involved in carbon metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, and cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leplat et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ishii and Hihara, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lieman-Hurwitz et al., 2009</xref>). CyAbrB2 binds to the <italic>hox</italic> promoter in vitro and represses its expression in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dutheil et al., 2012</xref>). CyAbrB1, an essential gene, physically interacts with the cyAbrB2 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yamauchi et al., 2011</xref>) and binds the <italic>hox</italic> promotor region in vitro to promote its expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Oliveira and Lindblad, 2008</xref>).</p><p>To explore the dynamics of those transcription factors governing the expression of <italic>hox</italic> operon, we conducted a time-course analysis of the transcriptome and ChIP-seq of SigE and cyAbrB2. Our ChIP-seq and transcriptome analysis showed the NAPs-like nature of cyAbrB2, which prompted us to conduct a chromosomal conformation capture assay. 3C analysis explored the physical interaction between the <italic>hox</italic> promoter region and its downstream and upstream genomic region in the aerobic condition, and some loci changed interaction frequency upon entry to the microoxic condition. Furthermore, some interactions in the â<italic>cyabrB2</italic> mutant were different from those of the wildtype. From those experiments, we propose that cyAbrB2 modulates chromosomal conformation like NAPs, allowing access to the SigE-containing RNA polymerase complex on the <italic>hox</italic> promoter, by which the <italic>hox</italic> operon achieves distinct expression dynamics. Chromosomal conformation of bacteria is a growing area of interest, and the findings of this study have brought insight into the transcriptional regulation of cyanobacteria.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transcriptomes on entry to dark microoxic conditions</title><p>To understand transcriptional regulation under microoxic conditions, we conducted a time-course transcriptome capturing light aerobic and dark microoxic conditions at 1, 2, and 4 hr timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) based on KEGG pathway revealed that many biological pathways, including photosynthesis and respiration (oxidative phosphorylation), were downregulated by the transition to dark microoxic conditions from light aerobic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Upregulated pathways included butanoate metabolism and two-component systems. The enrichment in the butanoate metabolism pathway indicates the upregulation of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism. We further classified genes according to their expression dynamics. Within 1 hr of switching from aerobic to microoxic conditions, the expression levels of 508 genes increased more than twofold. Furthermore, genes with increased expression levels were classified into four groups based on the time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Of the 508 genes, 28 were termed âtransiently upregulated genesâ due to their decreased expression upon the comparison of 1 and 4 hr incubation under microoxic conditions (Log2 fold change &lt; â0.5), and 119 were termed âcontinuously upregulated genesâ, which continuously increased between 1 and 4 hr incubation under microoxic conditions (Log2 fold change &gt;0.5). Other than 508 genes twofold upregulated within 1 hr, 28 genes showed more than fourfold increment within 4 hr but not upregulated within 1 hr. We combined those âLate upregulated genesâ with 508 genes and referred to as âAll upregulated genesâ in the subsequent analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Mapping the classified genes to central carbon metabolism revealed that <italic>nifJ</italic> encoding PFOR and <italic>hox</italic> operon encoding a bidirectional hydrogenase complex were transiently upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

In the second pattern, cyAbrB2 binds on promoter regions, such as <italic>hox</italic> operon and <italic>nifJ</italic>.

This is presumably because sigma factors recognize the promoter as a large complex of RNA polymerase. CyAbrB2 binds to the <italic>hox and nifJ</italic> promoter region and may inhibit access to RNA polymerase complex under aerobic conditions. When cells entered microoxic conditions, the boundaries of the cyAbrB2 binding region and cyAbrB2-free region became obscure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), and SigE binding peaks on those promoters became prominent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

This deviation can inhibit SigE from binding during aerobic conditions, aside from cyAbrB2-mediated inhibition. Under the microoxic condition, transcription factors LexA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oliveira and Lindblad, 2005</xref>) and Rre34 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Summerfield et al., 2011</xref>) may aid SigE binding to the promoter of <italic>hox</italic> and <italic>nifJ</italic>, respectively.</p><p>Moreover, SigE seems susceptible to the blocking from cyAbrB2 during the aerobic condition compared with SigA. This is supported by the odds ratio of SigE being in the cyAbrB2-free region was higher than that of SigA in the aerobic condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). The higher exclusion pressure of cyAbrB2 on SigE may contribute to sharpening the transcriptional response of hox and nifJ on entry to microoxic conditions.

In assessing the control of the hox system, the authors focused on the relative contributions of cyAbrB2, alongside SigE (and to a lesser extent, SigA and cyAbrB1) under both aerobic and microoxic conditions. In mapping the binding sites of these different proteins, they discovered that cyAbrB2 bound many sites throughout the chromosome, repressed many of its target genes, and preferentially bound regions that were (relatively) rich in AT-residues. These characteristics led the authors to consider that cyAbrB2 may function as a nucleoid-associated protein (NAP) in Synechocystis, given the functional similarities with other NAPs like H-NS. They assessed the local chromosome conformation in both wild type and cyabrB2 mutant strains at multiple sites within a 40 kb window on either side of the hox locus, using a region within the hox operon as bait. They concluded that cyAbrB2 functions as a nucleoid associated protein that influences the activity of SigE through its modulation of chromosome architecture.</p><p>The authors approached their experiments carefully, and the data were generally very clearly presented. At the same time, the overall work contains many lines of inquiry and different protein investigations that in some ways made it more challenging to identify the overall take-away message(s).</p><p>Based on the data presented, the authors make a strong case for cyAbrB2 as a nucleoid-associated protein, given the multiple ways in which is seems to function similarly to the well-studied <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> H-NS protein. They now provide additional commentary that relates cyAbrB2 with other nucleoid-associated proteins.</p><p>Previous work had revealed a role for SigE in the control of hox cluster expression, which nicely justified its inclusion (and focus) in this study. The focus on cyAbrB2 is also well-justified, given previous reports of its control of hox expression; however, it shares binding sites with an essential homologue cyAbrB1. Interestingly, while the B1 protein appears to bind similar sites, instead of repressing hox expression, it is known as an activator of this operon. If the information on cyAbrB1 is retained in the manuscript, it would be important to consider how cyAbrB1 activity might influence the results described here (although the authors could also consider removing the cyAbrB1 information to help improve the focus of the manuscript).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.94245.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kariyazono</surname><given-names>Ryo</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Meiji University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Kawasaki</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Osanai</surname><given-names>Takashi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Meiji University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Kawasaki</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p><p>The authors provide solid data on a functional investigation of potential nucleoid-associated proteins and the modulation of chromosomal conformation in a model cyanobacterium.

The experiments were well done, the data presentation looks very structured, and the text reads well in principle.</p><p>Weakness:</p><p>Having a closer look, the red line of the manuscript is somewhat blurry. Reading the abstract, the introduction, and parts of the discussion, it is not really clear what the authors exactly aim to target. Is it the regulation of fermentation in cyanobacteria because it is under-investigated? Is it to bring light to the transcriptional regulation of hydrogenase genes? The regulation by SigE? Or is it to get insight into the real function of cyAbrB2 in cyanobacteria? All of this would be good of course. But it appears that the authors try to integrate all these aspects, which in the end is a little bit counterintuitive and in some places even confusing. From my point of view, the major story is a functional investigation of the presumable transcriptional regulator cyAbrB2, which turned out to be a potential NAP. To demonstrate/prove this, the hox genes have been chosen as an example due to the fact that a regulatory role of cyAbrB2 has already been described. In my eyes, it would be good to restructure or streamline the introduction according to this major outcome.</p></disp-quote><p>As you pointed out, the major focus of this study is cyAbrB2 as a potential NAPs. To focus on NAPs, we simplified the first paragraph of the discussion (ll.246-263) and added the section comparing cyAbrB2 with other known NAPs (11.269-299). To emphasize the description of cyAbrB2, we also rearranged the figures and divided the analysis on cyAbrB2 ChIP into two figures. We reduced the first paragraph of the introduction but mostly preserved the composition of the introduction to keep the general to specific pattern, even though the manuscript is blurry.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Points to consider:</p><p>The authors suggest that the microoxic condition is the reason for the downregulation of e.g. photosynthesis (l.112-114). But of course, they also switched off the light to achieve a microoxic environment, which presumably is the trigger signal for photosynthesis-related genes. I suggest avoiding making causal conclusions exclusively related to oxygen and recommend rephrasing (for example, &quot;were downregulated under the conditions applied&quot;).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this point. We rephrased l.114 to âby the transition to dark microoxic conditions from light aerobic conditionsâ (ll.108-109).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors hypothesized that cyAbrB2 modulates chromosomal conformation and conducted a 3C analysis. But if I read the data in Figure 5B &amp; C correctly, there is a lot of interaction in a range of 1650 and 1700 kb, not only at marked positions c and j. Positions c and j have been picked because it appears that cyAbrB2 deletion impacts this particular interaction. But is it really significant? In the case of position j the variation between the replicates seems quite high, in the case of position c the mean difference is not that high. Moreover, does all this correlate with cyAbrB2 binding, i.e. with positions of gray bars in panel A? If this was the case, the data obtained for the cyabrB2 mutant should look totally different but they are quite similar to WT. That's why the sentence &quot;By contrast, the interaction frequency in Îcyabrb2 mutant were low and unchanged in the aerobic and microoxic conditions&quot; does not fit to the data shown. But I have to mention that I am not an expert in these kinds of assays. Nevertheless, if there is a biological function that shall be revealed by an experiment, the data must be crystal clear on that. At least the descriptions of the 3C data and the corresponding conclusions need to be improved. For me, it is hard to follow the authors' thoughts in this context.</p></disp-quote><p>According to your suggestion, we again have carefully observed the 3C data. Furthermore, we conducted an additional 3C experiment on nifJ region (Figures 7F-J). Then we admit we had overinterpreted the 3C data. Therefore, we rewrote the result and discussion of the 3C assay in line with the data (ll.220-245) and removed the previous Figure 5E. Following are individual responses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Positions c and j have been picked because it appears that cyAbrB2 deletion impacts this particular interaction. But is it really significant?</p></disp-quote><p>We could not find statistically significant differences at locus c and j.

Therefore, we withdraw the previous claim and stated as follows; âMoreover, our 3C data did not support bridging at least in hox region and nifJ region, as the high interaction locus and cyAbrB2 binding region did not seem to correlate (Figure 7).â (ll.280-282)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If this was the case, the data obtained for the cyabrB2 mutant should look totally different but they are quite similar to WT.</p></disp-quote><p>We rewrote it as follows; âThen we compared the chromatin conformation of wildtype and cyabrb2â.

In âcyabrb2, by contrast, the interaction frequency of loci (c) and (j) was unchanged in the aerobic and microoxic conditions (Figure 7E). The interaction frequency of locus (c) in âcyabrb2 was as low as that in the microoxic condition of wildtype, while that of locus (j) in âcyabrb2 was as high as that in the aerobic condition of wildtype (Figures 7B and 7C).â (ll.238-243)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The figures are nicely prepared, albeit quite complex and in some cases not really supportive of the understanding of the results description. Moreover, they show a rather loose organization that sometimes does not fit the red line of the results section. For example, Figure 1D is not mentioned in the paragraph that refers to several other panels of the same figure (see lines110-128). Panel 1D is mentioned later in the discussion. Does 1D really fit into Figure 1 then? Are all the panels indeed required to be shown in the main document? As some elements are only briefly mentioned, the authors might also consider moving some into the supplement (e.g. left part of Figure 1C, Figure 2A, Figure 3B ...) or at least try to distribute some panels into more figures. This would reduce complexity and increase comprehensibility for future readers. Also, Figure 3 is a way too complex. Panel G could be an alone-standing figure. The latter would also allow for an increase in font sizes or to show ChIP data of both conditions (L+O2 and D-O2) separately. Moreover, a figure legend typically introduces the content as a whole by one phrase but here only the different panels are described, which fits to the impression that all the different panels are not well connected. Of course, it is the decision of the authors what to present and how but may they consider restructuring and simplifying.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the advice, we have rearranged the Figure composition.</p><p>The left side of Figure 1C has been moved to supplement. Instead, representative expression fold changes of âTransientâ, âPlateauâ, âContinuousâ, and âLateâ genes are shown for comprehensibility. We left Figure 1D in Figure 1, as this diagram shows our motive to focus on hox and nifJ. We moved Figure 2A to supplement. We did not move Fig3B, as this figure shows the distribution of cyAbrB2 (âlong tract of AT-rich DNAâ) comprehensively and simply. We agree that Figure 3 was too complex. Therefore, we moved Figures 3F and 3G to a new independent figure (Figure 4). In Figure 4C (former 3G), we show the ChIP data of the L+O2 condition only, and the change of ChIP data under the D-O2 condition is shown in Figure 5. The schematic image showing cyanobacterial chromosome and NAPs (previous Figure 5E) was omitted because it was overinterpreting.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors assume a physiological significance of transient upregulation of e.g. hox genes under microoxic conditions. But does the hydrogenase indeed produce hydrogen under the conditions investigated and is this even required? Moreover, the authors use the term &quot;fermentative gene&quot;. But is hydrogen indeed a fermentation product, i.e. are protons the terminal electron acceptor to achieve catabolic electron balance? Then huge amounts of hydrogen should be released. Comment should be made on this.</p><p>This is a very important point; Yes, hydrogenase indeed produces hydrogen under the conditions we investigated, and proton accepts a majority of reducing power under the dark microoxic condition. We wrote in the introduction section as follows; â<italic>Hydrogen is generated in quantities comparable to lactate and dicarboxylic acids as the result of electron acceptance in the dark microoxic condition</italic> (Akiyama and Osanai 2023; Iijima et al. 2016)â (ll.54-55). The detailed explanation is below, although omitted from the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>A recent study (Akiyama and Oasanai 2023) quantified the consumed glycogen and secreted fermentative products (hydrogen, lactate, dicarboxylic acid, and acetate) in the <italic>Synechocystis</italic> under the dark microoxic condition, the same conditions as we investigated. The system of the study consists of a 10 mL liquid layer and a 10 mL gas layer, cultivated for 3 days under dark microoxic conditions. Then the amounts of lactic acid, dicarboxylic acid, and hydrogen were approximately 2 Âµmol, 3.5 Âµmol, and 11Âµmol (assuming the gas layer was at 1 atm and ignoring aqueous population), respectively. On the other hand, glycogen equivalent to 15Âµmol of glucose was consumed in the system. This estimate supports hydrogen accounts for a substantial portion of fermentative products during dark microoxic conditions.</p><p>The necessity of hydrogen production under dark microoxic conditions was demonstrated in (Gutekunst et al. 2014). They show hydrogenase activity is required for the mixotrophic growth in the light-dark and microoxic cycle with arginine. The necessity remains unclear in our conditions because we only performed continuous dark microoxic conditions without glucose.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors also mention a reverse TCA cycle. But is its existence an assumption or indeed active in cyanobacteria, i.e. is it experimentally proven? The authors are a little bit vague in this regard (see lines 241-246).</p></disp-quote><p>We misused the Terminology. We mean to mention the âreductive branch of TCAâ. Cyanobacteria conduct the branched TCA cycle under microoxic conditions. One of the branches is the reductive branch, which reduces oxaloacetate to produce malate. We corrected âreverse TCA cycleâ to âreductive branch of TCAâ. (Figure 1D and ll.260-262)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>This work probes the control of the hox operon in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis, where this operon directs the synthesis of a bidirectional hydrogenase that functions to produce hydrogen. In assessing the control of the hox system, the authors focused on the relative contributions of cyAbrB2, alongside SigE (and to a lesser extent, SigA and cyAbrB1) under both aerobic and microoxic conditions. In mapping the binding sites of these different proteins, they discovered that cyAbrB2 bound many sites throughout the chromosome repressed many of its target genes, and preferentially bound regions that were (relatively) rich in AT-residues. These characteristics led the authors to consider that cyAbrB2 may function as a nucleoid-associated protein (NAP) in Synechocystis, given its functional similarities with other NAPs like H-NS. They assessed the local chromosome conformation in both wild-type and cyabrB2 mutant strains at multiple sites within a 40 kb window on either side of the hox locus, using a region within the hox operon as bait. They concluded that cyAbrB2 functions as a nucleoid-associated protein that influences the activity of SigE through its modulation of chromosome architecture.</p><p>The authors approached their experiments carefully, and the data were generally very clearly presented and described.</p><p>Based on the data presented, the authors make a strong case for cyAbrB2 as a nucleoid-associated protein, given the multiple ways in which it seems to function similarly to the well-studied <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> H-NS protein. It would be helpful to provide some additional commentary within the discussion around the similarities and differences of cyAbrB2 to other nucleoid-associated proteins, and possible mechanisms of cyAbrB2 control (post-translational modification; protein-protein interactions; etc.). The manuscript would also be strengthened with the inclusion of biochemical experiments probing the binding of cyAbrB2, particularly focusing on its oligomerization and DNA polymerization/bridging potential.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the comment that the biochemical experiments will deepen our insights into the cyAbrB2 and chromatin conformation. As the reviewer pointed out, the biochemical assay will provide valuable information on mechanisms of cyAbrB2 control, such as post-transcriptional modification, cooperation with cyAbrB1, oligomerization, and the structure of cyAbrB2-bound DNA. However, we think those potential findings are worth of new independent research paper, rather than a part of this paper. Therefore, we added a discussion mentioning biochemistry as the future work (ll.275-290; the section of âThe biochemistry of cyAbrB2 will shed light on the regulation of chromatin conformation in the futureâ).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Previous work had revealed a role for SigE in the control of hox cluster expression, which nicely justified its inclusion (and focus) in this study. However, the results of the SigA studies here suggested that SigA both strongly associated with the hox promoter, and its binding sites were shared more frequently than SigE with cyAbrB2. The focus on cyAbrB2 is also well-justified, given previous reports of its control of hox expression; however, it shares binding sites with an essential homologue cyAbrB1. Interestingly, while the B1 protein appears to bind similar sites, instead of repressing hox expression, it is known as an activator of this operon. It seems important to consider how cyAbrB1 activity might influence the results described here.</p></disp-quote><p>We infer that the minor side of the bimodal SigE peak is the genuine population that contributes to hox transcription, as hox genes are expressed in a SigE-dependent manner (Figure S2). We considered the strong SigA peak upstream of the hox operon binds the promoter of TU1715, the opposite direction of the hox operon. We added a description of the single SigA peak and bimodal SigE peak near the TSS of the hox operon as follows;</p><p>âA bimodal peak of SigE was observed at the TSS of the hox operon in a microoxic-specific manner (Figure 6C bottom panel). The downstream side of the bimodal SigE peak coincides with SigA peak and the TSS of TU1715. Another side of the bimodal peak lacked SigA binding and was located at the TSS of the hox operon (marked with an arrow in Figure 6C), although the peak caller failed to recognize it as a peak.â (ll.206-209)</p><p>The point that cyAbrB1 binds similar sites as cyAbrB2, despite regulating hox expression in the opposite direction, is very interesting. Therefore, we referred to the transcriptome data of the cyAbrB1 knockdown strain and compared the impact of cyAbrB1 knockdown and cyAbrB2 deletion. We described in result and discussion as follows;</p><p>âwe referred to the recent study performing transcriptome of cyAbrB1 knockdown strain, whose cyAbrB1 protein amount drops by half (Hishida et al. 2024). Among 24 genes induced by cyAbrB1 knockdown, 12 genes are differentially downregulated genes in cyabrb2â in our study (Figure S5D).â (ll.162-165)</p><p>âCyAbrB1, the homolog of cyAbrB2, may cooperatively work, as cyAbrB1 directly interacts with cyAbrB2 (Yamauchi et al. 2011), their distribution is similar, and they partially share their target genes for suppression (Figures 3A S5C and S5D). The possibility of cooperation would be examined by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay of cyAbrB1 and cyAbrB2 as a complex. Despite their similar repressive function, cyAbrB1 and cyAbrB2 regulate hox expression in the opposite directions, and their mechanism remains elusive.â (ll.292-296)</p><p><italic>Hox</italic> operon differs from this general tendency. To see if cyAbrB1 behaves differently from cyAbrB2 in the <italic>hox</italic> operon, we did an additional ChIP-qPCR experiment on cyAbrB1 in the aerobic condition and the dark microoxic condition (Figure 5C).

But the data presented in Figure 1 suggest that 1 hr corresponds to the beginning of microoxic growth, and that time 0 is aerobic. The composite 3C data in Figure 5 show some interesting but specific differences. It is appreciated that the authors presented the profiles for individual samples in Figure S7, and the differences here do not seem to be as compelling. Are the major differences being highlighted significantly (statistically) different (e.g. at the (c) and (j) loci)? Might the differences be starker if an earlier aerobic condition (e.g. time 0) had been used instead of the 1 hr - microoxic - timepoint?</p></disp-quote><p>Previous Figure 5 consisted of three time points (solid line: aerobic condition, dashed line:1hr of microoxic condition, and dotty line:4hr of microoxic condition). We omitted data of 4hr in the main figure (Figure 7) as 4hr in microoxic conditions makes data complicated. Three time points are shown in the profiles of individual loci (Figure S8).</p><p>There is no statistical significance found in (c) and (j) loci by t-test. Therefore, we have toned down the interpretation of 3C data as follows; âOur 3C result demonstrated that cyAbrB2 influences the chromosomal conformation of hox and nifJ region to some extent (Figure 7).â (ll.325-326)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) This is a complicated system that involves multiple regulatory proteins, each of which is differentially affected by the growth conditions (aerobic/microoxic). It is obviously beyond the scope of this work to probe deeply into all of these proteins. The focus here was on cyAbrB2, and to a slightly lesser extent SigE; however, based on the data presented, it seems that SigA and cyAbrB1 may be equally important contributors to hox control/expression, and in the case of cyAbrB1, possibly also to chromosome conformation. cyAbrB1 appears to have the same binding sites as cyAbrB2, and has been reported to interact with cyAbrB2. Given this association, it is possible that the two proteins may affect the binding of each other, and that loss of one might lead to enhanced binding by the other (or binding may require heterooligomerization?). Probing the regulatory interplay between these two proteins (or at least discussing it) feels important. Conducting e.g. mobility shift assays with each protein, both individually and together, could possibly allow for some understanding of how they function together.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the biochemistry of cyAbrB2 and cyAbrB1 may explain why cyAbrB1 and cyAbrB2 bind long tracts of AT-rich genome regions in vitro. We would like to put the biochemistry future plan as we think biochemistry data is beyond the present study.</p><p>The idea that cyAbrB1 and cyAbrB2 cooperate to form heterooligomers and broad binding to the genome is a very rational and interesting prediction. We add this idea to the discussion âOverall, the biochemistry integrating assay conditions (PTM, buffer condition, and cooperation with cyAbrB1) and output (DNA binding, oligomerization, and DNA structure) will deepen the understanding of cyAbrB2 as cyanobacterial NAPs.â(ll.287-290). We also compared our transcriptome of â_cyabrb2 with the recent study of cyabrb1 knockdown (ll. 162-165), and concluded âthey partially share their target genes for suppression (Figures 3A S5C and S5D)â (l. 293).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Throughout the manuscript, there is reference made to cyAbrB2 binding becoming 'blurry' or non-specific under microoxic conditions. It is not clear what this means. It appears that when cyAbrB2 binds, any given protected region can be quite extensive, which can be suggestive of polymerization along the chromosome. Are the boundaries for binding sites typically clearly delineated, and this changes when the cultures are growing under microoxic conditions? There is also no mention made anywhere about oligomerization potential for cyAbrB2, which would be important for the polymerization, and bridging suggested for cyAbrB2 in the model presented in Figure 5. Previous publications (Song et al., 2022; Ishi et al., 2008) have suggested that it can exist as a dimer in vivo, but that in vitro it is largely monomeric. The manuscript would benefit from some additional biochemical analyses of cyAbrB2 binding activity, with a particular focus on DNA binding and oligomerization/bridging potential, and some additional discussion about these characteristics as well.</p><p>Throughout the manuscript, there is reference made to cyAbrB2 binding becoming 'blurry' or non-specific under microoxic conditions.
