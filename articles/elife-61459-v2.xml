In <italic>C. elegans</italic> nematodes, starvation during the first larval stage promotes entry into a stress-resistant dauer stage until environmental conditions improve. Adults that have experienced dauer (postdauers) retain a memory of early-life starvation that results in gene expression changes and reduced fecundity. Here, we show that the endocrine pathways attributed to the regulation of somatic aging in <italic>C. elegans</italic> adults lacking a functional germline also regulate the reproductive phenotypes of postdauer adults that experienced early-life starvation. We demonstrate that postdauer adults reallocate fat to benefit progeny at the expense of the parental somatic fat reservoir and exhibit increased longevity compared to controls. Our results also show that the modification of somatic fat stores due to parental starvation memory is inherited in the F<sub>1</sub> generation and may be the result of crosstalk between somatic and reproductive tissues mediated by the germline nuclear RNAi pathway.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>postdauer</kwd><kwd>daf-12</kwd><kwd>nhr-49</kwd><kwd>tcer-1</kwd><kwd>hrde-1</kwd><kwd>prg-1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM129135</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hall</surname><given-names>Sarah E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Somatic aging and germline RNAi pathways promote inheritance of ancestral starvation memory through reallocation of fat storage in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Evidence indicating that experiences during early development affect behavior and physiology in a stress-specific manner later in life is abundant throughout the animal kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Telang and Wells, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Weaver et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Binder et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Pellegroms et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">van Abeelen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Zhao and Zhu, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Canario et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dantzer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Vitikainen et al., 2019</xref>). Epidemiological studies and experiments using mammalian animal models have supported the ‘thrifty’ phenotype hypothesis which proposes that fetal or postnatal malnutrition results in increased risk for metabolic disorders in the offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Neel, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hales and Barker, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Vaag et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Smith and Ryckman, 2015</xref>). For instance, individuals exposed to the WWII Dutch Hunger Winter during gestation had lower glucose tolerance and increased risk of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases in adulthood compared to siblings born before the famine. In addition, the increased propensity to develop metabolic disorders was inherited for two generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Painter et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lumey et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Veenendaal et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, stress, such as malnutrition, early in life and the ensuing metabolic and physiological adaptation highlight the effectiveness by which the environment reconfigures animal life history.</p><p>The nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> makes a critical decision regarding its developmental trajectory based on the environmental conditions experienced during its early larval stages (L1-L2). If conditions are poor (e.g. low food availability, crowding, or high temperatures), decreased insulin and TGF-β signaling promote entry into an alternative, stress-resistant, non-aging, diapause stage named dauer. Once conditions improve, dauer larvae resume development as postdauer L4 larvae and continue through reproductive adulthood as postdauer adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cassada and Russell, 1975</xref>). Alternatively, if conditions are favorable, L1 larvae proceed through additional larval stages (L2-L4) until reaching reproductive adulthood (control adults) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Sulston and Horvitz, 1977</xref>). Although postdauer adults are morphologically similar to control adults, we previously showed that postdauer adults retained a cellular memory of their early-life experience that resulted in genome-wide changes in their chromatin, transcriptome, and life history traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hall et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hall et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ow et al., 2018</xref>). Remarkably, postdauer adults also encoded the nature of their early environmental stress and gauged their adult reproductive phenotypes and genome-wide gene expression based on this memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ow et al., 2018</xref>). Postdauer adults that experienced crowding or high pheromone conditions exhibited increased fecundity and upregulated expression of genes involved in reproduction relative to control adults that never experienced crowding. In contrast, postdauer adults that experienced starvation (PD<sub>Stv</sub>) exhibited decreased fecundity and an enrichment in somatic gene expression compared to control adults that never experienced starvation (CON) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ow et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, the changes in fecundity and somatic gene expression in PD<sub>Stv</sub> adults required a functional germ line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ow et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The crosstalk pre-requisite between somatic and reproductive tissues for postdauer reproductive phenotypes is also a key regulatory feature governing adult lifespan and stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kenyon, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kenyon, 2010b</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, endocrine signaling has emerged as one of the principal pathways extending the lifespan of animals lacking a germ line due to either ablation of germ line precursor cells or mutations in the <italic>glp-1</italic>/Notch receptor gene. The two main effectors of endocrine signaling, the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16 and the nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) DAF-12, are required for the increased lifespan of germ line-less animals and are regulated by the physiological state of the animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hsin and Kenyon, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kenyon, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kenyon, 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Murphy and Hu, 2013</xref>). When an animal experiences reproductive stress, such as sterility, DAF-16 is dephosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus where it can modify target gene expression to promote the extended lifespan of germ line-less animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kenyon, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kenyon, 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Murphy and Hu, 2013</xref>). DAF-12, a homolog of the mammalian vitamin D receptor, binds to bile acid-like steroid ligands (dafachronic acids or DA) to boost the expression of genes involved in reproduction and growth under favorable conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Antebi, 2014</xref>). In <italic>glp-1</italic> mutants, the Δ<sup>7</sup> form of DA (Δ<sup>7</sup>-DA) is increased fourfold compared to wild type and promotes DAF-16 nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Shen et al., 2012</xref>). One of the consequences of the DAF-16 and DAF-12-dependent endocrine signaling in <italic>glp-1</italic> mutants is a significant increase in stored intestinal fat, which allows for somatic maintenance and prolonged lifespan in the absence of germline development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Wang et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we show that steroid hormone signaling, reproductive longevity signaling, and nuclear hormone receptors contribute to the decreased fecundity of postdauer animals that experienced early-life starvation by modifying fatty acid metabolism. The reproductive plasticity of PD<sub>Stv</sub> adults is a result of crosstalk between somatic and reproductive tissues, the effect of which is an increase in lipid metabolic pathway function in an animal that has experienced dauer, resulting in decreased lipid storage in the adult and reallocation of fat into embryos. Thus, the pathways that bestow increased lipid storage and extended longevity in a germ line-less animal function to promote reproduction in a postdauer animal that experienced early-life starvation. We also show that the F<sub>1</sub> generation inherits the parental memory for altered fat metabolism manifested as increased intestinal fat storage, which is dependent on HRDE-1 and PRG-1, two germline-specific RNAi Argonautes. Given the role of these Argonautes in RNAi-mediated transgenerational inheritance, our results suggest that RNAi pathways may transmit an ancestral starvation memory through the modulation of fat metabolism to ensuing generations to provide the necessary hardiness to survive future famine.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dafachronic acid-dependent DAF-12 signaling may be required for decreased fecundity after starvation-induced dauer formation</title><p>Given that endocrine signaling across tissues is a prominent feature of reproductive longevity, we examined whether wild-type PD<sub>Stv</sub> adults shared any gene expression signatures with animals lacking a functional germ line. In <italic>glp-1</italic> mutants, increased longevity is dependent on TOR (target of rapamycin) signaling, DAF-16/FOXO gene regulation, steroid hormone signaling, and fatty acid metabolism regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lapierre and Hansen, 2012</xref>).

The closest gene relative to <italic>daf-12</italic>, <italic>nhr-8</italic>, is also upregulated 2.5-fold in PD<sub>Stv</sub> adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lindblom et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Magner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ow et al., 2018</xref>); however, <italic>nhr-8(ok186)</italic> adults exhibited a significant brood size reduction in PD<sub>Stv</sub> animals compared to controls similar to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). One possible explanation of this observation is that passage through dauer may partially rescue the reproductive phenotypes of the <italic>daf-12</italic>, <italic>daf-36</italic>, and <italic>daf-9</italic> mutants, as has been previously observed for hypodermal and vulval precursor cell fates in postdauer heterochronic mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Liu and Ambros, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Euling and Ambros, 1996</xref>), or that DAF-12 activity in the absence of DA is sufficient for reproduction in PD<sub>Stv</sub> animals. Another explanation is that DA-dependent DAF-12 activity is required for the early-life starvation memory that programs a decrease in PD<sub>Stv</sub> fecundity, and its loss results in a reproductive phenotype similar to what we have observed previously in pheromone-induced postdauers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ow et al., 2018</xref>). Although we cannot distinguish between these possibilities with this data, we favor the latter explanation given the abrogation of the decreased fecundity phenotype in <italic>dhs-16</italic> mutants, which lack significant reproductive defects as determined by the similarity of the brood size of <italic>dhs-16</italic> control adults to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The TCER-1 reproductive longevity pathway mediates reproductive plasticity</title><p>DAF-16 and PQM-1 act in a mutually antagonistic manner to promote the expression of a group of stress response genes (Class I) or genes associated with growth and reproduction (Class II), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Tepper et al., 2013</xref>). We found that the set of genes with significant changes in mRNA levels between PD<sub>Stv</sub> and controls was enriched for Class I and II targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2s1sdata1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>). In addition, we found two genes that regulate DAF-16 cellular localization, <italic>pqm-1</italic> and <italic>daf-18</italic>, were significantly up and downregulated, respectively, in PD<sub>Stv</sub> adults compared to controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ow et al., 2018</xref>). DAF-18 is the functional ortholog of the human PTEN tumor suppressor gene that promotes DAF-16 nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ogg and Ruvkun, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gil et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mihaylova et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Solari et al., 2005</xref>). These observations prompted us to ask whether PQM-1 and DAF-18 contribute to the reduced fertility in PD<sub>Stv</sub> adults by altering the regulation of genes involved in reproduction and sequestering DAF-16 in the cytoplasm. However, the brood size differences between control and PD<sub>Stv</sub> adults in <italic>pqm-1(ok485)</italic> and <italic>daf-18(e1375)</italic> mutants were similar to wild type, indicating that gene regulation by PQM-1 is unlikely to contribute to the PD<sub>Stv</sub> reduced fecundity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Next, because <italic>daf-16</italic> null mutants are dauer defective, we crossed a <italic>daf-16(mu86)</italic> null allele with a strain carrying a rescue transgene (<italic>daf-16a<sup>AM</sup>::gfp</italic>) that constitutively localizes DAF-16 to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lin et al., 2001</xref>).

Since <italic>daf-18(e1375)</italic> is a hypomorph, we next tested the possibility that DAF-16 nuclear localization may play a role in regulating postdauer reproduction.

FAT-5, FAT-6, and FAT-7 convert saturated fatty acids (SFAs) to mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), while FAT-2 catalyzes the conversion of MUFAs to poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Watts and Ristow, 2017</xref>). Our previous mRNA-Seq results showed that the expression of <italic>fat-5</italic>, <italic>fat-6</italic>, <italic>fat-7</italic>, and <italic>fat-2</italic> increased significantly between 3.8- and 26.6-fold in wild-type PD<sub>Stv</sub> adults compared to controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ow et al., 2018</xref>).

Furthermore, the double mutant strains with combinations of mutations in <italic>fat-5</italic>, <italic>fat-6</italic>, and <italic>fat-7</italic> genes all exhibited an elimination of the decreased brood size phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These results suggest: (1) a functional redundancy between the Δ9 fatty acid desaturases in modulating lipid homeostasis of PD<sub>Stv</sub> adults, with FAT-6 playing a more principal role than FAT-5 and FAT-7; and (2) MUFA and PUFA levels may be upregulated to promote the decreased fertility phenotype in PD<sub>Stv</sub> adults compared to controls.</p><p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, MUFAs are essential for viability as a <italic>fat-5; fat-6; fat-7</italic> triple mutant is lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brock et al., 2006</xref>).

In addition to acting as key regulators of fat metabolism, FAT-5, FAT-6, and FAT-7 are also essential in promoting the long lifespan of adult worms lacking a germ line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gilst et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brock et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Goudeau et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Ratnappan et al., 2014</xref>). Given that MUFAs may be required for the reduced fecundity of PD<sub>Stv</sub> adults, we asked whether the dietary addition of OA to PD<sub>Stv</sub> animals would further reduce their brood size. To test this, we compared the brood size of PD<sub>Stv</sub> adults fed <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 grown with OA and PD<sub>Stv</sub> adults whose bacterial diet was not pre-loaded with OA. We tested the N2 wild type, <italic>nhr-49</italic>, and Δ9 desaturase double mutant strains. We found that for wild type and the strains that included a mutation in <italic>nhr-49</italic>, the supplementation of OA significantly increased PD<sub>Stv</sub> adult fecundity compared to the control diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In addition, the <italic>fat-6; fat-5</italic> double mutant strain continued to exhibit a significant increase in brood size when fed food supplemented with OA. However, the Δ9 desaturase double mutant strains carrying a mutation in <italic>fat-7</italic>, <italic>fat-7; fat-5</italic> and <italic>fat-6; fat-7</italic>, did not exhibit an OA-induced increase in brood size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). These results suggest that OA is not required for decreased fecundity but may rather be a limiting factor for reproduction after passage through the starvation-induced dauer stage, whether for nutrition or as a signaling molecule across tissues to regulate physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Schmeisser et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Starich et al., 2020</xref>). These results also indicate that <italic>fat-7</italic> is required for the OA-induced increase in brood size, which was unexpected given that it acts upstream of OA in fatty acid synthesis and suggests that FAT-7 has additional roles in fatty acid metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Watts, 2009</xref>). Altogether, these results suggest that the upregulation of fatty acid desaturases are critical for the decreased fertility in PD<sub>Stv</sub> adults by mediating and promoting the synthesis of sufficient levels of lipids needed for reproduction after the animals experienced starvation-induced dauer formation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Lipid metabolism is affected in wild-type postdauer adults that experienced starvation-induced dauer.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Brood size of wild-type N2 PD<sub>Stv</sub> and mutant PD<sub>Stv</sub> with or without oleic acid (OA) supplementation. * p &lt; 0.05 and **** p &lt; 0.0001 compare PD<sub>Stv</sub> to PD<sub>Stv</sub> + OA within a genotype; <sup>&amp;</sup> p &lt; 0.05, <sup>&amp;&amp;</sup>p &lt; 0.01, <sup>&amp;&amp;&amp;</sup> p &lt; 0.001, and <sup>&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;</sup> p &lt; 0.0001 compare N2 PD<sub>Stv</sub> to mutant PD<sub>Stv</sub>; <sup>####</sup> p &lt; 0.0001 compares of N2 PD<sub>Stv</sub> + OA to mutant PD<sub>Stv</sub> + OA; one-way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple comparison test.

Given that PD<sub>Stv</sub> adults have an increased expression of lipid metabolism genes similar to <italic>glp-1</italic>, but have limited quantities of OA for reproduction, we questioned what the status of fat stores would be in wild-type PD<sub>Stv</sub> adults with an intact germ line. Using Oil Red O (ORO) staining, we compared the amounts of neutral triglycerides and lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">O'Rourke et al., 2009</xref>) in PD<sub>Stv</sub> one-day-old adults and developmentally matched controls. Despite having a significant upregulation in fatty acid metabolism genes, we found that PD<sub>Stv</sub> adults have a significantly reduced amount of stored lipids relative to controls in their intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). These results are consistent with a model that PD<sub>Stv</sub> adults have increased expression of lipid metabolism genes for reproduction rather than somatic lipid storage.</p><p>Next, we investigated whether the decreased lipid stores in PD<sub>Stv</sub> adults was dependent upon DAF-12 and TCER-1. DA-dependent DAF-12 activity was shown previously to promote fat utilization for reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast to previous results, we found that control adults of both <italic>daf-12(rh284)</italic> and <italic>daf-12(rh285)</italic> strains displayed low levels of lipid storage, and postdauer adults exhibited a significant increase in lipid storage relative to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Interestingly, the levels of intestinal ORO staining positively correlated with control and PD<sub>Stv</sub> brood sizes in wild type and the <italic>daf-12</italic> mutants, and the <italic>daf-12</italic> mutant postdauers have statistically similar lipid stores compared to wild-type postdauers, further supporting the conclusion that DA-dependent DAF-12 activity is not required in postdauers to regulate lipid storage and reproduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In contrast, <italic>tcer-1(tm1452)</italic> lipid staining was diminished in PD<sub>Stv</sub> compared to controls, similar to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, since both <italic>tcer-1(tm1452)</italic> control and PD<sub>Stv</sub> adults have reduced fat stores compared to their wild-type counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>), and TCER-1 is known to positively regulate NHR-49 and fatty acid metabolism, this result may be due to the inability of these animals to store fat and not because TCER-1 regulates the levels of stored fat in PD<sub>Stv</sub> adults. These results suggest that fine-tuning the balance of somatic lipid stores between the CON and PD<sub>Stv</sub> life histories may be correlated with reproductive output.</p><p>Given that fatty acid metabolism is important for regulating fecundity in postdauer animals, we profiled fatty acids in wild-type control and PD<sub>Stv</sub> adults. Quantification of the level of SFAs, MUFAs, and PUFAs revealed that most of these fatty acids, including oleic acid, remained unchanged in control and PD<sub>Stv</sub> adults. Only two PUFAs, α-linolenic acid (ALA or C18:3n3) and dihomo-γ-linolenic (DGLA or C20:3n6) were significantly downregulated and upregulated, respectively, in PD<sub>Stv</sub> adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). ALA is an omega-3 fatty acid whose level is augmented in <italic>glp-1</italic> animals and is reported to extend adult lifespan in a manner that is dependent on NHR-49 and the SKN-1/Nrf2 transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Ratnappan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amrit et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Qi et al., 2017</xref>). Dietary supplementation of omega-6 fatty acid, DGLA, has been shown to trigger sterility through ferroptosis, an iron-dependent germ line cell death resulting from the production of toxic lipid metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deline et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Perez et al., 2020</xref>). Through the activities of the <italic>fat-2</italic>, <italic>fat-1</italic>, <italic>fat-3</italic>, <italic>elo-1/2</italic> and/or <italic>let-767</italic> genes, oleic acid serves as the substrate for the production of ALA and DGLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Interestingly, with the exception of <italic>fat-2</italic>, we found that the mRNA levels of these genes were significantly increased in postdauers that experienced starvation but not crowded conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ow et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, the fatty acid profiling suggests that a complex interplay between various PUFAs and their biosynthesis, and not the levels of oleic acid per se, may play a role in modulating fecundity in postdauers adults that experienced starvation.</p><p>Next, we investigated how PD<sub>Stv</sub> animals prioritize fat utilization for reproduction rather than intestinal storage. During <italic>C. elegans</italic> reproduction, intestinal fat stores are reallocated into low-density lipoproteins (LDL)-like particles (yolk lipoproteins or vitellogenins) that are incorporated into oocytes through receptor-mediated endocytosis in a process called vitellogenesis to supply nutrients to the developing embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kimble and Sharrock, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Grant and Hirsh, 1999</xref>). Six vitellogenins homologous to the human ApoB proteins are encoded in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome, <italic>vit-1</italic> through <italic>vit-6</italic>, and concomitant multiple RNAi knockdown of the <italic>vit</italic> genes increases adult lifespan in a process that requires NHR-49 and NHR-80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Spieth et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Seah et al., 2016</xref>). Because vitellogenesis mobilizes intestinal fat resources for reproduction and depletes somatic lipid stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kimble and Sharrock, 1983</xref>), we hypothesized that PD<sub>Stv</sub> adults have reduced fat reservoirs because they prioritize vitellogenesis as a reproductive investment over intestinal storage. To test this, we first examined the lipid content of PD<sub>Stv</sub> and CON adult embryos in utero using ORO staining. In contrast to the intestinal fat stores, we observed that ORO staining of PD<sub>Stv</sub> embryos was significantly increased compared to CON embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>). Next, we examined the lipid content of CON and PD<sub>Stv</sub> embryos of <italic>daf-12</italic> mutant strains. If intestinal lipid storage is indeed negatively correlated with the amount of vitellogenesis, we would predict that <italic>daf-12</italic> adults would exhibit the opposite phenotype compared to wild type, with <italic>daf-12</italic> PD<sub>Stv</sub> embryos having less fat than CON embryos. Instead, we observed that <italic>daf-12</italic> PD<sub>Stv</sub> and CON embryos have similar levels of ORO staining, all of which were significantly higher than the wild-type levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>). In contrast to our previous results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, these results indicate that DAF-12 does play a role in lipid allocation in control and postdauer animals, potentially by regulating vitellogenesis.</p><p>Furthermore, we examined the effects on the intestinal fat stores in control and PD<sub>Stv</sub> adults when vitellogenesis is disrupted by RNAi knockdown of <italic>vit-1,</italic> which also results in the knockdown of <italic>vit-2</italic>/<italic>3</italic>/<italic>4</italic>/<italic>5</italic> due to the high-sequence homology amongst the <italic>vit</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Seah et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). In animals treated with the empty vector (EV) negative control, PD<sub>Stv</sub> adults continued to exhibit decreased fat stores compared to control adults. However, PD<sub>Stv</sub> adults treated with <italic>vit-1</italic> RNAi have significantly greater intestinal fat deposits than PD<sub>Stv</sub> negative controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>), indicating that increased vitellogenesis in PD<sub>Stv</sub> adults may be a contributing factor to the lack of stored intestinal fat. Altogether, these results suggest that PD<sub>Stv</sub> adults utilize fat accumulated after diapause for reproduction and not somatic storage.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Vitellogenesis and adult lifespan are affected in postdauer animals.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) ORO staining in N2 CON and PD<sub>Stv</sub> one-day-old adults fed with <italic>vit-1</italic> RNAi or control empty RNAi vector (EV). **** p &lt; 0.0001 compares CON and PD<sub>Stv</sub> of the same RNAi condition; <sup>&amp;&amp;</sup>p &lt; 0.01 and <sup>####</sup>p &lt; 0.0001 compare <italic>vit-1</italic> to EV RNAi in N2 CON and PD<sub>Stv</sub>, respectively; one-way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple comparison test.

To examine whether the decrease in fat stores in postdauers would affect their longevity, we measured adult lifespan in wild-type controls and postdauers and found that postdauers have a significantly increased longevity compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Interestingly, we previously reported that crowding-induced postdauers also exhibited increased mean lifespan, suggesting that the increased longevity of PD<sub>Stv</sub> adults may be due to passage through dauer and not their specific early-life stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hall et al., 2010</xref>). We next asked if a disruption in PD<sub>Stv</sub> vitellogenesis resulting in increased level of intestinal fat would affect their lifespan by performing <italic>vit-1</italic> knock-down.

Namely, HRDE-1 promotes the inheritance of the starvation memory to the next generation, and PRG-1 halts the propagation of an ‘expired’ memory to the grand-progeny. In addition, the P<sub>0</sub> CON of adults of <italic>hrde-1</italic> and <italic>prg-1</italic> mutant strains have significantly increased stored fat compared to wild type, indicating these pathways also seem to play a role in regulating lipid storage in continuously developing animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Therefore, reproduction in <italic>C. elegans</italic> hermaphrodites is sperm-limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Byerly et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Ward and Carrel, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kimble and Ward, 1988</xref>). In previous results, when control and PD<sub>Stv</sub> somatic development was synchronized using vulva morphology, we observed significantly fewer germ cell rows in PD<sub>Stv</sub> larvae compared to control larvae, correlating with fewer sperm available for self-fertilization in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ow et al., 2018</xref>). To determine if DAF-12, TCER-1, and NHR-49 play a direct role in germline proliferation as a mechanism to regulate reproductive plasticity, we counted the number of germ cell rows in control and PD<sub>Stv</sub> mutant larvae that were developmentally synchronized by their somatic morphology. Because <italic>daf-12(rh284)</italic> and <italic>daf-12(rh285)</italic> mutants have altered gonad morphologies that prevent accurate synchronization, we used <italic>daf-36(k114)</italic> to disrupt the steroid signaling pathway.

These results suggest that NHR-49 acts later in development to regulate the PD<sub>Stv</sub> brood size, perhaps by modulating fatty acid metabolism in the intestine to support vitellogenesis in adults. Like NHR-49, TCER-1 plays an intestinal role in upregulating fatty acid metabolism genes in animals lacking germ cells, but also functions redundantly with PUF-8, a member of an evolutionarily conserved stem cell proliferation modulatory family, to potentiate germ cell proliferation in animals undergoing continuous development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Pushpa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amrit et al., 2016</xref>). We found that a mutation in <italic>tcer-1</italic> resulted in a similar number of total germ cell rows in control and PD<sub>Stv</sub> larvae, indicating that TCER-1 plays a role in PD<sub>Stv</sub> reproductive plasticity by regulating germ cell proliferation in addition to its intestinal role (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

Together, these results indicate that DAF-12 and TCER-1 act early in germline development to delay the onset of germ cell proliferation in PD<sub>Stv</sub> animals, while NHR-49 primarily functions later in development to promote the reduced fertility of PD<sub>Stv</sub> adults.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The trade-off between reproduction and longevity has long been associated with the notion that in the absence of reproduction, the fat stores of an animal would be redistributed to promote somatic maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Williams, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kirkwood, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Westendorp and Kirkwood, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Partridge et al., 2005</xref>). As such, reducing or suppressing reproduction in animals often extends lifespan, in part due to enhanced lipogenic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fowler and Partridge, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kenyon, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kenyon, 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Judd et al., 2011</xref>). What remains unclear is how reproduction and somatic maintenance are balanced by developmental signals. In this study, we show reproduction is attenuated in wild-type <italic>C. elegans</italic> that have experienced dauer as a result of early-life starvation. We propose a model whereby steroid signaling, reproductive longevity, and fatty acid metabolic pathways are reprogrammed in animals that experienced starvation-induced dauer in order to delay the onset of germline proliferation and redistribute intestinal fat to developing oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). These changes would allow PD<sub>Stv</sub> adults to delay reproduction until energy thresholds are met to provide adequate levels of nutrition to fewer albeit viable embryos at the expense of somatic survival and maintenance. In <italic>glp-1</italic> mutants that lack a germ line, the fat that would normally be allocated to the progeny is channeled to nurture somatic tissues and, consequently, promote extended longevity. Thus, the mechanisms that prolong lifespan in the absence of a functional germ line are the same cellular programs deployed to respond to developmental signals triggered by early-life starvation in a wild-type animal.</p><p>The extended lifespan associated with animals missing a functional germ line is specifically dependent on the lack of proliferating germ cells and not due to sterility resulting from sperm, oocyte, or meiotic precursor cell deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hsin and Kenyon, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arantes-Oliveira et al., 2002</xref>). Animals without a functional germ line have upregulated fat metabolism pathways and exhibit increased levels of intestinal fat stores that are associated with a longer lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kenyon, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kenyon, 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amrit et al., 2016</xref>). However, a direct correlation between an extended adult lifespan and an increase in intestinal lipid level remains to be elucidated. Our results demonstrated that postdauers with lower somatic fat content also exhibited longer lifespans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B, C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C</xref>), indicating that an increased intestinal fat stores are not required for lifespan extension. Indeed, dietary restriction in animals, whether chronic or intermittent, can promote longevity through multiple different mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kenyon, 2010b</xref>). Although PD<sub>Stv</sub> adults have transcriptional signatures similar to <italic>glp-1</italic> mutants, their phenotype is more similar to <italic>eat-2</italic> mutants, which are a genetic model for chronic dietary restriction due to a pharyngeal pumping defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Avery, 1993</xref>). <italic>Eat-2</italic> mutants have significantly decreased ORO staining and a lifespan increase up to 50% over wild type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lakowski and Hekimi, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Klapper et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, <italic>eat-2</italic> mutants delay reproduction and have a significantly smaller brood size compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crawford et al., 2007</xref>). The lifespan extension of <italic>eat-2</italic> requires TOR inhibition through PHA-4 as well as the activity of SKN-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bishop and Guarente, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Sheaffer et al., 2008</xref>), but the expression of the genes encoding these proteins are unchanged in PD<sub>Stv</sub> adults. However, passage through dauer, a nonfeeding stage, may trigger an independent mechanism of dietary restriction through somatic aging pathways that regulates the PD<sub>Stv</sub> phenotypes.</p><p>The cellular mechanisms that regulate reproduction are intricately connected to lipid metabolism and longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). While a number of genes and cellular components affecting germline proliferation have been extensively investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kimble and Crittenden, 2005</xref>), what might the actual signals communicating the state of proliferating germ cells be that arbitrate lipid levels and the aging process? Here, we argue the signal communicating the state of germ cell proliferation may include dafachronic acids. Dafachronic acids mediating increased longevity are produced in the somatic gonad, which includes the stem cell niche site of the germ line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Yamawaki et al., 2010</xref>). Based on our results, we conclude that DA is required for the delay in germline proliferation in PD<sub>Stv</sub> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), which is consistent with previous data indicating that DA can inhibit germ cell proliferation in adults in a DAF-12 dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mukherjee et al., 2017</xref>). Our data also suggests that DAF-12 may be acting at multiple developmental stages and in different tissue types to regulate PD<sub>Stv</sub> reproduction. Our germ cell row counts indicate that <italic>daf-36</italic> mutant larvae have no significant defects at the onset of germline proliferation that would account for the low brood size observed in control adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). However, <italic>daf-12</italic>, <italic>daf-36</italic>, and <italic>daf-9</italic> mutants have severe gonad defects, including distal tip migration defects, that can impair adult reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antebi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gerisch et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Rottiers et al., 2006</xref>). Our brood size data alone is consistent with the hypothesis that the gonad defects may be partially rescued after passage through dauer resulting in an increased brood size compared to controls, or that DA and DAF-12 are not required to regulate postdauer brood size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, we demonstrated that the <italic>daf-12 rh284</italic> and <italic>rh285</italic> alleles can mask the phenotype of reproductive longevity pathway mutants, indicating that DAF-12, but not DA, is required for the PD<sub>Stv</sub> brood size phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). One possible mechanism of how DAF-12 activity contributes to the reproductive plasticity in PD<sub>Stv</sub> adults through its regulation of vitellogenesis. We showed that the levels of stored lipids in <italic>daf-12</italic> embryos were higher than that observed in embryos of either control or PD<sub>Stv</sub> wild-type adults and was independent of the levels of intestinal lipid storage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Interestingly, the connections between steroid hormone signaling, vitellogenesis, and fertility are well documented in various fish species (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">King et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Wu et al., 2021</xref>), and exposing <italic>C. elegans</italic> to exogenous cholesterol, the precursor for DA, has been shown to increase expression of vitellogenesis genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Novillo et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, we are currently investigating the mechanisms of how DAF-12 and DA regulate lipid homeostasis and vitellogenesis to modulate reproduction in PD<sub>Stv</sub> animals. Taken together, our data are consistent with a model where DA and DAF-12 signaling act tissue specifically to regulate germline proliferation and vitellogenesis based on the life history of the animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>An intriguing finding of our study is that the parental starvation memory of PD<sub>Stv</sub> adults was bequeathed to the F<sub>1</sub> progeny in a HRDE-1 dependent manner, triggering elevated levels of fat stores, presumably as a physiological defense against future famine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the wild-type grand-progenies, PRG-1 is required for the increase in fat stores to be reset to control levels of the same generation. One potential explanation is that small RNA signals are transmitted to subsequent generations via the HRDE-1 and/or PRG-1 RNAi pathways to effect somatic phenotypes. However, with the exception of DAF-16, none of the germline longevity pathway genes or the vitellogenesis genes examined in this study were categorized as direct HRDE-1 targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buckley et al., 2012</xref>). Given that the life stage (adulthood) at which the HRDE-1 targets were identified is the same life stage that was used in this study, we speculate that HRDE-1 may be indirectly targeting endocrine and vitellogenins genes by: (1) targeting germ line genes that then affect somatic gene expression or (2) indirectly regulating the function of the endocrine and vitellogenin genes by targeting a different repertoire of somatic targets. Interestingly, we find that 62% of small RNAs associated with HRDE-1 target genes (984 out of 1587) are expressed in somatic tissues, such as neurons, intestine, hypodermis, and muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ortiz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kaletsky et al., 2018</xref>). Accordingly, HRDE-1 is known to contribute to the heritability of a cohort of small RNAs targeting nutrition and lipid transporter genes that was inherited for at least three generations from populations that experienced L1 larval arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Rechavi et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, HRDE-1 is required for the repression of a group of genes activated upon multi-generational high-temperature stress that is inherited for at least two generations in the absence of the stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ni et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, PRG-1 has been reported to function in somatic tissue by repressing <italic>C. elegans</italic> axonal regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Shen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim et al., 2018</xref>), and reports from <italic>Drosophila</italic>, mollusks, and mammals have shown that piRNAs are expressed in the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Rajasethupathy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Perrat et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Nandi et al., 2016</xref>). Recently, PRG-1 was shown to potentiate the transgenerational inheritance of learned avoidance to the pathogenic PA14 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> bacteria for multiple generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Moore et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, it is likely that HRDE-1 and PRG-1 RNAi pathways may serve as signaling referees between the soma and the germ line to effect changes due to environmental and developmental signals to perdure ancestral starvation memory.</p><p>Our study shows that PD<sub>Stv</sub> adults have upregulated expression of lipid metabolism genes as a means to load embryos with increased fat and potentially protect progeny against the consequences of future food scarcity. During the course of its natural history, <italic>C. elegans</italic> occupies ephemeral environments such as rotting fruit or decomposing vegetation, where conditions and food availability are highly unpredictable. The dauer larva affords <italic>C. elegans</italic> a survival and dispersal strategy to escape harsh environmental conditions by often associating with passing invertebrate carriers. Once a food source is found, dauers resume reproductive development to colonize the new habitat. Upon exhaustion of resources and population expansion, young larvae enter dauer and thereby repeating the ‘boom and bust’ life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Schulenburg and Félix, 2017</xref>). Because of frequent environmental perturbations, an adopted phenotypic plasticity strategy would ensure an advantage in species survival. The generation following a bust period would inherit the cellular programs for increased somatic lipid stores. It is thus remarkable that the cellular mechanisms to ensure survival of the species are fundamentally similar between humans and nematodes, two species that have diverged hundreds of millions of years ago, once again underscoring the relevance of a simple roundworm in understanding basic animal physiology.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (include species here)</td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>)</td><td>N2</td><td>Caenorhabditis Genetics Center</td><td>Wild type</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>)</td><td>AA82</td><td>Caenorhabditis Genetics Center</td><td><italic>daf-12(rh284) X</italic></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>)</td><td>AA85</td><td>Caenorhabditis Genetics Center</td><td><italic>daf-12(rh285) X</italic></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>)</td><td>AA292</td><td>Caenorhabditis Genetics Center</td><td><italic>daf-36(k114) V</italic></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>)</td><td>AA1052</td><td>Adam Antebi, Max Planck Institute</td><td><italic>dhs-16(tm1890) V</italic></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>)</td><td>AE501</td><td>Caenorhabditis Genetics Center</td><td><italic>nhr-8(ok186) IV</italic></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>)</td><td>BS1080</td><td>Tim Schedl, Washington University</td><td><italic>gld-1::gfp::3xflag</italic></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>)</td><td>BX26</td><td>Caenorhabditis Genetics Center</td><td><italic>fat-2(wa17) IV</italic></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>)</td><td>BX106</td><td>Caenorhabditis Genetics Center</td><td><italic>fat-6(tm331) IV</italic></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>)</td><td>BX107</td><td>Caenorhabditis Genetics Center</td><td><italic>fat-5(tm420) V</italic></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>)</td><td>BX110</td><td>Caenorhabditis Genetics Center</td><td><italic>fat-6(tm331) IV;

Control and starvation-induced postdauer animals were obtain in a similar manner as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ow et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, to gather PD<sub>Stv</sub> animals, well-fed worms grown on seeded NGM plates and monitored until the bacteria food was depleted and dauers were visible (about 1 week). Dauers were selected with 1% SDS, followed by recovery by feeding on seeded NGM plates. One-day-old PD<sub>Stv</sub> adults were collected on day two following recovery (first day of adulthood). Control adults were obtained by collecting embryos from hypochlorite-treated well-fed gravid adults that did not experience dauer. Embryos were grown on seeded NGM plates until the first day of adulthood.

Cultures were pelleted and washed several times with M9 buffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Stiernagle, 2006</xref>) and resuspended at a 10x concentration. The 10x OP50 was seeded onto peptone-less NGM plates and allowed to dry overnight before use.

Age matched one-day-old adults were washed from 60 mm seeded NGM plates with 1x PBS pH 7.4 and rinsed 3–4 times until they were cleared of bacteria. Worms were permeabilized in 1x PBS pH 7.4 with an equal volume of 2x MRWB buffer (160 mM KCl, 40 mM NaCl, 14 mM Na<sub>2</sub>EGTA, 1 mM spermidine-HCl, 0.4 mM spermine, 30 mM PIPES pH 7.4, 0.2% β-mercaptoethanol) and supplemented with 2% paraformaldehyde. Samples were rocked for 1 hr at room temperature. Following fixation, worm samples were washed with 1x PBS pH 7.4, resuspended in 60% isopropanol, and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. An ORO stock solution (prepared beforehand as a 0.5 g/100 mL in isopropanol and equilibrated for several days) was diluted to 60% with dH<sub>2</sub>O and rocked for at least one day to be used as the working stock. The ORO working stock was filtered through a 0.22 or 0.45 μm filter immediately before use. Fixed worms were incubated in filtered ORO working stock and rocked overnight at room temperature. Next day, worm samples were allowed to settle and the ORO stain was removed. Worm pellets were washed once with 1x PBS pH 7.4 and resuspended in 200 μL of 1x PBS with 0.01% Triton X-100. Aliquots of worm samples were mounted onto microscope glass slides and imaged. Quantification of embryo ORO staining was done by singling out individual embryos in utero from one-day-old adults. Images were captured with a Nikon Eclipse Ci with Spot 5.2 software, an iPhone through iDu Optics equipped with a LabCam adapter (New York, NY), or with a Leica DM5500 B microscope with the LAS X Core Workstation fitted with a MC170 Color HD camera. All images from parallel experiments were captured using the same microscope platform. Color images were separated into their RGB channel components and the intensity of staining in the anterior intestine was measured on the green channel as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Yen et al., 2010</xref>) using ImageJ (NIH). Because the unstained pharynx immediately above the anterior intestine was used as the ORO staining subtraction background, negative ORO staining values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6A</xref>) are a result of a high background in specific worm samples.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Fatty acid analysis</title><p>To obtain control animals, small agar chunks (approximately 1 cm x 1 cm) from a well-fed mixed population of worms grown on NGM plates at 20°C were transferred to 100 mm NGM plates freshly seeded with 10x concentrated OP50 (10x NGM plates). After 3 days of propagation, embryos were harvested by standard methods using sodium hypochlorite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Stiernagle, 2006</xref>) and transferred to 10x NGM plates. One-day-old adults were collected three days later and washed with Milli-Q water until the supernatant was clear. Excess water was removed by centrifugation (3000 rpm for 30 s) and worm pellets (0.25 to 1.09 g) were flash frozen in a dry ice and ethanol slurry and stored at −80°C until analysis. To obtain postdauer animals, agar chunks from worms grown in a similar manner as control animals were transferred to 10x NGM plates and incubated for 2 weeks at 20°C for starvation-induced dauer formation. Starved worms were collected with Milli-Q water and dauers were selected by treatment with 1% SDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Stiernagle, 2006</xref>). Dauers were transferred to 10x NGM plates and fed for 2 days. Postdauer one-day-old adults were harvested with Milli-Q water and washed until the supernatant was cleared. Excess water was removed by centrifugation and worm pellets (0.86 to 1.35 grams) were flash frozen and stored at −80°C until analysis. Total fatty acids were quantitatively measured by Creative Proteomics (Shirley, NY) using gas chromatography (GC) with flame ionization detection as follows: to extract fatty acids, worm samples were weighed into a screw-cap glass vial containing tritricosanoin as an internal standard (tri-C23:0 TG) (NuCheck Prep, Elysian, MN). Samples were homogenized and extracted with a modified Folch extraction. A portion of the organic layer was transferred to a screw-cap glass vial and dried in a speed vac. After samples were dried, BTM (methanol containing 14% boron trifluoride, toluene, methanol; 35:30:35 v/v/v) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was added. The vial was vortexed briefly and heated in a hot bath at 100°C for 45 min. Following cooling, hexane (EMD Chemicals, USA) and HPLC grade water were added, tubes were recapped, vortexed, and centrifuged to help in the separation of layers. An aliquot of the hexane layer was transferred to a GC vial. GC was performed using a GC-2010 Gas Chromatograph (Shimadzu Corporation, Columbia, MD) equipped with a SP-2560, 100 m fused silica capillary column (0.25 mm internal diameter, 0.2 μm film thickness; Supelco, Bellefonte, PA). Fatty acids were identified by comparison with a standard mixture of fatty acids (GLC OQ-A, NuCheck Prep), which was also used to determine the individual fatty acid calibration curves. Fatty acid composition was expressed as a percent of total identified fatty acids and concentrations as µg/mg of worms.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>RNA interference</title><p>Gravid adults were treated with hypochlorite to obtain embryos using standard methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Stiernagle, 2006</xref>).

Worm survival was assessed every two days and was deemed dead if no movement was detected after gentle prodding with a worm pick. Animals that crawled to the side of the assay plate and died due to desiccation were censored from the experiment. To obtain F<sub>1</sub> animals, 2–3 P<sub>0</sub> L4 larva were placed onto one seeded 60 mm NGM plate lacking FUDR and grown at 20°C. Next day, following P<sub>0</sub> egg playing, the parents were removed and their F<sub>1</sub> progeny allowed to grow at 20°C until they reached the L4 larval stage. Ten L4 F1 larvae were placed onto each of 3–4 OP50-seeded 60 mm NGM plates supplemented with FUDR. F<sub>1</sub> worm lifespan was assessed in the same manner as the parental generation.

exhibit gene expression and reproductive phenotypes that reflect their environmental and developmental history. In adults that experienced starvation-induced dauer formation (PD<sub>Stv</sub>), we showed that gene expression changes of somatically-expressed seesaw genes and their characteristic reduced brood size relative to control adults (CON) required a functional <italic>glp-4</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ow et al., 2018</xref>).

One possible explanation is that cultivation conditions of the P<sub>0</sub> and the F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>2</sub> populations differed: P<sub>0</sub> animals were obtained from a mixed population consisting of all life stages (embryos to adults), while the composition of the F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>2</sub> populations were more synchronous. Previous work has reported that population density affects the progression of worm development due to the type of chemical signals, such as ascarosides, extruded into the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ludewig et al., 2017</xref>). Pheromones are secreted throughout worm development; thus, we hypothesize a pheromone-dependent mechanism regulating worm physiology based on cultivation conditions may account for the differences in control population. We should emphasize that a statistically significant lower postdauer fecundity is observed regardless of whether the P<sub>0</sub> animals were chosen from a mixed population culture or from a homogenous staged population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).

We recognize that is an exciting and emerging area of research and that this current study provides key insights into how early starvation-induced memory affects fat storage and fecundity in adults, reveals the steroid signaling pathways and molecules involved, and how the starvation memory is transmitted to progeny in a germline nuclear RNAi-dependent manner. The reviewers and I agree that the experiments were well executed and the conclusions well supported.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Somatic aging pathways regulate reproductive plasticity in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by John Kim as the Reviewing Editor and Kathryn Cheah as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Victor Ambros (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>All three reviewers and the editors think that, in principle, this manuscript is suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. It nicely builds on your previous work to provide novel insights into the role of steroid hormone signaling in the differences in fecundity and lipid storage for animals that experience early life stresses compared to those that do not. In addition, the study addresses how such signals may be transmitted to the next generation, resulting in phenotypes such as increased fat storage. However, there was also strong consensus that several critical revisions must be carried out before it is acceptable for publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>After consultation, the three reviewers and I agree that the three critical points raised by Reviewer #2 must be addressed. In addition, reviewer #1 and #3 both had significant issues with the MUFA/OA experiments in terms of both presentation and interpretation and agreed that two fairly simple experiments would help clarify the conclusions of the results. While we hope that you will consider all of their comments, I have summarized below the 4 major revisions that we would like you to address:</p><p>1. The interpretation of the fecundity data: Reviewer #2 poses an alternative, and possibly more parsimonious, interpretation of the fecundity data. If you agree, please consider rewriting this section, or at least incorporating this plausible alternative interpretation of the fecundity data (and better presenting the data so that they don't exaggerate or mislead the effects due to small numbers as noted by Reviewer #3).</p><p>2. We ask that you consider some simple genetic analysis to test whether the fecundity defects are due to limiting sperm as you hypothesize. These experiments would directly provide empirical support for this hypothesis.</p><p>3. The F1 phenotypes such as increased lipid storage are very interesting and suggests that such metabolic reprogramming may confer the F1s a physiological advantage. Therefore, it would be informative to show some physiological consequence of the inherited F1 phenotype such as its impact on fecundity and longevity.</p><p>4. Reviewers #1 and #3 found the MUFA/OA experiments quite confusing and contradictory. Please address their concerns with text revisions plus some simple experiments that Reviewer #1 suggests – i.e. measuring MUFAs/OA in control and PDStv adults and seeing if exogenous OA addition rescues the reduced fecundity phenotypes of the fat-5/6/7 double mutants.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors have published multiple papers on the topic of post-dauer phenotypic plasticity in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. They previously showed that post-dauer adults have distinct gene expression profiles that are dependent upon the nature of the dauer-inducing stressor and correlated with opposing brood size phenotypes. Here they report studies designed to reveal the molecular basis for the reduced fecundity phenotype observed in wild-type adults that traversed dauer due to starvation during early larval development (referred to as PDStv). They show that many of the same molecules and pathways that mediate germline-ablation-induced longevity (DA/DAF-12 signaling, TCER-1, and lipid metabolism genes) are also required for reduced fecundity in PDStv adults. Oil Red O staining reveals that PDStv adults have reduced intestinal fat stores concomitant with increased embryo fat staining. This reapportioning of fat stores requires DAF-12 and vitellogenins. Delayed gametogenesis, which is associated with the reduced fecundity of PDStv adults, is also mediated by DA and TCER-1. Finally, they show that PDStv adults give rise to F1 progeny with increased intestinal fat stores compared to F1 progeny of control animals that did not traverse dauer, and this transgenerational phenotype requires HRDE-1.</p><p>Overall the experiments are well-executed, and the data are convincing. In addition, the authors have done well to identify several genes that participate in post-dauer reproductive plasticity. However, in my opinion the study does not yield much mechanistic insight into this process. Moreover, there is one aspect of the data that seems contradictory to me and needs to be either resolved experimentally or explained more clearly.</p><p>1. Figure 1: since DHS-16 also participates in DA biosynthesis (Wollam et al. PLOS Biology 2012), a dhs-16 mutant should also be tested here. Since DHS-16 is required for delta-7-DA biosynthesis but not delta-1,7-DA biosynthesis, this result could help pinpoint the specific DA involved in this process.</p><p>2. Lines 265-286: I may be missing something, but I am confused about the role of MUFAs/OA in the reduced fecundity phenotype of PDStv adults. In lines 265-266, it is stated that &quot;…MUFAs are required for the decreased fertility phenotype…&quot; This is consistent with the observation that double-mutant combinations of fat-5/6/7 alleles suppress the phenotype (Figure 3D). However, based on the OA supplementation experiment (Figure 3E), the authors conclude in lines 280-281 that &quot;…OA is a limiting factor for reproduction after passage through the starvation-induced dauer stage…&quot; Is there an optimal concentration of MUFAs and/or OA that inhibits fecundity? Measuring MUFAs/OA in control and PDStv adults would help to resolve this question.</p><p>3. Related to the above point, does exogenous OA supplementation rescue the reduced fecundity phenotype in fat-5/6/7 double mutants?</p><p>4. Does vit-1 RNAi affect the brood size of PDStv adults?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Ow et all report findings that build upon their previous work (Ow et al. 2018), where they had shown that <italic>C. elegans</italic> adults that had developed through the alternative L3 larval stage, the dauerlarva, displayed altered fecundity and altered gene expression programs compared to control animals that had not undergone the dauer larva stage (ie had developed continuously from egg to adult). Moreover, in that previous paper, the authors reported that the phenotype of postdauer adults, including the aspects of their transcriptional program, depended on the particular stress used to induce dauer larva entry – high pheromone vs starvation – during the pre-dauer larval development. This current study builds upon those previous findings to explore the mechanisms whereby starvation-induced dauer larva arrest, followed by post-dauer L3 and L4 development, can affect the physiology of the worm and its progeny.</p><p>The authors report here that steroid hormone signaling is involved in the differences in fecundity and fat storage in postdauer adults compared to control (non-dauer) adults. They also report that the effects of starvation-induced dauer larva development can be transmitted to the next generation to affect fat storage in the progeny. The authors emphasize that these effects of life history on reproductive capacity and lipid metabolism are associated with the same steroid signaling pathways that affect longevity in response to reproductive stress, and suggest that, &quot;.…ancestral starvation memory is inherited and may be the result of crosstalk between somatic and reproductive tissues mediated by the germline nuclear RNAi pathway.&quot; These findings are interesting, particularly the epigenetic programming of apparently adaptive metabolic physiology in progeny, dependent on the life history of the parent.</p><p>The findings of the paper, broadly speaking, are reasonably well supported by the data, in that life history dependent alterations in fecundity and lipid metabolism are well documented, and the transmission of phenotype to the F1 is also well supported by the data. The effects of mutations in steroid hormone signaling and RNAi mutants are also well demonstrated. So, the essential findings of the paper are robust, and their implications are undoubtedly important in terms of advancing understanding of adaptive interplay between development and physiology.</p><p>However, there are some significant concerns that should be addressed:</p><p>1) Alternative interpretations of certain important findings were not considered.</p><p>These concerns have to do with the conclusions summarized in Line 29: &quot;.… steroid hormone signaling promotes fat reallocation in postdauer adults…&quot; and Line-109: &quot;Dafachronic acid-dependent DAF-12 signaling is required for decreased fecundity after starvation-induced dauer formation&quot;.</p><p>The above conclusions are derived chiefly from the data in Figures 1 and 4. In Figure 1, it is apparent that daf-9(rh50) and daf-36(k114) mutants that had traversed the starvation-induced dauer larva exhibited a significant increase in brood size compared to animals of the same genotypes that had not experienced starvation (or dauer larva arrest). This is an exceedingly interesting finding, since these mutants seem to be behaving opposite to the wild-type in this regard; wild type post dauer animals have a reduced brood size compared to controls. The authors' interpretation of this finding – that steroid hormone signaling causes the reduced fecundity in wild type postdauer adults – is a bit skewed towards one point of view at the expense of an alternative (and arguably more valid) interpretation. The alternative view comes from considering the raw data in the dataset supporting Figure 1 (83372_0_data_set_1656224_q6n6fh.xlsx). In the dataset, it is apparent that the brood sizes of daf-12(lf) daf-9(lf) and daf-36(lf) non-dauer controls are much lower than wild type non-dauer controls. So, it appears that steroid hormone signaling is somehow required for full fecundity in non-dauer adults. Strikingly, the brood size defects of these mutants are essentially suppressed in postdauer animals (see 83372_0_data_set_1656224_q6n6fh.xlsx). Therefore, these results could be interpreted to mean that daf-12, daf-9, and daf-36 are actually more critical for full brood size during continuous development than they are during postdauer development. In other words, one could say that &quot;… daf-12 signaling is required for full fecundity during continuous development, and is relatively dispensable during postdauer development.&quot; Similarly, Figure 4 shows that postdauer daf-12 mutants are suppressed for the reduced fat storage that these mutants display when developed continuously (without starvation or dauer arrest). Indeed, fat levels in postdauer daf-12 mutants appear to be restored to essentially the same levels as exhibited by postdauer wild type adults. This finding can be interpreted to suggest that daf-12 is not required for normal fat metabolism in postdauer animals (or at least daf-12 is less critical for fat storage in postdauer adults than in non-dauer adults). Note that this way of framing the conclusions from these data is the opposite to how the authors state their conclusions (that daf-12 regulates fat storage and fecundity of postdauer adults).</p><p>2) An instance where an additional experiment could have provided critical tests of otherwise relatively speculative interpretations.</p><p>In this paper, following on from initial findings reported in Ow et al. 2018, the authors explore the phenomenon wherein postdauer animals can have altered numbers of germ cells at defined stages of larval development, suggesting differences in the timing of key steps in germline proliferation. The authors suggest that this altered germline proliferation program could affect brood size by altering the number of sperm available for self-fertilization. This is a very interesting hypothesis, that was unfortunately not tested directly by crossing the postdauer hermaphrodites to males to determine if sperm are indeed limiting.</p><p>3) Another instance where an additional experiment could have provided critical tests of otherwise relatively speculative interpretations.</p><p>Another very interesting observation reported here is that the F1 progeny of postdauer adults, on average have more stored fat than F1 progeny of continuously-developed adults. This is the reverse of the P0 situation, where postdauer adults have less stored fat than controls (Figure 6). This inversion between P0s and F1s is absent in hrde-1 or prg-1 mutations, which are defective in RNAi inheritance. These data support the conclusion that small RNA mediated gene silencing could mediate the reprogramming of progeny physiology. What is missing is a demonstration of whether or not the reprogrammed F1 animals manifest any consequences from the reprogramming. In particular, Does the increased lipid storage in F1 animals confer upon them an altered fecundity and/or longevity?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Ow et al. seek to further elucidate the pathways involved in limiting reproductive output (brood size) after early life stress in the form of starvation-induced dauer in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Using genetic analysis, they dissected several relevant pathways, including steroid signaling and fat metabolism, that may play a role in limiting brood size in post-dauer adults after starvation (PDst adults). They also examined the accumulation of fat by Oil Red O staining. They found that in the parental generation, fat levels decreased in the intestine of PDst adults. Interestingly, progeny in the F1 generation exhibited an increase in fat levels compared to WT counterparts, and this elevation was reversed by the F2 generation. This intergenerational phenomenon is dependent on germline RNAi factors that have previously been demonstrated to mediate transgenerational inheritance. Overall, the authors tackled an interesting and novel biological question using a system well established and pioneered by their lab. However, the data presented are somewhat disjointed, and at times seemingly contradict each other. Parts of the paper is difficult to follow and the conclusions are unclear.</p><p>1. In general, many of the strongest effects on brood size from the genetic analysis (Figures 1-2) are occurring in strains with very small brood sizes to begin with. Thus, plotting the data as log2 fold change normalized between PDst adults and control risks visually exaggerating the effects and misleading the reader. Although the raw data are included and the reader can find out the extreme differences in brood sizes of the mutant strains (for example, daf-12 mutants), the lack of comments / discussion by the authors made the fold change figure misleading. The authors should consider plotting the brood size data (instead of just the fold change), so this difference can be easier to visualize. Although this does not necessarily negate the effects claimed by the authors, the authors need to clearly indicate that some of the strains have greatly reduced brood sizes when cultured under normal condition. Due to this caveat, the genetic interpretation is also unclear. One could argue that the transient dauer arrest somehow reverses the brood size defects of the mutants, rather than that the mutation suppresses the mild reduction on brood size caused by dauer arrest.</p><p>2. Similar to comment 1, the authors do not address why PDst should increase the brood size of the mutant strains. It would be logical that if a factor, like DAF-12, was required for the decrease in fertility of PDst adults that in this mutant strain there be no change in brood size after PDst, however in many cases the authors are actually seeing an increase in brood size rather than no change. Is this likely to be an artifact of the low brood size that these strains have under normal condition? It is interesting that the authors previously observed an increase in brood size in post-dauer adults forced into dauer by crowding, but this point is not discussed. Either way, the authors should discuss their interpretation of the brood size increase in PDst adult mutant strains in the text.</p><p>3. It would be interesting to investigate if there is any interaction between steroid signaling, TCER-1 and KRI-1 in regulating the low fecundity phenotype. That would help make the manuscript more coherent and easier to follow. In its current state, the earlier findings are not well-connected with the latter findings.</p><p>4. DAF-16 plays a critical role in regulating stress-mediated phenotypes. In fig-2B, the authors investigated the brood size of a strain that constitutively localizes DAF-16 in the nucleus. It would be helpful to include the brood size of daf-16(-) worms in PDstv/CONsv to definitely rule out the possibility of DAF-16 involvement.</p><p>5. At the beginning of the result section, in lines 111-117, the authors discuss the changes in gene expression that are shared between PDst adults and glp-1 germliness mutants, however they do not show the results of the comparison. Although the RNA-seq experiments were from a previous paper from the lab, the authors should still show the comparison results to convince readers that the similarities between PDst adults and glp-1 warrant investigation. For example, they could show a gene ontology analysis to highlight the pathways that are in common, or show Venn diagrams indicating significant overlap. Without the comparison data, it is difficult for the reader to assess how similar PDst adults and glp-1 pathways really are.</p><p>6. The genetic data in Figure 3 was especially difficult to interpret, and the authors need to develop the discussion of this figure more thoroughly. Data shown in Figure 3A suggests that none of the factors (with the exception of sbp-1) show a robust suppression of the PDst fertility phenotype. This is also confusing because the authors include several different alleles of nhr-49 mutants, and see effects in some, but not all of the mutants. Moreover, some mutants are gain-of-function and some loss-of-function, but the authors have not explained why they would expect to see the same phenotype in both GOF and LOF alleles, so overall the results are difficult to interpret. The data become more convincing moving onto Figure 3C. Nevertheless, the authors need a more thorough discussion and consider the inconsistency in their data and interpret the results accordingly.</p><p>7. For Figure 3E, the authors state their hypothesis in the text (around line 274) that oleic acid (OA) supplementation should further decrease the brood size after PDst since they just found in Figure 3D that the loss of fat metabolism genes (that produce OA) could rescue the decreased brood size phenotype in PDst adults. This hypothesis is logical from their data, however the authors see the opposite of this result since all strains show an increase in brood size in Figure 3E when on OA. Of course surprising results occur, but the authors do not attempt to reconcile the discrepancy between their hypothesis and the results, leaving the reader very confused. They conclude that OA may be a limiting factor for PDst reproduction, but this is in contrast to their previous conclusion that reducing factors that produce OA with genetic mutants (hence limiting OA) would be beneficial to PDst reproduction. This discussion needs to be clarified. Additionally, the authors do not show the effect of OA on WT worms not exposed to PDst, which could be an important control and perhaps help the authors explain some of their contradictory findings.</p><p>8. Following comment 7, it might be helpful to determine whether induction of the fat genes indeed result in changes in MUFAs.</p><p>9. The authors show that PDstv adults have increased lipid storage in embryos, even in fat-6(-); fat-7(-) mutants. Do the authors consider increased lipid storage in embryos to be a general phenomenon of low lipid storage mutants?</p><p>10. It may be interesting to check the expression of the desaturases in daf-12(-), tcer-1(-) and kri-1(-) worms to tie in the role of these desaturases in regulating low fecundity phenotype. This will also help to connect the earlier results with the fat phenotype.</p><p>11. The authors observed that depletion of VIT-1 resulted in significantly increased intestinal fat deposit (Figure 4C and 4D). Since vitellogenins are known to carry fat from the intestine to the developing oocytes, its depletion would be expected to stop the transfer of fat from the intestine to the oocytes, which could result in increased intestinal fat. The authors should consider including this interpretation in the text.</p><p>12. The authors suggested that germ cell numbers in daf-12(-) and tcer-1(-) could be connected to their brood sizes in postdauer worms. However, since the difference in germ cell numbers appears to be very small, and the change in brood size appears to be very large. Authors should comment on that.</p><p>13. Lastly, the paper at its current state does not read like a coherent paper, but rather it reads like two separate sections.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61459.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] Overall the experiments are well-executed, and the data are convincing.

At the least, this observation suggests that DAF-12 plays a role in regulating vitellogenesis.</p><p>– Finally, the <italic>daf-12; tcer-1</italic> and <italic>daf-12; kri-1</italic> double mutants exhibit or exacerbate the <italic>daf-12</italic> phenotype alone. This observation suggests that the DAF-12 activity, independent of DA, is contributing to the postdauer brood size phenotype. We have not yet examined if this is also the case for lipid storage.</p><p>Together, these data suggest that DAF-12 is playing a role, both DA-dependently and DA-independently, at different developmental timepoints to regulate PD<sub>Stv</sub> phenotypes. We have modified the manuscript text to present both interpretations of our data in the Results section and included an argument for DAF-12 involvement in the Discussion section. We are further investigating the potential roles of DAF-12 in lipid metabolism and brood size regulation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> adults.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) An instance where an additional experiment could have provided critical tests of otherwise relatively speculative interpretations.</p><p>In this paper, following on from initial findings reported in Ow et al. 2018, the authors explore the phenomenon wherein postdauer animals can have altered numbers of germ cells at defined stages of larval development, suggesting differences in the timing of key steps in germline proliferation. The authors suggest that this altered germline proliferation program could affect brood size by altering the number of sperm available for self-fertilization. This is a very interesting hypothesis, that was unfortunately not tested directly by crossing the postdauer hermaphrodites to males to determine if sperm are indeed limiting.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed the experiment where CON and PD<sub>Stv</sub> hermaphrodites were mated to control males and the number of progeny was counted. We found that the brood sizes of mated CON and PD<sub>Stv</sub> hermaphrodites were statistically similar (see Appendix 1-figure 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Another instance where an additional experiment could have provided critical tests of otherwise relatively speculative interpretations.</p><p>Another very interesting observation reported here is that the F1 progeny of postdauer adults, on average have more stored fat than F1 progeny of continuously-developed adults. This is the reverse of the P0 situation, where postdauer adults have less stored fat than controls (Figure 6). This inversion between P0s and F1s is absent in hrde-1 or prg-1 mutations, which are defective in RNAi inheritance. These data support the conclusion that small RNA mediated gene silencing could mediate the reprogramming of progeny physiology. What is missing is a demonstration of whether or not the reprogrammed F1 animals manifest any consequences from the reprogramming. In particular, Does the increased lipid storage in F1 animals confer upon them an altered fecundity and/or longevity?</p></disp-quote><p>We measured the longevity of CON and PD<sub>Stv</sub> P<sub>0</sub> and F<sub>1</sub> populations. Interestingly, we found that PD<sub>Stv</sub> adults have significantly increased longevity compared to CON adults, similar to what we observed for pheromone-induced postdauers (Hall et al. 2010). However, the increased longevity of postdauer adults was not inherited in the F<sub>1</sub> progeny (see Figure 5C). Similarly, we tested whether the increased lipid storage in F<sub>1</sub> progeny of PD<sub>Stv</sub> adults altered their brood size, but the F<sub>1</sub> of CON and PD<sub>Stv</sub> adults had statistically similar brood sizes (Figure 5—figure supplement 3). We are continuing to examine whether the increased lipid storage in PD<sub>Stv</sub> F<sub>1</sub> progeny conveys a physiological advantage over CON progeny.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] Overall, the authors tackled an interesting and novel biological question using a system well established and pioneered by their lab. However, the data presented are somewhat disjointed, and at times seemingly contradict each other. Parts of the paper is difficult to follow and the conclusions are unclear.</p><p>1. In general, many of the strongest effects on brood size from the genetic analysis (Figures 1-2) are occurring in strains with very small brood sizes to begin with. Thus, plotting the data as log2 fold change normalized between PDst adults and control risks visually exaggerating the effects and misleading the reader. Although the raw data are included and the reader can find out the extreme differences in brood sizes of the mutant strains (for example, daf-12 mutants), the lack of comments / discussion by the authors made the fold change figure misleading. The authors should consider plotting the brood size data (instead of just the fold change), so this difference can be easier to visualize. Although this does not necessarily negate the effects claimed by the authors, the authors need to clearly indicate that some of the strains have greatly reduced brood sizes when cultured under normal condition. Due to this caveat, the genetic interpretation is also unclear. One could argue that the transient dauer arrest somehow reverses the brood size defects of the mutants, rather than that the mutation suppresses the mild reduction on brood size caused by dauer arrest.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to reassure the reviewer that our intention to present the data as log2 fold change between PD and CON adults was not to mislead the reader, but rather was an attempt to simplify the comparison of brood sizes within a strain. As suggested, we have remade all the figures using scatterplots representing brood size data to include both CON and PD<sub>Stv</sub> data, and we used an ANOVA with <italic>post hoc</italic> test for multiple comparisons for statistical analysis. We have also included text describing the increase in brood size in <italic>daf-12</italic> PD<sub>Stv</sub> adults. Please see the response to Reviewer #2, comment #1 for more details.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Similar to comment 1, the authors do not address why PDst should increase the brood size of the mutant strains. It would be logical that if a factor, like DAF-12, was required for the decrease in fertility of PDst adults that in this mutant strain there be no change in brood size after PDst, however in many cases the authors are actually seeing an increase in brood size rather than no change. Is this likely to be an artifact of the low brood size that these strains have under normal condition? It is interesting that the authors previously observed an increase in brood size in post-dauer adults forced into dauer by crowding, but this point is not discussed. Either way, the authors should discuss their interpretation of the brood size increase in PDst adult mutant strains in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited the text to include a comment regarding the similarity of increased postdauer brood size between pheromone-induced postdauer adults and some of the mutant strains examined.

It would be interesting to investigate if there is any interaction between steroid signaling, TCER-1 and KRI-1 in regulating the low fecundity phenotype. That would help make the manuscript more coherent and easier to follow. In its current state, the earlier findings are not well-connected with the latter findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We had previously included the brood sizes of <italic>daf-12; tcer-1</italic> and <italic>daf-12; kri-1</italic> double mutants in Figure 1—figure supplement 1B, with a discussion of this experiment in the Appendix 1. We found that the brood sizes of these strains mimicked or exacerbated the <italic>daf-12</italic> alone brood size, suggesting that <italic>daf-12</italic> is acting in parallel or downstream of the reproductive longevity pathway. We argue that <italic>daf-12</italic> is acting downstream of <italic>tcer-1</italic> and <italic>kri-1</italic> (see Appendix 1). We have now included a statement of this experiment in the main manuscript text to bring it to the readers attention.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. DAF-16 plays a critical role in regulating stress-mediated phenotypes. In fig-2B, the authors investigated the brood size of a strain that constitutively localizes DAF-16 in the nucleus. It would be helpful to include the brood size of daf-16(-) worms in PDstv/CONsv to definitely rule out the possibility of DAF-16 involvement.</p></disp-quote><p><italic>Daf-16</italic> mutants are dauer defective.

At the beginning of the result section, in lines 111-117, the authors discuss the changes in gene expression that are shared between PDst adults and glp-1 germliness mutants, however they do not show the results of the comparison. Although the RNA-seq experiments were from a previous paper from the lab, the authors should still show the comparison results to convince readers that the similarities between PDst adults and glp-1 warrant investigation. For example, they could show a gene ontology analysis to highlight the pathways that are in common, or show Venn diagrams indicating significant overlap. Without the comparison data, it is difficult for the reader to assess how similar PDst adults and glp-1 pathways really are.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not perform a systematic analysis of PD<sub>Stv</sub> RNA-Seq data with <italic>glp-1</italic> RNA-Seq data. However, <italic>glp-1</italic> animals have multiple characteristic gene expression signatures that have been shown to contribute to its longevity phenotype. We curated this list of gene expression changes from the literature for qualitative comparison with the gene expression changes observed in our PD<sub>Stv</sub> RNA-Seq data. The list of genes with notable gene expression changes comparable to <italic>glp-1</italic> is found in Supplementary file 1. We have also performed a comparison of gene expression changes in PD<sub>Stv</sub> with DAF-16, PQM-1, and TCER-1 targets, which can be found in Figure 2—figure supplement 1-Source Data 1 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1-Source Data 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The genetic data in Figure 3 was especially difficult to interpret, and the authors need to develop the discussion of this figure more thoroughly. Data shown in Figure 3A suggests that none of the factors (with the exception of sbp-1) show a robust suppression of the PDst fertility phenotype. This is also confusing because the authors include several different alleles of nhr-49 mutants, and see effects in some, but not all of the mutants. Moreover, some mutants are gain-of-function and some loss-of-function, but the authors have not explained why they would expect to see the same phenotype in both GOF and LOF alleles, so overall the results are difficult to interpret. The data become more convincing moving onto Figure 3C. Nevertheless, the authors need a more thorough discussion and consider the inconsistency in their data and interpret the results accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited the discussion of Figure 3 to improve the clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. For Figure 3E, the authors state their hypothesis in the text (around line 274) that oleic acid (OA) supplementation should further decrease the brood size after PDst since they just found in Figure 3D that the loss of fat metabolism genes (that produce OA) could rescue the decreased brood size phenotype in PDst adults. This hypothesis is logical from their data, however the authors see the opposite of this result since all strains show an increase in brood size in Figure 3E when on OA. Of course surprising results occur, but the authors do not attempt to reconcile the discrepancy between their hypothesis and the results, leaving the reader very confused. They conclude that OA may be a limiting factor for PDst reproduction, but this is in contrast to their previous conclusion that reducing factors that produce OA with genetic mutants (hence limiting OA) would be beneficial to PDst reproduction. This discussion needs to be clarified. Additionally, the authors do not show the effect of OA on WT worms not exposed to PDst, which could be an important control and perhaps help the authors explain some of their contradictory findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited the text to improve the clarity of this section.

Following comment 7, it might be helpful to determine whether induction of the fat genes indeed result in changes in MUFAs.</p></disp-quote><p>We were unable to perform this complicated experiment. However, we did perform fatty acid profiling for CON and PD<sub>Stv</sub> adults (please see Figure 4—figure supplement 1C and Reviewer #1 concerns, comment #2). In addition, we tested whether the <italic>fat</italic> double mutants were required for the OA-dependent increase in PD<sub>Stv</sub> brood size and found that <italic>fat-7</italic> is required for the phenotype.

The authors show that PDstv adults have increased lipid storage in embryos, even in fat-6(-); fat-7(-) mutants.

However, we did perform ORO staining in <italic>daf-12</italic> mutants.

It may be interesting to check the expression of the desaturases in daf-12(-), tcer-1(-) and kri-1(-) worms to tie in the role of these desaturases in regulating low fecundity phenotype.

The authors observed that depletion of VIT-1 resulted in significantly increased intestinal fat deposit (Figure 4C and 4D). Since vitellogenins are known to carry fat from the intestine to the developing oocytes, its depletion would be expected to stop the transfer of fat from the intestine to the oocytes, which could result in increased intestinal fat. The authors should consider including this interpretation in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited our manuscript to include this interpretation of our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. The authors suggested that germ cell numbers in daf-12(-) and tcer-1(-) could be connected to their brood sizes in postdauer worms. However, since the difference in germ cell numbers appears to be very small, and the change in brood size appears to be very large. Authors should comment on that.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the changes in germ cell rows in larvae do not correlate with adult brood sizes in <italic>daf-36</italic> and <italic>tcer-1</italic> mutants.
