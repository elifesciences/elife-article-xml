However, effective therapies that target the microbiome have been elusive given its inherent complexity. Here, we experimentally examined diet-microbe-host interactions through a complex systems framework, centered on dietary oxalate. Using multiple, independent molecular, rodent, and in vitro experimental models, we found that microbiome composition influenced multiple oxalate-microbe-host interfaces. Importantly, the administration of the oxalate-degrading specialist, <italic>Oxalobacter formigenes,</italic> was only effective against a poor oxalate-degrading microbiota background and gives critical new insights into why clinical intervention trials with this species exhibit variable outcomes. Data suggest that, while heterogeneity in the microbiome impacts multiple diet-host-microbe interfaces, metabolic redundancy among diverse microorganisms in specific diet-microbe axes is a critical variable that may impact the efficacy of bacteriotherapies, which can help guide patient and probiotic selection criteria in probiotic clinical trials.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Neotoma albigula</italic></kwd><kwd>oxalate</kwd><kwd>microbiome</kwd><kwd>metabolome</kwd><kwd>probiotics</kwd><kwd>hyperoxaluria</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK121689-01A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>Aaron W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007312</institution-id><institution>Cleveland Clinic Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>Aaron W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Microbiome composition through the redundancy of oxalate-degrading bacteria, critically influence oxalate metabolism, explaining variable outcomes of <italic>Oxalobacter formigenes</italic> therapy and offers insights for improving probiotic selection and clinical trial strategies.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Research into the host-associated microbiome is at an inflection point. Decades of research have revealed that host-associated microbiomes are intimately linked to host health and touch all aspects of host physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Gomaa, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Cox et al., 2022</xref>). The first phase of microbiome research was focused on descriptive studies that characterized differences in the microbiome by host species, body site, and disease phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Turnbaugh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Lloyd-Price et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">Wang and Jia, 2016</xref>). Clinical case:control metagenome-wide association studies that found differences in microbiome composition between healthy and disease cohorts gave rise to the ambiguous term ‘dysbiosis’ and much of the literature is focused on ‘balancing’ the gut microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Tang and Hazen, 2024</xref>). In the second, and current, phase of research, studies have moved towards gaining more mechanistic insight into specific microbe-host interactions that influence host physiology and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Tang and Hazen, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">de Vos and de Vos, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">de Vos et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib157">Zimmermann et al., 2021</xref>). However, it is increasingly being recognized that, given the wide variability in microbiome composition, host genetics, and lifestyles, understanding mechanisms and causal relationships between gut bacteria and host physiological responses is not enough for the development of effective bacteriotherapies that target the gut microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Vujkovic-Cvijin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Walter et al., 2020</xref>). In fact, many probiotic clinical trials, with known mechanistic links between the probiotics and host physiology, have exhibited wide variability in results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Barkhidarian et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Rogers and Mousa, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ceccherini et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Batagello et al., 2018</xref>). It is currently unclear what sources of variability may drive the response to targeted bacteriotherapies. Some variables that have been proposed include heterogeneity in microbiome composition, alcohol consumption, and bowel movement quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Vujkovic-Cvijin et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Complex system theory is one means to potentially constrain hypotheses and bridge the gap between mechanistic studies and effective bacteriotherapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Foster et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Layeghifard et al., 2017</xref>). Studies of the host-associated microbiome often casually acknowledge that these systems are complex and, while, there has been progress made in developing mathematical approaches to complex modeling of host-microbiome relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Foster et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Layeghifard et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Ridenhour et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Kumar et al., 2019</xref>), few studies have bridged the gap between experimental biology and complex system theory.</p><p>Mammals and their gut microbiome, are often considered as a holobiont (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Richardson, 2017</xref>), defined as a discrete unit that exhibits collective action and evolves as a unit. Using evolutionary theory approaches, it is hypothesized that the form and function of the microbial part of the holobiont is driven primarily by host-microbe influences, but which require microbe-microbe interactions to help manage the enormous burden of microbiome constraint, which is termed an ‘ecosystem on a leash’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Foster et al., 2017</xref>). Under this hypothesis, microbe-host interactions, in which host-associated microbes evolve to produce metabolic by-products for the sole benefit of the host, are necessarily rare. Essential features of complex systems include functional redundancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Foster et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Palla et al., 2005</xref>) and cooperation through chains of direct interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Foster et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Palla et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Lambiotte et al., 2019</xref>), distinct functional nodes that process and transfer resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Palla et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Lambiotte et al., 2019</xref>), fractality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Palla et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Lambiotte et al., 2019</xref>), and adaptability through specific homeostatic feedback mechanisms to maintain relatively consistent internal conditions given a dynamic external environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Foster et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Cohen et al., 2022</xref>). While considerable progress has been made in understanding the nature of complex systems, there is a lack of consensus on basic terminology and broadly applicable analytical or experimental models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Torres et al., 2021</xref>). This limitation is due in part because complex systems necessarily transect many divergent entities in nature and is thus studied in diverse scientific disciplines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Torres et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, while some essential features of complexity have been elucidated within specific real-world systems, such as the conversion of polysaccharides to butyrate by multiple species in the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Roediger, 1980</xref>), or feedback loops in blood pressure regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Javorka et al., 2017</xref>), experimental evidence of multiple features of complexity within a single system is sparse, especially in microbe-host systems.</p><p>To overcome the limitations of applying complex systems theory to the microbe-host holobiont, new models and experimental frameworks are needed that balance complexity with tractability. Antinutrients, molecules produced in plants to deter herbivory, disrupt homeostasis by targeting the function of the microbiome, host, or both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Kolodziejczyk et al., 2019</xref>), and provide an effective focal point to study complexity. Oxalate is an antinutrient present in many plant-based foods, which typically provides the majority of oxalate in circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Crivelli et al., 2020</xref>), but is also produced as a terminal metabolite in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Holmes et al., 2001</xref>). While some host genetic mutations increase endogenous production of oxalate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Cochat and Rumsby, 2013</xref>), mammals do not produce enzymes capable of degrading oxalate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Hodgkinson, 1977</xref>). However, multiple oxalate-degrading bacteria exist in the gut, which degrades oxalate through one of a handful of simple metabolic pathways involving one or two genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allison et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Miller and Dearing, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Liu et al., 2021a</xref>), which isolates this function to the gut microbiota. As such, oxalate degradation as a function, exhibits a moderate amount of complexity compared to other gut microbiota functions, such as the production of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), that requires host input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Tang et al., 2015</xref>). Beyond the moderate complexity, it is known that oxalate-degrading bacteria are susceptible to antibiotics and that antibiotic use decreases oxalate degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Nazzal et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Miller et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Kharlamb et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Lange et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Mittal et al., 2005</xref>). Elevated levels of oxalate induce oxidative stress, activate the inflammasome, and disrupt epithelial barrier function through tight junction proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Mulay et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Peerapen and Thongboonkerd, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Peerapen and Thongboonkerd, 2021</xref>). This molecule has been linked to diseases including kidney stones and chronic kidney disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Holmes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Nazzal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib152">Waikar et al., 2019</xref>), breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Castellaro et al., 2015</xref>), and cardiometabolic disorders such as atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Liu et al., 2021b</xref>), obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Efe et al., 2019</xref>), and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Efe et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>Oxalobacter formigenes,</italic> which uses oxalate as a sole carbon and energy source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allison et al., 1985</xref>), is a well-studied oxalate-degrading species of bacteria. The negative, at times lethal, effects of oxalate, along with the identification and mechanisms of oxalate-degrading bacteria in the gut, have been worked out for several decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allison et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">James and Butcher, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anantharam et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baetz and Allison, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baetz and Allison, 1990</xref>), pre-dating the current microbiome era.</p><p>Despite this knowledge, clinical intervention trials involving <italic>Oxalobacter formigenes,</italic> which is perhaps the most effective oxalate-degrading species known, have successfully resulted in a significant reduction in urine oxalate levels in only 43% of studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Batagello et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ariceta et al., 2023</xref>). Oxalate-degrading lactic acid bacteria have been successful in 37.5% of studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Batagello et al., 2018</xref>). Both treatments led to a wide variability in patient responses. Given these data and the well worked out mechanisms of oxalate metabolism, it is clear that having an understanding of the mechanistic links between the gut microbiota and host physiology, alone, is demonstrably not sufficient to develop effective bacteriotherapies. Therefore, even though the history of oxalate-microbe-host interactions is much greater than most other microbe-host systems, oxalate degradation represents an accurate reflection of the challenges faced by microbiome research and is a prime candidate for complex system modelling to understand the critical variables that determine responsiveness to bacteriotherapies.</p><p>The objectives of the current study were to evaluate oxalate-microbe-host interactions, within the framework of complex systems. We used multi-omic approaches utilizing multiple independent in vivo and in vitro models to understand the critical variables that influence the gut microbiota’s maintenance of oxalate homeostasis and its impact on the host. We targeted several potential oxalate-microbe-host interfaces that include the gut microbiota itself, which is one of the first lines of defense against antinutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dearing and Weinstein, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Kohl et al., 2014b</xref>), intestinal epithelium, which is an important barrier between microbe and host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Foster et al., 2017</xref>), the liver, which is important for the biotransformation of dietary or microbial metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Grant, 1991</xref>), along with the kidneys and vasculature, where calcium oxalate can potentially form calcified deposits or induce inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Liu et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Robertson and Peacock, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Nishizawa et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Fishbein et al., 2008</xref>). Collectively, data indicate that multiple oxalate-microbe-host interfaces are influenced significantly by gut microbiota composition and that harboring diverse microorganisms capable of degrading oxalate can limit the impact of <italic>O. formigenes</italic> as a probiotic. Based on results from this study, we propose a phased approach for the development of bacteriotherapies whereby clinical case:control studies determine whether or not a clinical phenotype is associated with the microbiome and the microbial taxa/functions associated with specific phenotypes (Phase I).</p><p>Hypothesized taxa and/or microbial functions should be mechanistically resolved through in vitro and germ-free animal studies (Phase II). Finally, mechanistic insights should be applied to a complex systems theoretical framework to identify those variables that most impact the potential success of bacteriotherapies (Phase III). Such a phased approach would have broad implications for patient and probiotic selection in the development of targeted bacteriotherapies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Defining the oxalate-microbe-host as a complex system</title><p>To apply complex systems modeling to oxalate-microbe-host interactions, we first defined the system as a network of nodes, connections, and fractal layers. Nodes represent distinct sites where oxalate is processed, connections define the transfer of oxalate or its metabolites between nodes, and fractals represent autonomous subunits that perform analogous but distinct functions. For antinutrients like oxalate, we identified four primary nodes where transformation occurs or where oxalate directly affects the host. The first node is the stomach, where acidic conditions can chemically modify some molecules, such as glucosinolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Frandsen et al., 2019</xref>). A fraction of oxalate may be absorbed into circulation at this stage.</p><p>The second node is the intestine, where oxalate encounters high bacterial densities, particularly in the colon. Within the gut microbiome, two fractal layers exist: microbial species and the genes within each species. Microbial oxalate degradation follows one of three possible models: (a) one species/one function, (b) multiple species/one function, or (c) multiple species/multiple functions. Historically, <italic>Oxalobacter formigenes</italic> was considered the primary oxalate degrader (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Daniel et al., 2021</xref>), relying on a two-gene metabolic pathway (oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase and formyl-CoA transferase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baetz and Allison, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baetz and Allison, 1990</xref>). However, more recent studies demonstrate that oxalate degradation is a broader function distributed across multiple bacterial species, utilizing diverse metabolic pathways that may require one or two genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Miller and Dearing, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Liu et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Turroni et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Turroni et al., 2007</xref>). Additionally, gut microbiota interactions influence oxalate degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Belenguer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Miller et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Miller et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Miller et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Miller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Miller et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Miller et al., 2016a</xref>) with by-products such as CO₂ and formate serving as substrates for downstream metabolic pathways, including acetogenesis, methanogenesis, and sulfate reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Drake, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Asanuma et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ferry, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Oremland and Polcin, 1982</xref>). Given the inconsistent results of <italic>O. formigenes</italic> trials and the recognition of broader oxalate-microbiota interactions, we hypothesize that oxalate homeostasis is maintained either by diverse oxalate-degrading bacteria or by cooperative networks in which a subset of bacteria degrades oxalate while others utilize its metabolic by-products.</p><p>A portion of intestinal oxalate is absorbed into circulation or excreted in the stool, while another fraction is secreted back into the gut via transporters such as SLC26A6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Freel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Hatch and Freel, 2008</xref>). Additionally, some oxalate is transported via the portal vein to the liver, forming the third node (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Dancygier and Dancygier, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Unlike other metabolites that are detoxified by the liver, oxalate is a source rather than a sink in hepatic metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Hodgkinson, 1977</xref>). However, the liver plays a central role in metabolizing other gut-derived molecules, such as trimethylamine, which it converts into the more pathogenic TMAO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Tang et al., 2015</xref>). Some complex antinutrients, such as creosote, require both gut microbial and hepatic metabolism for complete degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Kohl and Dearing, 2011</xref>). The liver itself can be divided into fractal layers based on cell type and gene expression. The final node includes systemic circulation and target organs, where unmetabolized oxalate or other antinutrients may trigger immune responses before eventual urinary excretion.</p><p>This framework generates multiple testable hypotheses regarding the cooperative roles of gut microbiota, hepatic metabolism, and host physiology in oxalate homeostasis, which are explored in subsequent sections.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Constitutive and oxalate-dependent effects of the microbiome impact host hepatic gene expression</title><p>Both the gut microbiota and the liver are important organs for the neutralization of antinutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Grant, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Kohl and Dearing, 2016</xref>), indicative of functional redundancy, cooperation, and fractality. While it is known that the liver does not degrade oxalate itself, it could still be impacted by oxalate, in gut microbiota-dependent ways. To determine the effects of oxalate exposure and microbiome on host hepatic gene expression, we used a fecal transplant model to examine different host microbiomes with the same host genetics. The microbiota from two different host species were utilized for these experiments. Specifically, Swiss-Webster mice harbor a poor oxalate-degrading microbiota and are often used in studies of hyperoxaluria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Miller et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Miller et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Miller et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Hatch et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Hatch and Freel, 2013</xref>). Conversely, the white-throated woodrat, <italic>Neotoma albigula,</italic> is a wild rodent that exclusively consumes <italic>Opuntia</italic> cactus, which is high in oxalate, and harbors a highly effective and responsive gut microbiota tuned to oxalate degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Miller et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Miller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Miller et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Justice, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Kohl et al., 2014a</xref>). For the transplant model, a 5-d course of neomycin was used to suppress the native gut microbiota of Swiss-Webster mice (SWM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Miller et al., 2019b</xref>), followed by fecal transplants either from SWM (allograft; SW-SW) or <italic>N. albigula</italic> (NALB)<italic>,</italic> which has a highly effective and transferable oxalate-degrading gut microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Miller et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Miller et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Miller et al., 2016a</xref>), (xenograft; SW-NALB). Subsequently, animals were fed either a 0% or 1.5% oxalate diet (Evigo, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Liver tissue was obtained after 3 wk and processed for bulk RNAseq. The RNAseq data analyses revealed constitutive microbiome and microbiome-dependent oxalate effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>), whereby SW-SW mice exhibited an oxalate-dependent alteration of 219 hepatic genes, with a net increase in activity, while the SW-NALB mice exhibited an oxalate-dependent alteration of 21 genes with a net decrease in activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). In the SW-NALB mice, the primary response was a decrease in sulfation activity with oxalate exposure, which is involved in the deactivation, detoxication, and excretion of xenobiotics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), and suggests oxalate may be beneficial for this host-microbe system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Koppel et al., 2017</xref>). The primary response in the SW-SW mice was an increase in mitochondrial activity, translation, protein regulation, and ribosome biogenesis, indicative of oxalate-induced hepatic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Liu et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Strzelecki and Menon, 1986</xref>). Since hosts only differed by gut microbiota composition, these data demonstrate causative interactions between the gut microbiota and liver activity through oxalate-dependent and independent pathways. Within the framework of complex systems, results show microbe-host cooperation whereby oxalate effectively processed within the SW-NALB gut microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Miller et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Miller et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Miller et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Miller et al., 2016a</xref>) reduced overall liver activity, indicative of a beneficial impact. Data also suggest that both the gut microbiota and the immune system are involved in oxalate remediation (redundancy), such that if oxalate cannot be neutralized in the gut microbiota or liver, then the molecule will be processed through host immune response mechanisms (fractality), in this case indicated through an overall increase in inflammatory cytokines with oxalate exposure combined with an ineffective oxalate-degrading microbiota (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6a, b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp9">Supplementary file 9a; b</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Oxalate exposure impacted host hepatic activity in a microbiota-dependent fashion.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Swiss Webster mice were given neomycin, followed by an allograft (Swiss-Webster mice, SWM) or xenograft (<italic>N. albigula</italic>, NALB) fecal transplant, then maintained on a 0 or 1.5% oxalate diet prior to necropsy for fecal metabolomics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and hepatic transcriptomics.

To assess changes to microbial metabolic output with oxalate exposure, we used the same animals as above. Following the diet trial, colon stool was collected post-necropsy and processed for untargeted metabolomics, which is a measure of total metabolites present in stool from the diet, microbial activity, and host activity. Collectively, results are indicative of constitutive microbiome and microbiome-dependent oxalate effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). The SW-SW mice exhibited an alteration of 162 microbial metabolites upon oxalate exposure, with a net decrease in activity compared to the no oxalate group, whereas the SW-NALB mice exhibited an alteration of 83 microbial metabolites, with a net increase in activity compared to the no oxalate group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). In SW-NALB mice, the primary response was an increase in lipid metabolism and a shift (increase/decrease) in fatty acid, secondary metabolite, and alkaloid profiles. In the SW-SW mice, the primary response was an increase in fatty acid synthesis and phenylalanine metabolism, and a decrease in the synthesis of secondary metabolites, cholesterol, and alkaloids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Therefore, while oxalate had a much greater impact on gut microbial metabolism in SW-SW mice overall, the metabolic pathways impacted were similar. Net changes in microbial metabolites produced are indicative of a negative impact of oxalate on microbial activity in SW-SW and a positive impact in SW-NALB mice. Integration of host hepatic gene expression and gut metabolomic data shows that oxalate induces a small decrease in hepatic activity overall for SW-NALB mice and a large increase in hepatic activity for SW-SW mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). From a complex systems perspective, data reflect a causative effect of oxalate for the shift in microbial metabolic output. Specifically, the SW-NALB mice exhibit hallmarks of homeostatic feedback with oxalate exposure to maintain a consistent metabolic output, defined by the relatively small, net negative, microbial metabolite-hepatic gene network compared to the large, net positive, network of SW-SW mice. Additionally, data further support the cooperation, redundancy, and fractality of the gut-liver axis. While SW-NALB exhibit a small increase in microbial metabolic activity and a decrease in liver activity, the SW-SW mice saw a large decrease in microbial metabolic activity, coupled with a large increase in hepatic activity, which is reflected in the multi-omic network profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and suggests that the oxalate-induced change in microbial metabolism is responsible for the change in hepatic activity.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Oxalate exposure impacted microbial metabolic activity in a microbiota dependent fashion.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) PCoA of protein normalized, log-transformed metabolomic data. p=0.001 for microbiome composition, p=0.1 for dietary oxalate content, p=0.3 in two-way analysis; two-way PERMANOVA.

Where possible, isolates from human sources were obtained. Cohorts, defined in the STAR methods, were used to delineate hypotheses that either carbon and energy substrates are sufficient to explain known effects of the oxalate-degrading microbial network or that additional aspects of taxa commonly stimulated by dietary oxalate are required to explain past results (taxa defined through previous meta-analysis of studies) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Batagello et al., 2018</xref>).

However, there was a much greater change in format metabolism, dependent on the microbes present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3D</xref>). Despite the more moderate change in oxalate levels, there were similar oxalate-associated effects on renal calcium oxalate deposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F, G</xref>), which was not dependent on formate levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). With the metabolic cohorts, the presence of known oxalate degraders appeared to be more important for oxalate homeostasis than the taxonomic cohort, since the absence of known oxalate-degraders led to oxalate levels similar to the No_bact (Group 1) controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). Collectively, data show that while the taxa chosen for the taxonomic cohort enabled efficient oxalate even in the absence of <italic>O. formigenes</italic>, the bacteria present in the metabolic cohort had a greater influence on formate levels. In both diet trials, urinary oxalate, but not formate correlated with CaOx deposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3G and H</xref> – metabolic, data not shown - taxonomic). The effects of oxalate and transplant group differed between the two cohort studies with mice in the metabolic cohort exhibiting higher levels of IL-6 of microbial transplant groups compared to the negative controls. However, similar to the taxonomic cohort, there were no differences in IL18.

The objective of the current study was to examine oxalate-microbe-host interactions within a complex systems framework. Collectively, the results of the study offer quantifiable and generalizable metrics of diet-microbe-host systems that can be used to guide more effective patient and probiotic selection criteria for clinical trials involving bacteriotherapies that target the gut microbiota. Specifically, with complex system modeling, we found through multiple in vivo and in vitro experimental systems, that exogenous oxalate exhibits systemic effects on multiple organs, including the gut microbiota, and oxalate homeostasis is specifically mitigated by diverse oxalate-degrading bacteria rather than a single bacterial species or factors such as host species, or microbe-microbe cooperation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model of oxalate-host-microbiome interactions, based on experiments here.</title><p>Model starts in the top left and proceeds along arrows through fecal or urinary excretion.

Specifically, experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> demonstrated that host responses to oxalate were dependent on the composition of the gut microbiota. Expanding on this, experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> revealed that oxalate’s impact on microbial community structure was similarly reliant on the whole microbiota, and direct multi-omic data integration confirmed that these microbial changes subsequently influenced host responses to oxalate. Once the gut microbiota composition was deemed to be critical, experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> examined the specific oxalate impacts on the gut microbiota, using <italic>N. albigula</italic> and its native microbiota as the model for high oxalate tolerance. This analysis identified multiple genes associated with oxalate degradation, as well as acetogenic, methanogenic, and sulfate-reducing pathways. To assess the functional redundancy of these pathways, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2 supp3 supp4 supp5">Supplementary files 2-5</xref> quantified the extent to which multiple microbial species contribute to these pathways. The high degree of redundancy observed suggested that oxalate degradation is maintained through diverse oxalate-degrading bacteria rather than a single keystone species. To explore the environmental factors influencing oxalate metabolism, we employed a culturomic approach to characterize microbial responses under controlled conditions and to evaluate oxalate degradation within our defined, hypothesized microbial communities (based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> data and past oxalate diet trials). Finally, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> validated our metagenomic, metabolomic, and culturomic findings through targeted microbial transplants in mice, specifically demonstrating that the diversity of oxalate-degrading microbes were transferable and influenced host oxalate homeostasis more than a single species. The overall complex modeling approach was designed to systematically identify the most critical factors in the oxalate-microbiota-host relationship. Each experiment was informed by prior results, allowing for a stepwise refinement of hypotheses and experimental design. This integrative framework underscores the importance of metabolic redundancy in modulating oxalate metabolism and its downstream effects on host physiology.</p><p>Microbial oxalate metabolism, which has been researched for several decades, pre-dating the current microbiome era, is an ideal focal point to understand pertinent variables that impact probiotic success. Here, we found that heterogeneity in microbiome composition, independent of host genetics, significantly impacted multiple diet-microbe-host interfaces that included hepatic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>), gut microbiota metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), renal mineralization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3E and F</xref>), intestinal inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H,I</xref>), and cardiac fibrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1H1</xref>). Importantly, we found that oxalate degradation was highly redundant among diverse species in the gut of <italic>N. albigula,</italic> which consumes a high oxalate diet in the wild (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Consistent with past studies, administering <italic>O. formigenes</italic> led to a significant reduction in both stool and urine oxalate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>). However, when co-administered with other oxalate-degrading microorganisms, there was no additive effect. Oxalate-based results were similar, but to a lower degree, in the metabolic cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B and C</xref>). In taxonomic cohort studies, we did not see significant differences in the change in urine formate, based on the microbial transplant group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), in contrast to metabolic cohort studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3D</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, data offer strong support for the hypothesis that metabolic redundancy among diverse taxa, is the primary driver of oxalate homeostasis, rather than metabolic cooperation in which the by-products of oxalate degradation are used in downstream pathways such as acetogenesis, methanogenesis, and sulfate reduction. However, data on the metabolic cooperation hypothesis were inconclusive and there are multiple known microbe and host sources of formate, which may confound results in these studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Asanuma et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Hughes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Pietzke et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Ternes et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Modeling the microbe-host system through an evolutionary perspective, it has previously been suggested that while host control over the microbiome is the primary driver of the form and function of the gut microbiota, given the enormous biomass and diversity of the gut microbiota, microbe-microbe competition is also required to constrain the microbiota in mammalian microbe-host systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Foster et al., 2017</xref>). In the current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5B</xref>) and previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allison et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Miller and Dearing, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Turroni et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Turroni et al., 2007</xref>), we and others have found that oxalate can differentially exhibit positive or negative effects on microbial growth and metabolism dependent on the species and environment present. These data provide two alternative ecological pressures to degrade oxalate. The first is to use oxalate as a carbon and energy source for growth, as is the case with <italic>O. formigenes</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allison et al., 1985</xref>). The second is to degrade oxalate to remove it as a toxin, as is the case with some <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> and <italic>Bifidobacteria</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Turroni et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Turroni et al., 2007</xref>). The data showing oxalate degradation as a metabolically redundant function among multiple diverse microorganisms that maintain oxalate homeostasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggest that the amount of oxalate consumed or produced by the liver is too great for a single, slow-growing oxalate-degrading specialist can handle alone, in contrast to prevailing hypotheses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Daniel et al., 2021</xref>), and in support of the ecosystem on a leash hypothesis. Importantly, the near-universal presence of formate metabolism genes suggests that formate may be an even greater source of ecological pressure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). In fact, multiple studies have shown that formate is toxic both to many bacterial species and to mammalian hosts, which supports this hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Hughes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Pietzke et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Ternes et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Kirkpatrick et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib150">Voskuhl et al., 2022</xref>).

Furthermore, oxalate degradation exhibits moderate complexity, both in that it is isolated to the gut microbiota and is performed through a handful of simple metabolic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Cochat and Rumsby, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Hodgkinson, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allison et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Miller and Dearing, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Liu et al., 2021a</xref>). Despite this knowledge, clinical trials designed to reduce systemic oxalate using either <italic>O. formigenes</italic> or other oxalate-degrading bacteria have exhibited a wide variety of patient and trial responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Batagello et al., 2018</xref>). However, knowledge about other diet-microbe-host links are largely in their infancy. Many of the other known features exhibit much greater complexity than oxalate degradation. For instance, while the production of short-chain fatty acids are widely viewed as beneficial for both the gut microbiota and host health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Deleu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Kelly et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Portincasa et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Shimizu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Tian et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Vieira et al., 2017</xref>), many short-chain fatty acids are known and are produced by a wide variety of species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Fusco et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Mann et al., 2024</xref>). Other important diet-microbe-host links, such as the production of secondary bile acids or TMAO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Tang and Hazen, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Tang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chiang, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Collins et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Gérard, 2013</xref>), also involve host hepatic activity, increasing the complexity further. Given the complexity of diet-microbe-host interactions and the fact that understanding the mechanisms through which the gut microbiota modifies the diet to influence host health is demonstrably insufficient for the development of effective bacteriotherapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Barkhidarian et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Rogers and Mousa, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ceccherini et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Batagello et al., 2018</xref>), we propose a three-phase, pre-clinical experimental workflow for the development of targeted bacteriotherapies. In the first phase of research, case:control metagenome-wide studies and research into other factors that modify the microbiome, such as prior antibiotic exposure, can identify disease phenotypes that are influenced by the microbiome, along with the microbial taxa and genes responsible for this association. In the second phase of research, hypothesized taxa and/or metabolic functions can be explored through in vitro and germ-free animal studies, using appropriate models to determine the mechanistic links that drive disease phenotypes through diet-microbe-host interactions. Finally, in phase three, these mechanistic links can be applied to a complex system theoretical framework, as done in the current study, to identify those variables most pertinent to successfully influence specific phenotypes through targeted changes to the gut microbiota. Such a phased research structure will provide for much more effective probiotic and patient selection criteria prior to clinical trials.</p><p>There were some important limitations to the current study. First, while we did conduct one study with <italic>N. albigula,</italic> most animal studies here sought to eliminate host genetics from the equation, as a means of simplification. Host genetics are another layer of complexity that were not examined here and may have an impact on oxalate homeostasis beyond the gut microbiota. Second, in animal studies with the refined communities of microorganisms, the taxonomic and metabolic cohorts studies were conducted separately and some batch effects are apparent, such as with the change in creatinine values or urine output. Finally, it is apparent from our data and the literature that there are multiple host and microbial sources of formate. As such, data pertaining to formate utilization by our transplant communities are inconclusive.</p><p>In conclusion, using a complex systems theoretical framework, we examined the oxalate-microbe-host interactions of multiple oxalate-microbe-host interfaces and found multiple microbiome-dependent effects of oxalate. The negative effects of oxalate were mitigated by metabolically redundant oxalate-degrading bacteria, more so than by metabolic cooperation or a single oxalate-degrading species. Critically, we found that while <italic>O. formigenes</italic> can lower urine oxalate when placed on a background of a poor oxalate-degrading community, as current theory predicts, this effect is lost when co-administered with other oxalate-degrading bacteria. Collectively, data help to resolve why the gut microbiota of the white-throated woodrat, <italic>N. albigula,</italic> effectively responds to and degrades even very high dietary oxalate levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Miller et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Miller et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Miller et al., 2016a</xref>) and offer a clear pathway for more effective patient and probiotic selection for future clinical trials to reduce urine oxalate. More importantly, the conceptual and experimental framework developed in this study, based on complex systems theory, paves the way for a phased approach to microbiome research in which clinical microbiome insights (Phase I) drive mechanistic insights between the gut microbiota and host physiology (Phase II), that can be applied to a complex system model to constrain hypotheses and identify the most pertinent variables that drive microbe-host interactions that influence host physiology and health (Phase III). Such an approach will allow for much more efficacious probiotics and patient selection criteria in clinical intervention trials.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal studies</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Tracking animal health</title><p>Throughout all diet trials, animals were monitored for evidence of trauma, dehydration, pain, or other forms of suffering.

Animals were transported to the University of Utah and housed in individual cages (48 by 27 by 20 cm) with a 12 hr/12 hr light/dark cycle, at 28 °C and 20% humidity. Animals were initially maintained on a 0.2% oxalate, high-fiber rabbit chow (Harlan Teklad formula 2031; Envigo) for 7 mo prior to experimentation. This diet reduces the overall detectable diversity of the microbiota of these animals but maintains the members of the native microbiota overall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Kohl and Dearing, 2014</xref>). All methods were approved by the IACUC under protocol no. 12–12010.</p><p>Subsequently, <italic>N. albigula</italic> woodrats were placed in a diet trial in which the oxalate concentration of the food was gradually increased over time along a gradient from 0.2% (for days 1–5; herein referred to as 0%), 3% (days 6–10), and 6% (days 11–15; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The oxalate concentration of the diet was adjusted by adding the appropriate amount of sodium oxalate (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) into the powdered rabbit chow on a dry weight basis. The schedule for each concentration of dietary oxalate was chosen to ensure that the gut microbiota had time to respond to the specific diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Belenguer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Miller et al., 2016b</xref>).

To examine the host-independent effects of oxalate on gut microbiota with either a low or high efficiency at degrading oxalate, two distinct host-microbe model systems were developed. For both models, equal numbers of male and female Swiss-Webster mice were used as the host. For the low oxalate-degrading gut microbiota, Swiss-Webster mice were given fecal transplants using feces from other Swiss-Webster mice (allografts), as discussed below. A 1.5% oxalate diet is sufficient to induce hyperoxaluria in Swiss-Webster mice, defined as a 50% increase in urinary oxalate excretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Miller et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Miller et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Hatch et al., 2011</xref>). For the high oxalate-degrading gut microbiota, Swiss-Webster mice were given fecal transplants from <italic>N. albigula</italic> (xenografts). We have previously shown that fecal transplants from <italic>N. albigula</italic> are sufficient to induce significant and persistent oxalate metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Miller et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Miller et al., 2016a</xref>). During and after fecal transplants, animals were grouped into four to a cages, with four cages assigned to each treatment group, for a total of 16 animals per experimental group. To minimize individual variability and eliminate any cage effect in subsequent metrics, samples and data collected from all animals in a cage were pooled together into an individual sample. To develop the two different mouse models, the conversion of the gut microbiota from the native microbiota to the grafted microbiota (allografts or xenografts) was completed in two stages. First, the native microbiota was depleted with a 5-d course of neomycin (0.5 g/L water, combined with 2 g/L sucralose), while on a 0% oxalate diet. Mice were given ad libitum access to water during this time and throughout the experiment. Neomycin is a broad spectrum antibiotic that is poorly absorbed across the gut, and effectively reduces gut microbiota density by up to 90% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib149">Vijay-Kumar et al., 2010</xref>). After antibiotic depletion, mice were given the respective fecal transplants by first thawing feces, then aseptically mixing 32  g feces per kg body weight directly into powdered mouse chow. Fecal transplants were performed daily for 6 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Miller et al., 2019b</xref>), during which animals were switched to either a 0 or 1.5% oxalate diet.

First, based on the metabolic pathways enriched by oxalate in the <italic>N. albigula</italic> gut microbiota (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>), assessed through comparative shotgun metagenomics (described below), we hypothesized that microorganisms that engage in those metabolic pathways help to mitigate the systemic effects of oxalate. To test this hypothesis, we isolated bacteria from <italic>N. albigula</italic> stool (described below) and grouped microorganisms into four cohorts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). These included oxalate-degrading bacteria alone (Ox; Group 2), microorganisms that can utilize formate or oxalate (Ox_form; Group 3), oxalate and formate users, in addition to the metabolism of selected sugars (All; Group 4), or the complete cohort except for oxalate degraders (No_ox; Group 5). Microorganisms isolated from <italic>N. albigula</italic> stool and used in microbial transplants were termed the ‘metabolic cohort.’ In addition to the metabolic cohort, a ‘taxonomic cohort’ was defined by cross-referenced metabolic pathways enriched by oxalate with microbial taxa previously reported to be stimulated by oxalate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Batagello et al., 2018</xref>). Microorganisms from this cohort were purchased commercially from the ATCC or DSMZ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>). In addition to these cohorts, we also examined a negative control in which animals were inoculated with sterile media (No_bact (Group 1); Group 1), and a positive control in which animals were inoculated with the whole gut microbiota of <italic>N. albigula,</italic> extracted from a stool by first vortexing in a 1:1 mixture of stool and sterile PBS, followed by centrifuging at 8000 RPM for 2 min. The supernatant was inoculated into gut microbiota media with 20 mM sodium oxalate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>) overnight prior to microbial transplant.</p><p>To prepare each isolate for transplants, an overnight culture of each species was grown and mixed in equal proportions by volume for each cohort. The community was then centrifuged and the supernatant was decanted. After antibiotic depletion of the native gut microbiota in Swiss-Webster mice, 38 mg of pelleted bacteria of each preparation was added directly to the food and administered over the course of 6 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>), as done previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Miller et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Hatch et al., 2011</xref>). Preparations corresponded to approximately 5×10<sup>8</sup> microorganisms for each isolate in the appropriate transplant groups. Quantification of bacterial numbers was performed through absorbance of the microbial preparations on a spectrophotometer at 600 nm, calibrated to direct microscopic counts.</p><p>As above, animals were grouped four into a cage, with samples from each cage pooled together prior to collection and analyses. Similarly, animals were maintained on custom inserts that mimic metabolic cages for the effective separation of urine and stool prior to collection. During the microbial transplant animal studies, stool and urine was collected daily and inserts were disinfected. For oxalate and formate quantification, samples were collected at the end of the antibiotic depletion, microbial transplants, a 0% oxalate washout period, and after return to a 3% oxalate diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–D</xref>, S8B-D). Prior to biochemical assays, urine was frozen (−20 °C) and feces were dried at 45 °C overnight. Prior to freezing, aliquots of urine were equally divided into six fractions for each of the biochemical assays performed (discussed below). Fractions for oxalate quantification were collected into 4 N HCl prior to freezing to prevent the non-enzymatic conversion of ascorbic acid into oxalate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Miller et al., 2016b</xref>). For microbial inventories, a portion of feces and colon feces (discussed below) were frozen at −80 °C.

Necropsies were performed to aseptically remove colon feces, colon, kidneys, and heart tissue. Colon tissue was longitudinally bisected, swiss-rolled, and placed into 4% paraformaldehyde overnight for fixation at 4 °C for histopathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Le Naour et al., 2022</xref>). Kidney and heart tissues were placed into 4% paraformaldehyde overnight for fixation at 4 °C prior to histopathology. Hearts were first perfused with paraformaldehyde solution prior to immersion.</p><p>After fixation, colon, kidney, and heart tissue were placed in 70% ethanol at 4 °C prior to paraffin embedding, serial sectioning, and staining. To quantify colitis, colon tissue was stained with hematoxylin and eosin and imaged with light microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Whole colons were scored for colitis by two blinded, independent reviewers using a semi-quantitative protocol that considers inflammatory infiltrates, goblet cell loss, crypt density, crypt hyperplasia, muscle thickening, submucosal inflammation, crypt abscesses, and ulcerations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Koelink et al., 2018</xref>). To quantify calcium oxalate deposition, kidney tissue was stained with Von Kossa staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Rungby et al., 1993</xref>), which turns calcium deposits black and the remaining tissue pink (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8E</xref>). Kidneys were imaged under light microscopy and calcium oxalate deposition was quantified using an automated process in QuPath, based on stain color.

To quantify cardiac fibrosis, heart tissue was stained with Masson’s trichrome stain, which stains collagen fibrosis blue and the remaining tissue red (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s6">Figure 6—figure supplement 6</xref>).

Positive controls that included a known amount of substrate along with no substrate negative controls were included in all batches of ELISA assays. Samples, standards, and controls were all run in duplicate and values were averaged. Urinary and fecal oxalate were quantified with an ELISA-based assay (Sigma-Aldrich), with a modified protocol, is as follows. Upon initial testing of oxalate and formate assays using solutions of sodium oxalate and sodium formate in water, it was discovered that while formate assays only had affinity for formate, the oxalate assays had equal affinity for both oxalate and formate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s6">Figure 6—figure supplement 6A</xref>). Specifically, when oxalate alone was added to the solution, the quantified concentration of oxalate matched the amount added. However, when oxalate and formate was added at equal concentrations, the quantified oxalate was approximately twice as high as what was added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s6">Figure 6—figure supplement 6B</xref>). Furthermore, when adding 300 uM of formate or oxalate to human urine specimens, the amount of oxalate quantified was approximately 300 uM higher than urine without any modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s6">Figure 6—figure supplement 6C</xref>). To eliminate the formate contamination on oxalate measurements, oxalate was extracted by first acidifying to pH 3 with 3 M HNO<sub>3</sub>. Acidified urine was centrifuged, and supernatant collected. The pH was then brought up to 7 with NaOH. Subsequently, 5 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> was added to solution to precipitate calcium oxalate. The precipitates were extracted by centrifugation and decanting. Finally, calcium oxalate solution was acidified in 1:4 parts of 4 N HCl prior to enzymatic assay, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Miller et al., 2016b</xref>). When oxalate was extracted from urine specimens in this way, prior to quantification, we saw a significant decrease in quantified oxalate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s6">Figure 6—figure supplement 6C</xref>), as expected given the assay affinity for formate. When solutions containing formate alone went through the extraction process, no oxalate was quantified. Given these results, urinary and fecal oxalate was extracted prior to ELISA-based assays using the manufacturer’s recommendations, post-extraction. For fecal oxalate, samples were acidified with 6 N H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> to solubilize oxalate prior to following the extraction protocol above. For creatinine, cytokines, and oxalate, values generated on a 0% oxalate diet were substracted from all other values, matched by cage, with the assumption that this would isolate oxalate-induced molecule generation. For urinary formate, this substraction was not done since formate can come from multiple sources other than oxalate degradation and values on a 0% oxalate diet were not clearly lower than on a 3% oxalate diet. For all values, data are presented as the change from baseline. Data were statistically compared with two-way analyses and post-hoc, Holm’s-corrected, paired t-tests.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Culturomic assays</title><p>All assays were conducted under strict anaerobic conditions (90% N<sub>2</sub>, 5% H<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) in an anaerobic chamber (Bactron 300).</p><p>The stool from <italic>N. albigula</italic> were used to determine the impact of environmental factors on oxalate metabolism in vitro and to isolate bacteria for the metabolic cohort. <italic>Enterococcus gallinarum,</italic> an oxalate-degrading species previously isolated from <italic>N. albigula,</italic> was also used in culturomic assays to determine the impact of environmental factors on oxalate metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Miller et al., 2014</xref>). To test environmental factors on oxalate metabolism, gut microbiota media, previously designed to support a broad array of gut bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Goodman et al., 2011</xref>), was used as a base media. From there, compounds were added to the media based on metabolic pathways enriched by dietary oxalate in the <italic>N. albigula</italic> gut microbiota (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). Concentrations of added chemicals were based on previously published media recipes where necessary. For assays using the NALB stool, the microbiota was extracted by first vortexing thawed stool, then centrifuging at 8000 rpm for 2 min. For in vitro assays involving pure cultures or synthetic cohorts, bacteria were first grown in media, with or without oxalate, that was first validated to allow for the growth of each isolate in pure culture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). Subsequently, extracted microbiota or pure cultures were normalized to 10<sup>8</sup> microorganisms, as above. Pure cultures were mixed in equal proportions as needed and inoculated into the target media to evaluate oxalate metabolism under different chemical or microbial profiles. Media was incubated for 48–120 hr at 37 °C. All microbiological procedures were done under anaerobic conditions in a Bactron300 anaerobic chamber or sealed containers, as needed. To assess oxalate metabolism in different culture conditions, oxalate was quantified by extracting oxalate and quantification through titration with KMnO<sub>4</sub>, as we have done previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Miller et al., 2014</xref>).

In this medium, oxalate was added at 50 mM to specifically select for bacteria that can use oxalate as a carbon and energy source. Subsequently, the NALB microbiota from the stool was first diluted to ~1 bacterium/100 ul and then inoculated into 5 or 10 96-well plates, depending on the rarity of positive hits, and quantifying growth through spectrophotometry. Wells in which the absorbance values at 600 nm for greater than one standard deviation above the average for all wells were considered positive for growth. Wells with positive growth had bacteria isolated by streaking on rich media, transferred to broth cultures, and had stocks made in 15% glycerol that were frozen at –80 °C until needed. Bacteria were chosen for downstream in vitro and in vivo studies (metabolic cohort) by screening a minimum of ten isolates for each target substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Those isolates grown in oxalate or formate-containing media were subsequently enriched in the minimal media and oxalate or formate degradation was validated through broth cultures and ELISA-based assays. Isolates that utilized the greatest amount of oxalate and formate were chosen for the metabolic cohort. For the other substrates, isolates were chosen based on those that exhibited the greatest amount of growth using the target substrates as a sole carbon and energy source, based on absorbance values at 600 nm. Subsequently, chosen isolates for the metabolic cohort along with isolates for the taxonomic cohort underwent PCR with the 27 F and 1492 R primers to amplify the 16 S rRNA gene. Amplicons were purified and sequenced with Sanger sequencing to determine or validate taxonomy and purity.

The samples were then placed briefly in a water bath at 37 °C and placed on dry ice. An aliquot of each sample was taken out for protein concentration measurement. Then, 150 μL of chilled acetonitrile containing internal standards (Betaine-d9, Carnitine-d9, Orinithine-d6, Valine-13C3, Tyrosine-13C, 15 N, Estrone-13C3, and Cholesterol-13C3) was added to the remaining samples followed by centrifugation at 14,000 g for 10 min to precipitate out the protein pellet. The supernatants were recovered and transferred to fresh tubes. The samples were dried briefly and re-suspended in 2% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid for subsequent LCMS analysis. One-microliter aliquots taken from each sample were pooled and this QC standard was analyzed every 10 injections. The untargeted metabolomics was performed by injecting 0.5 uL of each sample onto a 10 cm C18 column (Thermo Fisher CA) coupled to a Vanquish UHPLC running at 0.35 mL/min using water and 0.1% formic acid as solvent A and acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid as solvent B. The 15 min gradient used is given below. The Orbitrap Q Exactive HF was operated in positive and negative electrospray ionization modes in different LC-MS runs over a mass range of 50–750 Da using full MS at 120,000 resolution. The data-dependent acquisitions were obtained on the pooled QC sample. The DDA acquisition (DDA) includes MS full scans at a resolution of 120,000 and HCD MS/MS scans taken on the top 10 most abundant ions at a resolution of 30,000 with dynamic exclusion of 4.0 s and the apex trigger set at 2.0–4.0 s. The resolution of the MS2 scans were taken at a stepped NCE energy of 20.0, 30.0, and 45.0.</p><p>XCMS was used to deconvolute the data using 5 ppm consecutive scan error, 7–75 s as minimum and maximum peak width, S/N threshold of 10, and span of 0.2 in positive and negative electrospray ionization modes for retention time correction. The resulting peak table was normalized to total protein concentration and further analyzed via MetaboLyzer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Mak et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, the ion presence threshold was set at 0.7 in each study group. Data were then log-transformed and analyzed for statistical significance via non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test. Ions present in just a subset of samples were to be analyzed as categorical variables for presence status via Fisher’s exact test. All p-values were set to be corrected via the Benjamini-Hochberg step-up procedure for false discovery rate (FDR&lt;0.05). The data could then be utilized for PCA, putative identification assignment, and pathway enrichment analysis via KEGG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Okuda et al., 2008</xref>), HMDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib156">Wishart et al., 2018</xref>), LIPIDMAPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">O’Donnell et al., 2019</xref>), and BioCyc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Karp et al., 2019</xref>) databases.

The Autometa algorithm takes assembled contigs as input, bins the data to genomes using contig coverage values, GC content, and the Barnes-Hut t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (BH t-SNE) distribution of the contigs. Taxonomy is assigned based on the consensus classification of all contigs in a genomic bin. Completeness and purity calculations are based on the presence of known, unique universal single-copy genes in Autometa. After genomic binning, the contigs were oriented and scaffolded in CSAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Chen et al., 2018</xref>), which compares the genomic bins to reference genomes of close relatives. Gaps within the genomes were filled with Abyss-Sealer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Simpson et al., 2009</xref>) using the original raw sequencing reads as input. The completeness and purity of genomes were recalculated and taxonomic assignment was validated through phylogenetic analysis of the de novo constructed genomes in comparison with all complete NCBI genomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), achieved through Phylophlan, using the ‘—accurate’ parameter which considers more phylogenetic positions at the cost of computational speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Asnicar et al., 2020</xref>). Phylophlan allows for the phylogenetic analysis of bacteria and archaea using complete genomes rather than gene amplicons, which provides greater resolution on phylogenetic analysis.

Multiple, independent molecular, animal, and in vitro experimental models were introduced into this research. The authors found that microbiome composition influenced multiple oxalate-microbe-host interfaces. Oxalobacter formigenes were only effective against a poor oxalate-degrading microbiota background and give critical new insights into why clinical intervention trials with this species exhibit variable outcomes. Data suggest that, while heterogeneity in the microbiome impacts multiple diet-host-microbe interfaces, metabolic redundancy among diverse microorganisms in specific diet-microbe axes is a critical variable that may impact the efficacy of bacteriotherapies, which can help guide patient and probiotic selection criteria in probiotic clinical trials.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. The main message of this research, is that through complex modelling, we believe we have identified the critical variable (metabolic redundancy) that is responsible for the efficacy of probiotics designed to reduce oxalate levels, thus allowing for improved patient selection in clinical trials. We also believe that this process and the critical features identified can be translated to other critical microbial functions such as short chain fatty acid synthesis, secondary bile acid synthesis, and others.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Strengths:</p><p>The paper has made significant progress in both the depth and breadth of scientific research by systematically comparing multiple experimental methods across multiple dimensions. Particularly through in-depth analysis from the enzymatic perspective, it has not only successfully identified several key strains and redundant genes, which is of great significance for understanding the functions of enzymes, the characteristics of strains, and the mechanisms of genes in microbial communities, but also provided a valuable reference for subsequent experimental design and theoretical research.</p><p>More importantly, the establishment of a novel research approach to probiotics and gut microbiota in this paper represents a major contribution to the current research field. The proposal of this new approach not only breaks through the limitations of traditional research but also offers new perspectives and strategies for the screening, optimization of probiotics, and the regulation of gut microbiota balance. This holds potential significant value for improving human health and the prevention and treatment of related diseases.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comments. We believe that the approach taken here, which contrasts with conventional reductionist techniques, will be critical for translating gut microbiome research into actionable therapeutic approaches.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>While the study has excellently examined the overall changes in microbial community structure and the functions of individual bacteria, it lacks a focused investigation on the metabolic cross-feeding relationships between oxalate-degrading bacteria and related microorganisms, failing to provide a foundational microbial community or model for future research. Although this paper conducts a detailed study on oxalate metabolism, it would be beneficial to visually present the enrichment of different microbial community structures in metabolic pathways using graphical models.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this critique. In the current study, we broadly examined the response of the gut microbiota to dietary oxalate. Based on initial shotgun metagenomic results, we focused in on specific taxa and metabolic functions. Through metagenomic and multiple culture-based studies, we quickly honed in on redundancy in oxalate-degrading function as a key feature for oxalate homeostasis. We believe that the defined microbial community we used for microbial transplants (particularly the taxonomic cohort) provides a strong, minimal community to explore oxalate homeostasis further. In fact, we are using this consortium in multiple follow-up studies to fully understand the cross-feeding that may occur among these microorganisms, as you suggest. We note that figure 3 shows the change of species and metabolic pathways with oxalate exposure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, the authors have done a commendable job in studying the roles of key bacteria. If the interactions and effects of upstream and downstream metabolically related bacteria could be integrated, it would provide readers with even more meaningful information. By illustrating how these bacteria interact within the metabolic network, readers can gain a deeper understanding of the complex ecological and functional relationships within microbial communities. Such an integrated approach would not only enhance the scientific value of the study but also facilitate future research in this area.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We note that based on the collective data obtained in this study, that redundancy in the oxalate degradation is the critical feature that maintains oxalate homeostasis. However, we are interested potential metabolic interactions between microbes in our defined community and are currently investigating these interactions through extensive investigations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Using the well-studied oxalate-microbiome-host system, the authors propose a novel conceptual and experimental framework for developing targeted bacteriotherapies using a three-phase pre-clinical workflow.

The innovation relies on the third phase since phase I and phase II are the dominant approaches everyone in the microbiome field uses.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. As you note, the proposed phases I and II are the predominant approaches used. In fact, many clinical trials have been conducted to try and reduce urine oxalate in patients, based solely on mechanistic studies with Oxalobacter formigenes. As noted in our manuscript, only 43% of those studies results in the intended outcome, necessitating the approach we took in the current study. Our results suggest that the reason for the high rate of failure, despite well established mechanisms, is due to insufficient patient selection that focused only on the presence or absence of <italic>O. formigenes</italic>, which is a species that exhibits very low prevalence and abundance in the human gut microbiota, normally.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors used a multidisciplinary approach which included:</p><p>(1) fecal transplant of two distinct microbial communities into Swiss-Webster mice (SWM) to characterize the host response (hepatic response-transcriptomics) and microbial activity (untargeted metabolomics of the stool samples) to different oxalate concentrations;</p><p>(2) longitudinal analysis of the N. albigulia gut microbiome composition in response to varying concentrations of oxalate by shotgun metagenomics, with deep bioinformatic analyses of the genomes assembled; and</p><p>(3) development of synthetic microbial communities around oxalate metabolisms and evaluation of these communities' activity in oxalate degradation in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these comments. In the complex modelling approach, we focused on complete microbiota from host species known to have high and low capacities for oxalate tolerance, combined with targeting specific metabolic functions vs. specific taxa that may include unknown functions important for oxalate metabolism. Further, we examined the influence of our target communities on oxalate metabolism through multiple in vitro and in vivo studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>However, I have concerns about the frame the authors tried to provide for a 'complex system theoretical approach' and how the data are interpreted within this frame. Several of the conclusions the authors provide do not seem to have sufficient data to support them.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We have tried to address these concerns by adding an exhaustive figure that broadly represents our complex modelling approach that includes potential complex system-based hypotheses, how they were tested, and the host-microbiome-oxalate interactions found in our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Major Concerns</p><p>(1) The authors argue about the importance of bringing 'Complex System Theory' to the microbiome field systematically and consistently. However, the authors fail to introduce this theory throughout the entire manuscript. For example, the authors tried to describe key elements and their nomenclature, such as nodes and fractal layers, in the first part of the result section. But the description is wordy and not precise. It would be more useful if the authors connected the model description with a visual representation, such as a figure. Unfortunately, these elements are not emphasizing and carried across the results section and are not mentioned in the discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added a figure (Figure 7) that details this process extensively and ties each of our findings to the complex system model and nomenclature. We have also reiterated how our results fit in the complex system model in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, there is no straightforward approach to integrating multi-omics datasets to identify the variables that are determinants of the system. For example, Figure 1 focuses on the impact of the host, hepatic activity, to oxalate exposure on fecal transplants into Swiss Webster mice; Figure 2 focuses on the effects of oxalate exposure on stool metabolic activity, not only microbial metabolic activity, on fecal transplants into Swiss Webster mice; and Figure 3 focuses on microbiome responses to different oxalate concentration in Neotoma albigula. There is no &quot;model&quot; to really integrate the host, the microbiome activity, and the microbiome composition information. And, unfortunately, the data generated between experiments cannot directly integrate; see major concern # 2.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We have made more clear the experimental approach and how it applied to understanding the critical factors that maintain oxalate homeostasis. Specifically, Figure 1 established that the effect of oxalate on the host was dependent on the microbiota, rather than host genetics. Figure 2 established the effect of oxalate on the gut microbiota was again dependent on the whole gut microbiota and that these oxalate-microbe effects also influenced oxalate-host effects through a direct multi-omic data integration. Once we established that the oxalate effects on host and microbiota were dependent on the whole microbiota composition, Figure 3 then sought to figure out how oxalate impacted the gut microbiota, using our model of high oxalate tolerance (<italic>N. albigula</italic>). With the finding in Figure 3 that there were multiple genes attributed to the degradation of oxalate, or acetogenic, methanogenic, and sulfate reducing pathways, Figure 4 and relevant supplemental figures sought to quantify the redundancy of these pathways. After establishing a very high degree of redundancy, we sought to use a culturomic approach to determine what environmental factors impacted oxalate metabolism and to evaluate oxalate metabolism using our defined, hypothesized communities of microorganisms. Finally, figure 6 sought to validate our metagenomic, metabolomic, and culturomic results from multiple animal and in vitro models using targeted microbial transplants in mice. While we did have some direct multi-omic data integration (Figures 2 and 3), the process employed here sought to systematically determine which factors were most important for the oxalate-microbiota-host relationship, and then to use those results to design the subsequent experiments. We have added this description to the discussion, which helps to contextualize the complex system modelling approach we took here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the authors did not provide a novel variable that successfully influences oxalate degradation in the oxalate-microbiome-host system. The authors argue that &quot;both resource availability and community composition impact oxalate metabolism,&quot; which we currently inferred by the failure of the clinical tries and do not provide a clear intervention strategy to develop functional bacteriotherapy. The identification of composition as an important variable that was predictable without any multi-omics approach was highlighted by the development of synthetic microbial communities. Synthetic microbial communities are critical to characterizing complex microbiomes. Still, the authors did not explain how this strategy can be used in their theoretical framework (that is their goal), and these communities are not well introduced across the manuscript; see major concern # 4.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated, it is clear from the failed clinical trials that we do not fully understand what microbial features dictate oxalate homeostasis. We have specifically identified, through fecal transplant studies, that microbial composition is critical for oxalate homeostasis and that diverse oxalate-degrading bacteria exist. However, ours is the first study that explicitly shows that it is this diversity that controls oxalate homeostasis. This is specifically ascertained through the targeted microbial transplants in mice whereby <italic>O. formigenes</italic> was given alone or with different combinations of other microorganisms. In other words, we were able to replicate both successful and failed studies by manipulating which specific species were introduced into animals. This is unprecedented in the literature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors provide several conclusions that are not completely supported by the data available. For example:</p><p>(a) Lines 236-239: &quot;Within the framework of complex systems, results show microbe-host cooperation whereby oxalate effectively processed within the SW-NALB gut microbiota reduced overall liver activity, indicative of a beneficial impact.&quot; - The authors did not provide data related to oxalate levels of oxalate processing for this dataset.</p></disp-quote><p>While we did not specifically quantify oxalate degradation for this specific study, as cited in the text when describing this Swiss-Webster, Neotoma albigula system, we have previously published multiple animal studies explicitly showing that the <italic>N. albigula</italic> animals were highly effective oxalate degraders, which is transferable to Swiss-Webster mice through fecal transplants. Since the gut microbiota’s impact on oxalate has been welll established through experiments by our group, the purpose of these specific experiments were to look the other way and examine the effect of oxalate on the gut microbiota of these two animal models. In the referenced text, we again cited our studies showing that the SW-NALB system effectively degrades oxalate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(b) Lines 239-243: &quot;Data also suggest that both the gut microbiota and the immune system are involved in oxalate remediation (redundancy), such that if oxalate cannot be neutralized in the gut microbiota or liver, then the molecule will be processed through host immune response mechanisms (fractality), in this case indicated through an overall increase in hepatic activity and specifically in mitochondrial activity.&quot; - The authors did not provide any evidence related to the immune system and oxalate metabolism.</p></disp-quote><p>We corrected that statement as follows: “…in this case indicated through an overall increase in inflammatory cytokines with oxalate exposure combined with an ineffective oxalate-degrading microbiota (Figures S6a,b; S9a,b).” In other words, if the liver and gut microbiota can’t eliminate a toxin, then the immune system must deal with it through inflammatory pathways. Oxalate is a well established, pro-inflammatory compound. Our data show that this is dependent on the gut microbiota.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(c) Lines 250-252: &quot;Following the diet trial, colon stool was collected post-necropsy and processed for untargeted metabolomics, which is a measure of total microbial metabolic output.&quot; - Although most metabolites in stool samples are indeed microbial, there are also host metabolites. So, it is not technically correct to relate the metabolomic analysis of stool samples to only microbial metabolic analysis. In addition, the authors discussed compounds such as alkaloids and cholesterol as microbial metabolites, which these compounds are more related to the diet and host correspondingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected this to state: “total metabolites present in stool from the diet, microbial activity, and host activity”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(d) Lines 270-273. &quot;Specifically, the SW-NALB mice exhibit hallmarks of homeostatic feedback with oxalate exposure to maintain a consistent metabolic output, defined by the relatively small, net negative, microbial metabolite-hepatic gene network compared to the large, net positive, network of SW-SW mice.&quot; - How do the authors define oxalate homeostasis? In addition, do the authors imply feedback between the liver and the microbiome in which the microbiome responds to a liver response related to oxalate levels? Or could the observation in Figure 1 be explained just by microbial consumption of oxalate that would reduce the impact of oxalate that arrives at the liver?</p></disp-quote><p>Oxalate homeostasis is defined in that sentence: “relatively small, net negative, microbial metabolite-hepatic gene network compared to the large, net positive, network of SW-SW mice” – in other words, for SW-NALB mice, oxalate did not produce a considerable change to either microbial or hepatic metabolic activity. We did not really test the liver impact on gut microbiota and can’t speak to that. We believe, based on Figure 2 data, that it is not just the degradation of oxalate that explains the lack of change in hepatic activity in SW-NALB mice, rather that the oxalate-induced shift in the gut microbiota metabolic activity broadly altered hepatic activity, as inferred from Figure 2 c. We made this more clear in the results: “suggests that the oxalate-induced change in microbial metabolism is responsible for the change in hepatic activity”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(e) Lines 297-301: &quot;The oxalate-dependent metagenomic divergence of the NALB gut microbiota (Figure 3), combined with the lack of change in the microbial metabolomic profile with oxalate exposure (Figure 2), suggest that oxalate stimulates taxonomically diverse, but metabolically redundant microorganisms, in support of maintaining homeostasis.&quot; - The authors cannot conclude anything related between taxonomic changes and microbial activity since the taxonomic data presented is for microbial enrichment in N. albigulia, and the &quot;microbial activity data&quot; is from the fecal transplantation experiment in SWM. These are two completely different systems with two completely different experimental designs.</p></disp-quote><p>We have shown very similar results in that oxalate induces the taxonomic divergence for the NALB gut microbiota, in multiple previous studies. The experiment in which a minimal, positive increase in microbial metabolites, was saw with oxalate was based on the SW-NALB model whereby Swiss-Webster mice have an NALB microbiota. We show throughout the manuscript, that the impact of oxalate is very microbiota dependent and supports our claim. However, the claim is hypothesis generating – that metabolic redundancy is important for oxalate homeostasis. We modified our statement to make all of this more clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to microbial composition, the authors did not show data validating the efficiency of the fecal transplantations (allograft or xenograft) in the SWM after antibiotic treatment. They also did not show evidence of microbial composition dynamics in response to oxalate exposure.</p></disp-quote><p>Again, the efficacy of fecal transplants, used in the way they were here, has been shown in multiple past studies of our group. In past studies, we have extensively characterized the microbiota from fecal transplants and which taxa were associated with oxalate levels. Therefore, that topic was not the focus of the current study, instead focusing on the oxalate impact on gut microbiota activity. Our past studies, referenced multiple times through the current manuscript, were used in large part to help determine which microbes to include in our taxonomic cohort, as described in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(f) Lines 301-303: &quot;Given that data came from the same hosts sampled longitudinally, these data also reflect a microbiota that is adaptive to oxalate exposure, which is another important characteristic of complex systems.&quot; - In their dataset, what is the evidence that the microbiota of N. albigulia is adapted to oxalate exposure? Is the increase in genomes with pathways related to oxalate metabolism related to an increase of oxalate in the diet? If so, does the microbiota exposure with a higher oxalate concentration decrease the systemic level of oxalate? In neither of the experiments related to Figures 1 to 3, the authors showed a correlation of systemic oxalate levels with microbial composition, hepatic host response, or stool metabolism.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 3 explicitly shows the longitudinal impact of increasing levels of oxalate showing an increase in oxalate degrading genes (Figure 3d). The specific samples selected for analysis here come from a previous study in which we explicitly quantified changes to the gut microbiota composition and both stool and urine oxalate for every time point listed in figure 3a. This information is explicitly stated in the methods coupled with the fact that “neither fecal nor urinary oxalate levels increased significantly.” Again, the effect of the gut microbiota on oxalate in these model systems have been extensively studied by our group and provide the foundation for the current study to look at the effect of oxalate on the gut microbiota and host.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Considering my last two points, the authors do not present substantial evidence to support their hypothesis that oxalate stimulates taxonomically diverse, metabolically redundant communities.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated above, that oxalate stimulates taxonomically diverse taxa was ascertained through multiple past studies, as well as the current study (Figure 3e). The metabolically redundant part is ascertained both through untargeted metabolomics (Figure 2a,b) and shotgun metagenomics (Figure 3c,d). Further evidence for the metabolic redundancy with oxalate comes from our culturomic approach, which showed that 14.58% of isolates could grow on oxalate as a carbon and energy source, in addition to the high proportion of isolates that could grow on other carbon and energy sources, at least much more than can be ascribed to a single species (Figure 5c). We made this more clear in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(g) Lines 330-335. &quot;Additionally, the broad diversity of species that contain oxalate-related genes suggests that the distribution of metabolic genes is somewhat independent of the distribution of microbial species, which suggests that microbial genes exist in an autonomous fractal layer, to some degree. This hypothesis is supported by studies which show a high degree of horizontal gene transfer within the gut microbiota as a means of adaptation.&quot; - This conclusion is highly speculative, especially since the author did not do any analysis to directly evaluate a relationship between the oxalate metabolic pathways and the microbial species where these pathways are present.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 3c,d,e explicitly shows the metabolic pathways and species enriched by oxalate exposure. Figure 4d, generated using the same data from Figure 3, explicitly shows the taxa that harbor oxalate-degrading genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(h) Lines 364-366. &quot;Collectively, data show that both resource availability and community composition impacts oxalate metabolism, which helps to define the adaptive nature of the NALB gut microbiota.&quot; - The authors indeed showed evidence that community composition impacts oxalate metabolism. However, the authors did not show any evidence to directly evaluate the resource availability to impact oxalate metabolism.</p></disp-quote><p>This is explicitly shown through in vitro community-based and single species assays varying multiple different carbon and energy sources to quantify changes to oxalate degradation (chosen based on shotgun metagenomic results; Figure 5a,b).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Lines 321-325. &quot;Acetogenic genes were also present in 97.18% of genomes, dominated by acetate kinase and formate-tetrahydrofolate ligase (Figure S3A323C). Methanogenic genes were present in 100% of genomes, dominated by phosphoserine phosphatase, atpdependent 6-phosphofructokinase, and phosphate acetyltransferase (Figure S4A-C).&quot; - The authors spent much time analyzing the adjacent pathways related to oxalate and oxalaterelated products of oxalate metabolism. However, my understanding is that the genes used to analyze these pathways (formate metabolism, acetogenesis, methanogenesis), such as the ones named above, are not unique/specific for those pathways but participate in other &quot;housekeeping&quot; pathways. What is the relevance of these analyses when those genes are not unique/specific to the function/pathways that the authors describe? If I infer correctly, these bioinformatic analyses aim to evaluate the hypothesis of whether oxalate metabolism could be a social/cooperation metabolism and whether other species could participate in the metabolism of oxalate subproducts. However, these analyses did not explicitly evaluate this hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct in that we aimed to evaluate the potential that oxalate metabolism could benefit from metabolic cooperation. The specific genes chosen for this analysis were those explicitly listed in the target metabolic pathways in KEGG, as described. However, while the analyses do show the strong potential that the CO2 and formate produced from oxalate degradation could be used in these other pathways, as intended, the genes can be used in other metabolic pathways. We did, however, explicitly test the hypothesis that formate, produced from oxalate degradation, could be utilized by the gut microbiota. While the targeted transplants with the taxonomic cohort did not clearly show the use of formate in this way, those from the metabolic cohort did (Figures 6d and S8d). This question is still in ongoing investigations in our group.</p><p>We have made it more clear that our genome analyses provide the potential for metabolic redundancy rather than definitive proof for metabolic redundancy, which was evaluated more extensively in other experiments from this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(a) Lines 481-484. &quot;Collectively, data offer strong support for the hypothesis that metabolic redundancy among diverse taxa, is the primary driver of oxalate homeostasis, rather than metabolic cooperation in which the by-products of oxalate degradation are used in downstream pathways such as acetogenesis, methanogenesis, and sulfate reduction.&quot; - Although the authors recognize that their data about the metabolic cooperation hypothesis is inconclusive, they never tested the hypothesis related to metabolic cooperation, as mentioned above. This is highly speculative.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated above, the targeted microbial transplants to animals and in vitro studies (Figure 5e,f) did explicitly test the cooperation hypothesis, but it the results did not support it and instead pointed much more strongly to metabolic redundancy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Lines 355-359. &quot;Cohorts, defined in the STAR methods, were used to delineate hypotheses that either carbon and energy substrates are sufficient to explain known effects of the oxalate-degrading microbial network or that additional aspects of taxa commonly stimulated by dietary oxalate are required to explain past results (taxa defined through previous meta-analysis of studies).&quot; - The definition of the metabolic cohorts and the taxonomic cohorts should not be hidden in the material and methods section. It should be explicit and clearly explained in the main text. Related, the table presented in Figure 5D is exceptionally confusing and does not help to understand and differentiate between the metabolic and the taxonomic cohorts. The authors need to explicitly identify the synthetic communities used in each cohort and each group by their members and their characteristics in supplementary tables.</p></disp-quote><p>In the sentences before those referenced, we state: “Culturomic data recapitulates molecular data to show a considerable amount of redundancy surrounding oxalate metabolism (Fig. 5C). Isolates generated from this assay were used for subsequent study (metabolic cohort; Figure 5D). Additionally, a second cohort was defined and commercially purchased based both on known metabolic functions and the proportion of studies that saw an increase in their taxonomic population with oxalate consumption (Fig. 5D; taxonomic cohort). Where possible, isolates from human sources were obtained.” Figure 5d explicitly shows the specific species used in each cohort along with the groups they were in for transplant studies, the explicit metabolic pathways we were targeting, along with the % of studies that these species were associated with oxalate metabolism. All of this information is both in the main text of the results and in the figure legends. It is not hidden in the methods, but the methods do reiterate what was also placed in the results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figures 5 and 6, the authors used the following groups with the corresponding nomenclature: 'Group 1, No_bact; Group 2, Ox; Group 3, Ox_form; Group 4, All; Group 5, No_ox'. Although the information related to these groups is present in the material and method section in lines 1139-1143, the authors also need to explicitly explain the groups and their nomenclature in the main text.</p></disp-quote><p>Since this information is explicitly and succinctly given in the referenced figures, I believe that adding the same information in the text would be too redundant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to the development of the synthetic communities.

Related to the bacteria isolated from the culturomic assays, including Figure 5C and metabolic cohort, the authors indeed reported the isolation methodology in lines 1262-1275. However, there is no information about the sequencing of these isolates. The authors should present these isolates as a list (supplementary table) with their names, taxonomy, metabolic profile, and Genome ID if these genomes were submitted to NCBI.</p></disp-quote><p>We added additional information for how metabolic cohort isolates were chosen and how they were taxonomically identified. The taxonomy and substrate utilization of isolates are in Figure 5D. We did not sequence the genomes of metabolic cohort bacteria. However, the ATCC isolates, which comprise the taxonomic cohort, are publicly available.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The author presented the 248 metagenomics assembles in Figure S1 in a circular chart in context with other genomes.

The authors clearly showed the negative effect of oxalate on the host. Although there are reports in the literature of oxalate consumers with a negative effect on the microbiome, such as Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria, there is no evidence in this manuscript about a negative effect of oxalate on the microbiome, and there is not an experimental design to evaluate it.</p></disp-quote><p>These data are presented in Figure 2A and B. As stated, oxalate led to a net reduction in total microbial metabolites produced of 34 metabolites, with a significant shift in overall metabolome, indicative of metabolic inhibition. This is in comparison to the net gain of 9 metabolites, with no significant shift overall, in the mice with the NALB microbiota. The positive and negative effects of oxalate on the whole gut microbiota here are bolstered by previous studies on the effect of oxalate on pure cultures as discussed and cited on line 623624.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Related to the last section, it is hard to really compare the results of the taxonomic cohort versus the metabolic cohort when the data of one cohort is in the main figure and the other in a supplementary figure. In addition, all the comparisons between the two cohorts seem to be qualitative. For any comparisons, the authors need to do a statistical comparison between the groups of the two cohorts.</p></disp-quote><p>The comparison of the two sets of data are indeed qualitative. This is because these mouse models were run in separate experiments to test separate hypotheses (whether utilization of specific substrates is enough to improve oxalate metabolism or if specific taxa previously responsive to dietary oxalate was better, which is stated in the manuscript). Given that these experimental models were tested separately, it would not be statistically valid to do a direct statistical comparison, even though the experimental procedures were the same and the only difference were the transplanted bacteria. The separation of the experiments into a main and supplemental figure was done out of necessity given the very large amount of data and many experimental mouse models that were run in this study overall.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Comments.</p><p>(1) The authors should define 'antinutrients'.
