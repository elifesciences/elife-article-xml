However, the interactions between these socially relevant regions have yet to be described. In this study, we used resting-state magnetic resonance imaging to explore bonding behaviors and functional connectivity of brain regions previously associated with pair-bonding. Thirty-two male and female prairie voles were scanned at baseline, 24 hr, and 2 weeks after the onset of cohabitation. By using network-based statistics, we identified that the functional connectivity of a corticostriatal network predicted the onset of affiliative behavior, while another predicted the amount of social interaction during a partner preference test. Furthermore, a network with significant changes in time was revealed, also showing associations with the level of partner preference. Overall, our findings revealed the association between network-level functional connectivity changes and social bonding.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Microtus

prairie vole (<italic>Microtus ochrogaster</italic>) is a rodent native of North America whose natural behavior involves pair-bonding, which can be defined as a long-lasting, strong social relationship between individuals in a breeding pair in monogamous species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Walum and Young, 2018</xref>). Pair-bonded voles will usually display selective aggression towards unfamiliar conspecifics; biparental care, including paternal behavior and alloparenting; incest avoidance; and reproductive suppression of adult individuals within a family group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Carter et al., 1995</xref>). These behaviors make the prairie vole a valuable model to investigate behaviors associated with a socially monogamous reproductive strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Young and Wang, 2004</xref>), social bond disruption, social isolation, and social buffering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lieberwirth and Wang, 2016</xref>). Being comparable to human-like social interactions, studying the neurobiology of social behavior in the prairie vole may allow further understanding of human social bonding, its alterations in psychological disorders, and overall impact on health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kiecolt-Glaser et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Pair-bonding-related behaviors in the prairie vole depend on hormonal mechanisms and the activation of emotional, reward, and sensory brain circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Walum and Young, 2018</xref>), integrating large functional networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Johnson and Young, 2017</xref>). Among these, the mesolimbic reward system and the social decision-making network (SDMN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Johnson et al., 2017</xref>) are the proposed networks to be involved in pair-bonding, being modulated by steroid hormones, dopamine (DA), oxytocin (OXT), arginine vasopressin (AVP), γ-aminobutyric acid, glutamate, and corticotropin-releasing factor, among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Walum and Young, 2018</xref>). A current hypothesis suggests that pair-bonding consists of two different plastic processes: the formation of a neural representation of the partner, and a selective preference for the partner, that is the maintenance of the pair-bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Young and Wang, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Walum and Young, 2018</xref>). In this process, an association has to be created between the reinforcing properties of sex (mating) and the olfactory signature from the partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Ulloa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Young and Wang, 2004</xref>). In broad terms, both OXT and AVP are necessary and sufficient for the formation of the pair-bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Young and Wang, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lieberwirth and Wang, 2016</xref>), and their release during social and sexual interactions are the likely triggers and critical modulators of the mentioned network, since most regions included in the SDMN express their corresponding receptor binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Johnson and Young, 2017</xref>). DA would also be released in concert with OXT and AVP in specific regions to modulate the adequate display of behavior and formation of the pair-bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Young and Wang, 2004</xref>).</p><p>While prairie voles of both sexes already display changes in behavior by 24 hr of cohabitation with mating as a result of pair-bonding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wang and Aragona, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Williams et al., 1992</xref>), the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), for example, has substantially more D1-like receptor binding 2 weeks after female exposure, relative to non-pair-bonded males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aragona et al., 2006</xref>), a phenomenon that is also been observed in female voles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Resendez et al., 2016</xref>). This evidence suggests that long-term plasticity is relevant for pair-bond maintenance. Furthermore, male prairie voles that were pair-bonded for 2 weeks displayed selective aggression toward conspecific male and female strangers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gobrogge et al., 2007</xref>), and the 2 week time frame has also been found relevant in bond disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Insel and Hulihan, 1995</xref>) and partner loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tabbaa et al., 2017</xref>). While there is a possibility that these changes in behavior involve the interplay of broad networks, it has not been directly explored in vivo.</p><p>Recently, novel electrophysiologic and optogenetic techniques have been employed to demonstrate that the functional connectivity between the NAcc and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) during initial cohabitation in female prairie voles modulates the affiliative behavior with their potential partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amadei et al., 2017</xref>), providing exciting data of the relevance of such corticostriatal interactions for social bonding. However, this approach does not allow the study of the interaction of multiple brain regions, that is networks, and their relevance of such interactions in the process of pair-bonding. Neuroimaging methods may provide the alternative to explore such networks in a longitudinal fashion, since few studies have made use of positron-emission tomography to explore limited aspects of such longitudinal changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bales et al., 2007</xref>), providing the first longitudinal evidence of neurophysiological changes associated with pair-bonding. Potentially, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) may be the ideal tool to explore the longitudinal changes in functional brain networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Damoiseaux et al., 2006</xref>), providing high spatial resolution, wide brain coverage, and being minimally invasive to explore longitudinal changes. In particular, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) explores the low-frequency fluctuations (&lt;0.1 Hz) of the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal, which has proven to remain highly synchronized within the sensory, motor, and associative networks in the brain of humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Damoiseaux et al., 2006</xref>), non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rilling et al., 2007</xref>), and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gozzi and Schwarz, 2016</xref>), including the prairie vole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ortiz et al., 2018</xref>), turning this technique into a promising tool for translational research. Indeed, functional connectivity explored by means of the correlation of rsfMRI signals of anatomically separated brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Friston et al., 1993</xref>) has demonstrated to be correlated with neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mateo et al., 2017</xref>), and it is subject to change in plastic processes such as learning and memory in both humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jolles et al., 2013</xref>) and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nasrallah et al., 2016</xref>). A recent study found differences in diffusion-weighted imaging and resting-state functional connectivity between two distinct populations of male prairie voles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ortiz et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we make use of this non-invasive technique to explore behavioral correlates with brain functional connectivity and its longitudinal changes associated with pair-bonding in male and female prairie voles.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Baseline functional connectivity predicts the display of affiliative behavior</title><p>Thirty-two 3-month-old sexually naïve female (N = 16) and male (N = 16) prairie voles (<italic>M. ochrogaster</italic>) were used in the study. Prairie voles underwent three magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisition sessions: a baseline scan before cohabitation, a second scan 24 hr after the onset of cohabitation, and a third scan 2 weeks after the onset of cohabitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The final imaging sample consisted of 90 datasets, with only six subjects missing one session (see Materials and methods). The day after the baseline scanning session, female and male voles unrelated to each other were randomly assigned as couples and placed for cohabitation in a new home to promote ad libitum mating and social interaction. Four days before cohabitation, silastic capsules (Dow Corning Silastic Laboratory Tubing; ThermoFisher Scientific, Pittsburg, PA) containing estradiol benzoate (E2B; Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) were implanted in previously ovariectomized female voles to enable sexual receptivity and promote mating (see Materials and methods). The first 6 hr of cohabitation was video recorded for analysis of social and mating behavior. Mount (M ± SEM: 65.4 ± 31.7 min), intromission (116 ± 35.3 min), and ejaculation (125 ± 34.4 min) latencies were obtained for male voles (N = 16). Lordosis latency (22.3 ± 13.3 min) was also measured on females (N = 16), and huddling latencies (69.5 ± 15.8 min) were obtained for each male and female pair. Three of the 16 couples did not mate during the recorded period, but all voles displayed huddling and licking/grooming behavior with their sexual partner. Once joined, voles remained housed in couples for the rest of the experiment and were only separated for MRI scanning sessions and behavioral tests.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental design and brain regions of interest.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sequence of experiments during a 30 day period: Female voles were bilaterally ovariectomized before MR and behavioral protocols. After being allowed to recover from surgery for 10 days, silastic capsules containing E2B (estradiol benzoate) were implanted via s.c. 4 days before cohabitation for sexual receptivity induction.

However, longitudinal explorations of the brain before and after pair-bonding are scarce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bales et al., 2007</xref>), especially from a network perspective. Here, by using rsfMRI, we were able to detect a brain network in which baseline functional connectivity (before cohabitation) predicted the latency for huddling behavior during the first hours of cohabitation, providing the potential neurofunctional substrate for the variability in affiliative behavior and further extending the recent findings that the corticostriatal electric activity modulates social bonding in prairie voles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amadei et al., 2017</xref>). A relationship between functional connectivity and social interaction was also found, in which a network detected from data obtained 24 hr after the onset of cohabitation predicted the amount of social interaction during the PPT. Finally, our results reflected significant longitudinal changes in functional connectivity of prairie voles after pair-bonding. Post hoc analyses revealed differential short- and long-term connectivity changes mainly involving the lateral septum (LS), with three network connections correlating with the level of partner preference in different sessions. We further discuss the potential neurophysiological basis and implications of our findings.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Correlations between network functional connectivity and social behavior</title><p>Although each of the identified networks would likely act as a whole or possess emergent properties, in the following text, we mention previous evidence in rodents that may aid in their functional interpretation, and each component will be dissected in segments to better understand node relationships and their putative role in social bonding and related behavior.</p><p>Even though it has been reported that in prairie voles, 24 hr of cohabitation or 6 hr of ad libitum mating is sufficient for a pair-bond to be developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Williams et al., 1992</xref>), a considerable amount of evidence has shown that other factors influence its development and maintenance. Specifically, AVP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ophir et al., 2008</xref>) and OXT receptor gene expression and density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">King et al., 2016</xref>), paternal nurturing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahern and Young, 2009</xref>), and neonatal isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Barrett et al., 2015</xref>) have shown to produce variability in the exhibition of prairie vole social behavior. Though they were under the same experimental conditions, subjects from both sexes in this study showed a wide behavioral variability not only during their sexual encounters in the first hours of cohabitation, but also in their bonding behavior evaluated between 48 and 72 hr after the onset of cohabitation. It is likely that the sum of previously mentioned factors gives each subject a distinctive brain network configuration that ultimately relates to bonding behavior. Hence, we hypothesized that there may be individual differences in functional connectivity that could explain the variability in socio-sexual behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Correlation with huddling latencies</title><p>Indeed, we identified a network for which the functional connectivity at baseline was negatively related to huddling latencies during the first hours of cohabitation. In other words, baseline functional connectivity predicted how quickly subjects would begin affiliative huddling with an opposite-sex conspecific. Huddling is a measurable affiliative behavior in prairie voles and a useful indicator of social receptiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Salo et al., 1993</xref>). The network included the following connections: VP–MeA–LS–VTA–RSC–PVN, PVN–RSC–BLA–NAcc–ACC–NAcc, and BLA–DG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This network has regions reported to be involved in social salience, social memory and recognition, spatial memory, and reward-seeking mechanisms. Therefore, it is possible that subjects that exhibited huddling at an earlier time found it more rewarding than those who did not.</p><p>The VP plays a major role in reward and motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Smith et al., 2009</xref>). Since MeA activity in rodents is necessary for social recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ferguson et al., 2001</xref>) and responds to sex-specific chemosensory cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wang and Young, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yao et al., 2017</xref>), increased MeA-VP connectivity may improve the rewarding response of sex-related social interaction. Additionally, DA neurons are reported to modulate VP responses evoked by amygdala stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Maslowski-Cobuzzi and Napier, 1994</xref>). The LS is a structure involved in social recognition and retrieval of relevant social information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bielsky et al., 2005</xref>), in addition that it is known to be anatomically interconnected with regions involved in social behavior, including the hippocampus and the MeA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Risold and Swanson, 1997</xref>). In rats, it has been shown that OXT release in the LS is required for the maintenance of social memory and may also be modulated by the MeA according to the relevance of the social stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lukas et al., 2013</xref>). It is likely that MeA-LS connectivity further integrates social information. LS–VTA–RSC functional connections, through the VTA, may contribute to linking contextual information with the midbrain DA system and regulate motivational behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Luo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Maeda and Mogenson, 1981</xref>), since the RSC is known to be involved in the processing of spatial and contextual memory in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Todd and Bucci, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Connectivity between PVN–RSC–BLA may be related to an association of a spatial context with a socially salient stimuli. While OXT projections from PVN may probably influence the regulation of social salience in the whole network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Johnson et al., 2017</xref>), it is also reported to be sensitive to external stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anacker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Liu et al., 2001</xref>) that can impact OXT synthesis and release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Smith and Wang, 2014</xref>). The BLA may act as an associative site for stimulus-outcome representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cardinal et al., 2002</xref>), which would allow an appropriate response according to previous social encounters, information that possibly requires hippocampus-associated memory (BLA-DG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Frey et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tashiro et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In a previous report, the BLA and the ACC were found relevant in coordinating brain activity when social interaction is initiated and in the formation of social recognition memory through gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tanimizu et al., 2017</xref>). The NAcc is known to translate reward-predictive information from the amygdala (BLA–NAcc) to promote cue-evoked, reward-seeking behavioral responses in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ambroggi et al., 2008</xref>), while the ACC has been considered an important region in the decision-making process between sensory perception, motivation, and final motor performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Assadi et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, input from the ACC (NAcc–ACC) may be necessary for a social decision-making process. It is important to note that a recent study demonstrated this particular circuit may be unique in prairie voles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Horie et al., 2020</xref>), and in female prairie voles, the functional connectivity of the prefrontal cortex and NAcc after the first encounter predicts affiliative huddling toward a partner, and the activation of such circuit biases later preference toward a partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amadei et al., 2017</xref>). Our results extend such findings, showing that a larger network including similar corticostriatal connectivity, measured even before the exposure to a potential partner, predicts affiliative behavior. Moreover, such relation is consistent for both males and females, and the circuit includes the amygdala and hippocampus, as predicted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amadei et al., 2017</xref>. Overall, the functional connectivity of this network may indicate the predisposition of a prairie vole to engage in prosocial behavior, which might be influenced by previous experience and other factors mentioned beforehand.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Correlation with amount of social interaction</title><p>A network component detected at 24 hr after the onset of cohabitation, LS–NAcc–mPFC–MeA–VP–MOB–DG, was negatively correlated with the amount of social incentive a subject would have during the partner preference test, a test in which it interacted with two conspecifics of the opposite sex, one being the partner and the other a stranger vole. Interestingly, this component includes five regions from the huddling network previously described, and all but two nodes (MeA–VP) are related differently when comparing it with the former network.</p><p>Regardless of the level of preference for the partner, prairie voles of both sexes had a differential interest in engaging socially. While the huddling network is related to pre-pair-bonding affiliative behavior, this network is necessarily related to post-bonding behavior, since it was only detected 24 hr after the onset of cohabitation. It is possible that functional connectivity of this component is associated with the modulation of a behavioral response, that is approach or avoidance, according to social olfactory cues that may be rewarding according to previous experience. Besides its social recognition role, in rodents the LS is reported to modulate reward response by decreasing neuronal activity in the NAcc through AVP release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gárate-Pérez et al., 2021</xref>). The NAcc–mPFC pathway has been widely characterized as modulating reward-seeking, goal-oriented behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gill et al., 2010</xref>), and the mPFC and the amygdala are extensively interconnected and tune the expression of fear and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Marek et al., 2013</xref>). The involvement of the MeA–VP hints modulation of sex-related social interaction, particularly via chemosensory stimuli (MOB-DG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Castro et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Liu et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our data suggests that functional connectivity 24 hr after the onset of cohabitation has a relationship to the level of sociability, reflecting a phenotype independent of pre-bonding behavior and partner preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Further investigation of this network would be necessary to understand the impact of sociability in other behaviors, such as mate-territory guarding and parental nurturing. Apparently, its change in modulation is on a short term, since a correlation at 2 weeks of cohabitation was not found and other regions or networks may play this role on a long-term basis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Longitudinal changes in functional connectivity after pair-bonding</title><p>It has been proposed that pair-bonding results from the convergence of the mesolimbic DA reward circuit and social discrimination circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Walum and Young, 2018</xref>). The results here presented are consistent with this model, by demonstrating both short- and long-term changes in a brain network including regions largely associated with reward/motivation (ACC, VTA, NAcc, VP) and the social decision-making network, specifically related to sensory contextualization (BLA, LS, RSC, dHIP), saliency processing (LS, ACC, VTA), and memory formation and retrieval (vHIP, dHIP, mPFC, RSC).</p><p>Changes in functional connectivity after 24 hr after the onset of cohabitation may result from familiarization of a new spatial context that also implies a novel social context, that is exposure to new housing and to a novel, opposite-sex conspecific stranger. During this process, subjects are exposed to novel stimuli and engage in their first socio-sexual interactions, forming new memories of the partner and after-bonding behaviors such as mate and territorial guarding may appear. As mentioned earlier in this section, functional connectivity changes detected at 2 weeks after the onset of cohabitation may be related to long-term modulation of behavior as a result of social bonding, in which the partner and its associated cues become salient/rewarding and the pair-bond enters a maintenance phase. In general, these temporally dynamic functional connectivity changes may be related to the modulation of socio-sexual interactions with the partner and add a level of complexity that can be glimpsed due to the longitudinal analysis of the data. While the nodes here identified are interconnected into a larger network and their precise contribution to complex social behavior remains elusive to our methods, their potential role will be discussed based on previous results and the connectivity patterns here identified.</p><p>The lateral septum (LS) strikes as a relevant region in the modulation of social behavior, appearing as a hub that may integrate or relay spatial, contextual, and reward information between the ventral striatum and limbic regions, with cortical areas and hippocampal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wirtshafter and Wilson, 2020</xref>). The hippocampus may also participate as an important relay region, being anatomically connected to the DG, RSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sugar et al., 2011</xref>), VTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gasbarri et al., 1994</xref>), and the prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Preston and Eichenbaum, 2013</xref>). Twenty-four hours after the onset of cohabitation, the LS showed a decrease of functional connectivity with the dHIP; in mice, silencing this circuit decreases social aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Leroy et al., 2018</xref>). At the same period, an increase of connectivity between the LS and the RSC was also identified, which may be related to contextual memory acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Opalka and Wang, 2020</xref>) and possibly associate social information with a spatial context. This change of connectivity may involve relay from the hippocampus, since anatomical projections between them are known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Risold and Swanson, 1997</xref>). In regard to the VP, it has been reported that its stimulation increases c-fos expression in regions including the LS and could be mediating reward processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Panagis et al., 1997</xref>). The increase of connectivity between the latter regions seems to be on a relatively short term.</p><p>Social interaction would necessarily require new memory consolidation and, possibly, formation of the neural representation of the partner. Our data showed functional connectivity changes occurred in the hippocampus 24 hr after the onset of cohabitation (ACC–vHIP, LS–dHIP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), which has demonstrated to be critical in encoding spatial and mnemonic information in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lin et al., 2017</xref>). ACC–vHIP activity has been associated with the regulation of fear in novel environments and in contextual fear generalization in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bian et al., 2019</xref>). However, the vHIP has also shown to contribute in social memory processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chiang et al., 2018</xref>), and the ACC is proposed to integrate new information to modify future behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kolling et al., 2016</xref>). Increased ACC–vHIP connectivity could be related to social memory formation, but it may also be related to higher anxiety triggered by a new spatial and social environment.</p><p>In regard to functional connectivity changes 2 weeks after the onset of cohabitation, a long-term increase of connectivity was detected between the LS–mPFC, while a decrease was found in ACC–LS connectivity. It is enticing to propose that the LS is necessary for conspecific recognition and subsequent modulation of behavior, since AVP administration enhances pair-bond formation in prairie voles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Liu et al., 2001</xref>), and male voles exposed to females have increased Fos-immunoreactive cells in the LS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wang et al., 1997</xref>). In rats, OXT release in the LS is also required for the maintenance of social memory, modulated by the relevance of the social stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lukas et al., 2013</xref>). Consequently, LS connectivity changes might be related to long-term social recognition and behavior modulation, mediated by afferents from prefrontal structures, that is the mPFC and the ACC (ACC–LS–mPFC). The aforementioned ACC may have a role in saliency regulation and in decision-making processes, while the mPFC is proposed to have a role in the initiation, maintenance, and modulation of social attachment and behavior in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ko, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tanimizu et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We also observed a decrease of connectivity between NAcc and VTA by the 2 week period. Considering the NAcc is densely innervated by VTA DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Steinberg et al., 2014</xref>), the after-bonding decrease of connectivity between these two regions may reflect the plasticity events necessary for pair-bond maintenance, in which D1-like receptor upregulation induces a long-term behavioral state in which stranger voles are attacked or avoided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aragona et al., 2006</xref>). In mice, VP neuron activity drives positive reinforcement through projections to the VTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Faget et al., 2018</xref>). The long-term increase of functional connectivity between these two regions suggests they may play a role in the maintenance of the bond through positive reinforcement.</p><p>Functional connectivity between the mPFC and the dHIP was increased. The dorsal region of CA2 has been characterized as a hub for sociocognitive memory processing in rodents, specifically for social memory encoding, consolidation, recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Meira et al., 2018</xref>), and social recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hitti and Siegelbaum, 2014</xref>). Also, the mPFC has been proposed as a critical region for remote memory retrieval and for memory consolidation, reportedly relying on the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Euston et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, their increased interaction could support the integration of new memories into pre-existing networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Preston and Eichenbaum, 2013</xref>) and, potentially, in the incorporation of the partner into long-term memory representations. Indeed, OXT receptor activation in dHIP promotes the persistence of long-term social recognition memory in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lin et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Lastly, we detected a decrease of BLA–NAcc connectivity between 24 hr and 2 weeks of cohabitation. It has been proposed that these regions regulate social reward processing in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ambroggi et al., 2008</xref>) and may facilitate pair-bonding in prairie voles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Horie et al., 2020</xref>). Our results suggest that these regions may encode the reward-predictive cue, that is the partner, during bond establishment, but other regions could be involved in the maintenance of the bond, such as VP–VTA and NAcc–VTA.</p><p>Although both AVP and OXT have been proposed to have sex-differentiated roles in pair-bond formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Young and Wang, 2004</xref>), the functional connectivity here explored showed no significant differences between sexes or significant sex-session interactions. Sexual dimorphism may still be present in a structural level, but the outcome of brain functional connectivity could remain similar between sexes.</p><p>Even though our results show ample individual variability in display of behavior as much as in brain functional connectivity, our analysis was able to capture group-wise consistent changes for both female and male prairie voles, suggesting these could be crucial in modulating social behavior after cohabitation with mating independently of the strength of the pair-bond. We propose that the long-term functional connectivity changes observed in the network are related to social bonding and may lead to pair-bonding induction and maintenance.</p><p>Concerning gICA, the obtained FWE-corrected P statistics found no significant differences between sessions. This being a voxel-wise type of analysis that implies multiple comparisons with its respective correction, gICA maps may not be sensitive enough to detect punctual, region-specific changes in brain functional connectivity. While ICA in rsfMRI is a valuable method with advantageous properties for identifying spatio-temporal signal sources that are not well-characterized or well-understood, different methods of analyses such as NBS seem more suitable for the aim of our study, which was to investigate the relationship between social behavior and functional connectivity, as well as the exploration of changes of connectivity in specific regions as a consequence of social bonding.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Correlation of brain functional connectivity with partner preference</title><p>While consistent longitudinal changes in connectivity were present in our data, we wanted to explore whether some of these nodes had a relationship with the level of partner preference, which captures the strength of the pair-bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Williams et al., 1992</xref>), which was evaluated between 48 and 72 hr after the onset of cohabitation.</p><p>Positively, our results highlight the role of functional circuits in individual variability of social behavior, in which regions previously associated with reward processing are most relevant in determining bonding behavior. These correlations are dynamic in time, and each may contribute to the encoding and behavioral outcome of the pair-bond.</p><p>LS–VP baseline connectivity positively predicted the level of partner preference. It has been reported that AVP receptor overexpression in VP induces partner preference in socially promiscuous meadow voles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lim et al., 2004</xref>). Twenty-four hours after the onset of cohabitation, a negative correlation was found between BLA–NAcc connectivity and partner preference. Variation in OXT receptor density in the NAcc relates to partner preference in prairie voles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">King et al., 2016</xref>). Two weeks after the onset of cohabitation, LS–RSC negatively correlated with partner preference. Previous work demonstrated that AVP receptor expression in the RSC predicts sexual fidelity and territorial behavior in male prairie voles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ophir et al., 2008</xref>) and may reflect different mating tactics, that is ‘wanderer’ or ‘resident’, in which resident voles maximize mating success through mate guarding and reduced territory space, in contrast to wanderers that overlap many home ranges to increase opportunistic mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Getz et al., 2005</xref>). Our findings suggest that the baseline state of reward circuits (LS–VP) may influence initial bond development that will be encoded and established by BLA–NAcc, but long-term pair-bond maintenance may be modulated by social-reward, context-related regions (LS–RSC). In general, network functional connectivity variability may also reflect behavioral diversity influenced by genetic and environmental factors.</p><p>The prairie vole has proven to be a valuable model that has enabled the characterization of the neurobiological mechanisms behind complex socio-sexual behaviors, potentially useful to understand human social bonding and its alterations in psychological disorders. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate correlations between social bonding with brain functional connectivity, as well as time-dependent changes of multiple interacting brain regions (networks) of male and female prairie voles in cohabitation with mating. However, there are some limitations related to the use of rsfMRI. First, the animals were scanned under anesthesia, which may potentially alter the brain functional connectivity. Yet, we have used an anesthesia protocol that practically preserves the functional interactions as in the awake state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Grandjean et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Paasonen et al., 2018</xref>) and that has not been reported to significantly alter rsfMRI and BOLD response in longitudinal sessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamczak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Weber et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>). Although functional neuroimaging of awake prairie voles is possible, the acclimation process may induce significant stress and even increase the risk of physical harm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Yee et al., 2016</xref>), limiting the longitudinal design and the interpretation of the results.</p><p>Second, unlike male voles, female voles were subjected to surgical procedures and hormonal treatment before the MR scanning sessions. Although male voles are not precise controls for females, no significant differences were identified between male and female voles, behavior-wise or in rsfMRI connectivity. Also, since no significant longitudinal changes in functional connectivity were found in brain structures not expected to be involved in social behavior, the observed changes may be mostly related to social bonding and behavior. However, a control group with no behavioral protocols and same hormonal conditions as the ones reported in this study is desirable to confirm that there are no confounding effects in the longitudinal analysis.</p><p>Third, the precision in the definition of the ROIs is limited by the shape and the size of the voxels, being hard to assure that the defined regions specifically and uniquely include signal from the anatomical ROIs. Nevertheless, we are certain that the defined ROIs include the actual ROIs, and at the least, the changes here reported are related to those areas and their surrounding tissue. It is important to note that functionally connected nodes may not necessarily have direct axonal projections to each other, and the interaction between nodes could be mediated or relayed through other structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Friston et al., 1993</xref>). Also, contrary to other electrophysiological or neuropharmacological methods, functional MRI captures an indirect measure of neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim and Ogawa, 2012</xref>). However, it poses the great advantage that it allows the longitudinal exploration of the brain, with the best spatial resolution and wider coverage that any imaging method can achieve non-invasively. The consistency of our results with recent findings using direct electrophysiology readings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amadei et al., 2017</xref>) further supports their relevance in identifying the neurophysiology of complex social behaviors. With evidence from previous reports as support, ROIs analyzed in this study constitute at least three different networks and have multiple roles in the development, establishment, and maintenance of social bonding. Additional research is required to increase understanding on their precise role in prairie vole behavior.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings suggest the existence of several functional brain networks involved in the modulation of social bonding in the prairie vole. Network-based statistics revealed a network involving cortical and striatal regions in which its functional connectivity predicted the onset of affiliative behavior, and another overlapping network was associated with the amount of social interaction after pair-bonding. Furthermore, a network with significant changes in time was revealed, with the lateral septum playing a role as a central hub that connects prefrontal and cortical regions with regions from the limbic system and the ventral striatum. Additionally, the retrosplenial cortex-lateral septum, lateral septum-ventral pallidum, and basolateral amygdala-nucleus accumbens functional connectivity correlate with the level of partner preference. In summary, brain functional connectivity allows exploring the mechanisms that underlie individual variability in the expression of socio-sexual behavior, enabling its prediction, and sexual experience and long-term cohabitation induce network-wide changes in socio-sexual relevant circuits. Overall, these results provide a novel approach and analyses to further investigate the neurophysiology of complex social behaviors displayed in the prairie vole.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Network-Based Statistic Toolbox</td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20600983">20600983</ext-link></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_002454">SCR_002454</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Network-Based R-Statistics</td><td valign="top">doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.07.373019">10.1101/2020.11.07.373019</ext-link></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_019114">SCR_019114</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">nlme</td><td valign="top">CRAN</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_015655">SCR_015655</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">FSL</td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21979382">21979382</ext-link></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_002823">SCR_002823</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">ANTS – Advanced Normalization ToolS</td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20851191">20851191</ext-link></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_004757">SCR_004757</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">ggplot2</td><td valign="top">CRAN</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_014601">SCR_014601</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">GraphPad Prism</td><td valign="top">GraphPad</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_002798">SCR_002798</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">MATLAB</td><td valign="top">MathWorks</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Dexmedetomidine</td><td valign="top">Zoetis</td><td valign="top">PubChem CID: <break/>5311068</td><td valign="top">s.c. bolus dose:0.05 mg/kg</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Isoflurane</td><td valign="top">PiSA</td><td valign="top">PubChem CID: 3763</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">β-Estradiol 3-benzoate</td><td valign="top">Sigma</td><td valign="top">PubChem CID: 222757</td><td valign="top">Dose: 0.5 mg/mL dissolved in corn oil</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Dow Corning Silastic Laboratory Tubing</td><td valign="top">ThermoFisher Scientific</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Length of tubing for capsule: 1.7 cm</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Thirty-two 3-month-old sexually naïve female (<italic>N</italic> = 16) and male (<italic>N</italic> = 16) prairie voles (<italic>M. ochrogaster</italic>) were used in the study. The animals were housed in a temperature (23°C) and light (14:10 light–dark cycle) controlled room and provided with rabbit diet HF-5326 (LabDiet, St. Louis, MO) oat, sunflower seeds, and water ad libitum. These voles were previously weaned at 21 days, housed in same-sex cages, and were descendants of voles generously donated by Dr. Larry J. Young from his colony at Emory University. The number of subjects per group is comparable to the largest sample sizes using rsfMRI in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bajic et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Christiaen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Grandjean et al., 2014</xref>). All surgical, experimental, and maintenance procedures were carried out in accordance with the ‘Reglamento de la Ley General de Salud en Materia de Investigación para la Salud’ (Health General Law on Health Research Regulation) of the Mexican Health Ministry that follows the National Institutes of Health’s ‘Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals’ (NIH Publications No. 8023, revised 1978). The animal research protocols were approved by the bioethics committee of the Instituto de Neurobiología, UNAM.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Surgical procedures</title><p>Fourteen days before the experimental protocol, female voles were bilaterally ovariectomized. After recovery, silastic capsules (Dow Corning Silastic Laboratory Tubing; ThermoFisher Scientific, Pittsburg, PA) containing estradiol benzoate (E2B; Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) dissolved in corn oil (0.5 mg/mL of E2B) were implanted via s.c. to induce sexual receptivity 4 days before cohabitation protocol and remained implanted during the entire experimental protocol. Females in Microtus species are induced ovulators and do not show cyclic changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Taylor et al., 1992</xref>), and for the purpose of this experiment, estrogen-in-oil capsule implantation allowed a stable and equal hormonal dose in all female subjects. The corresponding dose and procedure reliably induced sexual receptivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ingberg et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Anesthesia for image acquisition</title><p>Animals were anesthetized to avoid stress and excessive movement during scanning sessions. Isoflurane at 3% concentration in an oxygen mixture was used for induction and positioning in the scanner bed, in which the head was immobilized with a bite bar and the coil head holder. Once voles were securely placed in the scanner bed, isoflurane anesthesia (Sofloran; PiSA, Mexico) was adjusted at a 2% concentration and a single bolus of 0.05 mg/kg of dexmedetomidine (Dexdomitor; Zoetis, Mexico) was administered subcutaneously. Five minutes after the bolus injection, isoflurane anesthesia was lowered and maintained at 0.5%. MRI acquisition started when physiological readings were stabilized (~15 min after bolus injection). The use of both anesthetics has been reported as optimal for rsfMRI acquisition in rodents and closely resemble an awake condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Grandjean et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Paasonen et al., 2018</xref>), yet the mentioned combination of dose and administration route were previously standardized for this specific protocol in prairie voles (unpublished data). Body temperature was maintained with a circulating water heating pad within the scanner bed, respiration rate was monitored with an MR-compatible pneumatic pillow sensor, and blood oxygen saturation was measured with an MR-compatible infrared pulse-oximeter (SA Instruments Inc, Stony Brook, NY). After the scanning sessions, animals were monitored until fully recovered and transferred back to their housing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Image acquisition</title><p>MRI acquisition was conducted with a Bruker Pharmascan 70/16US, 7 Tesla magnetic resonance scanner (Bruker, Ettlingen, Germany), using an MRI CryoProbe transmit/receive surface coil (Bruker, Ettlingen, Germany). Paravision-6 (Bruker, Ettlingen, Germany) was used to perform all imaging protocols. Before running the fMRI sequence, local field homogeneity was optimized within an ellipsoid covering the whole brain and skull using previously acquired field maps. rsfMRI was acquired using a spin-echo echo-planar imaging (SE-EPI) sequence: repetition time (TR) = 2000 ms, echo time (TE) = 19 ms, flip angle (FA) = 90°, field of view (FOV) = 18 × 16 mm<sup>2</sup>, matrix dimensions = 108 × 96, yielding an in-plane voxel dimensions of 0.167 × 0.167 mm<sup>2</sup>, and slice thickness of 0.7 mm, total volumes acquired = 305 (10 min and 10 s). EPI bandwidth was 288,461.5 Hz, the number of slices was 25, pi pulse (refocusing pulse) duration was 1.5455 ms with 2200.0 Hz bandwidth, and pi/2 (excitation pulse) was 1.9091 ms and 2200.0 Hz, respectively. After the rsfMRI sequence, an anatomical scan was obtained using a spin-echo rapid acquisition with refocused echoes (Turbo-RARE) sequence with the following parameters: TR = 1800 ms, TE = 38 ms, RARE factor = 16, number of averages (NA) = 2, FOV = 18 × 20 mm<sup>2</sup>, matrix dimensions = 144 × 160, slice thickness = 0.125 mm, resulting in isometric voxels of size 0.125 × 0.125 × 0.125 mm<sup>3</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Cohabitation and behavior analysis</title><p>Female and male voles unrelated to each other were randomly assigned as couples and placed for cohabitation in a new home cage with fresh bedding to promote ad libitum mating and social interaction. The first 6 hr of cohabitation was video recorded for subsequent analysis of social and mating behavior: mount, intromission, and ejaculation latencies from male voles; lordosis latency from females; and huddling latencies for each male and female pair. In male voles, mount latency was scored if it straddled the female from behind with pelvic thrusting, a continued mount behavior with repetitive thrusting was scored as intromission latency, and ejaculation latency was scored if after intromission and deeper thrusting an evident period of male inactivity was followed. Lordosis latency was scored if the female vole adopted an immobile posture with concave back flexion, neck extension, elevation of the hindquarters, and tail deviation to facilitate male mounting and intromission. Some females displayed lordosis reflex as pre-mounting behavior and were scored for lordosis latency. Since the onset of behaviors such as grooming or licking involve social contact and may overlap with huddling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Burkett et al., 2016</xref>), in this study huddling latency was only scored if there was continuous, side-to-side bodily contact for at least 10 s. Once joined, voles were housed in couples for the remaining of the experiment and were only separated for MRI scanning sessions and behavioral tests.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Partner preference test</title><p>Subjects underwent a 3 hr PPT to evaluate pair-bond formation. This protocol was based on a previously described test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Williams et al., 1992</xref>) and was performed in custom-built, three-chambered clear plastic arenas divided by perforated clear plastic barriers that allowed visual, auditory, and olfactory contact, but not physical interaction or mating behavior between subjects. In the central chamber, the vole being tested could roam freely, and time spent in the incentive areas at opposite sides of the chamber was recorded. The incentive areas were defined as the proximal space next to the chambers with its ‘partner’ or with an opposite-sex, novel ‘stranger’ vole. All stranger voles were unrelated to subjects in the test and had the same age and hormonal condition than the sexual partner. On each test, partner or stranger voles were randomly and alternately positioned on the opposite chambers of the arena. Each subject was tested only once in the PPT, either at 48 hr or at 72 hr after the onset of cohabitation. If a vole had PPT (assigned randomly and alternately) at the 48 hr period, its partner was tested at the 72 hr period to enable rest between tests and avoid excessive stress. PPT data analysis was performed with <italic>UMATracker</italic> software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yamanaka and Takeuchi, 2018</xref>), which allowed quantification of the proportion of time spent with each of the stimulus voles. The percentage of time spent on the area related to the partner and of the area of the stranger were obtained. From this data, a partner preference index was calculated for each subject, consisting of the proportion of time spent on the area related to the partner divided by the proportion of time spent on both social incentive areas (time with partner plus time with stranger vole).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Imaging data pre-processing</title><p>Imaging data pre-processing was performed with FMRIB’s Software Libraries (FSL; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jenkinson et al., 2012</xref>) and Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Avants et al., 2011</xref>) for spatial registration. To avoid initial signal instability, the first five volumes of each functional series were discarded. The slice-timing correction and motion correction were applied, using the first non-discarded volume as reference. The reference volume was also taken to determine the deformable transformation to the corresponding anatomical image. The resulting transformation was combined with a non-linear transformation to a prairie vole brain template obtained from previously published work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ortiz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Functional images were later warped to the brain template and resampled to a resolution of 0.16 × 0.16 × 0.7 mm<sup>3</sup>. To minimize physiological confounds, the first five eigenvectors (time series) within the combined non-gray matter mask were obtained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Behzadi et al., 2007</xref>), since recent findings have shown that vascular, ventricle, and white matter signal regression enhances functional connectivity specificity from rsfMRI data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Grandjean et al., 2020</xref>). These eigenvectors and the six motion parameters (three rotations, three displacements) were regressed out from each subject’s functional series. Datasets were band-pass filtered to retain frequencies between 0.01 and 0.1 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gorges et al., 2017</xref>). Finally, smoothing was applied with a box kernel with size of three voxels, using FSL.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Functional connectivity analysis</title><p>Regions of interest (ROIs) were manually defined on the anatomical prairie vole brain template, visually guided with the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lein et al., 2007</xref>), to select the minimum possible number of voxels that included/covered the respective region. Connectivity matrices were calculated using MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA) as follows: first, the average time series for each region were extracted from the pre-processed fMRI datasets and then, partial-correlation estimates were obtained for all possible pairs of ROIs, partialing out the remaining time series. Before analysis, correlation values were Fisher z-transformed. For each region, seed-based functional connectivity maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), as well as signal-to-noise ratio values, were generated for the assessment of data quality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5C</xref>).</p><p>Due to technical problems, two subjects missed the baseline MRI acquisition (session 1), and two subjects missed the 2 week cohabitation MRI acquisition (session 3). Additionally, two baseline datasets showed signal loss in the dorsal cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). The final imaging sample consisted of 90 datasets, with only six subjects missing one session.</p><p>Correlations between behavioral data and functional connectivity were assessed with the NBS framework, using the NBS Toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zalesky et al., 2010</xref>), which estimates the statistical significance of clusters of connections (networks) by comparing their strength with a null distribution of such property obtained with 5000 permutations of the original data. Since the NBS Toolbox is restricted to general linear hypothesis testing, the longitudinal data was analyzed with linear mixed models (LMM), implemented via the Network-Based R-statistics package (NBR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gracia-Tabuenca and Alcauter, 2020</xref>), which allows to implement LMM in an NBS framework. Also, NBR restricts the permutation of within-subject data based on the random variables. Specifically for functional connectivity longitudinal analysis, LMM were fitted for each connection (edge) considering sex (male, female) as a fixed variable, and session (baseline, 24 hr, and 2 weeks of cohabitation) and intercept as random variables. Those edges with significant (p&lt;0.05) sex, session, or interaction effects at this level were used to identify sets of connected nodes, that is components or networks, and their statistical strength (sum of their statistical estimates, Z-values) were compared with a null distribution of the largest clusters from the statistical tests of the permutated data (5000 permutations), this being the NBS framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zalesky et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Group-independent component analysis</title><p>gICA was applied using FSL’s melodic (FSL; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jenkinson et al., 2012</xref>) on the same pre-processed images previously used in this study, only the female and male prairie voles that underwent all three MR scanning sessions were included on the analysis (n = 26), each subject having three different pre-processed images (n = 78). The number of components was set to 10, as described in previous work in prairie voles by our own group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ortiz et al., 2018</xref>). To identify connected voxels over background, gICA maps were scaled to Z-scores and thresholded voxel-wise at Z ≥ 2.3 based on a Gaussian/Gamma mixture model and an alternative hypothesis testing approach. These gICA maps were visually inspected and labeled according to their anatomical distribution and location of their maximal regions, with additional visual guidance from the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lein et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data in the study is presented as <italic>mean</italic> ± <italic>standard error of the mean</italic> unless otherwise noted. Partner preference was explored with one-tailed Mann–Whitney U tests given that Shapiro–Wilk normality tests revealed that such data was not normally distributed. Behavioral data was analyzed with GraphPad Prism 5 (<italic>GraphPad</italic> Software, La Jolla, CA).</p><p>The NBS Toolbox was used with a level of significance of p&lt;0.05 to identify networks (sets of connections) with significant linear associations with behavioral data. Correlation matrices were not thresholded for NBS analyses, but a fixed threshold of T &gt; 1.7 was used to define the connections with significant associations, for both the actual test and the corresponding tests for the permuted data (5000 permutations). A posteriori Pearson’s two-tailed correlation tests were obtained for each edge within the significant networks and were depicted with R software package ggplot2 (ggplot2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wickham, 2016</xref>) to better describe the relationships between specific connections and the associated behavior.</p><p>Implementation of LMM in NBR relies on the ‘nlme’ R package (nlme; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pinheiro et al., 2017</xref>) to fit LMM at the edge level and integrate them with the permutation tests required for the NBS framework. Since the degrees of freedom in LMM may vary for each variable (e.g., F(1,30) for Sex vs F(2,56) for Session), the edge-wise threshold was defined at p&lt;0.05. Similar to the GLM-based NBS, no initial threshold was applied to the connectivity matrices prior to LMM-based NBS. To better describe the differences between sessions for each edge in the significant networks, estimated marginal means post hoc comparisons were used for LMM and were corrected for an FDR q &lt; 0.05.</p><p>In order to evaluate whether networks found through gICA maps had significant changes between sessions, dual regression was applied on the spatial maps from the group-average analysis to generate subject-specific associated time series and the corresponding spatial maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Beckmann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nickerson et al., 2017</xref>). First, for each subject, the group-average set of spatial maps was regressed into the subject’s 4D space-time dataset, obtaining a set of subject-specific time series, one per group-level spatial map. Next, those time series were regressed into the same 4D dataset, resulting in a set of subject-specific spatial maps, one per group-level spatial map (n = 10). Group differences across sessions were assessed using FSL’s randomize permutation-testing tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Winkler et al., 2014</xref>), in which two-sample paired t-tests were used (session 1 vs session 2, session 1 vs session 3, and session 2 vs session 3, respectively), given that an adequate anova version is not available in randomize for this experimental design.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Fernando A Barrios for his valuable comments to the manuscript, and Deisy Gasca, Martín García, Alejandra Castilla, Leopoldo González Santos, Nuri Aranda López, and Ma.

The authors found that in both males and females partners there is a connectivity changes in specific brain networks (including the ACC, VTA, LS and the hippocampus) associate with pair bonding formation. Moreover, they found that partner preference evaluated at 48 or 72 hours of cohabitation, predicted long-term functional connectivity between the medial amygdala and the ventral pallidum.</p><p>All reviewers agreed that the findings are interesting and novel. Reviewer #1 noted that &quot;The authors went to great length to scan a relatively large number of animals and also did a very good job with analyses of resting-state data, which can be tricky at times.&quot;</p><p>Few important concerns were raised which require to be dealt in the revised submission. Generally the three reviewers agreed that the essential revision could be dealt with in the text.</p><p>The revisions should include additional analyses, greater level of methodological detail, additional clarity and explanation of the measured behaviors and statistics, thorough discussion to address the issue of lack of control for the temporal dimension or other control groups. Also, all reviewers agreed that the title should be revised as it is misleading.</p><p>The reviews are included in their entirety below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>My main major comments regard (1) the lack of controls for the temporal dimension; and (2) the lack of figures showcasing the quality of the data acquired (and potential processing pipeline effects). These could probably be addressed without any specific new experiments but would require quite a bit of new analyses.</p><p>1) Control for the 2w temporal dimension</p><p>a) While I understand that the surgery and capsule implantation are commonplace for behavioral or neurophysiological experiments, I am worried that they may introduce some temporal confounds that – to my understanding of the Materials and methods – have not been accounted for. How do we know that the some of the changes in female rsfMRI patterns do not covary with recovery from surgery / hormonal cycles? In an ideal scenario, a control group with no behavior would have been added. However, this can also be mentioned as a confounding factor in the Discussion, and the authors could probably reason against this possibility using prior neurophysiological data.</p><p>b) Along the same line, the authors should also present data from ROIs that are NOT expected to be related with social behavior, to control for some of these potential confounders.</p><p>2) Quality of experiments.</p><p>While again commending the authors for the large number of animals scanned for this study, I would need to see figures with raw data to estimate the levels of artifacts in the original images and how they were addressed. For example, were ghosts detected along the time series? How were these dealt with?</p><p>To assess all these, I'd expect the authors to include figures with (a) representative raw data from the rsfMRI scans (to show the quality of the raw data arising from the cryogenic coil); (b) time series analyses in ROIs before/after preprocessing; (c) corresponding maps of rs connectivity, along with connectivity matrices for the different brain areas for the different conditions.</p><p>These could be presented as supplementary data, although for me it makes sense to include in the main document.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>1) Can the choice of huddling latency be justified in more detail? I don't know whether a reader would appreciate the meaning of this measure.</p><p>2) On a similar note: partner preference indexes, being calculated by dividing the time spent huddling with the Partner over the total time spent huddling, seem like they might miss out on differences in total social contact, which could be interesting. That is, a vole with 5 seconds spent huddling with its Partner and 10 seconds total huddling would have an equivalent preference index (0.5) as a vole that spent 5 minutes huddling with its Partner and 10 minutes total huddling (0.5), but these would strike me as very different phenotypes. Total time spent huddling could be an interesting variable to consider alongside the latency to huddle and preference index.</p><p>3) While I appreciate the careful consideration taken to select ROIs for this study, a strength of whole brain neuroimaging often comes from its ability to survey all brain regions simultaneously and thereby discover regions previously not known to be involved. Social neuroscience has a list of &quot;usual suspects&quot; and it may be the case that other brain regions that have not yet been implicated in pair bonding could still be important. An exploratory analysis could therefore be useful to the field.</p><p>4) I appreciated the presentation of the findings. The time-dependent changes, particularly the acute plastic changes were interesting. I also appreciated the figures' presentation of individual data points and longitudinal trends. That said, the effects do not appear very large, since the distributions overlap so much. Of course, there could still be large effects with overlapping distributions if there was just large individual variation that stayed consistent from time point to time point, but that doesn't appear to be the case for most brain regions. Perhaps violin plots would show the distributions and effect sizes more clearly than box plots? This is something I have struggled with in the past as well, and finding a reliable data visualization solution isn't trivial.</p><p>5) Subsection “Partner preference measured between 48h and 72h of cohabitation predicts long-term functional connectivity between MeA and VP” – What was the strength of the correlation between partner preference and MeA-VP connectivity at two weeks of cohabitation? I think the reader would assume all brain region correlations were examined, but were all time points considered as well? I imagine there would be difficulties considering the large number of tests being run, but it also seems like measures from the baseline scan pre-bonding would be the most relevant?</p><p>6) Each partner in a pair was tested as the subject in a PPT. Were their preferences for one another correlated? That is, if a male showed a high preference index for his female, was that reciprocated?</p><p>7) The Materials and methods state &quot;correlation values were Fisher's z-transformed&quot; so the reader does not have a sense of how strong the connectivity truly is between two regions, rather, what is shown is how strong the connectivity is between two regions relative to the connectivity between two randomly selected regions. Somewhere the range of correlation strengths should be noted.</p><p>This manuscript does an admirable job distilling a large number of measures and results down into manageable take-home messages for the reader.</p><p>To my knowledge, there has not been much work done distinguishing the phases of 24 hours post introduction to 2 weeks post introduction. I think the reader would benefit from knowing why this time point was chosen. The subsection “Longitudinal changes in functional connectivity after pair bonding”, mentions mate and territorial guarding but these behaviors would have been present by 24 hours.</p><p>8) As shown in Figure 3A, the mPFC showed consistent declines in functional connectivity. Beyond my facetious first reaction that this shows romance does indeed impair higher order cognitive processes, I think this is an interesting finding. However, the authors then state &quot;A long-term increase of connectivity was detected between the LS with the mPFC&quot; which doesn't appear to agree with Figure 3A unless I'm misunderstanding something.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>1) The first and most fundamental is that there is no control group, and so interpretation of temporal changes associated with bonding assumes that repeated anesthesia and time had no effect on patterns of functional connectivity. Are there any studies that explicitly address this concern? They cite two studies suggesting their protocol &quot;practically preserves the functional interactions as in the awake state&quot;, but this falls short of addressing the possibility that repeated anesthesia might change their measures. I really wish they had allocated some of their effort to examining a suitable control-group (sib-housed, age-matched adults, in which control females were OVX + E implanted).</p><p>2) The second is that use of NBS and its integration with the LMM is insufficiently described. I cannot tell how they did their analyses based on the provided description (subsection “Statistical analysis”).</p><p>3) Apparently the connectivity matrix that serves as an input to NBS is based on the partial correlation matrix at each time point. What was the threshold the authors used to define connectivity? This is essential for the NBS statistic but I could not find it in the Materials and methods or Results.</p><p>4) Subsection “Functional connectivity analysis”, they say that linear mixed models were fit, but they are not explicit about what the dependent variables are for these models. The following sentence says that networks &quot;with significant sex, session or interaction effects were identified based on the Network Based Statistics.&quot; It is not at all clear what this means. NBS are tests for longer-than-random spans of significant links. Did they simply use NBS to identify significant spans of linkages, and then test each region that went into a significant span with an LMM? The following sentence makes it sounds as though the connections themselves were defined by significant effects of sex or time, not by correlations. The &quot;Statistics&quot; and &quot;Functional connectivity&quot; subsections of the Materials and methods need to be revised in order to be appropriately evaluated. Please be explicit about the relationship between the LMM and the NBS.</p><p>5) If sex and time were part of the NBS analysis, I would also ask the authors to be explicit about how they executed the permutation test of the NBS statistic. I assume they permuted the assignment of both sex and time. Did they preserve the structure of between-individual variation?</p><p>6) I have similar concerns about the relationship between NBS and correlations with behavior. I found the methods of analysis hard to follow.</p><p>7) I had some concerns about mating and bonding in the study. Regarding the estradiol-in-oil implant method, how long do females remain in behavioral estrus in this condition? Preventing pregnancy and extending estrus may distort the dynamics of bonding.</p><p>8) The authors only recorded mating behavior over 6h. On a related note, the strength of partner preference seems surprisingly weak (counting each subject as independent across a total 32 tests, but p only ~0.03-0.04); the authors claim an n=32, but tested 32 subjects twice (48h and 72h). In the subsection “Statistical analysis”, the authors say they used a Mann Whitney U, but in Figure 2, they seem to show results of the 2 partner-preference tests lumped together. The authors should be explicit about this analysis to ensure they have not pseudoreplicated their sample size. (If they included 64 tests from 32 individuals in 16 pairs, that would certainly seem to be a problem with pseudoreplication.) Moreover, some pairs did not mate in the 6 hour window. It seems possible that some of the effects of the 2 week vs. 24h time period might be due to the lack of mating in the initial 24h period. I wonder how the results would change if they excluded animals who didn't mate and/or showed no partner preference?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55081.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>My main major comments regard (1) the lack of controls for the temporal dimension; and (2) the lack of figures showcasing the quality of the data acquired (and potential processing pipeline effects).

First, we have extended the description of female prairie voles hormonal conditions to highlight the need of such implantation. The following text has been added in the Materials and methods subsection “Surgical procedures”:</p><p>“Females in <italic>Microtus</italic> species are induced ovulators and do not show cyclic changes (Taylor et al., 1992), and for the purpose of this experiment, estrogen-in-oil capsule implantation allowed a stable and equal hormonal dose in all female subjects. The corresponding dose and procedure has reliably induced sexual receptivity in rodents (Ingberg et al., 2012).”</p><p>Although male voles are not precise controls for females, we did not identify any significant longitudinal changes between females and males, nor in functional connectivity nor in behavioral tests, which could have been potentially attributed to the surgery. As suggested by the reviewer we have included a brief discussion within the limitations of the study, including the reference to the ideal scenario of a control group. The following text is now included:</p><p>“Second, unlike male voles, female voles were subjected to surgical procedures and hormonal treatment before the MR scanning sessions. […] However, a control group with no behavioral protocols and same hormonal conditions as the ones reported in this study is desirable to confirm there are no confounding effects in the longitudinal analysis.”</p><p>Finally, in order to highlight the relevance of the brain-behavior associations here presented as suggested by the editor, we now present behavioral associations with functional connectivity as the main results, then we show the longitudinal changes, highlighting those with significant associations with social behaviors, and discussing the potential limitations of our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Along the same line, the authors should also present data from ROIs that are NOT expected to be related with social behavior, to control for some of these potential confounders.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion.

[…] Linear mixed models (LMM) implemented via the Network-Based R-statistics package (NBR; Gracia-Tabuenca and Alcauter, 2020) considering sex as a fixed variable, and session and intercept as random variables, found no significant networks with differences between sessions (pFWE=0.1568), nor sex*session interactions (pFWE=0.619 and pFWE=0.3554), suggesting that in both female and male prairie voles, cohabitation with mating and social bonding do not influence changes in functional connectivity in these regions between any session (baseline, 24h and 2 weeks after the onset of cohabitation).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Quality of experiments.</p><p>While again commending the authors for the large number of animals scanned for this study, I would need to see figures with raw data to estimate the levels of artifacts in the original images and how they were addressed.

I don't know whether a reader would appreciate the meaning of this measure.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We have extended the description of the relevance of this measure in the study of social behaviors. The following text has been added in the Materials and methods subsection “Cohabitation and behavior analysis”:</p><p>“The amount and proneness to affiliative behavior has shown reliability in describing the level of sociability and mating systems in Microtus voles. […] Other studies in voles have also measured huddling latency to assess levels of affiliative behavior, since it may influence pair bond induction and formation (Shapiro et al., 1990; Amadei et al., 2017).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) On a similar note: partner preference indexes, being calculated by dividing the time spent huddling with the Partner over the total time spent huddling, seem like they might miss out on differences in total social contact, which could be interesting. That is, a vole with 5 seconds spent huddling with its Partner and 10 seconds total huddling would have an equivalent preference index (0.5) as a vole that spent 5 minutes huddling with its Partner and 10 minutes total huddling (0.5), but these would strike me as very different phenotypes. Total time spent huddling could be an interesting variable to consider alongside the latency to huddle and preference index.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting observation. As a reminder, as mentioned in the “Partner Preference Test” subsection in Materials and methods, due to the physical restrictions placed on the chamber, instead of measuring time spent huddling, we measured the percentage of time spent in the incentive areas related to the partner or the stranger vole. Therefore, the partner preference index was calculated by dividing the percentage of time spent on the partner social incentive area over the percentage of time spent on both social incentive areas.</p><p>To address the particular question of variability in total social interaction during the test, the proportion of time spent on social incentive areas over the total recorded time was calculated for all subjects. The average percentage of time spent on social incentive areas over the total time of the test was 79.70 ± 2.65 %. Spearman correlation analyses showed that the amount of time spent on social incentive areas had no relationship with the partner preference index (rs(30)=0.08912 p=0.6277), (see new Figure 4—figure supplement 1). However, we tested if functional connectivity 24h after the onset of cohabitation had a relationship with the total time spent on social incentive areas during the test, regardless if it interacted with the partner or stranger prairie vole (<italic>N=32</italic>). Using the NBS toolbox, a significant positive linear relationship (<italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.013) was found with the following network component: LS-NAcc-mPFC-MeA-VP-MOB-DG (Figure 4A).The correlation strength between each connected node was obtained with a posteriori Pearson correlations: LS-NAcc (r(30) = -0.369, <italic>p</italic> = 0.037), NAcc-mPFC (r(30) = -0.312, <italic>p</italic> = 0.081), mPFC-MeA (r(30) = -0.373, <italic>p</italic> = 0.034), MeA-VP (r(30) = -0.376, <italic>p</italic> = 0.033), VP-MOB (r(30) = -0.531, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001), and MOB-DG (r(30) = -0.404, <italic>p</italic> = 0.021) (Figure 4B-G).</p><p>This findings suggest that the lower the connectivity between these regions 24h after the onset of cohabitation, the longer the subject would interact with a conspecific of the opposite sex (known or unknown) during the PPT, which was evaluated between 48 and 72h after the onset of cohabitation. Hence, it reflects a phenotype independent both from pre-bonding behavior and partner preference, since regardless of the preference for the partner, prairie voles of both sexes had a differential interest in engaging socially. We have added this new result in the Results section:</p><p>“During the partner preference test (PPT), the proportion of time spent on social incentive areas over the total recorded time was calculated for analysis in all subjects (see Materials and methods). […] The correlation strength for each connection in such network was obtained with a posteriori Pearson correlations: LS–NAcc (r(30) = -0.369, p = 0.037), NAcc–mPFC (r(30) = -0.312, p = 0.081), mPFC–MeA (r(30) = -0.373, p = 0.034), MeA–VP (r(30) = -0.376, p = 0.033), VP–MOB (r(30) = -0.531, p = 0.001), and MOB–DG (r(30) = -0.404, p = 0.021) (Figure 4B-G.”</p><p>The results are commented in the Discussion section:</p><p><bold>“</bold>A network component detected at 24h after the onset of cohabitation, LS–NAcc–mPFC–MeA–VP–MOB–DG, was negatively correlated with the amount of social incentive a subject would have during the Partner Preference Test, a test in which it interacted with two conspecifics of the opposite sex, one being the partner and the other a stranger vole. […] Apparently, its change in modulation is on a short term since a correlation at 2 weeks of cohabitation was not found and other regions or networks may play this role on a long-term basis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) While I appreciate the careful consideration taken to select ROIs for this study, a strength of whole brain neuroimaging often comes from its ability to survey all brain regions simultaneously and thereby discover regions previously not known to be involved.

An exploratory analysis could therefore be useful to the field.</p></disp-quote><p>Undoubtedly, exploratory analyses are useful for the discovery of regions not previously suspected to be involved in a particular behavior. To address the exploration of large-scale functional brain networks, we have included a gICA in the following sections:</p><p>Results section:</p><p>“Group independent component analysis (gICA) was also performed to address the exploration of large-scale functional brain networks and potential differences between sessions. […] However, the obtained FWE-Corrected P statistics found no significant differences between sessions. Being this a voxel-wise method, it may not be sensitive enough to detect punctual, region-specific changes in brain functional connectivity.”</p><p>Discussion section:</p><p>“Group independent component analysis (gICA) was also performed to address the exploration of large-scale functional brain networks and potential differences between sessions. […] Being this a voxel-wise method, it may not be sensitive enough to detect punctual, region-specific changes in brain functional connectivity.”</p><p>Materials and methods:</p><p>“gICA was applied using FSL’s melodic (FSL; Jenkinson et al., 2012) on the same pre-processed images previously used in this study, only the female and male prairie voles that underwent all 3 MR scanning sessions were included on the analysis (n=26), each subject having 3 different pre-processed images (n=78). […] These gICA maps were visually inspected and labeled according to their anatomical distribution and location of their maximal regions, with additional visual guidance from the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas (Lein et al., 2007).”</p><p>Materials and methods subsection “Statistical analysis”:</p><p>“In order to evaluate if networks found through gICA maps had significant changes between sessions, dual regression was applied on the spatial maps from the group-average analysis to generate subject-specific associated timeseries and the corresponding spatial maps (Beckmann et al., 2009; Nickerson et al., 2017). […] Group differences across sessions were assessed using FSL's randomise permutation-testing tool (Winkler et al., 2014), in which two-sample paired t-tests were used (session 1 vs. session 2, session 1 vs. session 3, and session 2 vs. session 3, respectively), given that an adequate anova version is not available in randomise for this experimental design.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) I appreciated the presentation of the findings. The time-dependent changes, particularly the acute plastic changes were interesting. I also appreciated the figures' presentation of individual data points and longitudinal trends. That said, the effects do not appear very large, since the distributions overlap so much. Of course, there could still be large effects with overlapping distributions if there was just large individual variation that stayed consistent from time point to time point, but that doesn't appear to be the case for most brain regions. Perhaps violin plots would show the distributions and effect sizes more clearly than box plots? This is something I have struggled with in the past as well, and finding a reliable data visualization solution isn't trivial.</p></disp-quote><p>Certainly, our data reflects ample individual variability and the effects of these findings may not appear very large. Nonetheless, partial correlation analyses were used to assess significant functional connections between any two regions minimizing the effects of other regions in such relation. This type of analysis has high sensitivity in the detection of true functional connections, as it first regresses out all other nodes before correlating any two nodes (Smith et al., 2013). Hence, our analysis shows the significant functional connections that group-wise, were the strongest and most consistent in spite of underlying individual variability, the latter also allowing us to explain the observed variability in the expression of social behavior.</p><p>Following the advice of the reviewer, we are now presenting data of the mentioned figure (now Figure 5) in violin plots.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Subsection “Partner preference measured between 48h and 72h of cohabitation predicts long-term functional connectivity between MeA and VP” – What was the strength of the correlation between partner preference and MeA-VP connectivity at two weeks of cohabitation? I think the reader would assume all brain region correlations were examined, but were all time points considered as well? I imagine there would be difficulties considering the large number of tests being run, but it also seems like measures from the baseline scan pre-bonding would be the most relevant?</p></disp-quote><p>Under your suggestion, we have decided instead to analyze partner preference correlations with regions that underwent significant longitudinal changes after social bonding to better address such associations. We have added this new result in the Results section:</p><p>“Although several regions were found to change significantly after cohabitation and social bonding, we tested if any specific connection of the detected network component (Figure 5A) could have a relationship with the partner preference index obtained between 48 and 72 hours after the onset of cohabitation, which was used to evaluate the level of pair bonding in each subject. […] Also, significant negative relationships were found between the partner preference index and BLA–NAcc functional connectivity at 24h of cohabitation (session 2) (r(30) = -0.464, p = 0.0074), and in LS–RSC functional connectivity at 2 weeks of cohabitation (session 3) (r(28) = -0.437, p = 0.015 ), which may suggest that the lower the connectivity between these regions at the specified time points, the higher the partner preference index (Figure 6B-C).”</p><p>The results are further commented in the Discussion section:</p><p>“While consistent longitudinal changes in connectivity were present in our data, we wanted to explore if some of these nodes had a relationship with the level of partner preference, which captures the strength of the pair bond (Williams et al., 1992), which was evaluated between 48 and 72 hours after the onset of cohabitation.</p><p>[…] In general, network functional connectivity variability may also reflect behavioral diversity influenced by genetic and environmental factors.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Each partner in a pair was tested as the subject in a PPT. Were their preferences for one another correlated? That is, if a male showed a high preference index for his female, was that reciprocated?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting question that we did not address before. Two-tailed Spearman correlation analysis revealed that partner preference was not reciprocated between male and female partners (rs(14)=-0.203, p=0.450), suggesting partner preference may not be majorly influenced by the partner’s perceived socio-sexual behavior (Figure 4—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The Materials and methods state &quot;correlation values were Fisher's z-transformed&quot; so the reader does not have a sense of how strong the connectivity truly is between two regions, rather, what is shown is how strong the connectivity is between two regions relative to the connectivity between two randomly selected regions. Somewhere the range of correlation strengths should be noted.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included the non-Fisher z-transformed partial-correlation connectivity matrices in the new Figure 1—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This manuscript does an admirable job distilling a large number of measures and results down into manageable take-home messages for the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your kind comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To my knowledge, there has not been much work done distinguishing the phases of 24 hours post introduction to 2 weeks post introduction. I think the reader would benefit from knowing why this time point was chosen. The subsection “Longitudinal changes in functional connectivity after pair bonding”, mentions mate and territorial guarding but these behaviors would have been present by 24 hours.</p></disp-quote><p>This time period was selected based on previous literature. Specifically, on studies that have shown neurophysiological and behavioral changes occurring by a two-weeks period that may be related to the maintenance of the pair bond. The following text has been added to include such information in the Introduction section:</p><p>“While prairie voles of both sexes already display changes in behavior by 24 hours of cohabitation with mating as a result of pair-bonding (Wang and Aragona, 2004; Williams et al., 1992), the NAcc, for example, has substantially more D1-like receptor binding 2 weeks after female exposure, relative to non–pair bonded males (Aragona et al., 2006), a phenomenon that’s also been observed in female voles (Resendez et al., 2016). […] While there is a possibility that these changes in behavior involve the interplay of broad networks, it has not been directly explored in vivo.”</p><p>Altogether, such evidence seemed relevant to explore changes in functional connectivity after cohabitation for two weeks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) As shown in Figure 3A, the mPFC showed consistent declines in functional connectivity. Beyond my facetious first reaction that this shows romance does indeed impair higher order cognitive processes, I think this is an interesting finding. However, the authors then state &quot;A long-term increase of connectivity was detected between the LS with the mPFC&quot; which doesn't appear to agree with Figure 3A unless I'm misunderstanding something.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting observation and potential interpretation. However, between baseline and 24h after the onset of cohabitation, a non-significant decrease of connectivity is shown between LS-mPFC, but it increased significantly at the 2 weeks period (Session 3). Post-hoc analyses showed LS-mPFC connectivity had significantly increased when comparing Baseline with 2 weeks (t(56) = -2.856; p=0.0060), and also when comparing 24h vs. 2 weeks LS-mPFC (t(56) = -4.013; p=0.0001) (Figure 5H).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>1) The first and most fundamental is that there is no control group, and so interpretation of temporal changes associated with bonding assumes that repeated anesthesia and time had no effect on patterns of functional connectivity. Are there any studies that explicitly address this concern? They cite two studies suggesting their protocol &quot;practically preserves the functional interactions as in the awake state&quot;, but this falls short of addressing the possibility that repeated anesthesia might change their measures. I really wish they had allocated some of their effort to examining a suitable control-group (sib-housed, age-matched adults, in which control females were OVX + E implanted).</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, a number of studies have addressed the effects of sedation in fMRI longitudinal studies in rodents, specifically in forepaw stimulation. In rats, three fMRI sessions conducted in 5-day intervals, in which a 0.05 mg/kg medetomidine bolus injection plus a subcutaneous infusion of 0.1 mg/kg/h medetomidine were used, found no significant differences in BOLD signal change between sessions (Weber et al., 2006). In mice, repetitive medetomidine sedation with a dose of 0.3 mg/kg in combination with medetomidine infusion of 0.6 mg/kg/h in a 3 fMRI session protocol was also well tolerated and with reproducible BOLD response in forepaw stimulation (Adamczak et al., 2010).</p><p>While these studies suggest medetomidine effectiveness for fMRI longitudinal experiments and for rsfMRI (Zhao et al., 2008), the combined use of isoflurane with medetomidine has shown to have better cortical and partially preserved thalamo-cortical connectivity, having a higher resemblance to the awake condition in comparison to isoflurane and medetomidine alone (Grandjean et al., 2014, Paasonen et al., 2018). Even though a control group would certainly be more suitable for assessing the effects of anesthesia in our study, the relatively low dose used for our rodent model and the evidence shown on previous reports, support that our sedation protocol would not have a significant effect on the longitudinal follow-up. A brief sentence addressing previous studies on anesthesia has been included (subsection “Anesthesia for image acquisition”). In addition, we have now added the longitudinal analysis of regions not expected to be involved in social behavior, which had no significant changes between sessions.</p><p>However, as we now state in limitations (Discussion), a control group is desirable to confirm there are no confounding effects in the longitudinal changes two weeks after the onset of cohabitation. Accordingly, and also as suggested by the editor and reviewers, we now present the associations between functional connectivity and behavior as the main results, then we show the longitudinal changes, highlighting those with significant associations with social behaviors, discussing the potential limitations of our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The second is that use of NBS and its integration with the LMM is insufficiently described. I cannot tell how they did their analyses based on the provided description (subsection “Statistical analysis”).</p></disp-quote><p>Edgewise LMM through NBS framework was reformulated as follows in the Materials and methods – subsection “Functional connectivity analysis”:</p><p>“Correlations between behavioral data and functional connectivity were assessed with the Network Based Statistics (NBS) framework, using the Network Based Statistic Toolbox (Zalesky et al., 2010), which estimates the statistical significance of clusters of connections (networks) by comparing their strength with a null distribution of such property obtained with 5000 permutations of the original data. […] Those edges with significant (p &lt; 0.05) sex, session or interaction effects at this level were used to identify sets of connected nodes, i.e. components or networks, and their statistical strength (sum of their statistical estimates, Z-values) were compared with a null distribution of the largest clusters from the statistical tests of the permutated data (5000 permutations), this being the NBS framework (Zalesky et al., 2010).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Apparently the connectivity matrix that serves as an input to NBS is based on the partial correlation matrix at each time point. What was the threshold the authors used to define connectivity? This is essential for the NBS statistic but I could not find it in the Materials and methods or Results.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated by Zalesky et al., 2010, one of the advantages of NBS is that no initial threshold is required for the connectivity matrices to be analyzed (although it is possible to do so), however it is critical to define a threshold to define the connections that surpass the statistical tests, which will be used to define the clusters of connections. Accordingly, we did not apply any connectivity threshold to the connectivity matrices, but we did apply a threshold at the sample inference level to define the connections that surpassed the statistical tests, and with these, define the clusters of connections or networks. For the behavioral correlates with NBS, using GLM, we used a threshold of T &gt; 1.7. For the LMM-based NBR, we are able to define such a threshold in terms of the p-value, and it was set at p &lt; 0.05 for each edge. Note that when using LMM the degrees of freedom between variables may vary (e.g., F(1,30) for Sex vs. F(2,56) for Session), for this reason we rely on significance instead of a static F-value in the LMM. Nevertheless, control of the family- wise error rate (FWER) of the defined networks (clusters of connections), is controlled irrespective of the threshold choice by the estimation of the null distributions.</p><p>The following information has been now included in the Materials and methods “Statistical analysis” subsection:</p><p>“The NBS toolbox was used with a level of significance of p &lt; 0.05 to identify networks (sets of connections) with significant linear associations with behavioral data. […] To better describe the differences between sessions for each edge in the significant networks, estimated marginal means (EMM) post-hoc comparisons were used for LMM and were corrected for a false discovery rate (FDR) q &lt; 0.05.<bold>”</bold></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Subsection “Functional connectivity analysis”, they say that linear mixed models were fit, but they are not explicit about what the dependent variables are for these models. The following sentence says that networks &quot;with significant sex, session or interaction effects were identified based on the Network Based Statistics.&quot; It is not at all clear what this means. NBS are tests for longer-than-random spans of significant links. Did they simply use NBS to identify significant spans of linkages, and then test each region that went into a significant span with an LMM? The following sentence makes it sounds as though the connections themselves were defined by significant effects of sex or time, not by correlations. The &quot;Statistics&quot; and &quot;Functional connectivity&quot; subsections of the Materials and methods need to be revised in order to be appropriately evaluated. Please be explicit about the relationship between the LMM and the NBS.</p></disp-quote><p>The dependent variable of the LMM models was the functional connectivity represented in the connectivity matrices (i.e., partial correlations between ROIs). As the reviewer correctly states, NBS tests for longer-than-random spans of significant links, but first we need to identify those significant links. That is done performing a statistical test in each possible connection (element of the matrix), be it using linear mixed models or the general linear model, as specified in any case. So, NBS first performs the statistical test in every element of the matrix, to identify the weighted or binary size of the clusters of links that surpass the test. Then, for every permutation of the original data, it performs the same tests, and identifies the size of the larger cluster to generate a null distribution. Finally, the size of clusters identified in the actual (real) case are compared with the null distribution of the largest random clusters, and the final family-wise p-value for each of them is estimated. So, depending on the data and the question being asked, the NBS framework can be applied with a variety of statistical tests. Shortly, associations between functional connectivity (from a single session) and behavioral data, are performed with the GLM; longitudinal data is analyzed with LMM. The great advantage of the NBS framework is that not only tests individual connections, but it identifies sets of connections, or networks.</p><p>We have reviewed the “Statistics” and “Functional connectivity” subsections that concern the NBS framework as follows:</p><p>“Correlations between behavioral data and functional connectivity were assessed with the Network Based Statistic (NBS) framework, using the Network Based Statistic Toolbox (Zalesky et al., 2010), which estimates the statistical significance of clusters of connections (networks) by comparing their strength with a null distribution of such property obtained with 5000 permutations of the original data.

[…] To better describe the differences between sessions for each edge in the significant networks, estimated marginal means (EMM) post-hoc comparisons were used for LMM and were corrected for a false discovery rate (FDR) q &lt; 0.05.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) If sex and time were part of the NBS analysis, I would also ask the authors to be explicit about how they executed the permutation test of the NBS statistic. I assume they permuted the assignment of both sex and time. Did they preserve the structure of between-individual variation?</p></disp-quote><p>That is correct, the labels for sex and session were also permuted when they were included in the model, but preserving the data within-subjects to maintain the data structure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) I have similar concerns about the relationship between NBS and correlations with behavior. I found the methods of analysis hard to follow.</p></disp-quote><p>NBS takes as input the connectivity matrices from all observations and tests their relationship to linear covariates using a general linear model (GLM). The hypothesis tested at every connection was if connectivity strength was linearly associated with behavioral data. Relying on permutations, the NBS framework identifies clusters of connections for which the null hypothesis was rejected. The NBS enables rejection of the null hypothesis at the network level (i.e., at the level of those clusters), controlling the family-wise error rate (FWER). We have modified the description as referred in the previous points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) I had some concerns about mating and bonding in the study. Regarding the estradiol-in-oil implant method, how long do females remain in behavioral estrus in this condition? Preventing pregnancy and extending estrus may distort the dynamics of bonding.</p></disp-quote><p>Silastic implants were selected over estradiol s.c. administration because daily injections for two weeks may have been a potential stressor on the subjects and its partners. This method also enables more stable plasma estradiol levels than pellets (Mosquera, Shepherd and Torraro, 2015). A pilot study was performed to determine the efficiency of the estradiol implant and females remain sexually receptive for at least 20 days (non-published data).</p><p>Regarding female hormonal condition, <italic>Microtus</italic> species are induced ovulators and do not show cyclic changes. Female prairie voles are sexually inactive in the family nest; and stimuli from the environment, particularly male-related olfactory stimuli, are thought to induce endocrine changes, including increases in serum estrogen levels that promote sexual and behavioral receptivity (Taylor et al., 1992). In the presence of an unrelated male, females usually become sexually receptive at 48 h, will mate for 24h (Carter et al., 1987), and may remain in vaginal estrous for as long as 30 days when housed across a barrier from males (Richmond and Conaway, 1969). Therefore, the estradiol-capsule implantation enabled female sexual receptivity and reduced defensive aggression towards the male partner (Winslow et al., 1993; Insel et al., 1995). A brief sentence has been added to remind the reader the particular estrus condition in female prairie voles, in the Materials and methods subsection “Surgical procedures”:</p><p>“Females in <italic>Microtus</italic> species are induced ovulators and do not show cyclic changes (Taylor et al., 1992) , and for the purpose of this experiment, estrogen-in-oil capsule implantation allowed a stable and equal hormonal dose in all female subjects.<bold>”</bold></p><p>Additionally, mating is not essential for partner preference formation in female voles, though it has shown to accelerate bonding. Rather, cohabitation leads to pair bonding, and events associated with mating or estrus induction facilitate the onset of partner preference; and pair bonding may be established with at least 6 hours of cohabitation with mating or 24h of cohabitation without mating (Williams et al., 1992).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors only recorded mating behavior over 6h. On a related note, the strength of partner preference seems surprisingly weak (counting each subject as independent across a total 32 tests, but p only ~0.03-0.04); the authors claim an n=32, but tested 32 subjects twice (48h and 72h). In the subsection “Statistical analysis”, the authors say they used a Mann Whitney U, but in Figure 2, they seem to show results of the 2 partner-preference tests lumped together. The authors should be explicit about this analysis to ensure they have not pseudoreplicated their sample size. (If they included 64 tests from 32 individuals in 16 pairs, that would certainly seem to be a problem with pseudoreplication.) Moreover, some pairs did not mate in the 6 hour window. It seems possible that some of the effects of the 2 week vs. 24h time period might be due to the lack of mating in the initial 24h period. I wonder how the results would change if they excluded animals who didn't mate and/or showed no partner preference?</p></disp-quote><p>Each subject was tested only once in the partner preference test (PPT), within a 48h to 72h time frame. If a vole had PPT (assigned randomly and alternately) at the 48h period, its partner was tested at the 72h period. Specifically, each vole participated in two different PPT tests: once as the tested vole, and once as a stimulus vole in its partner’s PPT. Hence, we obtained a single partner preference measure for each subject. This 48h-72h testing period was chosen due to time constraints and to avoid excessive stress on the animals, which have no access to food and water during the 3-hour duration of the test. For better clarity, we have added the following text in the Materials and methods subsection “Partner Preference Test”:</p><p>“Each subject was tested only once in the partner preference test (PPT), either at 48 or 72h after the onset of cohabitation. If a vole underwent PPT (assigned randomly and alternately) at the 48h period, its partner was tested at the 72h period to enable rest between tests and avoid excessive stress.”</p><p>Regarding the strength of partner preference, as it has been previously characterized in this rodent model, we did find a statistically significant preference for the partner. However, as discussed in the manuscript, there is also a wide variability in partner preference in this species, which gave us the advantage to explore correlations with functional connectivity.</p><p>In respect to mating behavior, as mentioned before, mating is not essential for pair bonding in female voles, but it may facilitate its establishment (Williams et al., 1992). Though it has been reported that males may pair with diestrus females and without copulation (Shapiro and Dewsbury, 1990), mating in male voles has reported to be more relevant in pair bond formation than in females (Winslow et al., 1993; Insel et al., 1995). This trend is not entirely clear in our data: of 5 male voles with a partner preference index lower than 0.5, 2 of them did not mate during the 6 h window. It is important to consider that these subjects may have succeeded in mating both before the 24h scanning session or before the PPT. Further investigation would be necessary to fully understand the effects of mating in male vole pair bonding facilitation and its relationship with changes in brain functional connectivity, since only a small number of subjects were found in this particular circumstance.</p><p>References:</p><p>Adamczak, J.
