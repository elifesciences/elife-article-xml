When cells enter mitosis, membrane-chromatin contacts must be broken to allow for proper chromosome segregation; yet how this occurs remains ill-understood. Unexpectedly, we observed that an imbalance in the levels of the lamina-associated polypeptide 1 (LAP1), an activator of ER-resident Torsin AAA+-ATPases, causes a failure in membrane removal from mitotic chromatin, accompanied by chromosome segregation errors and changes in post-mitotic nuclear morphology. These defects are dependent on a hitherto unknown chromatin-binding region of LAP1 that we have delineated. LAP1-induced NE abnormalities are efficiently suppressed by expression of wild-type but not ATPase-deficient Torsins. Furthermore, a dominant-negative Torsin induces chromosome segregation defects in a LAP1-dependent manner. These results indicate that association of LAP1 with chromatin in the nucleus can be modulated by Torsins in the perinuclear space, shedding new light on the LAP1-Torsin interplay.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>nuclear envelope</kwd><kwd>mitosis</kwd><kwd>inner nuclear membrane</kwd><kwd>chromosome segregation</kwd><kwd>Torsins</kwd><kwd>LAP1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030_184801</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kutay</surname><given-names>Ulrike</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001703</institution-id><institution>EPFL</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fierz</surname><given-names>Beat</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The INM protein LAP1B, an activator of Torsin ATPases, is a chromatin-binding factor that erroneously persists on mitotic chromatin if Torsin functionality is compromised, inducing chromosome segregation defects and binucleation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In all eukaryotes, a double membrane barrier termed nuclear envelope (NE) serves as the boundary of the nuclear compartment that safeguards the genetic information. The NE is built by a large chromatin-attached membrane sheet of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Despite the connectivity of the NE-ER membrane network, the inner nuclear membrane (INM) contains a unique set of transmembrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holmer and Worman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ungricht and Kutay, 2015b</xref>). In general, enrichment of these membrane proteins from the peripheral ER at the nuclear face of the NE relies on several domains or short linear motifs in their extralumenal domains that together ensure retention on nuclear partners such as nuclear lamins, chromatin-associated factors or DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boni et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Powell and Burke, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ungricht et al., 2015a</xref>). While the interaction of INM proteins with the nuclear lamina is restricted to lamin-expressing metazoan cells and certain protists, chromatin is the principal binding partner of INM proteins in all eukaryotes. The association of INM proteins with chromatin is functionally important, being it for the formation of gametes, for development or differentiation, exemplified by the NE-based pairing of homologous chromosomes during meiosis, or the progressive enrichment of transcriptionally repressed chromatin domains at the nuclear periphery of differentiating metazoan cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ungricht and Kutay, 2017</xref>).</p><p>How INM proteins associate with chromatin is best understood for cases in which folded domains are used for chromatin binding. The lamin B receptor (LBR), for example, contains an N-terminal tudor domain for interaction with the epigenetically marked tail of histone H4 as well as structurally less-defined regions for association with DNA and HP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hirano et al., 2012</xref>). Some INM proteins contain short bihelical motifs for chromatin interaction such as the LEM (LAP2-emerin-MAN1) domain, which binds the chromatin factor BAF, or related motifs that bind DNA directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barton et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brachner and Foisner, 2011</xref>). The interaction of other mammalian INM proteins with chromatin is less understood. Biochemical experiments suggest that many INM proteins might even interact with DNA directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ulbert et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In cells undergoing open mitosis, the entire nuclear compartment is disintegrated by NE breakdown (NEBD), which liberates chromosomes from confinement by the nuclear membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Champion et al., 2017</xref>). In the course of prophase, the multifaceted interactions between INM proteins, chromatin, and nuclear lamins are broken, allowing for the separation of membranes from chromatin and the partitioning of INM proteins into the mitotic ER network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ellenberg et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yang et al., 1997</xref>). Exploiting a synthetic membrane–chromatin tethering system, we recently demonstrated that failed removal of membranes from chromatin impairs mitotic chromatin organization, chromosome segregation and cytokinesis, and perturbs post-mitotic nuclear morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Champion et al., 2019</xref>). Notably, also in yeasts with closed mitosis, the detachment of chromosomes from the NE is required for faithful chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Titos et al., 2014</xref>). It is generally assumed that changes in posttranslational modifications of INM proteins and chromatin-associated factors, especially protein phosphorylation, induce membrane dissociation from chromatin during mitotic entry. In strong support of this view, many mammalian INM proteins are phosphorylated in their nucleoplasmic domains by CDK1 or other abundant mitotic kinases during mitotic entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Güttinger et al., 2009</xref>). Also chromatin-associated interaction partners of INM proteins such as BAF are released from chromatin by mitotic phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Samwer et al., 2017</xref>). After prophase, multiple mechanisms ensure that the ER does not re-associate with chromatin prematurely, before NE reformation starts in late anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Champion et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>When studying the release of membrane proteins from chromatin during mitotic entry in cultured human somatic cells, we observed that an increased cellular level of one specific INM protein, the lamina-associated polypeptide 1 (LAP1), caused a failure in membrane removal from chromatin in mitosis. This observation not only indicated that LAP1 is a novel chromatin-binding INM protein but also suggested that some cellular factor(s) might have become limiting for breaking mitotic LAP1-chromatin contacts. LAP1 is an INM-localized activator of Torsins; the only known AAA+ ATPases residing in the lumen of the ER and the continuous perinuclear space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goodchild and Dauer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Laudermilch and Schlieker, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sosa et al., 2014</xref>). Although neither the precise biological role nor the substrates of Torsins are known, loss of Torsin functionality causes changes in NE morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goodchild et al., 2005</xref>), pointing toward a role at the NE. Mutations in <italic>TOR1A</italic>, the predominant Torsin isoform expressed in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jungwirth et al., 2010</xref>), lead to a severe movement disorder termed early-onset dystonia (DYT1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ozelius et al., 1997</xref>). Notably, also mutations in the <italic>LAP1</italic> gene, which is ubiquitously expressed in the human body, have been linked to primary dystonia as well as to cardiomyopathy, cerebellar atrophy, and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dorboz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fichtman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kayman-Kurekci et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rebelo et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In our experiments, persistence of LAP1 on mitotic chromatin was accompanied by changes in post-mitotic NE morphology and cell division errors, reminiscent of defects that we had previously reported for a synthetic membrane–chromatin tether, which prevents mitotic chromatin release. Strikingly, overexpression of wild-type but not of ATPase-deficient Torsins efficiently suppressed LAP1-induced NE abnormalities. Furthermore, a dominant-negative Torsin induced chromosome segregation defects in a LAP1-dependent manner, suggesting that LAP1 association with chromatin is modulated by Torsin ATPases residing in the perinuclear space and ER lumen. Collectively, our results underscore the importance of dissolving INM protein-chromatin interactions for mitotic fidelity and suggest that LAP1 may not merely be important for Torsin ATPase activation but itself subject to Torsin regulation across the INM.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Increased levels of LAP1 impair the dissolution of LAP1–chromatin contacts during mitosis</title><p>Although it is generally assumed that changes in posttranslational modifications of INM proteins and chromatin-associated factors, especially protein phosphorylation, induce membrane dissociation from chromatin during mitotic entry, direct evidence in support of this hypothesis in living cells is lacking and our molecular understanding of the process is limited. Here, we set out to gain new insights into the mechanisms required for dissociation of INM proteins from chromatin. In a first step, we tested whether it is possible to impair the release of the NE membranes from mitotic chromatin if any cellular factor involved in dissolving INM protein-chromatin contacts would become limiting by a disturbed ratio between INM proteins and the potential release factor(s). Thus, we overexpressed several abundant INM proteins, including emerin, SUN1, SUN2, LAP2β, LEM2, and LAP1 in HeLa cells by transiently transfecting the respective expression vectors. Remarkably, overexpression of LAP1B, the longest human isoform of LAP1, led to severe NE aberrations, while overexpression of other INM proteins did not cause similar defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Interestingly, the LAP1-induced NE aberrations were observed in the vast majority of cells when analyzed after 48 hr, whereas most cells still displayed a normal nuclear morphology after 24 hr, perhaps because more cells had progressed through mitosis in presence of LAP1 at the later time point. Changes in NE morphology upon LAP1B expression were also evident in other cell types such as HCT116 or HepG2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The LAP1B-induced NE aberrations were reminiscent of those that we had previously observed using a synthetic membrane–chromatin tethering system that prevents the release of the NE/ER network from chromatin during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Champion et al., 2019</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overexpression of LAP1B and LAP1C causes post-mitotic nuclear envelope (NE) aberrations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Vectors encoding the indicated inner nuclear membrane (INM) proteins were transfected into HeLa cells.

In these experiments, we also included LAP1C, the second isoform of human LAP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). LAP1C is produced from a shorter transcript and starts at an alternative translational start site (Met 122), leading to an isoform that is N-terminally truncated by 121 amino residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Santos et al., 2014</xref>). Cells were analyzed by confocal microscopy 48 hr after tetracycline induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), and expression levels were examined by quantification of GFP intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The severity of the NE aberrations indeed increased with rising expression levels for both LAP1B-GFP and LAP1C-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E, F</xref>); however, they were more pronounced for LAP1B when comparing cells with a similar expression level of both isoforms. We also inspected fixed cells for an association of membranes with chromatin during metaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Both GFP-tagged LAP1 isoforms were enriched at mitotic chromatin; however, the enrichment of LAP1B-GFP was more prominent, indicating a stronger retention of the longer isoform on mitotic chromatin.</p><p>To exclude that persistent LAP1–chromatin contacts affect the mitotic localization of endogenous NE proteins, we fixed uninduced and induced LAP1B-GFP cells, and immunostained for nuclear lamins and multiple INM proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Analysis of metaphase cells revealed that of the tested INM proteins only LAP1B-GFP was strongly enriched at mitotic chromatin. Taken together, overexpression of both human LAP1 isoforms results in their failed removal from mitotic chromatin and cells display an aberrant post-mitotic nuclear morphology, whereas overexpression of other INM proteins at comparable expression levels does not cause similar phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The molecular architecture of the nucleoplasmic domain of LAP1</title><p>LAP1 has originally been identified as an INM protein that interacts with nuclear lamins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Foisner and Gerace, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Senior and Gerace, 1988</xref>), yet the molecular architecture of its nucleoplasmic domain remains poorly characterized. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments previously revealed an extremely low diffusional mobility of LAP1B at the INM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zuleger et al., 2011</xref>), but how it is so strongly immobilized at the INM remained to be determined. As overexpressed LAP1B-GFP was associated with chromatin during mitosis, we reasoned that interaction with both chromatin and nuclear lamins may anchor LAP1B at the INM. Our FRAP experiments confirmed that LAP1B-GFP is a highly immobile INM protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In contrast, LAP1C-GFP was more mobile, showing a recovery curve similar to LAP2β-GFP.</p><p>To elucidate which lamins contribute to the retention of LAP1 at the NE, we examined the diffusional mobility of LAP1B-GFP and LAP1C-GFP after RNAi-mediated depletion of lamin A/C, lamin B1, or lamin B2 by FRAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B, C</xref>). Downregulation of lamin A/C and lamin B1, but not of lamin B2, led to an increase in the diffusional mobility of LAP1B at the NE. The combined depletion of lamin A/C and lamin B1 had an even stronger effect, indicating that both A- and B-type lamins contribute to retention of LAP1B at the INM. For LAP1C, only the loss of lamin A/C had a prominent effect on its mobility, suggesting that A-type lamins play a major role in retention of the shorter isoform at the INM.</p><p>The extraluminal domain of LAP1B is predicted to be largely intrinsically disordered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and we set out to delineate its chromatin and lamina-binding regions.

Consistent with our assumption that chromatin-binding contributes to the retention of LAP1B at the INM, the CBR was sufficient to target the CBR-SPAG4-GFP fusion protein to the NE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Finally, we tested whether the CBR can interact with chromatin directly by performing electrophoretic mobility shifts assays (EMSAs), revealing that the purified recombinant CBR can interact with reconstituted nucleosomes and even naked DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C, D</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, our mapping experiments delineated three regions within the disordered nucleoplasmic domain of LAP1B that confer interaction with nuclear components: two regions that confer association with the nuclear lamina (aa 1–72 and 184–337) and a central region that is sufficient for chromatin interaction (CBR, aa 98–138; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).

Strikingly, deletion of the CBR abolished the occurrence of NE aberrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).</p><p>To pinpoint residues within the CBR that contribute to mitotic chromatin association, we mutated conserved Ser and Thr residues within the CBR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). With this approach, we identified two residues (S108 and T124) that if mutated to glutamate affected NE localization of the LAP1(98–136)-SPAG4-GFP fusion protein during interphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), abolished its binding to chromatin in metaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) and reduced its affinity for DNA and mononucleosomes in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C, D</xref>). Although these Ser and Thr residues could in principle be subject to mitotic phosphorylation, we have so far been unable to confirm mitotic phosphorylation of these sites. Comparison of the diffusional mobility of full-length LAP1B-GFP with LAP1B(ΔCBR)-GFP and LAP1B-2E(S108E,T124E)-GFP demonstrated that both mutant constructs exhibited a higher mobility at the NE, highlighting the contribution of the CBR and the identified residues to the retention of LAP1B at the INM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A, B</xref>). Importantly, when we introduced both mutations into the membrane-bound, nucleoplasmic domain of LAP1B in the construct LAP1(1-359-2E)-GFP, binding to mitotic chromatin and post-mitotic NE aberrations were fully abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Taken together, this data shows that chromatin-binding contributes to the retention of LAP1 at the NE and identifies two residues (S108 and T124) that are essential for chromatin binding of LAP1B during mitosis.

The persistent chromatin association of overexpressed LAP1B during mitosis prompted us to examine whether restoring a normal LAP1B to Torsin ratio by co-overexpression of these proteins would rescue NE shape defects. We transiently expressed LAP1B-GFP alone or together with either Tor1A or Tor1B, both C-terminally tagged with an HA-Strep tag, and analyzed the percentage of cells containing NE aberrations two days after transfection. For quantification, we binned cells into a window of comparable fluorescence intensities to exclude an influence of varying LAP1B expression levels. Indeed, co-expression of either Torsin led to a striking decrease in NE aberrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B, C</xref>).

Remarkably, Tor1B(E178Q)-GFP expression led to a twofold higher number of binucleated cells as compared to cells expressing Tor1B-GFP wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Notably, no severe post-mitotic NE aberrations were observed in Tor1B(E178Q) expressing cells, which might be explained by fewer, weaker and/or less persistent chromatin interactions of endogenous LAP1 in anaphase compared to overexpressed LAP1. We know from our previous work that late mitosis is indeed critical for the manifestation of this phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Champion et al., 2019</xref>). As binucleation is indicative for failed cytokinesis and commonly caused by chromosome segregation defects, we quantified DNA bridges and lagging chromosomes. This analysis revealed a significant increase in chromosome segregation defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). To elucidate whether the observed increase in binucleated cells can be attributed to the failed removal of LAP1 from mitotic chromatin, we performed RNAi-mediated depletion of LAP1 in Tor1B(E178Q)-GFP expressing cells. Importantly, the number of binucleated cells was significantly reduced in LAP1-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). As judged by the GFP signal, the Tor1B(E178Q)-GFP expression seemed slightly reduced in LAP1-depleted cells as compared to cells treated with control siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), and we wished to exclude that unequal Tor1B(E178Q) expression levels led to the reduction of binucleation in LAP1-depleted cells. Therefore, we induced Tor1B(E178Q) with a lower tetracycline concentration in control cells. Even though these cells now expressed two-fold less Tor1B-E178Q compared to LAP1-depleted cells, binucleation was still significantly reduced upon downregulation of LAP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A, B, C</xref>). For comparison, we also depleted the ER-resident Torsin-activator LULL1 in Tor1B(E178Q)-GFP expressing cells, but could not observe a reduction in binucleated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A, B, D</xref>). LULL1 depletion also did not prevent the localization of LAP1 to mitotic chromatin upon Tor1B(E178Q) expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C, D</xref>). Taken together, the dominant-negative Tor1B variant induces the persistence of LAP1-positive membrane patches on (pro)-metaphase chromatin, chromosome segregation defects and binucleation in a LAP1-dependent manner. Collectively, our findings indicate that Torsin function is important for mitotic fidelity by assuring normal LAP1 behavior during mitosis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>During NE breakdown, membrane proteins of the INM are released from chromatin and the nuclear lamina to allow for the spatial separation of membranes from chromatin. Our work uncovers that the abundant and ubiquitously expressed INM protein LAP1 is tightly anchored at the INM of interphase cells by association with both chromatin and the nuclear lamina. Unexpectedly, we found that LAP1 remains stuck on chromatin in mitosis if either the stoichiometry of LAP1 to Torsins is unbalanced or Torsin functionality is compromised. These findings are intriguing for two reasons. Firstly, they indicate that Torsins, residing in the perinuclear space, influence LAP1’s ability to bind chromatin at the other side of the membrane. Secondly, reminiscent of some of the phenotypes that we have previously observed using a synthetic membrane-chromatin tether (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Champion et al., 2019</xref>), the failure in release of LAP1 from mitotic chromatin is associated with chromosome segregation defects, binucleation and postmitotic NE aberrations.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The Torsin-LAP1 interplay</title><p>Based on studies in human cells, mice and <italic>Drosophila</italic> diverse roles of Torsins have been suggested, including functions in ER homeostasis, secretion, lipid metabolism, NPC biogenesis, and nuclear export of large particles like mRNPs or HSV1 capsids by a vesicular transport process across the NE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grillet et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jokhi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maric et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nery et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pappas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rampello et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rampello et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Turner et al., 2015</xref>). However, while all these suggested functions are supported by the reported cellular phenotypes, biochemical and genetic data, it is currently unclear what are direct or indirect consequences of Torsin function since the molecular mechanism of Torsin action has remained elusive. All attempts to identify bona fide substrates of these unsual, ER-luminal AAA+ ATPases have so far been unsuccessful. It has therefore even been speculated that the established Torsin activators LAP1 and LULL1 could act simultaneously as activators and substrates of these mysterious ATPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cascalho et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rose et al., 2015</xref>), especially since LAP1 and LULL1 are highly enriched on the ATP-bound form of some Torsins, as expected for substrates of AAA+ ATPases.</p><p>So, how do our findings relate to the current understanding of the molecular function of Torsins? Our experiments suggest that the interaction of Torsins with the C-terminal, luminal domain of LAP1 in the ER lumen influences the chromatin-binding activity of LAP1’s nucleoplasmic domain on the other side of the membrane. This implies that LAP1 might not merely behave as an activator of Torsins, but could in turn itself be a downstream effector or ‘substrate’ influenced by the activity of the ATPases. Two observations indicate that this reverse crosstalk from Torsin to LAP1 is indeed linked to the enzymatic activity of the ATPase: Firstly, LAP1B-induced NE aberrations can be rescued by expression of Tor1B wild-type but not by an ATPase inactive mutant. Secondly, LAP1 derivatives that are deficient in Torsin ATPase activation execute a stronger dominant-negative effect on cell division than wild-type LAP1.</p><p>Clearly, even if considering LAP1 a ‘substrate’ of Torsins ATPases, their interplay must differ from the ‘classical’ enzyme-substrate mechanism typical of AAA+ ATPases that thread protein substrates through the central pore of a usually hexameric ATPase rings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hanson and Whiteheart, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Olivares et al., 2016</xref>). Although Torsins show sequence similarity to bacterial ClpX ATPases that serve as the paradigm of substrate-threading AAA+ ATPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Olivares et al., 2016</xref>), they seem to lack the characteristic pore loops involved in substrate gripping during the translocation of an unfolded protein chain through the central opening of the ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Demircioglu et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, the luminal domains of LAP1 and LULL1 are structural mimics of the ATPase fold. These domains bind laterally to the ATPase domain of Torsins to activate ATP hydrolysis through their arginine finger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sosa et al., 2014</xref>), inconsistent with LAP1 being a substrate of a threading mechanism. Consistently, Torsins have not been found to unfold the luminal domains of LAP1 and LULL1 in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, the interplay of Torsin and LAP1 must work differently.</p><p>From a conceptual point of view, we can envisage several scenarios as to how Torsin ATPase activity could influence chromatin interaction of LAP1. One possibility is that activation of Torsins transduces mechanical forces across the membranes, thereby weakening the interaction of LAP1 with chromatin, and thereby facilitating its removal from chromatin. This might entail a conformational rearrangement of the luminal domain of LAP1 relative to the ATPase domain of Torsins induced by ATP hydrolysis, and propagated to the other side of the membrane either in form of a Torsin-induced pulling on LAP1 or a rotational movement of LAP1 along its longitudinal axis in the plane of the membrane. Another plausible scenario is that Torsin ATPase activation leads to the disassembly of LAP1 dimers or higher order oligomers by affecting their lateral association, thereby influencing the avidity of the LAP1–chromatin interaction.</p><p>Based on structural studies that revealed an AAA+ fold mimicry of the luminal domains of LAP1 and LULL1, it has originally been assumed that they form mixed heterohexameric rings with Torsins, with support from in vitro assembly experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sosa et al., 2014</xref>). Such a heterohexameric configuration with 3 LAP1 and 3 Torsin molecules per hexamer would readily explain how an ATPase-deficient Torsin mutant such as Tor1B(E178Q) could increase the affinity of LAP1 for chromatin due to avidity effects caused by the entrapment of LAP1 in these ATP-stabilized ring structures. However, it was subsequently noted that the surfaces of the luminal domains of LAP1 and LULL1 are only well conserved on their catalytic interface with Torsins but not on the potential non-catalytic interface, indicating the lack of evolutionary pressure to maintain this interface and shedding some doubt on the suggested hetero-hexameric organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chase et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Demircioglu et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, Torsins display surface conservation on both their catalytic and non-catalytic interfaces, consistent with the possibility that Torsins could form homo-oligomers. Indeed, Torsins can assemble into ATP-dependent, homo-oligomeric structures in vitro, adopting the configuration of a spiral or potentially a lock-washer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chase et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Demircioglu et al., 2016</xref>). Such configuration would provide only one accessible interface for binding of LAP1 or LULL1 to promote oligomer disassembly upon ATPase activation. It remains to be seen which higher order configuration of Torsins exist in living cells, also in light of the view that LAP1 and LULL1 are overstoichiometric to Torsins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Itzhak et al., 2016</xref>). Such knowledge will be key to inform rational models of how Torsins influence chromatin interaction of LAP1.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>LAP1 interaction with chromatin and the nuclear lamina</title><p>LAP1B possesses an extremely low diffusional mobility in comparison to other INM proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zuleger et al., 2011</xref>). Its intrinsically disordered nucleoplasmic domain engages in interaction with at least three binding partners that contribute to its strong retention at the INM, namely lamin A/C, lamin B1, and chromatin. This raises the question of whether the strong immobilization of LAP1 at the NE might bear an additional function beyond retaining the protein at the INM. Potential roles include the mechanical coupling of the INM to chromatin and the nuclear lamina or a function in chromatin positioning at the nuclear periphery, for example in heterochromatin organization. INM proteins together with nuclear lamins are known to serve as heterochromatin tethers that promote the positioning of transcriptionally silenced heterochromatin domains underneath the NE of differentiated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guelen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Solovei et al., 2013</xref>). Considering the organization of its nucleoplasmic domain, LAP1 seems ideally suited to bridge lamina-chromatin interactions. Notably, LAP1 is developmentally essential as LAP1 knockout mice exhibit perinatal lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2010</xref>). Recently, loss of LAP1 expression in human patients caused by a mutation leading to an in-frame termination codon in LAP1 has been associated with an early onset multisystemic nuclear envelopathy manifesting in severe neurological and developmental deficiencies, resulting in early lethality of the patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fichtman et al., 2019</xref>). These severe defects are most likely caused by a lack of Torsin activation at the NE by lack of LAP1. However, it might also be worth considering whether LAP1 might have a chromatin-associated function that is needed for proper development.</p><p>Our study primarily focused on the long isoform LAP1B. In comparison, LAP1C is predicted to possess a shortened CBR. When overexpressed, LAP1C is also capable of binding to chromatin during mitosis, albeit to a lesser extent than LAP1B. Interestingly, the relative expression of LAP1B and LAP1C differs between tissues and changes during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Santos et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shin et al., 2014</xref>). While LAP1C is the predominant isoform in undifferentiated cells, the relative levels of LAP1B strongly increase during differentiation and, interestingly, upon induced cell cycle exit of cultured somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Santos et al., 2015</xref>). In light of our observation that LAP1B is more prone to stick to mitotic chromatin than LAP1C and induces mitotic errors when present at increased levels in rapidly dividing cells, the physiological upregulation of LAP1B in correlation with cell cycle exit seems ideally suited to prevent potentially fatal mitotic defects caused by LAP1B.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The gist of the matter – mitosis or interphase?</title><p>Although we present evidence that Torsins influence the interaction of LAP1 with chromatin, we do not necessarily assume that Torsins have evolved to liberate LAP1 from chromatin for open mitosis or that they possess a function dedicated to mitosis. Given that primary dystonia caused by mutations of Tor1A or LAP1 seems to arise through a dysfunction of post-mitotic neurons, the function of Torsins is probably essential for the homeostasis of interphase cells. We rather consider it likely that mitosis is perturbed as a consequence of a perturbed LAP1-Torsin interplay during interphase that manifests in the subsequent mitosis.</p><p>Both the expression of the Tor1B ATPase-deficient E178Q mutant or excess LAP1 impaired the full removal of LAP1 from chromatin in mitosis, and is associated with chromosome segregation errors, increased binucleation of cells and post-mitotic NE aberrations. When we weakened chromatin association of LAP1B by mutation of two residues in the CBR to phospho-mimetic residues, these phenotypes disappeared, suggesting that the prolonged chromatin association of LAP1 during mitosis is the underlying reason. Dissociation of membrane chromatin contacts is currently assumed to be primarily controlled by protein phosphorylation. While our own investigations of mitotic phosphorylation of these sites remained inconclusive, one of these residues, that is Ser135, has indeed been detected as mitotically phosphorylated in large scale phosphoproteomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dephoure et al., 2008</xref>). If chromatin interaction of LAP1 were normally controlled by (mitotic) kinases, then the perturbed Torsin-LAP1 interplay could also affect the access of kinases to the nucleoplasmic domain of LAP1, for example by a failure in dissolving interactions of LAP1 with either itself or other partners. Interestingly, the nucleoplasmic domain of LAP1 is known to interact with protein phosphatase 1, the persistent binding of which could counteract the action of (mitotic) kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Santos et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, mitotic changes in chromatin may also promote LAP1 dissociation during mitosis, and these changes might be affected by perturbation of the LAP1-Torsin axis.</p><p>Both binucleation and aneuploidy may contribute to or even drive tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chow et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Levine and Holland, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tanaka et al., 2018</xref>). Because Torsins likely function in a redundant manner, it is highly improbable that Torsin function can be completely abolished by mutations in most tissues. For LAP1, in contrast, mutations that specifically impair its Torsin binding or activation capability, present a risk of causing mitotic errors. Remarkably, mutation of LAP1’s arginine finger was identified as a somatic mutation in melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krauthammer et al., 2012</xref>) and colon cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">The Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012</xref>). However, whether this mutation genuinely contributes to tumorigenesis remains to be clarified. Based on our findings, one could expect aneuploidy to develop over time if differentiated cells with high LAP1B expression levels were forced to reenter the cell cycle for instance by oncogenic driver mutations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>A list of materials is provided in Appendix 1-Key resource table 1.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Molecular cloning</title><p>The LAP1B, LULL1, Tor1A, and Tor1B coding regions were amplified from HeLa cDNA and cloned into the vector pcDNA5.1-GFP FRT/TO (cytomegalovirus [CMV] promoter; Invitrogen) for generation of stable, tetracycline-inducible cell lines.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Megan C King as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript presents an interesting novel idea: that the inner nuclear membrane (INM) protein LAP1, known as a regulator of Torsins, is itself regulated by Torsins. Luithle and colleagues describe a novel chromatin binding domain in the in the nucleoplasmic region of LAP1 that can directly bind DNA and functions at least in part to regulate LAP1's retention at the INM. The authors also identify two lamin interaction domains and show that these interactions further reinforce the anchorage of LAP1 at the INM. The authors tie the chromatin binding by LAP1 to its ability, when over-expressed, to induce altered nuclear morphology, defects in membrane removal during mitosis and features consistent with chromosome segregation defects. They discover that Torsin over-expression can modulate the phenotypes tied to LAP1 over-expression and therefore mimic the deletions/mutations that abrogate chromatin binding; this requires a functional Torsin-LAP1 interaction and TorsinB ATPase activity. Thus, for the first time, the authors describe a direct role for Torsins in promoting mitotic integrity via LAP1, suggesting that catalytically active Torsin, which is limiting, is required to release LAP1 from chromatin during mitosis.</p><p>All three reviewers were enthusiastic about the study, highlighting that it was well-written, presented data of consistently high quality, and would be of interest to a broad readership. The reviewers agreed that the manuscript reveals important new information on the mutual regulation of Torsins and LAP1 and provides a conceptual advance for our understanding of mitotic nuclear envelope breakdown via an unexpected mechanism operating across the inner nuclear membrane. The authors had some suggestions for a revised manuscript, most of which can be addressed with edits to the text.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The reviewers were somewhat troubled by the interpretation that &quot;…no post mitotic NE aberrations were observed in Tor1B(E178Q) expressing cells…&quot;, as shown in Figure 6B, C. This is confusing and seemingly contradicts the working model saying that increased LAP1 levels relative to active Tor1 lead to NE aberrations, in turn generating binucleated cells. As there is a certain degree of functional redundancy between Torsins (Laudermilch et al., 2016 and Tanabe et al., 2016), could this be due to the presence of endogenous TorsinA/B? Arguably, the most definitive experiment to support their central conclusion would be to show that a TorA/B knockout, or their co-depletion, results in the same phenotype as LAP1 overexpression considering that only TorA/B (but none of the other Torsins) act on Lap1 (Zhao et al., 2013). Or is even a TorB KO alone sufficient to cause similar effects?</p><p>2) The analyses strongly rely on the quantification of nuclear defects, but in some figures differences in nuclear defect severity are not so clear in the immunofluorescence images. How was severity of nuclear morphology defects quantified? From the images alone correlation with expression level is not so clear. The way that nuclear aberrations were quantified should be explained carefully in the text and/or legends.</p><p>3) Please address if and how the expression level of INM proteins tested was controlled, as this seems to be relevant for the phenotype (see Figure 1D)? Particularly SUN1 seems to be weakly expressed.</p><p>4) How did authors make sure that the cells had no nuclear aberrations before time lapse imaging was started? Did these cells never go through mitosis in the presence of the GFP-LAP1 before? How long do the cells survive in the presence of overexpressed LAP1? Authors may consider to show some of the data presented in Figure 5 (e.g. bi-nucleated cells) already here, to address cell fate upon LAP1 overexpression.</p><p>5) One important aspect of the proposed model, not addressed in the study and not even discussed in the manuscript, is the fact that Torsin's activity on LAP1 has to be regulated during the cell cycle. LAP1 is tethered to the nuclear periphery to a great part by its interaction with chromatin in interphase cells, which contain active Torsin. In mitosis Torsin is required to release LAP1 from chromatin. Is Torsin regulated or do chromatin changes in mitosis contribute to the Torsin-mediated LAP1 release? The authors should at least address this point in the Discussion. Along these lines, although the authors have not been able to dissect the phosphorylation of the CBR in detail to this point, it is worth asking how the phosphodead/phosphomimetic mutations influence the chromatin association of the CBR alone. Similarly, one wonders if the &quot;generic&quot; phosphorylation status of LAP1B (as visualized on a PhosTag gel/blot, for example) is altered during mitosis and whether this is influenced by dominant-negative forms of Torsin.</p><p>6) Although not absolutely essential, evidence for their speculation that the (hetero)oligomeric state of the Torsin/cofactor system influences their findings would be important for the Torsin field. The authors could test one key aspect comparatively easily: would a back interface Torsin mutant (Chase et al., 2017) selectively perturbing the Torsin homo-oligomer, but not the LAP1 interaction, fail or succeed in reverting the Lap1 overexpression phenotype? The result could materially inform our mechanistic understanding of this novel transmembrane relay mechanism.</p><p>7) The relatively low level of LAP1B expression relative to LAP1C expression (and weaker association of LAP1C with chromatin) raises the possibility that LAP1C also competes with LAP1B for other binding partners, including Torsins. Although the authors note that LAP1C can also induce nuclear aberrations (albeit much more weakly than LAP1B) one wonders if a functional LAP1C-Torsin complex might serve a function that is disrupted by LAP1B over-expression. Is there any evidence for such crosstalk?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63614.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The reviewers were somewhat troubled by the interpretation that &quot;…no post mitotic NE aberrations were observed in Tor1B(E178Q) expressing cells…&quot;, as shown in Figure 6B, C.

Or is even a TorB KO alone sufficient to cause similar effects?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize that we have missed to provide a rational explanation for the above statement. We previously reported that post-mitotic NE aberrations are induced when membranes are artificially tethered to chromatin throughout mitosis (Champion et al., 2019). Notably, NE aberrations also arise when membranes are only tethered to chromatin from metaphase onwards, indicating that the precocious presence of membranes on chromatin during mitotic exit is the decisive parameter for this phenotype. In contrast, chromosome segregation errors and binucleation are caused by membrane chromatin contacts during pro-(meta)phase, and not observed if membranes are only tethered during metaphase, i.e. after chromosome alignment at the spindle equator.</p><p>While we always observed both NE aberrations and chromosome segregation errors/ binucleation when we induced LAP1B expression, Tor1B(E178Q) expression robustly induced chromosome segregation errors but failed to cause the prominent NE aberrations that we observed upon LAP1 overexpression, as highlighted by our note in the text. We don’t think that this contradicts our working model for two reasons. Firstly, when we overexpress LAP1B-GFP, GFP-positive membranes cover almost the entire mitotic chromatin mass in metaphase, while we observe fewer membrane patches at metaphase chromatin in presence of Tor1B(E178Q) at endogenous levels of LAP1. The latter seems sufficient to cause chromosome segregation defects but not NE aberrations. Secondly, it is possible that the membrane patches induced by Tor1B(E178Q) at endogenous levels of LAP1 are not as stably bound to chromatin due to their lower avidity, are more dynamically remodelled, or even eventually resolved, perhaps helped by the endogenous Torsins, as suggested by the reviewers. Notably, for chromosome segregation errors prometaphase is the decisive time window, while it is later mitosis (anaphase) for NE aberrations, providing a rationale as to why chromosome segregation errors are more likely to be consistent between both treatments.</p><p>We have now revised this section to read: “Notably, no severe post-mitotic NE aberrations were observed in Tor1B(E178Q) expressing cells, which might be explained by fewer, weaker and/or less persistent chromatin interactions of endogenous LAP1 in anaphase compared to overexpressed LAP1. We know from our previous work that late mitosis is indeed critical for the manifestation of this phenotype (Champion et al., 2019)”.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we had tested whether depletion or knockout of Torsins induces a similar phenotype as Tor1B(E178Q) expression, however these data remained inconclusive. Firstly, we had generated TOR1A knock-out cells by CRSIPR/Cas9 and observed a high level of bi- and multinucleation in different clones generated with different guides as well as some nuclear shape abnormalities, consistent with our other observations. However, as binucleation is a phenotype that cannot be rescued, we performed a number of controls that then indicated that our CRISPR approach itself increased cell division defects when designed for unrelated targets, as long as the chosen guides found a genomic target. Thus, this data remained inconclusive. Similarly, we performed RNAi experiments to deplete Tor1A and Tor1B, the most abundant Torsins in HeLa cells. While we observed an increase in binucleation in the chosen HeLa cell line from 2% to about 6%, we feel that this data is too weak on its own, and we prefer to further investigate this issue in the future. However, we wish to emphasize that it is conceivable that the formation of Torsin-LAP1 oligomers might contribute to enhanced chromatin binding of LAP1, as already mentioned in the Discussion. In such a scenario, depletion of Torsins must not necessarily mimic the effect of Tor1B(E178Q) or LAP1B expression. Thus, this point remains to be addressed by other methods in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The analyses strongly rely on the quantification of nuclear defects, but in some figures differences in nuclear defect severity are not so clear in the immunofluorescence images. How was severity of nuclear morphology defects quantified? From the images alone correlation with expression level is not so clear. The way that nuclear aberrations were quantified should be explained carefully in the text and/or legends.</p></disp-quote><p>In all figures, the intensity of the GFP signal allows for a direct comparison of expression levels since imaging of cells from the same experiment was performed at identical settings. At all indicated instances, we have additionally binned cells of similar expression levels for quantitative analyses. Nuclear shape aberrations were quantified in Figure 3, and the classification of assigned categories is shown in Figure 3B. As we did not use machine learning or another image analysis tool for quantification of NE aberrations, we have digitalized the 5 phenotypic classes into only two final bins, i.e. “yes” and “no” categories. We apologize that we had not described these aspects sufficiently. We have now added a section on quantification of GFP intensities and nuclear shape aberrations to Materials and methods (“Image processing and quantification”), and extended the corresponding figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please address if and how the expression level of INM proteins tested was controlled, as this seems to be relevant for the phenotype (see Figure 1D)? Particularly SUN1 seems to be weakly expressed.</p></disp-quote><p>Please, see also above. In brief, the expression levels were quantified by integrating the NE GFP signal of individual nuclei in the fluorescent images. We think that there might have been some confusion on the quantification provided in former Figure 1E (the panel formerly at the right side of the immunoblots), which actually showed the quantification of the fluorescent images in Figure 1D. We have now rearranged the panels to hopefully address the point of the reviewers and revised the corresponding legend.</p><p>We agree that SUN1 was only weakly expressed in the cells presented in Figure 1A. We have repeated the experiment, now also taking images at 24 h, and replaced the panel. This demonstrates that even at higher expression levels SUN1 does not induce phenotypes similar to LAP1B. It also highlights that LAP1B-induced NE aberrations are only apparent in the vast majority of cells at 48 h after transient transfection (see also next point).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) How did authors make sure that the cells had no nuclear aberrations before time lapse imaging was started? Did these cells never go through mitosis in the presence of the GFP-LAP1 before? How long do the cells survive in the presence of overexpressed LAP1? Authors may consider to show some of the data presented in Figure 5 (e.g. bi-nucleated cells) already here, to address cell fate upon LAP1 overexpression.</p></disp-quote><p>For these time-lapse experiments, we used tetracycline-inducible cell lines for which we can control the timing of LAP1B induction. As we had observed that the NE was smooth in most LAP1B-expressing cells 24 h after induction but aberrant after 48 h (see also new Figure 1A), we started the time-lapse imaging after 24 h. To address the point of the reviewers, we now better describe the experimental timeline in the corresponding figure legend. Notably, the time-lapse microscopy experiment shown in Figure 1B shows that the NE is smooth in LAP1B-expressing cells before mitosis but ruffled after mitosis, in contrast to LAP2b-GFP-expressing cells, demonstrating that the NE aberrations manifest during mitotic exit. We now also include corresponding video files.</p><p>We have not performed any cell survival assay but observed severe multinucleation and flower ball shaped giant nuclei after 72 h of LAP1B overexpression.</p><p>Without a marker for cellular contours, we cannot indicate binucleation in Figure 1. Taking up the suggestion of the reviewers, we now refer to a pair of closely juxtaposed nuclei in the legend to Figure 1D as a sign of potential binucleation and refer the reader to later parts of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) One important aspect of the proposed model, not addressed in the study and not even discussed in the manuscript, is the fact that Torsin's activity on LAP1 has to be regulated during the cell cycle. LAP1 is tethered to the nuclear periphery to a great part by its interaction with chromatin in interphase cells, which contain active Torsin. In mitosis Torsin is required to release LAP1 from chromatin. Is Torsin regulated or do chromatin changes in mitosis contribute to the Torsin-mediated LAP1 release? The authors should at least address this point in the Discussion. Along these lines, although the authors have not been able to dissect the phosphorylation of the CBR in detail to this point, it is worth asking how the phosphodead/phosphomimetic mutations influence the chromatin association of the CBR alone. Similarly, one wonders if the &quot;generic&quot; phosphorylation status of LAP1B (as visualized on a PhosTag gel/blot, for example) is altered during mitosis and whether this is influenced by dominant-negative forms of Torsin.</p></disp-quote><p>It is currently unclear whether, and if so how, the activity of Torsins towards LAP1 is regulated during the cell cycle. As we already stated in the Discussion, “we do not necessarily assume that Torsins have evolved to liberate LAP1 from chromatin for open mitosis or that they possess a function dedicated to mitosis. […] We rather consider it likely that mitosis is perturbed as a consequence of a perturbed LAP1-Torsin interplay during interphase that manifests in the subsequent mitosis.” In light of this, we actually do not think that one must necessarily assume any cell cycle-specific regulation.</p><p>We really appreciate the reasoning of the reviewers on the chromatin changes and have introduced a sentence in our Discussion, to read: “Finally, mitotic changes in chromatin may also promote LAP1 dissociation during mitosis, and these changes might be affected by perturbation of the LAP1-Torsin axis.”</p><p>Regarding the effect of the phospho-mimetic mutants of the CBR, these were tested in altogether three settings: Firstly, in Figure 2E, for their contribution to NE targeting and mitotic chromatin association of the isolated CBR in the context of the CBR-SPAG4 fusion protein, in Figure 2F, for their effect on the ability of LAP1B(1-359) to induce NE aberrations and mitotic chromatin association of membranes, and thirdly, in FRAP experiments measuring LAP1 mobility at the INM (Figure 2—figure supplement 3 and Figure 5). We have not performed an in-depth analysis of a corresponding phospho-deficient mutant. And while we have observed mitotic phosphorylation of LAP1B in mitosis (visualized by changes in migration in normal SDS page and of some sites by mass spectrometry), we have not studied the influence of Tor1B(E178Q) expression. These are excellent suggestions for our future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Although not absolutely essential, evidence for their speculation that the (hetero)oligomeric state of the Torsin/cofactor system influences their findings would be important for the Torsin field. The authors could test one key aspect comparatively easily: would a back interface Torsin mutant (Chase et al., 2017) selectively perturbing the Torsin homo-oligomer, but not the LAP1 interaction, fail or succeed in reverting the Lap1 overexpression phenotype? The result could materially inform our mechanistic understanding of this novel transmembrane relay mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree that this would be very informative, and we have indeed tried to exploit this mutant in the experimental setup used in Figure 3A. The corresponding Tor1B(G258D) mutant did not fully rescue LAP1B-induced NE aberrations in contrast to the wild-type enzyme (our unpublished observations). However, in comparison to the Tor1B(E178Q) mutant, the NE aberrations seemed less severe upon expression of Tor1B(G258D). Thus, this mutant behaves like a “hypomorph” in our assay and we thus find it hard to infer a mechanistic conclusion from the observed “intermediate” phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The relatively low level of LAP1B expression relative to LAP1C expression (and weaker association of LAP1C with chromatin) raises the possibility that LAP1C also competes with LAP1B for other binding partners, including Torsins. Although the authors note that LAP1C can also induce nuclear aberrations (albeit much more weakly than LAP1B) one wonders if a functional LAP1C-Torsin complex might serve a function that is disrupted by LAP1B over-expression. Is there any evidence for such crosstalk?</p></disp-quote><p>It is very likely that LAP1B and LAP1C share additional binding partners, one example being nuclear lamins. However, as LAP1B presents an N-terminal extension of LAP1C, we would expect that most of the functions of LAP1C should also be covered by the long isoform. Thus, rather than LAP1C having a function that is disturbed by LAP1B overexpression, we consider it more likely that LAP1B interacts with additional factors and may have additional functions. So far, we have not performed any differential proteomics of LAP1B and LAP1C.</p></body></sub-article></article>
