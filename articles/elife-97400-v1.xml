Epidermal stem cells supply undifferentiated keratinocytes that differentiate as they migrate toward the outermost skin layer. Although such a replenishment process is disrupted in various human skin diseases, its underlying mechanisms remain elusive. With high-resolution live imaging and in vivo manipulations, we revealed that Notch signaling between keratinocytes is mediated by signaling filopodia called cytonemes and is essential for proper keratinocyte differentiation and proliferation. Inhibiting keratinocyte cytonemes reduced Notch expression within undifferentiated keratinocytes, leading to abnormal differentiation and hyperproliferation, resembling human skin disease phenotypes. Overproduction of Interleukin (IL)–17 signal, associated with skin diseases like psoriasis, induces psoriatic phenotypes by reducing cytoneme extension in zebrafish. Our study suggests that intercellular signaling between keratinocytes through cytonemes is critical for epidermal maintenance, and its misregulation could be an origin of human skin diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cytonemes</kwd><kwd>airinemes</kwd><kwd>epidermis</kwd><kwd>notch</kwd><kwd>IL-17</kwd><kwd>keratinocytes</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32AR080622</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Yi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM142791</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eom</surname><given-names>Dae Seok</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Keratinocyte cytonemes mediate essential Notch signaling for proper skin maintenance, with their disruption leading to abnormal differentiation and hyperproliferation resembling human skin disease phenotypes.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The vertebrate skin is a multilayered structure comprised of three main layers: the epidermis, the dermis, and the hypodermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akat et al., 2022</xref>). Each layer has distinct anatomical characteristics and serves specific functions. Of these layers, the epidermis, as the outermost layer, plays a pivotal role as the body’s first line of defense against environmental threats such as pathogens. It also plays a crucial role in regulating body temperature and preventing water loss into the surrounding environment. The epidermis consists of various layers, including the stratum basale, which houses a single layer of stem cells, and several layers of differentiated cells, including the stratum spinosum, stratum granulosum, and stratum lucidum. The outermost layer, the stratum corneum, primarily comprises dead keratinocytes that are continuously shed and replenished by underlying cells differentiated from epidermal stem cells in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Segre, 2006</xref>).</p><p>In zebrafish, the epidermis shares a similar composition to that of mammals. However, unlike mammals, aquatic animals lack a cornified layer and instead rely on a mucous layer to protect the epidermis in the aquatic environment. The basal layer of zebrafish, equivalent to the mammalian stratum basale, consists of stem cells that provide keratinocytes for replenishment during epidermal remodeling or wound healing. The periderm, comparable to the mammalian stratum granulosum and lucidum, is where fully differentiated keratinocytes are found. Similar to mammalian stratum granulosum, an intermediate layer is present between the basal layer and the periderm, housing undifferentiated keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang and Hwang, 2011</xref>). This intermediate layer is formed during metamorphosis and persists throughout adulthood in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The maintenance of a healthy epidermal barrier requires the intricately controlled proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes, which are supplied from underlying basal stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blanpain and Fuchs, 2009</xref>). As keratinocytes migrate apically from the stem cell layer, they undergo differentiation while concurrently exhibiting proliferation within the intermediate layer. Ultimately, fully differentiated keratinocytes replenish the periderm. This replenishment mechanism is well-conserved in both zebrafish and humans, and its misregulation constitutes a pivotal factor in the etiology of various human skin diseases, including <italic>psoriasis</italic>, <italic>atopic dermatitis</italic>, and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang and Hwang, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lowes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nowell and Radtke, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schempp et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>). Studies have also revealed that maintaining a healthy epidermis requires complex intercellular communications between keratinocytes and the immune system, adding complexity to our efforts to comprehensively understand the mechanism behind this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blanpain and Fuchs, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Park et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>One of the major signaling pathways critical for keratinocyte differentiation and proliferation is the Notch pathway. Studies have demonstrated that Notch receptors and ligands exhibit spatially restricted expression patterns in the layers of the epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nowell and Radtke, 2013</xref>). Notch 1, 2, and 3 are notably prevalent in the undifferentiated keratinocytes in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blanpain et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nickoloff et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Thélu et al., 2002</xref>). Moreover, dysregulated Notch signaling has been linked to abnormal keratinocyte differentiation and hyperproliferation, which are one of the hallmarks of various skin diseases including <italic>psoriasis</italic> and <italic>atopic dermatitis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gratton et al., 2020</xref>), highlighting the importance of proper Notch signaling in epidermal maintenance to retain the balance between keratinocyte differentiation and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ota et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rangarajan et al., 2001</xref>). Nonetheless, the precise mechanisms underlying the initiation of Notch signaling in undifferentiated keratinocytes and its dynamic regulations are not yet understood.</p><p>Furthermore, various combinations of cytokines produced by different immune cells under inflammatory conditions can significantly contribute to the onset or progression of these skin diseases. Among these, interleukin-17 (IL-17) is a well-characterized cytokine closely associated with the symptoms of these conditions. The overproduction of IL-17 by T helper (Th)17 cells and other immune cells is a primary driver of certain skin diseases, such as <italic>psoriasis</italic>. Biologic treatments that inhibit IL-17 have proven to effectively alleviate the symptoms of these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mosca et al., 2021</xref>). Unfortunately, discontinuing these treatments often leads to symptom recurrence. Also known, side effects associated with these inhibitors include headaches, nasopharyngitis, and infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Campa et al., 2016</xref>). Consequently, a definitive cure remains elusive currently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lowes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fragoulis et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Thus, IL-17 is one of the key molecules that contribute to the development of <italic>psoriasis</italic> and other skin diseases. The IL-17 pathway exerts its effects on keratinocytes, endothelial cells, and immune cells, resulting in the production of additional cytokines that promote positive feedback loops, sustaining the inflammatory state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mosca et al., 2021</xref>). However, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of this process are not yet fully understood. Therefore, gaining a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between keratinocytes, the Notch pathway, IL-17, and other players is essential for advancing the treatment of these diseases.</p><p>Intercellular signaling plays a critical role in skin development and maintenance. In recent years, a growing body of evidence has demonstrated that cells can establish communication through long, thin cellular protrusions extended by cells involved in either sending or receiving signals. These protrusions can be categorized based on their cytoskeletal composition, mode of signal delivery, morphology, and other characteristics. Examples include cytonemes, airinemes, tunneling nanotubes, intercellular bridges, migrasomes, exophers, and more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eom, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kornberg and Roy, 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Melentijevic et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang and Scholpp, 2019</xref>). These specialized cellular protrusions have been observed in diverse cell types and species, ranging from fruit flies and sea urchins to zebrafish and mice, with their signaling roles experimentally confirmed in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eom, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang and Scholpp, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Daly et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hall et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kornberg and Roy, 2014a</xref>). These specialized protrusions are significantly longer than typical filopodia and establish direct contact with target cells and serve as highways for transporting signaling molecules for major signaling pathways such as Hedgehog, Wnt, TGFβ, FGF, Notch in many in vivo and in vitro contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Daly et al., 2022</xref>). These signaling cellular protrusions temporally exist and have thin actin or actin/tubulin-based filaments. Consequently, live imaging is considered one of the most effective methods for observing these structures. For that reason, zebrafish has emerged as an excellent model system for studying these cellular protrusions. The transparent nature of their early developing embryos makes zebrafish particularly well-suited for this purpose. Moreover, zebrafish are vertebrates that share common mechanisms with mammals in terms of epidermal remodeling and maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eisenhoffer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martínez-Navarro et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we show evidence that cytonemes extended by fully differentiated keratinocytes play a crucial role in activating Notch signaling in undifferentiated keratinocytes, thus contributing to the maintenance of epidermal homeostasis and remodeling in zebrafish. Furthermore, we demonstrate that IL-17, a key player in the pathogenesis of human skin diseases, and <italic>clint1</italic>, a gene required for epidermal homeostasis, regulate keratinocyte cytonemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dodd et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sahlén et al., 2021</xref>). Collectively, our findings shed light on the mechanisms that govern the regulation of skin replenishment through keratinocyte cytonemes, providing a novel perspective on understanding how skin diseases can originate from keratinocytes autonomously through the mediation of cellular protrusions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Differentiated keratinocytes extend cytoneme-like cellular protrusions</title><p>In previous studies, we have reported a unique type of signaling cellular protrusions known as ‘airinemes’ and have investigated their signaling roles in pigment cells of zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eom, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bowman et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eom et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eom and Parichy, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Park et al., 2022</xref>). To extend our understanding of airinemes in other cell types, we employed random cell labeling and identified several cell types that extend airineme-like protrusions featured by highly curved filaments and large vesicles at their tips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eom, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eom et al., 2015</xref>). Fully differentiated keratinocytes, marked by <italic>krt4</italic>, were among the cell types displaying these airineme-like protrusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, arrowhead). These keratinocytes intriguingly also extend cytoneme-like protrusions, characterized by relatively straight filaments and a lack of vesicle at the tips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eom, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kornberg and Roy, 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang and Scholpp, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>, arrowheads). Nevertheless, we observed a low incidence of airineme-like protrusions, contrasting with the more frequent occurrence of cytoneme-like structures in these keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Consequently, we conducted a more in-depth characterization of these cytoneme-like protrusions. It is noted that cytonemes primarily consist of actin filaments, whereas airinemes are both actin and tubulin-based structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eom, 2020</xref>). To affirm their nature, we utilized an actin marker, <italic>LifeAct-mRuby</italic>, which clearly labeled these cytoneme-like protrusions while showing no co-localization with <italic>tubulin-mCherry</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>). Additionally, cytoneme-like protrusions were significantly reduced upon treatment with a cdc42 inhibitor, which inhibits actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, based on their cytoskeletal composition and morphology, we classified them as cytonemes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Differentiated keratinocytes extend cytoneme-like cellular protrusions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Airineme-like protrusion (arrowhead), and (<bold>B</bold>) cytoneme-like protrusions (arrowheads) labeled in <italic>krt4:palmEGFP</italic> injected keratinocytes.

IL-17 functions as a regulator capable of affecting cytoneme extension by modulating the actin cytoskeleton in keratinocytes.

Our study implies that the patients with human skin diseases may have defective cytoneme signaling between keratinocytes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>It is intriguing to observe that keratinocytes have the ability to extend both cytoneme and airineme-like protrusions. While these protrusions differ in their extension frequency and developmental context, this observation implies that a single cell type can employ two distinct types of cellular protrusions for signaling, each capable of transferring unique signaling molecules to potentially different targets. Previous research in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has demonstrated that the air sac primordium (ASP) can extend multiple cytonemes that appear morphologically identical but convey different signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Roy et al., 2011</xref>). However, it remains unknown whether the same cell type can extend two morphologically (and functionally) distinct protrusions that might also serve distinct functions in separate contexts. Consequently, future studies aimed at unraveling the regulation of these two types of protrusions could provide insights into how cells choose their signaling modalities based on their specific signaling requirements and environmental cues.</p><p>We have asked why cytoneme-mediated signaling is necessary between fully differentiated and undifferentiated keratinocytes, even though they are separated by opposing cell membranes. Notably, we have identified the Notch signaling pathway as being involved, which operates through membrane receptor and ligand interactions between adjacent cells. This led us to hypothesize that Notch signaling between cells in these layers is suppressed by Fringe proteins<italic>,</italic> which modulate Notch signaling. In our research, we have discovered that <italic>lunatic fringe (lfng)</italic> is exclusively expressed in the intermediate layer in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Panin et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Early studies in mice have also reported that three fringe genes exhibit differential expression in different epidermal layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Thélu et al., 1998</xref>). Hence, it appears that Notch signaling is tightly regulated or inhibited by default between epidermal layers in both zebrafish and mice. While it is well documented that Notch signaling is essential for keratinocyte differentiation and proliferation, the mechanism by which Notch signaling is initiated remains unclear. Our study suggests that cytonemes from fully differentiated keratinocytes in the periderm can activate Notch signaling in undifferentiated keratinocytes in the intermediate layer. However, further investigations are necessary to fully comprehend how cytoneme-mediated signaling coordinates with Lunatic fringe or other Fringes to trigger the Notch signal.</p><p>It is widely believed that the overproduction of IL-17 is a major contributing factor to <italic>psoriasis</italic>, and many studies have demonstrated that IL-17 signaling triggers inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). IL-17 affects various cellular targets, such as keratinocytes, neutrophils, endothelial cells, promoting tissue inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blauvelt and Chiricozzi, 2018</xref>). Thus, further studies are essential to determine whether uncontrolled cytoneme-mediated signaling in keratinocytes correlates with the onset or progression of psoriatic or other skin diseases. Nevertheless, our data strongly indicate that cell-autonomous overexpression of <italic>il17rd</italic> in peridermal keratinocytes (<italic>krt4+</italic>) can induce psoriasis-like phenotypes by inhibiting cytoneme extensions, which subsequently leads to a reduction in Notch signaling in undifferentiated keratinocytes. A diminished Notch signal has been observed in psoriatic lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ota et al., 2014</xref>). Our study suggests that cytoneme-mediated intercellular communication between keratinocytes plays a crucial role in epidermal maintenance, and its dysregulation may contribute to the development of human skin diseases. This idea has yet to be fully appreciated, and it could open up new avenues for understanding the onset or progression of human skin diseases.</p><p>Moreover, we have demonstrated that IL-17 can influence cytoneme extension by regulating Cdc42 GTPases, ultimately affecting actin polymerization. Consequently, it would be intriguing to investigate whether genes associated with <italic>psoriasis</italic> or other human skin diseases also function as regulators of cytonemes. For instance, the epidermal-specific deletion of inhibitor of NF-kB kinase 2 (IKK2) or the double knockout of the c-Jun and JunB genes in mice resulted in psoriasis-like phenotypes in a T-cell-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pasparakis et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zenz et al., 2005</xref>). Among the various roles of IKK and JunB, they are also known to regulate the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dubin-Bar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lennikov et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Otani et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, it is conceivable that dysregulated cytoneme-mediated signaling may contribute to psoriatic conditions in these contexts.</p><p>Similarly, we have shown that <italic>clint1</italic> mutants exhibited compromised cytoneme signaling and keratinocyte hyperproliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dodd et al., 2009</xref>). Clint1 plays an important role in vesicle trafficking, and it is suggested that endocytic pathways are critical for multiple steps in cytoneme-mediated morphogen delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Daly et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kalthoff et al., 2002</xref>). Therefore, it is interesting to investigate whether Clint1 functions as a cytoneme regulator could provide valuable insights.</p><p>Another important question requires an answer: the proper remodeling and maintenance of the epidermis seemingly depend on a well-controlled supply of keratinocytes from basal stem cells. Our study demonstrated the relay of cytoneme-mediated signals from the periderm to the underlying undifferentiated keratinocytes, leading to their differentiation and subsequent replacement of peridermal keratinocytes. However, the mechanism through which basal stem cells detect the need for an increased population of keratinocytes to maintain the intermediate layer remains unclear. This process does not necessarily involve cellular protrusion-mediated signaling. However, we discovered cytoneme-like protrusions originating from undifferentiated keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>). Our preliminary data, not presented in this manuscript, suggests that these cellular protrusions project downward, indicating their interaction with basal stem cells. Although further investigation is needed, it is conceivable that a replenishment signal from external sources or the periderm can be transmitted to stem cells through a multi-step cytoneme-mediated intercellular signaling pathways.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Experimental model and subject details</title><sec id="s3-1-1"><title>Zebrafish</title><p>Adult zebrafish were maintained at a constant temperature of 28.5°C under a 16:8 (L:D) cycle.

Thus, it is easy to distinguish filopodia from cytonemes, as cytonemes have a minimum length of 4.36 µm in our observations. We did not use the width parameter since there are no other protrusions except cytonemes. We calculated the cytoneme extension frequency by counting how many cytonemes extended from a cell per hour. We analyzed movies with 3 min intervals over a total of 10 hr, as described in the section above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>RT-PCR, qRT-PCR, and FACS</title><p>Zebrafish at SSL7.5 were skinned (N=15 per group), and the dissected tissues were placed in cold 1 x PBS.

Next, 1 mL Gibco Stem Pro Accutase Cell Dissociation Reagent was added to resuspend tissues, and the tube was incubated for at least 10 min at 37°C to dissociate the cells. After incubation, the cells were passed through 40 µm cell strainers to remove large tissue chunks before subjecting them to FACS (Fluorescence-activated cell sorting). FACS enabled the separation and collection of desired cell populations based on different cell membrane markers. EGFP+ and tdTomato+ cells were collected for downstream non-quantitative RT-PCR and quantitative RT-PCR. For cDNA synthesis, the SuperScript III CellsDirect cDNA Synthesis Kit was employed.

The research group has previously demonstrated that cellular connections called airinemes contribute to this communication. The current work builds upon this knowledge by showing that differentiated keratinocytes also use cytonemes, specialized signaling filopodia, to communicate with undifferentiated keratinocytes. They show that cytonemes are the more abundant type of cellular extension used for communication between the differentiated keratinocyte layer and the undifferentiated keratinocytes. Disruption of cytoneme formation led to expansion of the undifferentiated keratinocytes into the periderm, mimicking skin diseases like psoriasis. The authors go on to show that disruption of cytonemes results in perturbations in Notch signaling between the differentiated keratinocytes of the periderm and the underlying proliferating undifferentiated keratinocytes. Further the authors show that Interleukin-17, also known to drive psoriasis, can restrict formation of periderm cytonemes, possibly through the inhibition of Cdc42 expression. This work suggests that cytoneme mediated Notch signaling plays a central role in normal epidermal regulation. The authors propose that disruption of cytoneme function may be an underlying cause of various human skin diseases.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors provide strong evidence that periderm keratinocytes cytonemes contain the notch ligand DeltaC to promote Notch activation in the underlying intermediate layer to regulate accurate epidermal maintenance.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The impact of the study would be increased if the mechanism by which Interlukin-17 and Cdc42 collaborate to regulate cytonemes was defined. Experiments measuring Cdc42 activity, rather than just measuring expression, would strengthen the conclusions.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>The authors have sufficiently addressed my critiques from the initial round of evaluation. They have included useful representative images, clarified how they scored cytonemes and provided additional controls/experimental conditions that improve the rigor of the study. The results provided now support the key conclusions of the study.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.97400.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Yi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, Irvine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Irvine</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Nguyen</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, Irvine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Irvine</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Qingan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, Irvine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Irvine</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Has</surname><given-names>Oliver</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, Irvine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Irvine</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Forouzesh</surname><given-names>Kiarash</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, Irvine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Irvine</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Eom</surname><given-names>Dae Seok</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, Irvine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Irvine</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this paper, Wang et al show that differentiated peridermal cells of the zebrafish epidermis extend cytoneme-like protrusions toward the less differentiated, intermediate layer below.

Finally, changes in expression of the inflammatory cytokine IL-17 and its receptors is shown to affect cytoneme number and periderm structure in a manner similar to Notch and cdc42 perturbations.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Overall, the idea that differentiated cells signal to underlying undifferentiated cells via membrane protrusions in skin keratinocytes is interesting and novel, and it is clear that periderm cells send out thin membrane protrusions that contain a Notch ligand. Further, perturbations that affect cytoneme number, Notch signaling, and IL-17 expression clearly lead to changes in periderm structure and gene expression.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>More work is needed to determine whether the effects on keratinocyte differentiation are due to a loss of cytonemes themselves, or to broader effects of inhibiting cdc42. Moreover, more evidence is needed to support the claim that periderm cytonemes deliver Delta ligands to induce Notch signaling below. Without these aspects of the study being solidified, understanding how IL-17 affects these processes seems premature.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The aim of the study was to understand how cells of the skin communicate across dermal layers. The research group has previously demonstrated that cellular connections called airinemes contribute to this communication. The current work builds upon this knowledge by showing that differentiated keratinocytes also use cytonemes, specialized signaling filopodia, to communicate with undifferentiated keratinocytes. They show that cytonemes are the more abundant type of cellular extension used for communication between the differentiated keratinocyte layer and the undifferentiated keratinocytes. Disruption of cytoneme formation led to the expansion of the undifferentiated keratinocytes into the periderm, mimicking skin diseases like psoriasis. The authors go on to show that disruption of cytonemes results in perturbations in Notch signaling between the differentiated keratinocytes of the periderm and the underlying proliferating undifferentiated keratinocytes. Further, the authors show that Interleukin-17, also known to drive psoriasis, can restrict the formation of periderm cytonemes, possibly through the inhibition of Cdc42 expression. This work suggests that cytoneme-mediated Notch signaling plays a central role in normal epidermal regulation. The authors propose that disruption of cytoneme function may be an underlying cause of various human skin diseases.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors provide strong evidence that periderm keratinocytes cytonemes contain the notch ligand DeltaC to promote Notch activation in the underlying intermediate layer to regulate accurate epidermal maintenance.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The impact of the study would be increased if the mechanism by which Interlukin-17 and Cdc42 collaborate to regulate cytonemes was defined. Experiments measuring Cdc42 activity, rather than just measuring expression, would strengthen the conclusions.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Leveraging zebra fish as a research model, Wang et al identified &quot;cytoneme-like structures&quot; as a mechanism for mediating cell-cell communications among skin epidermal cells. The authors further demonstrated that the &quot;cytoneme-like structures&quot; can mediate Notch signaling, and the &quot;cytoneme-like structures&quot; are influenced by IL17 signaling.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Elegant zebrafish genetics, reporters, and live imaging.</p><p>Weaknesses: (minor)</p><p>This paper focused on characterizing the &quot;cytoneme-like structures&quot; between different layers and the NOTCH signaling. However, these &quot;cytoneme-like structures&quot; observed in undifferentiated KC (Figure 2B), although at a slightly lower frequency, were not interpreted. In addition, it is unclear if these &quot;cytoneme-like structures&quot; can mediate other signaling pathways than NOTCH.</p></disp-quote><p>We are currently investigating the role of cytoneme-like protrusions extended from undifferentiated keratinocytes and their role is still under investigation. We believe that addressing the function of undifferentiated keratinocyte cytonemes and exploring whether peridermal cytoneme can mediate other signaling pathways is beyond the scope of the current manuscript. However, we hope to publish our discoveries about them soon. It is worth noting that cytonemes mediate other morphogenetic signals, such as Hh, Wnt, Fgf, and TGFbeta in other contexts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, this is a solid paper with convincing data reporting the &quot;cytoneme-like structures&quot; in vivo, and with compelling data demonstrating the roles in NOTCH signaling and the regulation by IL17.</p></disp-quote><p>These findings provide a foundation for future work exploring the &quot;cytoneme-like structures&quot; in the mammalian system and other epithelial tissue types. This paper also suggests a potential connection between the &quot;cytoneme-like structures&quot; and psoriasis, which needs to be further explored in clinical samples.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Major points</p><p>- In general, representative images from each experiment should accompany the graphs shown. The inclusion of still frames from time-lapse imaging experiments in the main figures would help the reader understand the morphology and dynamics of these protrusions in control, cdc42, and IL-17 manipulations.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comments. We appreciate your suggestion to include representative images alongside the graphs to better illustrate the morphology and dynamics of these protrusions.</p><p>In response, we have made the following additions to our main figures.</p><p>Figure 3A now includes still images from time-lapse movies for both control and cdc42 manipulations.</p><p>Figure 5A and 6A,C now include still images for il17 manipulations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Data in Figure 3 is crucial as it demonstrates that cdc42DN selectively impairs cytoneme extensions without affecting other actin-based structures. It also shows that cdc42DN leads to upregulation of krtt1c19e in periderm. Therefore, these data should be presented in a comprehensive way. Still, frames of high mag views of time-lapse images from control and cdc42DN should be included in the figure. Similarly, a counter label (E-Cadherin, perhaps) showing the presence of all three layers and goblet cells at different focal planes capturing the different layers of the skin should be included. It is stated that the goblet cell number is unaffected, but they seem to be absent in the image shown in Figure 3B.</p></disp-quote><p>In this revised version, we have included magnified cross-sectional views. In addition to the images of the peridermal layer from the original version, we have now included the underlying intermediate and basal stem cell layers (Figure 3C-C”). We hope these data convincingly show that peridermal keratinocytes in cytoneme inhibited animals co-express krt4 and krtt1c19e markers, suggesting that peridermal keratinocytes are not fully differentiated.</p><p>We agree that the goblet cells in this particular image of experimental group appear largely absent, however, as we quantified many animals, the number of goblet cells was not significantly different between controls and experimental (Figure S2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The effects on periderm architecture upon broad cdc42 inhibition may not be directly due to a loss of cytonemes. Performing this experiment in a mosaic manner to determine if the effects are local and in the range of cytoneme protrusion would strengthen the conclusions. Adding a secondary perturbation to inhibit cytoneme formation in periderm cells would also strengthen the conclusions that defects are not related specifically to cdc42 inhibition, but cytonemes themselves.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We confirmed that mosaic expression of cdc42DN in peridermal keratinocytes elicited local disorganization, and elevated <italic>krtt1c19e</italic> expression as we seen in transgenic lines. Also, the cdc42DN expressing cells exhibited significantly lower cytoneme extension frequency.</p><p>In addition, we found that like cdc42DN, rac1DN expressing keratinocytes exhibited significant decrease in cytoneme extension frequency, but rhoabDN show no effects (new Figure S3). These data suggest that cytoneme extension is regulated by cdc42 and rac1 but not rhoab. Further investigation is required however, at least these data suggest that the effects we observe is likely the loss of cytonemes not just specifically to cdc42 inhibition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 4. The inclusion of an endogenous reporter of Notch activity, like Hes or Hey immunofluorescence, would strengthen the conclusion that the intermediate layer is Notch responsive.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. In this revised version, we have included immunostaining data in Figure 4D demonstrating that Her6 (the orthologous to human HES1) protein is expressed in the intermediate layer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- It is not clear where along a differentiation trajectory Notch signaling and cytonemes are needed. What happens to the intermediate layer when Notch signaling or cdc42 is inhibited? Do the cells become more basal-like? Or failing to become periderm? Meaning - is Notch promoting the basal to intermediate fate transition, or the intermediate to periderm transition? A more comprehensive characterization of basal, intermediate, and periderm differentiation with markers selective to each layer would help define which step in the process is being altered.</p></disp-quote><p>Notch signaling is known to regulate keratinocyte terminal differentiation. Thus, it requires in the process from intermediate to peridermal transition. We observed peridermal keratinocytes still strongly express krt19 suggesting their terminal differentiation is inhibited when cytoneme mediated Notch signaling is compromised.</p><p>As seen on Figure 3C”, peridermal keratinocytes express both krt4 and krtt1c19e markers and they are located at the peridermal layer suggesting that they are not fully differentiated keratinocytes. As we included the images of intermediate and basal layers, we do not observe any noticeable defects in basal stem cells or complete depletion of intermediate keratinocytes (Fig 3C-C”). These observations suggest that notch signaling, activated by cytonemes, is required for the differentiation of undifferentiated intermediate keratinocytes into peridermal keratinocytes.</p><p>We included this interpretation in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- A number of times in the text it is suggested that cytonemes, Notch, and IL-17 signaling are essential for keratinocyte differentiation and proliferation, but proliferation (% cells in S-phase and M-phase) is not measured. Also, #of keratinocytes @ periderm is not an accurate way to report the number of cells in the periderm unless every cell in the larvae has been counted. It should be # cells/unit area.</p></disp-quote><p>In this revised version, we confirmed that the number of Edu+ cells among peridermal keratinocytes are significantly increased when cytonemes are inhibited (Figure 3F-G). Also, as indicated in the methods section, we indeed counted the cells in 290um x 200um square. We believe both of the data sufficiently suggest that the number of keratinocytes in periderm is significantly increased due to the lack of proper cytoneme mediated signaling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- If the model is correct that Delta ligands from the periderm signal to intermediate cells to promote their differentiation and inhibit their proliferation, then depletion of Delta from Krt4 expressing cells should recapitulate the periderm phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>It is a great suggestion. However, zebrafish skin express multiple delta ligands and we do not know what specific combination of Deltas are delivered via cytonemes. In this manuscript we identified Dlc is expressed along the cytonemes and krt4+ cells (revised Figure S4), however we are unsure whether other Delta ligands involve the notch activation. However, cytoneme inhibition is performed specifically in krt4+ cells and the downregulation of Notch activation are observed in krtt1c19e+ undifferentiated keratinocytes. In this revised version, we found that a Notch responsive protein Her6 is exclusively expressed in the cytoneme target keratinocytes, and cytoneme extending cells (krt4+) do not express Notch receptors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- rtPCR data in Figure S3 is not properly controlled. Each gene should be tested in both krt4 and krtt1c19e expressing cells to determine their relative expression levels in different skin layers that are proposed to signal to one another. Are Notch ligands present in basal cells? These could be activating Notch in the intermediate layer.</p></disp-quote><p>Our intention was to merely confirm the Notch signaling components are expressed in cytoneme extending and receiving cells. Based on the new panel of RT-PCRs for notch signaling components, we confirmed again that dlc is expressed in cytoneme extending cells but not in receiving cells. Basal cells are also krtt1c19e+ but we did not detect dlc from them. Interestingly, we found that notch 2 is exclusively expressed in krtt1c19e+ cells but not from krt4+ cytoneme extending cells (now new Figure S4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- It is not intuitive why NICD (activation) and SuHDN (inhibition) of Notch signaling should result in a similar effect on the periderm. What is the effect of NICD expression on the TP1:H2BGFP reporter? Does it hyperactivate as expected?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree reviewer’s concerns. It is well studied that <italic>psoriasis</italic> patients exhibits either loss or gain of notch signaling (Ota et al., 2014 Acta Histochecm Cytochem, Abdou et al., 2012 Annals of Diagnostic Pathology). However, it remains unknown the underlying mechanisms. We merely intended to showcase our zebrafish experimental manipulations recapitulate human patients’ case. However, we believe this data doesn’t require for drawing the overall conclusion but need further investigation to explain it. Thus, if the reviewers agree we want to omit it in this manuscript and leave it for future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Due to the involvement of immune signaling in hyperproliferative skin diseases the paper then investigates the role of IL-17 on cytoneme formation by overexpressing two IL-17 receptors in the periderm. Fewer cytonemes were present in the receptor over-expressing periderm cells. The rationale for overexpressing the receptors was unclear. If relevant to endogenous cytokine signaling, the periderm would be expected to express IL-17 receptors normally and respond to elevated levels of IL-17.</p></disp-quote><p>The rationale behind the reason of why we overexpress the IL-17 receptors is to test its autonomy of krt4+ peridermal cells. There is a debate that whether the onset of <italic>psoriasis</italic> is autonomous to keratinocytes or non-autonomous effects of immune malfunction. In addition to the overexpression of IL-17 receptors, we showed that the IL-17 ligand overexpression shows the sample effects on cytoneme extension (Fig. 6A-B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Experiments overexpressing IL-17 in macrophages are also suggested to limit cytoneme number whereas heterozygous deletion elevates them. Representative images and movies should be included to support the data. Western blots or immunofluorescence showing that IL-17 and its receptors are indeed overexpressed in the relevant layers/cell types should also be included as controls. Knockout of IL-17 protein in the new Crispr deletion mutant should also be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to the reviewer’s comments, we have included representative images of peridermal keratinocytes in IL-17 ligand overexpressed and il17 CRISPR KO animals (Fig. 6A,C).</p><p>We have confirmed the overexpression of Il17rd, Il17ra1a and Il17a in the transgenic animals. For the il17 receptors, we FACS-sorted differentiated keratinocytes and performed qRT-PCR. Similarly, for the il17 ligand, we isolated skin tissue and conducted qRT-PCR (new Figure S7).</p><p>Additionally, we confirmed that IL-17 protein expression is undetectable in il17a CRISPR KO fish (Fig. S8C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Evidence that the effect of IL-17 upregulation on periderm architecture is via cytonemes is suggestive but not conclusive. Can the phenotype be rescued by a constitutively active cdc42?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion. We are unsure whether constitutively active cdc42 expression can rescue IL-17 overexpression mediated reduction of cytoneme extension frequency. It is well expected that cdc42CA will stabilize actin polymerization in turn more cytonemes. However, it is also known sustained cdc42 activation can paradoxically lead to actin depolymerization. Thus, we concern it will be likely uninterpretable. Also, we need to generate a new transgenic line for this experiment and the baseline control experiments and validations take substantial amount of time and efforts with no confidence.</p><p>We and others believe that the cdc42 is a final effector molecule to regulate cytoneme extension given its role in actin polymerization. we provided the evidence that IL-17 overexpression significantly reduced cdc42 and rac1 expression (Figure 6E) and co-manipulation with IL17 overexpression and cdc42DN led to further down-regulation of cytoneme extension frequency in peridermal keratinocytes (Figure 6H).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In a final experiment, the authors mutate a psoriasis-associated gene, clint1a gene and show an effect on cytonemes, Notch output, and periderm structure. More information about what this gene encodes, where the mRNA is expressed, and where the cell the protein should localize would help place this result in context for the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>In this revised manuscript we included more information about the clint1.</p><p>“The clathrin interactor 1 (<italic>clint1</italic>), also referred to as enthoprotin and epsinR functions as an adaptor molecule that binds SNARE proteins and play a role in clathrin-mediated vasicular transport (Wasiak, 2002). It has also been reported that <italic>clint1</italic> is expressed in epidermis and play an important role in epidermal homeostasis and development in zebrafish (Dodd et al., 2009)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points</p><p>- The architecture of zebrafish skin is notably distinct from that of humans and other mammals and whether parallels can be drawn with regards to cytoneme mediated signaling requires further investigation. For this reason, I believe the title should include the words 'in zebrafish skin'.</p></disp-quote><p>In this version, we changed the title as ‘Cytoneme-mediated intercellular signaling in keratinocytes essential for epidermal remodeling in zebrafish’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- More details about the timing of cdc42 inhibition should be given in the main text to interpret the data. How many hours of days are the larvae treated? How does this compare to the rate of division and differentiation in the zebrafish larval epidermis?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for omitting the detailed experimental conditions for cytoneme inhibition. We have revised the main text as follows “Although the cytoneme inhibition is evident after overnight treatment with the inducing drugs, noticeable epidermal phenotypes begin to appear after 3 days of treatment. This reflects the higher cytoneme extension frequency and their potential role during metamorphic stages, which takes a couple of weeks (Figure 1C)”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- What are the genotypes of animals in Figure 4B where 'Notch expression' is being measured upon cdc42DN inhibition? Is this the TP1:H2B-GFP reporter? Again, details of the timing of this experiment are needed to evaluate the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We indicated the reference supplement figure for the Notch activity measure in the figure legend S4. And we added the following sentence in the main text. “Similar to the effects on the epidermis after cytoneme inhibition (Figure 3), it takes 3 days to observe a significantly reduction in Notch signal in the undifferentiated keratinocytes.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>- Figure 2B: the authors indicate that the undifferentiated keratinocytes (krtt1c19e+) do extend some cytonemes. Although this behavior is not a focus of the study, it would be helpful to see an image of krtt1c19e:lyn-tdTomato cytonemes. The discussion ends with an interesting statement about downward pointed protrusions coming off the undifferentiated keratinocytes. A representative image of this should be included in Figure 2.</p></disp-quote><p>In this revised version, we included an image of krtt1c19e positive cell that extend cytonemes in Figure 2C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The evidence for hyperproliferation of the undifferentiated keratinocytes would be strengthened by quantifying proliferation. Most experiments result in increased expression of krtt1c19e in the periderm layer, but it is unclear whether this is invasion, remodeling, or incomplete differentiation of the cells. Notch suppression with krtt1c19e:SuHDN and overactivation with krtt1c19e:NICD phenocopy each other. Are there differences in proliferation vs differentiation rates in these two genotypes that result in a similar phenotype?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments. In response to the feedback, we included Edu experiments that show increased cell proliferation in keratinocytes in periderm in experimental groups. Additionally, we observed co-expressed of both differentiated marker krt4 and undifferentiated marker krtt1c19e in the keratinocytes in periderm. Since we did not observe depletion of intermediate layer, we believe it is reasonable to conclude that the phenotype represents incomplete differentiation (new Figure 3). For the krtt1c19e:NICD question, please refer to our response to reviewer #1’ comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Do Cdc42DN and il17rd or il17ra1a work in parallel or in a hierarchy of signaling events to regulate cytoneme formation?</p></disp-quote><p>Cdc42 is widely recognized as a final effector in cytoneme extension, given its well-established role in actin polymerization, which is critical for cytoneme extension. Our data support a model where il17 signaling acts upstream of cdc42. We showed that the overexpression of il17rd or il17ra1a significantly reduced the expression of Cdc42 (Figure 6E). In double transgenic fish overexpressing il17rd and cdc42DN, we observed a more marked decrease in cytoneme extension compared to single transgenic (Figure 6H). These results collectively indicate that, at least partially, Cdc42 functions downstream of il17 signaling in the context of cytoneme formation. However, we acknowledge that additional regulatory mechanisms may be involved, given the complexity of cellular signaling networks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 6C: Are the effects of overexpression of il17rd specific to Cdc42, or are other Rho family GTPases like Rac and Rho also affected? Is the microridge defect (Figure 6D) also present in Tg(krt4:TetGBDTRE-v2a-cdc42DN) when induced, or could this be regulated by Rho/Rac?</p></disp-quote><p>We used the microridge formation as a readout to evaluate the effects of il17receptor overexpression on actin polymerization. In this revision, we demonstrate that the expression of other small GTPases is also decreased in il17rd or il17ra1a overexpressed keratinocytes (Figure 6E). Also, we confirmed that microridges exhibit significantly shorter branch length when cdc42DN or rac1DN is overexpressed (new Figure S9). It is note that we have shown that the effects on cytonemes are regulated by cdc42 and rac1 (new Figure S3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Please change the color of the individual data points from black to grey or another color so readers may better visualize the mean and error bars.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this comment, and in response, we have revised the figures by changing the color of the individual data points to empty circles and now the error bars are better visualized.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 1: What were the parameters used to identify an extension as a cytoneme? Please include the minimal length and max-width used in the analysis in the methods.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comments. We have now included the method of how we defined cytonemes and measured as follows. In zebrafish keratinocytes, lamellipodial extensions are the dominant extension type, and most filopodial extensions are less than 1µm in length, both are not easily visible at the confocal resolution we used for this study. Thus, it is easy to distinguish filopodia from cytonemes, as cytonemes have a minimum length of 4.36µm in our observations. We did not use the width parameter since there are no other protrusions except cytonemes. We calculated the cytoneme extension frequency by counting how many cytonemes extended from a cell per hour. We analyzed movies with 3-minute intervals over a total of 10 hours, as described in the section above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Line 149-150, (Figure S1) ML141 is a Cdc42 inhibitor, please correct the wording. Would the use of an actin polymerization inhibitor like Cytochalasin B or a depolymerizing agent (Latrunculin) increase the reduction in cytoneme formation?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing it out. We have revised it in this version. We have tried Cytochalasin B or Latrunculin and the treatments killed the animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 2: What is the depth of the Z-axis images?

Yes, the scale bar should apply to the cross-sectional images.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 3B-B' cross-section images should be added to confirm images shown represent the periderm layer. Are there folds in the epidermis due to cdc42DN expression or are differentiated keratinocytes absent?</p></disp-quote><p>In response, we have included z-stack images in the revised figure 3. We found that the epidermal tissue is not flat as compared to controls, presumably due to broad cdc42DN expression (Figure 3C”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure S3: Do the EGFP+ and tdTomato+ cells have noticeable differential gene expression?

However, we realized that activity measure with biosensors, especially in vivo, required significant amount of time and effort and validations which seem to take a substantial amount of work needed, and no confidence to work in our end.
