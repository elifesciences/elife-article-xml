regulation of gene expression and maintenance of genome stability. Heterochromatin formation involves spreading of chromatin-modifying factors away from initiation points over large DNA domains by poorly understood mechanisms. In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, heterochromatin formation requires the SIR complex, which contains subunits with histone-modifying, histone-binding, and self-association activities. Here, we analyze binding of the Sir proteins to reconstituted mono-, di-, tri-, and tetra-nucleosomal chromatin templates and show that key Sir-Sir interactions bridge only sites on different nucleosomes but not sites on the same nucleosome, and are therefore 'interrupted' with respect to sites on the same nucleosome. We observe maximal binding affinity and cooperativity to unmodified di-nucleosomes and propose that nucleosome pairs bearing unmodified histone H4-lysine16 and H3-lysine79 form the fundamental units of Sir chromatin binding and that cooperative binding requiring two appropriately modified nucleosomes mediates selective Sir recruitment and spreading.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17556.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17556.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17556.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Inside plant, fungi and animal cells, DNA wraps around disc-shaped histone proteins to form structures called nucleosomes. Chains of nucleosomes, each with a small stretch of DNA, help to package meters of genetic material into a compact form called chromatin in the cell’s nucleus. Changes to how chromatin is organized can affect how genes switch on and off. Critically, this allows cells to respond to changes in their environment and to develop into the many cell types required to build animals ranging from worms to humans. For example, specialized groups of proteins that bind to nucleosomes, spread along specific sites of chromatin and can change its structure into an inaccessible form called heterochromatin thereby switching off genes. Proteins that bind to specific nucleosomes control the spreading, gene activity, and even memory properties of heterochromatin. However, it is not clear how these proteins spread from their original binding point on the chromatin to other nucleosomes.</p><p>Now, Behrouzi, Lu et al. show how heterochromatin spreads to form large, stable structures in budding yeast. Their experiments reveal that heterochromatin proteins attach to sites on neighbouring nucleosomes, forming bridges between them. These findings conflict a long-held view as they show that pairs of nucleosomes, rather than individual nucleosomes, are the natural binding partners for heterochromatin proteins. Also, because these proteins cannot bridge from one side of a nucleosome to the other, they are unlikely to form a continuous chain across multiple nucleosomes on the chromatin. Instead, Behrouzi, Lu et al. observed that a series of short bridges between nucleosomes helps heterochromatin to spread.</p><p>To fully understand why bridging only happens between separate nucleosomes, the atomic structure of heterochromatin proteins bound to pairs of nucleosomes needs to be determined. In addition, it will be essential to develop more experimental methods to study the spreading of heterochromatin inside cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17556.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17556.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>heterochromatin</kwd><kwd>Sir3</kwd><kwd>Sir4</kwd><kwd>chromatin spreading</kwd><kwd>nucleosome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM61641</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moazed</surname><given-names>Danesh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moazed</surname><given-names>Danesh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cooperative association of a histone-binding complex with pairs of appropriately modified nucleosomes, which form fundamental units of binding, mediates selective heterochromatin assembly and spreading.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The packaging of eukaryotic nuclear DNA with histones and other proteins into chromatin is critical for the regulation of transcription, recombination, replication and DNA damage repair. The basic unit of chromatin folding is the nucleosome, in which 147 base pairs of DNA are wrapped around an octamer of two copies each of histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kornberg, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Luger et al., 1997</xref>). Site-specific DNA-binding proteins or RNA-based mechanisms recruit histone-modifying proteins that mediate histone posttranslational modifications such as acetylation and methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holoch and Moazed, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jenuwein and Allis, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kouzarides, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Schreiber and Bernstein, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Strahl and Allis, 2000</xref>). These modifications provide binding sites for numerous effector proteins that activate or silence transcription and are often associated with large domains of DNA, which can range in size from 2–3 to several hundred kilobases. The assembly of large domains of DNA with activating or repressive histone modifications allows regional and coordinated regulation of gene expression and maintenance of landmark chromosome structures, but the mechanisms that mediate the spreading of histone modification over large DNA domains are poorly understood.</p><p>Heterochromatic DNA domains are a conserved feature of eukaryotic chromosomes and provide the most striking examples of regional control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Moazed, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Richards and Elgin, 2002</xref>). Heterochromatin forms at repetitive DNA regions in order to prevent recombination and maintain genome integrity as well as at developmentally regulated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Richards and Elgin, 2002</xref>). Heterochromatin tends to spread from defined initiation sites, leading to the inactivation of genes in a sequence-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Talbert and Henikoff, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). The mechanism of spreading of heterochromatin involves the recruitment of chromatin-modifying complexes, which have coupled histone-binding and histone-modifying activities, to specific nucleation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Canzio et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grunstein, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hoppe et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Luo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Moazed, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Rusche et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">2003</xref>). This is then followed by iterative cycles of histone modification and histone binding, which are thought to be coupled with the formation of homo and heterotypic interactions between silencing factors. In these models, silencing factors are proposed to form bridges that span binding sites on the same nucleosome and 'sticky ends' that extend away from nucleation points and mediate interactions across neighboring nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Canzio et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Moazed, 2001</xref>). The continuous nature of interactions between silencing proteins, both across single nucleosomes and across neighboring ones, amounts to the formation of proteinaceous chromatin-bound oligomers. However, this model has not been tested with chromatin templates that allow the extent to which self-association of silencing factors contributes to specific binding and spreading to be determined. The nature of silencing factor self-associations, how they bridge nucleosomes, and their relationship to the mechanism of spreading therefore remain ambiguous.</p><p>Silent chromatin in the budding yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> serves as a major model system for studies of heterochromatin establishment and inheritance. Silencing at the silent mating type loci (<italic>HML</italic> and <italic>HMR)</italic> and sub-telomeric regions requires silent information regulator (Sir) proteins, Sir2, Sir3, and Sir4, which together form the SIR complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aparicio et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Klar et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Moazed et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rine and Herskowitz, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rudner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rusche et al., 2003</xref>). During the initiation step, the Sir2 and Sir4 proteins, which together form a stable Sir2/4 heterodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Moazed et al., 1997</xref>), and Sir3, are recruited to the silencer through interactions with silencer-specificity factors, ORC, Abf1, and Rap1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hoppe et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Luo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Moretti et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Moretti and Shore, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Rusche et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Triolo and Sternglanz, 1996</xref>).

Subsequent iterative cycles of deacetylation and Sir-Sir interactions lead to spreading of SIR complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hoppe et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Luo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Rusche et al., 2002</xref>) along multiple kilobases of chromatin away from the silencer.</p><p>Many of the key activities of the SIR complex have been mapped to specific domains in its subunits and provide important guides for further studies. Modification-sensitive nucleosome binding occurs via a conserved domain at the N terminus of Sir3, called the bromo-adjacent homology (BAH) domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buchberger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Onishi et al., 2007</xref>). The AAA ATPase-like (AAAL) domain of Sir3 also interacts with histones and nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hecht et al., 1995</xref>). However, this interaction is at least an order of magnitude weaker than the BAH-mediated chromatin interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Martino et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Sir4 forms stable dimers via a coiled-coil domain at its C terminus (Sir4CC), which also forms a binding surface for two Sir3 molecules, linking the Sir2 histone deacetylase to the nucleosome binding subunit of the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Moazed et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rudner et al., 2005</xref>). Finally, Sir3 forms dimers via a winged helix (wH) domain at its C terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Oppikofer et al., 2013</xref>). Although all of the above interaction domains are critical for silencing, how they promote the spreading of silencing remains unknown.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17556.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cooperative association of Sir3 with DiN.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram of the Sir3 primary sequence showing the location of the BAH, AAAL, and wH domains.

Our analysis shows that, at physiological concentrations, Sir3 binds to DiN with maximal cooperativity by a mechanism that requires the Sir3wH dimerization domain and is enhanced by the Sir4CC domain. In contrast, although each nucleosome contains two Sir3 binding sites, the association of Sir3 with MonoN, in the presence or absence of Sir4CC, occurs by a non-cooperative mechanism, suggesting that these interactions mediate lateral Sir3-Sir3 bridging across two nucleosomes, rather than on the same nucleosome. Moreover, we show that H4K16 acetylation and H3K79 trimethylation, two well-established anti-silencing modifications, work together to dramatically reduce the affinity of Sir3 for nucleosomes. Together, our findings suggest that spreading of the Sir proteins on chromatin involves the cooperative recruitment of new SIR complexes to pairs of nucleosomes lacking H4K16 acetylation and H3K79 methylation independently of interactions with already bound SIR complexes. This inter-nucleosomal cooperative mode of binding suggests that interrupted Sir3 bridges across neighboring nucleosomes, stabilized by Sir4, are the primary driving force for heterochromatin spreading.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sir3 binds to DiN with high affinity and cooperativity</title><p>Sir3 molecules self-associate with high affinity (K<sub>D</sub> ~2 nM, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liou et al., 2005</xref>) to form mostly homo-dimers and to a lesser extent oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">McBryant et al., 2006</xref>).

To validate the EMSA observations using an equilibrium assay, we examined Sir3-nucleosome interactions at physiological ionic strength and temperature using the BioLayer Interferometry (BLI) assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdiche et al., 2008</xref>). To perform BLI measurements, we immobilized biotinylated MonoN or DiN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>) on the surface of streptavidin-coated biosensors and studied changes in the number of Sir3 molecules bound to nucleosomes by monitoring in real time the wavelength shifts of the reflected light from the biosensor surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, see Materials and methods). The binding signal at equilibrium reflects the number of Sir3 molecules bound to nucleosomes at any given Sir3 concentration. We reconstructed binding isotherms by plotting normalized binding signals at equilibrium <italic>vs.</italic> Sir3 concentration (see Materials and methods for further details). As controls, binding of Sir3 to immobilized nucleosomes was insensitive to whether the biotin moiety was attached to histone H2A via a flexible 30 Å linker or to the end of nucleosomal DNA with a 20 bp extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>). In contrast, it was strongly sensitive to the acetylation of nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D</xref>), indicating that the BLI signal reflected specific Sir3-nucleosome interactions.</p><p>We observed that Sir3BAH bound to MonoN and DiN with the nearly identical apparent affinity of ~1.4 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), consistent with EMSA measurements (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Similarly, analysis of the binding profiles of full-length Sir3 to MonoN and DiN resulted in calculated apparent K<sub>D</sub> values of around 1.4 and 0.11 µM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), which are similar to those obtained by EMSA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The Hill coefficient of Sir3 and Sir3BAH binding to MonoN was nearly identical and close to 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). In fact, binding of Sir3 or Sir3BAH to MonoN could be satisfactorily described by a simple model based on saturation of two identical and independent (i.e. non-cooperative) binding sites with a macroscopic dissociation constant of 1.2–1.4 µM (see Materials and methods), confirming the absence of cooperativity in binding of Sir3 to MonoN. In contrast, we observed cooperative binding of Sir3 to DiN, reflected in the Hill coefficient of ~2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, the complex of Sir3 with DiN, but not with MonoN, is stabilized by a cooperative mechanism, supporting the inter-nucleosomal mode of bridging depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>DiN units constitute the fundamental unit of chromatin for Sir3 binding</title><p>Our findings above show that Sir3-Sir3 contacts across different nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, right) play an important role in stabilizing Sir3-chromatin complexes. In contrast, even though there are two binding surfaces on each nucleosome for Sir3, intra-nucleosomal Sir3 interactions are prohibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, left). Therefore, one may conclude that in the context of chromatin arrays, unmodified DiN units act as independent high affinity binding sites for Sir3 dimers. To directly test this hypothesis, we compared the binding of Sir3 to DiN versus larger nucleosomal arrays using the BLI assay. Positive interactions between binding sites, beyond those present in the DiN template (equivalent to Sir3 oligomerization on chromatin), would result in higher apparent binding affinity and cooperativity for longer nucleosome arrays compared to DiN. In stark contrast to the difference in binding affinity between MonoN and DiN templates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,H</xref>), Sir3 binding to tri- and tetra-nucleosome templates (TriN and TetraN, respectively) displayed very similar binding affinity and cooperativity as binding to DiN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This result suggests that even in the context of nucleosome arrays Sir3-chromatin interactions that contribute to binding stability are limited to sites on only two different nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, right). We therefore conclude that binding sites on two different nucleosomes form the fundamental unit of chromatin binding for Sir3 dimers.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17556.009</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Sir3 displays maximal cooperative binding to DiN that is mediated by its winged helix (wH).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Binding of full-length Sir3 to DiN, TriN, and TetraN templates after background correction and normalization to min-max of binding signal was fit with the Hill equation (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

Deletion of the wH domain therefore did not affect Sir3 affinity for MonoN.

Further analysis of the BLI binding data with the Hill equation revealed that in contrast to full-length Sir3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>), Sir3∆wH, like Sir3BAH, bound to MonoN and DiN without cooperativity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). We therefore conclude that the wH dimerization domain is required for Sir3 cooperative and high affinity binding to DiN, without affecting Sir3 binding to MonoN. Furthermore, measurement of complex dissociation rates by BLI revealed that loss of wH domain reduced the half-life of Sir3-DiN and Sir3-TriN complexes by ~40%, while having little or no effect on Sir3-MonoN complex half-life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).

Therefore, although AAAL domain on its own interacts weakly with chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wang et al., 2013</xref>), it plays an important role in stabilizing the BAH-mediated Sir3-nucleosome complex. This effect is distinct from the wH domain-mediated stabilization of Sir3 inter-nucleosomal bridges discussed above.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Sir4CC stabilizes the Sir3 bridge across the DiN</title><p>Sir4 forms dimers, via its C-terminal coiled-coil (CC) domain, and this dimerization activity is required for silencing at both telomeres and the mating-type locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chien et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Murphy et al., 2003</xref>). Sir4CC also interacts with Sir3, through the Sir3 AAA ATPase-like (AAAL) domain, and this interaction is required for Sir3 recruitment and silencing in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ehrentraut et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">King et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rudner et al., 2005</xref>). We therefore speculated that Sir4CC might further stabilize Sir3-nucleosome interactions. There are at least two possible ways that Sir4 may interact with Sir3-nucleosome complexes. In the first mode, the Sir4CC mediates interactions between Sir3 molecules bound to each side of the same nucleosome forming an intra-nucleosomal bridge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, left). In the second model, the Sir4CC interacts with Sir3 molecules bound to two neighboring nucleosomes, adding a second layer of inter-nucleosomal interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, right). Similar to the different Sir3 binding modes described above, these two models predict different Sir4CC effects on the binding affinity of Sir3 for the MonoN and DiN, and therefore can be distinguished by binding experiments. Intra-nucleosomal bridging predicts that Sir3/Sir4CC has a higher binding affinity towards MonoN than Sir3 alone. In contrast, inter-nucleosomal bridging predicts (1) higher binding affinity of Sir3/Sir4CC towards DiN compared with Sir3 alone, because of the dimerizing Sir3wH domain and the interaction of Sir4CC with Sir3 AAAL domains, and (2) no change in the binding affinity of Sir3 towards MonoN upon the addition of Sir4CC.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17556.012</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Sir4CC does not affect Sir3 binding to MonoN, but increases its affinity towards DiN.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram of Sir4 primary sequence showing the location of the coiled-coil (CC) domain and the Sir2 interaction domain (aa747–893).

To achieve this, we devised a crosslinking assay in which the ability of a nucleosome immobilized on a solid resin to bind to a free nucleosome could be tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We assembled MonoN with 5’ biotinylated 601 DNA containing a 20 bp linker 5’ to the 601 sequence to allow sufficient space and flexibility of the nucleosome away from the solid support. The reconstituted biotinylated nucleosome was conjugated to streptavidin magnetic beads and incubated with Sir3 or Sir3ΔwH, either alone or in combination with Sir4CC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This was followed by incubation with Alexa-647-labeled MonoN. The beads and their associated proteins and nucleosomes were then recovered by magnetic concentration and washed prior to elution of nucleosomal DNA from the beads with 2 M NaCl. The resulting supernatant was analyzed by gel electrophoresis, and the amount of pulled down Alexa-647 nucleosomal DNA was quantified by the intensity of its fluorescent band.</p><p>The addition of Sir3 to immobilized nucleosomes promoted the recovery of free labeled nucleosomes and this recovery was not affected by the addition of Sir4CC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, lanes 4, 5, and 6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), even at lower Sir3 concentrations that still mediated substantial bridging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). In contrast, Sir3ΔwH, alone or in the presence of Sir4CC did not promote the recovery of free nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, lanes 7–9; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Western Blot analysis showed that similar amounts of proteins were loaded onto the resin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), ruling out the possibility that differences in bridging activity of different proteins were caused by unequal loading of proteins onto nucleosomes. Therefore, this result indicated that Sir3, through its wH domain, acts as a bridge linking mono-nucleosomes in solution. We note that the inability of Sir4CC to stimulate bridging, despite its effect in increasing the affinity of Sir3 and Sir3∆wH binding to DiN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,H</xref>), may suggest that Sir3-Sir4CC interactions are too weak to endure the stringent test of the pull-down assay. In this assay, the concentration of nucleosomes relative to each other is much lower (100 nM) than the effective local nucleosome concentration in the DiN EMSA. Furthermore, weak or highly dynamic complexes may partially disassemble during the wash steps of the assay. We suspect that while Sir4CC can readily link Sir3 bound to adjacent DNA-linked nucleosomes, the contact is not strong enough by itself to stably bring together separate Sir3-bound nucleosomes. A weak Sir4CC-Sir3 interaction in solution is consistent with most Sir3 not being associated with Sir4 in yeast extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Moazed et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rudner et al., 2005</xref>). In contrast, the wH-wH interactions can mediate relatively stable dimers in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Oppikofer et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>H4K16 acetylation and H3K79 trimethylation act together to inhibit Sir3 binding to nucleosomes</title><p>Both H4K16 and H3K79 play important roles in silencing in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Braunstein et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Johnson et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ng et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">van Leeuwen et al., 2002</xref>). Previous work showed that H4K16 acetylation (H4K16ac) and H3K79 methylation (H3K79me) each inhibits Sir3 binding to histone peptides and nucleosomes, but the difference in binding constants between unmodified and singly modified nucleosomes is rather modest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Johnson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Martino et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Swygert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). We quantified the effect of H4K16ac and H3K79me and, more importantly, the effect of co-existence of both modifications in the same nucleosome on Sir3 binding.

Sir3-Sir3 inter-nucleosomal interactions are mediated by wH dimerization domains and are further stabilized by Sir4. The inability of nucleosome binding domains in Sir3 dimers to interact with or bridge sites on the same nucleosome, or for Sir4 to bridge Sir3 molecules bound to the same nucleosome, lead us to propose that heterochromatin assembly occurs by interrupted Sir3 bridges across neighboring nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In contrast to oligomerization or sticky end-based models, in an interrupted or discontinuous spreading mechanism Sir-Sir contacts do not extend beyond two appropriately modified nucleosomes (unacetylated H4K16, unmethylated H3K79). We propose that nucleosome pairs bearing unmodified H3K79 and H4K16 residues form the fundamental unit of Sir chromatin binding. Furthermore, the requirement for two nucleosomes in cooperative binding of the complex suggests a new rate-limiting step in nucleation of silent chromatin that may contribute to specific silencer-guided assembly of silent chromatin.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17556.020</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Association of the SIR complex with chromatin by interrupted Sir3 bridges across neighboring nucleosomes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the SIR complex indicating the location of domains in Sir3 (brown) and Sir4 (blue) dimers, and highlighting the interaction of Sir4 with Sir2.

Sir3 dimers form inter-nucleosomal bridges via cooperative association with histone H4K16 and H3K79 regions on flat nucleosome surfaces. The Sir3 bridge requires the wH domain and is further stabilized via interactions between the coiled-coil domain of Sir4 and the AAAL domain of Sir3. Spreading does not involve interaction of newly recruited Sir3/Sir4 with already bound complexes but instead requires cooperative association with a pair of H4K16 deacetylated and H3K79 unmethylated nucleosome surfaces, and thus is driven primarily by Sir2-dependent deacetylation of proximal nucleosomes. The inability of Sir3 to simultaneously interact with binding sites on the same nucleosome, requires spreading via the formation of interrupted Sir3 bridges. Sir3 may interact with immediately neighboring nucleosomes (N1 and N2, N2 and N3, N3 and N4) or more distal nucleosome pairs lacking H4K16ac/H3K79me modifications (N4 and Nn).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17556.020">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17556.020</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-17556-fig7-v2"/></fig></p><sec id="s3-1"><title>An interrupted mechanism of heterochromatin spreading without sticky ends or oligomerization</title><p>The interrupted spreading mechanism described here is distinct from previously proposed oligomerization-based models.

This 'sticky ends' mode of binding would result in the formation of continuous Swi6-Swi6 interactions across silent chromatin domains. However, oligomerization beyond stable dimers proved to be weak, even in very high (20 µM or higher) Swi6/HP1 concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Canzio et al., 2011</xref>), and absent in mouse HP1β, even at 30 µM concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Muller-Ott et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, oligomerization may not contribute to the in vivo mechanism of action of HP1 proteins. In fact, subsequent re-analysis of the Swi6/HP1 binding isotherms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Canzio et al., 2011</xref>) revealed that a simpler model, lacking direct interactions among neighboring Swi6/HP1 dimers that were suggested in the original study, could explain the observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Teif et al., 2015</xref>).

In contrast, the discontinuous mode of binding revealed here suggests that recruitment of new SIR complexes does not rely on contacts between newly recruited and already bound complexes, but instead requires association of Sir3 with a pair of nucleosomes unmodified at H4K16 and H3K79. We note that Sir3 protein, at sub-micromolar concentrations and in buffers containing physiological salt concentrations, is found largely as a monomers and dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">McBryant et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Swygert et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, the ability of Sir3 to form higher order oligomers in low salt and at high concentrations may not play a role in its cellular function.

The cooperative mechanism of Sir3 binding to unmodified DiN units strongly biases Sir3 binding away from association with randomly occurring deacetylated nucleosomes that may arise throughout the genome. Independent measurements have reported a wide range of Sir3 and Sir4 molecules per cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gerber et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kulak et al., 2014</xref>). Since Sir3 is primarily concentrated inside the nucleus (volume ~2.8 µm<sup>3</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jorgensen et al., 2007</xref>), Sir3 intranuclear concentration may be roughly estimated at 0.4–0.8 µM. In this range of concentrations, unmodified nucleosome pairs are ~50–80 fold more likely to be bound by Sir3 than isolated single nucleosomes (see Materials and methods). This selectivity is in large part due to binding cooperativity: even if Sir3 bound to di-nucleosomes with 10-fold higher affinity than to mono-nucleosomes, in the absence of cooperativity, di-nucleosomes would be favored over isolated nucleosomes by only ~12 fold. Therefore, cooperative association of reader proteins with nucleosome pairs may endow heterochromatin domains with robustness against random noise.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and plasmids construction</title><p><italic>S. cerevisae</italic> strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>.

A minor degradation product co-purified with Sir4CC (1198–1358).

Samples were then run on native polyacrylamide gels, stained with SYBR Gold (Invitrogen), visualized on a Typhoon FLA7000 imager (GE Healthcare), and quantified using ImageQuant software. Sir3 binding to nucleosomes was quantified by the decrease in the intensity of the unbound nucleosome band. The apparent K<sub>D</sub> (protein concentration at transition midpoint) and Hill coefficient for each binding reaction was calculated by fitting the binding curves with the Hill Equation (see Analysis of binding cooperativity section below) using MATLAB (Mathematica).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Biolayer interferometry (BLI) assay</title><p>BLI sensors were pre-incubated in loading buffer (20 mM Tris.HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mg/ml BSA, 0.02% Tween-20) before incubation with 10 nM biotinylated MonoN or DiN in the same buffer for 5–10 min. To eliminate artifacts due to surface crowding and ligand walking, nucleosome binding to sensors were first optimized to determine conditions where sensors were loaded at &lt;25% capacity and binding behavior was insensitive to nucleosome density on sensor. All sensors for each titration experiment were loaded with the same number of nucleosomes (± 5%, as monitored by BLI loading signal). Binding experiments were performed using Octet RED384 system (Pall Life Sciences) at 30˚C in the same buffer used for loading nucleosomes, except that the NaCl concentration was reduced to 50 mM. To determine the effect of nonspecific protein-sensor interactions, we measured binding signal of empty sensors in various concentrations of Sir3 as well as nucleosome-loaded sensors in buffer solution without Sir3. Nonspecific Sir3-sensor interactions gave rise to linearly rising baselines, which were subsequently subtracted from the signal using a linear extrapolation procedure. Measurements were repeated with Sir3 protein from at least two independent purifications (using FLAG or TAP tags) and two separate reconstitutions of nucleosomes templates. For larger nucleosome arrays, two biotinylation densities (all or 33% of histone octamers biotinylated) were tested in the reconstitution of nucleosome arrays to ensure that sensor immobilization does not interfere with Sir3 binding. Addition of 0.5 µM competitor DNA (salmon sperm genomic DNA physically sheared to average 150–200 bp length) did not affect Sir3 binding to nucleosomes. Therefore, average binding profiles shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–H</xref> include experiments performed with and without competitor DNA. Furthermore, the presence of 20 bp extra linker DNA on MonoN did not affect binding of Sir3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Consistent with the above observations, loading of at least 10-fold higher free DNA on biosensors was necessary to obtain measurable signal changes as a result of Sir3 binding to free DNA. We therefore concluded that, the weak affinity of Sir3 for nonspecific binding to free DNA does not contribute to our nucleosome binding assays.</p><p>Association and dissociation rates and amplitudes were calculated by nonlinear least-square fitting of data with mono- or bi-exponential saturation models (see Measurement of Sir3 binding kinetics with BLI section below). The amplitudes were normalized and plotted versus protein concentration to reconstruct titration curves which were fit with the Hill equation, or when possible, with a model describing binding to identical independent sites (see Analysis of binding cooperativity section below).

Since Sir3 can engage multiple sites on nucleosomes through its BAH or AAAL domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hecht et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Martino et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Onishi et al., 2007</xref>), the two binding phases may represent different modes of Sir3-nucleosome interactions. Consistent with this hypothesis, the Sir3BAH domain alone bound to and dissociated from mono-nucleosomes with a single rate that was comparable to the fast rate of Sir3 binding and dissociation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4F,G</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). More importantly, the apparent affinity of Sir3BAH for MonoN (apparent K<sub>D</sub> = 1.4 ± 0.1 µM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) closely resembled that of the fast forming fraction of the Sir3-MonoN complex (K<sub>D</sub> = 1.4 ± 0.1 µM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), while the slow-forming fraction showed a considerably lower affinity (apparent K<sub>D</sub> &gt; 4 µM). Deletion of both AAAL and wH domains, but not the wH domain alone, caused a strong (&gt;3 fold) decrease in Sir3-MonoN complex half-life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>), confirming either a direct or synergistic contribution of AAAL domain to the interaction of Sir3 with mono-nucleosomes.</p><p>Therefore, thermodynamic, kinetic, and domain deletion experiments reveal that in addition to the BAH-mediated binding, Sir3 can engage mono-nucleosomes in other modes, most likely through the AAAL domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ehrentraut et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hecht et al., 1995</xref>), which are precluded in binding to larger nucleosome arrays ([Sir3] &lt;0.5 µM). Therefore, we compared binding of Sir3 to larger nucleosome templates with its fast phase of binding to MonoN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Non-covalent nucleosome crosslinking assays</title><p>Nucleosomes assembled with biotinylated DNA were conjugated to Dynabeads M-280 streptavidin (Invitrogen) at RT for 1 hr with rotation, using 36 μl of beads slurry per μg of nucleosomes in the binding buffer (20 mM Tris.HCl (pH 7.5), 0.3 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mM DTT, 1 mg/ml BSA, and 0.02% NP–40). Bead-conjugated nucleosomes were washed, and resuspended in equal volume of binding buffer as the initial volume of beads taken. Equal amount of conjugated nucleosomes, in a final concentration of 100 nM, was added to tubes containing Sir3, Sir3/Sir4CC, Sir3ΔwH, Sir3ΔwH/Sir4CC, Sir4CC, or buffer alone, and incubated with rotation at 4°C for 1 hr. The concentration of Sir3 proteins was 2 μM in the case of high protein concentration binding assay, and 200 nM in the case of low protein concentration binding assay. Sir4CC was in 2X molar excess of Sir3 proteins. Subsequently, Alexa-647 labeled nucleosomes were added into each reaction at a final concentration of 100 nM, and reactions were incubated for another 1 hr at 4°C. Finally, the beads were washed twice in the binding buffer before magnetic concentration. Alexa-647 nucleosomal DNA from the crosslinked nucleosomes was stripped from the beads with 2M NaCl, separated on native polyacrylamide gels, and quantified by the fluorescent intensity of the band.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>ChIP-seq</title><p>Cells were cultured overnight in YEPD medium, or selective media for cells harboring overexpression plasmids (YEp24 2 µ plasmid with Sir3 or Sir3△wH expressed from Sir3 endogenous promoter), diluted into fresh media to OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.4, and harvested at late log phase (OD<sub>600</sub> = 1.5). Cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature (RT), then quenched with 130 mM glycine for 5 min at RT, harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with TBS (50 mM Tris.HCl pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl), and flash frozen. Cell pellets were resuspended in 600 µl lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Na-Deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM PMSF, protease inhibitor tablet (Roche)), and disrupted by bead beating (MagNA Lyser, Roche) for 6 × 30 s at 4500 rpm with 0.5 mm glass beads.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Jessica Tyler (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Asifa Akhtar (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The three reviewers appreciated that the study provides a thorough biochemical and biophysical characterization of the Sir proteins to defined nucleosomal substrates. In particular, the work provides novel insight into the preferred chromatin binding substrate of yeast SIR proteins which is shown to be dinucleosomes that are bound in a 'bridging' mode and that high affinity binding requires that these nucleosomes lack both H4K16ac and H3K79me3.</p><p>Overall, the reviewers consider that this manuscript would be appropriate for publication after a round of revision. Reviewers have made a number of suggestions that we would like you to address before the manuscript can be further considered.</p><p>The authors claim, that the effects they nicely characterize in vitro are linked to a discontinuous spreading mode in vivo. The discontinuous model implies, that spreading does not rely on oligomerization, which has been proposed for many chromatin effectors. However, the only in vivo evidence presented is the ChIP-seq experiments, which is not a direct proof for the discontinuous model. Would it be possible to use another experiment as an alternative to analyze the dynamics/cooperativity of binding in vivo? Is Sir3 as dynamic as it was suggested for HP1? (Cheutin et al., Stunnenberg et al., Kilic et al.).</p><p>The authors show that dimerization of Sir3 via the winged helix (which was demonstrated earlier by the Gasser group) is necessary for this bridging. However, the effect of enhancement by the Sir4 CC is not very pronounced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). It appears that the authors ignore throughout the paper that there is a second nucleosome-binding module in Sir3 besides the BAH-domain, namely the AAA domain. How does this affect models of Sir3 binding to mono-nuc or di-nucs? Please explain and discuss the appropriate literature.</p><p>Other comments:</p><p>Given the experiments performed in the manuscript with the different Sir domains (e.g. BAH domain), it would be important to explain the relevance of this domain for nucleosome binding in the Introduction / text.

(Cheutin et al., Stunnenberg et al., Kilic et al.).</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that additional tests are required to test whether the proposed mechanism of spreading in vitro reflects in vivo heterochromatin spreading. We modified the text to indicate this point (subsection “An interrupted mechanism of heterochromatin spreading without sticky ends or oligomerization” Discussion). However, at the present time, we are unaware of any experimental method that can directly probe the molecular mechanism of spreading with the resolution necessary to differentiate oligomerization and interrupted spreading models in vivo. While it is interesting to measure the in vivo dynamics of Sir3 binding to chromatin as suggested by the reviewer, such measurements cannot prove or refute any of the spreading models discussed in the literature. For example, in vivo binding dynamics of HP1 measured by Cheutin et al., Stunnenberg et al., and Kilic et al. is <italic>not</italic> incompatible with either of the models proposed by Canzio et al. (2011) or Kilic et al. (2015). The latter work disfavors oligomerization model as a result of in vitro single molecule measurements. Hence, we believe such measurements lie outside of the scope of this work.</p><p>We note that the discontinuous assembly model, particularly in combination with in vivo Sir3 measurements, is consistent with non-uniform ChIP-seq profiles at heterochromatic mating type loci (Thurtle and Rine, 2014), whereas oligomerization (at least in the strict sense of the word) predicts a uniform Sir3 distribution across the locus. (subsection “An interrupted mechanism of heterochromatin spreading without sticky ends or oligomerization”, Discussion).</p><p><italic>The authors show that dimerization of Sir3 via the winged helix (which was demonstrated earlier by the Gasser group) is necessary for this bridging. However, the effect of enhancement by the Sir4 CC is not very pronounced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). It appears that the authors ignore throughout the paper that there is a second nucleosome-binding module in Sir3 besides the BAH-domain, namely the AAA domain. How does this affect models of Sir3 binding to mono-nuc or di-nucs? Please explain and discuss the appropriate literature.</italic> </p><p>We acknowledge that the function of AAAL domain has been insufficiently discussed in the main text and thank the reviewers for pointing it out. We now discuss this topic on several occasions in the manuscript. In summary, we cite the previous work showing AAAL interacts with chromatin, but point out our previous measurements showing that this interaction has a much lower affinity than BAH-nucleosome interaction (Introduction). In light of the data presented in this manuscript, we argue that AAAL domain has a clear (synergistic or additive) role in stabilizing the binding of Sir3 to nucleosome, but does not directly affect binding cooperativity to di-nucleosomes (Results).</p><p><italic>Other comments:</italic> </p><p><italic>Given the experiments performed in the manuscript with the different Sir domains (e.g. BAH domain), it would be important to explain the relevance of this domain for nucleosome binding in the Introduction / text. Also it would be helpful for the non-expert reader to provide a scheme with the Sir3 domains.</italic> </p><p>We have described the relative contribution of each Sir3 domain to histone and nucleosomes more fully in the Introduction (fourth paragraph) and have referred the reader to the schematic diagram of the domains in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>.</p><p><italic>In some of the Figures concentrations are shown in μm and nM respectively.

Briefly, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref> shows indistinguishable binding to nucleosomes with and without 20bp extra linker. Furthermore, in our initial BLI measurements of Sir3 binding to mono and di-nucleosomes, 0.5µM competitor DNA (salmon sperm genomic DNA sheared to average 150-200 bp length) was added to minimize nonspecific binding potential to sensors, but was omitted later as it proved to be unnecessary. Average binding profiles shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G-H</xref> include experiments performed with and without competitor DNA, as they did not show any difference.</p><p>We also attempted to measure the affinity of Sir3 for binding to long DNA templates in the absence of nucleosomes. However, about 50 fold higher free DNA than what was present in nucleosome binding assays was needed to obtain measurable binding signal with BLI assays. We therefore concluded that binding to free DNA does not contribute to binding signal measured in our assays, which is fully consistent with previous observations by Swygert et al. (2015).</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D</xref> – Please show the raw data (kinetics) of Sir3 binding to H4K16ac nucleosomes (BLI-data)</italic> </p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D</xref> is updated to show the raw binding data that was used in making the histogram.</p><p><italic>The differences presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> seem very minimal / small. As these minimal differences are important for the biological relevance of claims made in the paper, it is required to substantiate them with ChIP-qPCR experiments. Is the ChIP-seq profile an average of several replicates?</italic> </p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we have updated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> to show ChIP-qPCR data for strains overexpressing Sir3. We have also modified the text (Results) and the layout of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> to remove a possible point of confusion regarding the conclusions of this section.</p><p>We completely agree with the reviewers that our ChIP-seq results are not sensitive enough to detect potential differences between single and double mutant strains, when Sir3 is expressed at its normal level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The conclusion regarding the distinct effects of Sir3∆wH and Sir4I1311N mutations are drawn from strains overexpressing Sir3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In these strains, the spreading defects caused by each single mutation are very strong as they drastically limit the range and level of Sir3-bound domains around telomeric nucleation sites. In the double mutant, heterochromatin is completely defective for spreading, which is distinguishable from the single mutants.</p><p><italic>How does the fact that Sir3 oligomerizes</italic> in vitro <italic>affect the interpretation of the binding data?</italic> </p><p>As discussed (Discussion), there is very little or no Sir3 oligomerization in the conditions used in our assays. Our observations are consistent with recent SV-AUC measurements by Swygert et al. (2015) that used very similar assay conditions. Sir3 oligomerization in some of earlier studies appears to be due to the very low salt concentrations used in reaction buffers. We have not explored the effect of Sir3 oligomerization in mid to high μM concentrations as nucleosome binding and in vivo Sir3 concentration measurements fall well short of such concentrations.</p><p><italic>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C-F</xref>, were the curves for Sir3 binding to unmodified nucs drawn from a single data point?</italic> </p><p>We clarified the figure legends to remove the confusion. To keep the panel visually simple, the binding curves for unmodified nucleosomes show only the model fitted to the data. The data points and the model are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>.</p><p><italic>The whole paper uses Sir3 purified from yeast for the binding assays. How can we be sure that no other co-purifying factors are affecting the assay (despite the gel shown in the supplement, which shows some low molecular weight bands)? How about modifications on Sir3?</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for highlighting this aspect. We revised Results and Methods section to review relevant literature and add further details about Sir3 purification. Briefly, we used Sir3 purified from yeast because N-terminal acetylation of Sir3 (which is absent in bacterial expression) is necessary for efficient binding of the BAH domain to nucleosomes. We now point out that different affinity purifications (through TAP or FLAG tags) combined with a variety of FPLC steps (gel filtration in 150 mM or 500 mM NaCl, with or without 250 mM guanidine hydrochloride, ion exchange chromatography) all resulted in Sir3 with identical binding profiles to mono and di-nucleosomes. These results, in addition to the strong difference in band densities on protein gels, render the effect of any additional protein factors very unlikely.</p><p>We also note that the majority of smaller protein bands on the gel correspond to Sir3 degradation products (unpublished results and McBryant et al. (2006)).</p><p><italic>In the last sentence, it would be helpful if the authors could spell out what they mean with &quot;properly modified nucleosomes&quot; and &quot;appropriately modified nucleosomes&quot;. i.e. the authors should spell out that &quot;properly modified nucleosomes&quot; means nucleosomes lacking H4K16ac and H3K79me3.</italic> </p><p>Revised text as indicated (Abstract; Introduction; Discussion; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> legend).</p></body></sub-article></article>
