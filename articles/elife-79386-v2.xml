the cohesin ring. Here, we provide functional data to support the notion that the SA subunit is not a mere passenger in this structure, but instead plays a key role in the localization of cohesin to diverse biological processes and promotes loading of the complex at these sites. We show that in cells acutely depleted for RAD21, SA proteins remain bound to chromatin, cluster in 3D and interact with CTCF, as well as with a wide range of RNA binding proteins involved in multiple RNA processing mechanisms. Accordingly, SA proteins interact with RNA, and R-loops, even in the absence of cohesin. Our results place SA1 on chromatin upstream of the cohesin ring and reveal a role for SA1 in cohesin loading which is independent of NIPBL, the canonical cohesin loader. We propose that SA1 takes advantage of structural R-loop platforms to link cohesin loading and chromatin structure with diverse functions. Since SA proteins are pan-cancer targets, and R-loops play an increasingly prevalent role in cancer biology, our results have important implications for the mechanistic understanding of SA proteins in cancer and disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>STAG proteins</kwd><kwd>RNA binding proteins</kwd><kwd>R-loops</kwd><kwd>cohesin loading</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>106985/Z/15/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hadjur</surname><given-names>Suzana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD studentship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Porter</surname><given-names>Hayley</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

Accordingly, mutations of cohesin subunits lead to changes in cellular identity, both during development and in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Leiserson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Horsfield et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Viny and Levine, 2018</xref>). A prevailing model is that cohesin contributes to cell identity changes in large part by dynamically regulating 3D genome organization and mediating communication between distal regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hadjur et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sofueva et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zuin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kojic et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wutz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fudenberg et al., 2018</xref>). However, molecular insight into how and when cohesin subunits become associated with chromatin and contribute to this function in vivo in human cells is still lacking.</p><p>Most studies of cohesin function consider the Stromalin Antigen (STAG/SA) proteins as core complex members given their ubiquitous interaction with the tripartite cohesin ring (composed of SMC1, SMC3, and SCC1/RAD21). Rarely is the SA subunit considered for its roles independent of the cohesin ring, even though it is the subunit most commonly mutated across a wide spectrum of cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Leiserson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Balbás-Martínez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Solomon et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>SA proteins contribute to cohesin’s association with DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Murayama and Uhlmann, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Orgil et al., 2015</xref>). The yeast SA orthologue is critical for efficient association of cohesin with DNA and its ATPase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Murayama and Uhlmann, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Orgil et al., 2015</xref>). Separating interactions into SA-loader and cohesin ring-loader sub-complexes still impairs cohesin loading, indicating that SA functions as more than just a bridge protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Orgil et al., 2015</xref>). Crystallization studies reveal a striking similarity of SA with NIPBL [the canonical cohesin loader (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ciosk et al., 2000</xref>)], in that both are highly bent, HEAT-repeat containing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kikuchi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hara et al., 2014</xref>). Of note, NIPBL and SA interact together and wrap around both the cohesin ring and DNA to position and entrap DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Higashi et al., 2020</xref>), implying a potential role for SA in the initial recruitment of cohesin to DNA alongside NIPBL. Further, SA proteins bridge the interaction between cohesin and CTCF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xiao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Saldaña-Meyer et al., 2014</xref>), and also bridge interactions with specific nucleic acid structures in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bisht et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lin et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Mammalian cells express multiple SA paralogs. SA1 binds to AT-rich telomeric sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bisht et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lin et al., 2016</xref>) and SA2 displays sequence-independent affinity for particular DNA structures commonly found at sites of repair, recombination, and replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Countryman et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with this, results in yeast implicate non-canonical DNA structures in cohesin loading in S-phase. In vitro experiments show that cohesin captures the second strand of DNA via a single-strand intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Murayama et al., 2018</xref>), and chromatid cohesion is impaired by de-stabilization of single-strand DNA intermediates during replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>). Together, these suggest that SA proteins and DNA structures may play a regulatory role in guiding or stabilizing cohesin localizations.</p><p>During transcription, the elongating nascent RNA can hybridize to the template strand of the DNA and form an R-loop, which is an intermediate RNA:DNA hybrid conformation with a displaced single strand of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">García-Muse and Aguilera, 2019</xref>). A multitude of processes have been linked to R-loop stability and metabolism. For example, co-transcriptional RNA processing, splicing, and messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) assembly counteract R-loop formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crossley et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li and Manley, 2005</xref>). R-loop structures have also been shown to regulate transcription of mRNA by recruitment of transcription factors, displacement of nucleosomes, and preservation of open chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boque-Sastre et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Powell et al., 2013</xref>). Hence, like at the replication fork, sites of active transcription accumulate non-canonical nucleic acid structures.</p><p>We set out to investigate the nature of SA proteins and cohesin loading to DNA. We discovered independent functions of the SA proteins, providing critical insight into the importance they play in their own right to direct cohesin’s localization and loading to chromatin. In cells acutely depleted of RAD21, SA proteins remain associated with chromatin and CTCF where they are enriched at chromatin sites clustered in 3D. Moreover, we identify numerous, diverse cohesin-independent SA1 interactors involved in RNA processing, ribosome biogenesis, and translation. Consistent with this, SA1 and SA2 interact with RNA and non-canonical nucleic acid structures in the form of R-loops. Importantly, SA proteins are required for loading of cohesin to chromatin in cells deficient for NIPBL. Our results highlight a central role for SA proteins in cohesin biology and the cohesin-independent interaction of SA proteins with RNA processing factors opens up a new understanding of how SA dysregulation can impact disease development that moves us beyond the control of chromatin topology for gene expression regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SA interacts with CTCF on chromatin in the absence of the cohesin trimer</title><p>To determine how CTCF and cohesin assemble on chromatin, we used previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Natsume et al., 2016</xref>) human HCT116 cells engineered to carry a miniAID tag (mAID) fused to monomeric Clover (mClover) at the endogenous RAD21 locus and <italic>OsTIR1</italic> under the control of CMV (herein RAD21<sup>mAC</sup>). RAD21<sup>mAC</sup> cells were cultured in control EtOH conditions (EtOH) or in the presence of auxin (IAA) to induce rapid RAD21 degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a, b</xref>). Immunofluorescence (IF) was used to monitor the levels of mClover, SA1, SA2, and CTCF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a and b</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>). As reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Natsume et al., 2016</xref>, acute IAA treatment dramatically reduced mClover levels compared to control cells (mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) reduction of 82%, p=2.9E-239). SA proteins and CTCF were also all significantly reduced, however the extent of the change was notably different. We observed a small but significant reduction in CTCF signal upon IAA treatment (mean reduction of 16%, p=1.6E-27). This was similar to the mean SA1 signal which was reduced by 22% compared to EtOH control (p=3.5E-21). However, SA2 levels mirrored more closely the effect on mClover, being reduced by 63% (p=1.9E-186), but not completely lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). The retention of SA proteins despite the degradation of RAD21 was surprising given the fact that they are considered to be part of a stable biochemical complex.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>SA interacts with CTCF in the absence of cohesin.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Representative confocal images of SA1 and CTCF IF in RAD21<sup>mAC</sup> cells treated with ethanol (EtOH) as a control or Auxin (IAA) for 4 hr.

We prepared chromatin extracts from RAD21<sup>mAC</sup> cells treated with EtOH or IAA and performed chromatin co-immunoprecipitation (coIP) to probe the interactions between SA proteins, RAD21 and CTCF. Both SA1 and SA2 interacted with RAD21 and CTCF in control cells as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Parelho et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wendt et al., 2008</xref>), with notable differences in their preferred interactions whereby SA2 more strongly enriched RAD21 while the SA1-CTCF interaction was significantly stronger than SA2-CTCF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), in line with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wutz et al., 2020</xref>). Upon RAD21 degradation, we again observed a stronger effect on chromatin-bound SA2 levels compared to SA1, suggesting that SA2 is more sensitive to cohesin loss than SA1. Residual SA proteins retained their ability to interact with CTCF in the absence of RAD21 and additionally, the interaction between SA1 and CTCF was further enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Reciprocal coIPs with CTCF confirmed the CTCF-SA interactions in RAD21-depleted cells, including the differences between SA1 and SA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). We validated these results in a second cell line and using siRNA-mediated knockdown (KD) of SMC3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>). We also confirmed that approximately 20% of SA1 and SA2 were bound to chromatin without RAD21 even in unperturbed RAD21<sup>mAC</sup> HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>), reminiscent of reports of that SA1 can be independent of cohesin at telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bisht et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Next, we performed two-color Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM) to assess the nuclear distribution and co-localization of SA1, SA2 and CTCF with nanometric resolution in control and RAD21-degraded cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1e</xref>).

SA1 and CTCF exhibited higher densities compared to SA2, with shorter distances between clusters (mean NND of 68.9, 65.3, and 78.9 nm for CTCF, SA1 and SA2, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f and g</xref>). Furthermore, we analyzed the relative distribution of SA clusters to CTCF clusters by assessing the NND distribution between SA1 and CTCF, and SA2 and CTCF. Both SA1 and SA2 exhibited significant co-localization with CTCF at short distances in RAD21<sup>mAC</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1f, g</xref>).</p><p>Upon IAA treatment, we observed a decreased density of detected SA1, SA2, and CTCF in two analyzed clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e and f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1e</xref>), suggesting that RAD21 degradation affects the stability of SA proteins and CTCF. As observed by conventional confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), SA2 localizations were more affected than SA1 (mean density reduction in SA1, 32% and SA2, 42% compared to EtOH controls). Accordingly, SA1, SA2, and CTCF clusters were more sparsely distributed across the nucleus upon RAD21 degradation (mean NND 81.1, 109.7 and 117.5 nm, respectively) with SA2 significantly more affected than SA1 (mean NND increase 24.3%, 39% respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>).

Together, our results confirm the maintained interaction and spatial co-localization patterns of SA proteins with CTCF and reveal a difference in SA paralog stability in the absence of the core cohesin trimer.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Cohesin-independent SA proteins are localized at clustered regions in 3D</title><p>Previous analyses of the contribution of SA proteins to genome organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kojic et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wutz et al., 2017</xref>) were performed in cells containing cohesin rings, possibly obscuring a functional role for SA proteins themselves in genome organization. To determine if cohesin-independent SA proteins may function at unique locations in the genome, we investigated whether the residual SA-CTCF complexes (herein, SA-CTCF<sup>ΔCoh)</sup> in IAA-treated RAD21<sup>mAC</sup> cells occupied the same chromatin locations as in control cells. Using chromatin immunopreciptation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq), we determined the binding profiles of CTCF, SA1, SA2, RAD21 and SMC3 in RAD21<sup>mAC</sup> cells treated with EtOH or IAA. Pairwise comparisons of CTCF ChIP-seq with RAD21 or SA in control RAD21<sup>mAC</sup> cells revealed the expected overlap in binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1h</xref>). In contrast, both global and CTCF-overlapping RAD21 and SMC3 ChIP-seq signals were dramatically lost in IAA-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1h</xref>). In agreement with our microscopy and biochemistry results, we detected residual SA1 and SA2 binding sites in IAA-treated cells which retained a substantial overlap with CTCF. Furthermore, the sites co-occupied by CTCF and SA proteins in RAD21-depleted cells were also bound in control conditions, were enriched at TSSs and were characterized by active chromatin marks including phospho-S5 POLR2A, H3K4me3, and H3K27ac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1i</xref>). Thus, CTCF and SA maintain occupancy at their canonical binding sites in the absence of RAD21, suggesting that SA interaction with CTCF in the absence of the cohesin ring is a step in normal cohesin activity.</p><p>While depletion of cohesin results in a dramatic loss of Topologically Associated Domain (TAD) structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rao et al., 2017</xref>), the frequency of long-range inter-TAD, intra-compartment contacts (LRC) is increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sofueva et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rao et al., 2017</xref>), and enriched for CTCF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sofueva et al., 2013</xref>) or active elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rao et al., 2017</xref>). To determine whether residual, chromatin-bound SA could be associated with LRCs in the absence of RAD21, we re-analysed Hi-C data from control and IAA-treated RAD21<sup>mAC</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rao et al., 2017</xref>). We quantified all contacts within two different scales of genome organization; local TAD topology (100 k-1Mb) and clustered LRCs (1–5 Mb) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j</xref>). As previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rao et al., 2017</xref>), local TAD contacts are lost and clustered LRCs are enriched in IAA conditions. We probed the Hi-C datasets for contacts containing the residual SA-CTCF<sup>Δcoh</sup> binding sites and observed a further enrichment in IAA conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j</xref>, bottom right), indicating that SA-CTCF<sup>Δcoh</sup> are enriched at the clustered LRCs formed when cells are depleted of cohesin and thus implicating them in 3D structural configurations. Our results suggest that cohesin-independent SA, either with CTCF or alone, may itself contribute to higher order arrangement of active chromatin and regulatory features in 3D space.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>SA interacts with diverse ‘CES-binding proteins’ in cohesin-depleted cells</title><p>SA proteins contain a highly conserved domain known as the ‘stromalin conservative domain’ (SCD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Orgil et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Roig et al., 2014</xref>), or the ‘conserved essential surface’ (CES). Structural analysis of CTCF-SA2-RAD21 has shown that a F/YXF motif in the N-terminus of CTCF engages with a composite binding surface containing amino acids from RAD21 and the CES of SA2, forming a tripartite interaction patch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2018</xref>). Further, the authors identified a similar F/YXF motif in other cohesin regulatory proteins, predicting interactions between the SA-RAD21 binding surface and additional chromatin proteins. To investigate whether SA proteins could associate with F/YXF-motif containing proteins beyond CTCF in the absence of RAD21 in vivo, we performed chromatin coIP with SA1 and SA2 in EtOH and IAA and probed for interaction with CTCF as before, and three additional F/YXF-motif containing proteins, CHD6, MCM3 and HNRNPUL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a, b</xref>). All the proteins interacted with SA1 in RAD21-control cells and their interaction with SA1 was enriched upon RAD21-degradation, indicating that the association was not dependent on the amino acids contributed by RAD21. Interestingly, despite SA2 also containing the conserved CES domain, the F/YXF-motif proteins showed little interaction with SA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>), pointing to the presence of additional features in SA1 that stabilize its interaction with F/YXF containing proteins in vivo. Together, our results confirm that SA, in particular SA1, can interact with proteins beyond just CTCF and reveal that RAD21 is not required for the interaction between SA and F/YXF proteins in vivo. These results prompted us to re-evaluate the role of SA in cohesin activity and consider possible novel functions for these proteins.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Characterization of SA1 protein-protein interaction network in RAD21-depleted cells.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Chromatin coIP of SA1, SA2, and IgG with four predicted CES-binding proteins in RAD21<sup>mAC</sup> cells treated with EtOH or IAA for 4 hr.

Three biological replicates were prepared from RAD21<sup>mAC</sup> cells that were either untreated (UT) or treated with IAA and processed for IP with both SA1 and IgG antibodies. In parallel, RAD21<sup>mAC</sup> cells were also treated with scrambled siRNAs or with siRNA to SA1 to confirm the specificity of putative interactors. Immunoprecipitated proteins were identified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). SA1 peptides were robustly detected in all UT and siCON samples and never detected in IgG controls, validating the specificity of the antibody. We used a pairwise analysis of IAA vs UT SA1 samples to generate a fold-change value for each putative interactor. These candidates were changed by at least 1.5-fold compared to UT controls, and sensitive to siSA1, yielding 136 high-confidence interactors whose abundance was significantly altered with RAD21 loss (SA1<sup>ΔCoh</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). As expected, core cohesin subunits SMC1A and SMC3 were strongly depleted while no peptides were detected for RAD21. SA1 itself was significantly depleted compared to control cells, as were other cohesin regulators, known to directly interact with SA1, such as PDS5B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hons et al., 2016</xref>). In line with the enrichment we observed for the CES-binding proteins in IAA-conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2a</xref>), the vast majority of the SA1<sup>ΔCoh</sup> interactors were enriched for binding with SA1 in IAA conditions (117 of 136), and represent cohesin-independent SA1<sup>ΔCoh</sup> interactors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>).</p><p>We used STRING to analyse associations in the SA1<sup>ΔCoh</sup> interactome and to identify enriched biological processes and molecular functions. We calculated enrichment relative to either the whole genome or to the SA1 interactome, which was determined in parallel from control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>), revealing similar enrichment terms to previously published cohesin interactomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Panigrahi et al., 2012</xref>), and validating our approach. Compared to the whole genome background, processes enriched in the presence of cohesin were still enriched in the SA1<sup>ΔCoh</sup> PPI network and include a variety of functionally diverse cellular processes such as chromosome organization, transcription, RNA processing, ribosome biogenesis, and translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c and d</xref>). Within this group, there are chromatin remodeling proteins (INO80 and SMARCAL1) and several transcriptional and epigenetic regulators such as JARID2 and TAF15. Similar to our ChIP and coIP results, this suggests that SA1 maintains interaction with proteins that localize with it in the presence of cohesin, albeit at different abundances.</p><p>RNA processing was the most enriched category in the SA1<sup>ΔCoh</sup> PPI network (FDR = 3.62 × 10<sup>–39</sup>) and included proteins involved in RNA modification (YTHDC1, ADAR1, FTSJ3), mRNA stabilization and export (SYNCRIP, FMR1), and RNA splicing regulators (SRSF1, SON) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). We also found a significant enrichment for DNA and RNA helicases (FDR = 3.54 × 10<sup>–08</sup>) as well as RNA binding proteins (FDR = 9.11 × 10<sup>–11</sup>) within which were many HNRNP family members (HNRNPU, aka SAF-A). We also found a highly significant enrichment of proteins associated with ribosome biogenesis (FDR = 2.20 × 10<sup>–30</sup>) including both large and small subunit components; rRNA processing factors and components of the snoRNA pathway (FDR = 4.39 × 10<sup>–05</sup>). Finally, translation was significantly enriched as a biological process (p=1.64 × 10<sup>–06</sup>), with several cytoplasmic translation regulators identified as SA1<sup>ΔCoh</sup> interactors (DHX29, GCN1L1). Among these is ESYT2 which is primarily found in the cytoplasm and contains a F/YXF-motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1d, e</xref>). We validated eight of the highest-ranking proteins within the enriched functional categories described above in EtOH and IAA-treated RAD21<sup>mAC</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Importantly, the enrichment of these proteins with SA1 in the IAA condition suggests that SA may have a role in these processes independently of the core cohesin complex.</p><p>Comparison of the SA1<sup>ΔCoh</sup> interactome with the SA1 interactome revealed that the proteins involved in RNA processing (FDR = 0.0298), ribosome biogenesis (0.0197), ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis (0.0298) and rRNA processing (0.0409) were enriched with SA1 following IAA treatment compared to SA1 in the presence of RAD21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, dotted lines). Overall, our results show that SA1<sup>ΔCoh</sup> PPIs contain not only transcriptional and epigenetic regulators, but are predominantly enriched for proteins with roles in RNA processing and modification, ribosome biogenesis and translation pathways. Thus, SA1 is involved in several biological processes and may facilitate an aspect of cohesin regulation at a variety of functionally distinct locations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>SA proteins bind RNA independently of cohesin</title><p>Since RNA binding and RNA processing were among the most enriched categories in the SA1<sup>ΔCoh</sup> PPI network, we hypothesized that SA proteins may also bind RNA. We performed SA-crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) in untreated RAD21<sup>mAC</sup> cells and found that both SA1 and SA2 directly bound RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a and b</xref>). This was evidenced by detection of RNPs of the expected molecular weights, with a smear of trimmed RNA, which was stronger in the +UV and+PNK conditions, increased as the RNaseI concentration was reduced, and which was lost after siRNA-mediated SA KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a–c</xref>). We repeated the experiment in EtOH- and IAA-treated RAD21<sup>mAC</sup> cells to determine if the SA subunits can bind RNA in the absence of cohesin.

As many of these processes were enriched in the SA1 interactome, we reasoned that the diversity of biological processes represented in the SA1<sup>ΔCoh</sup> PPI network may be reflective of a role for SA proteins in R-loop biology.</p><p>We performed a number of experiments to investigate the localization of SA proteins at endogenous R-loops. First, we found a correlation between global SA and R-loop levels. We depleted endogenous R-loops by overexpressing ppyCAG-RNaseH-V5 in HCT116 cells. IF using the R-loop specific antibody S9.6 revealed that nuclear S9.6 levels were significantly reduced in cells which expressed V5 (38% of controls, p=0.04) and that mean SA1 signal was significantly reduced by 29% in the same cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Furthermore, RAD21<sup>mAC</sup> cells treated with scramble control siRNAs or Smartpool (SP) siRNAs to AQR (a known suppressor of R-loops <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sollier et al., 2014</xref>), SA1 or SA2 revealed that S9.6 IF signal was significantly increased in siAQR and siSA1 but not siSA2 cells compared to the siScr control (mean S9.6 signal increased by 28%, p=0.0004; 32%, p=3.90E-8; reduced by 10%, p=0.17, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1f</xref>). Although S9.6 signal was reduced by IF in RAD21<sup>mAC</sup> cells treated with IAA, this did not represent a significant change using this method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1g</xref>).</p><p>We also performed STORM imaging on EtOH and IAA-treated RAD21<sup>mAC</sup> cells to assess the nuclear distribution of SA1 in the context of R-loops with and without RAD21. We measured the ratio of the SA1 signal inside and outside of the S9.6 signal mask. A ratio of 1 indicates a random distribution of SA1 with respect to S9.6 domains while a ratio above 1 reflects enrichment within S9.6 domains. In EtOH conditions, we did not detect enrichment of SA1 localizations, in fact SA1 was modestly depleted (mean ratio 0.93). However, upon IAA treatment, we observed a significant enrichment of SA1 localizations within S9.6 domains (mean ratio 1.24, p&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>), strongly suggesting that SA1 proteins are localized within R-loop domains independently of cohesin.</p><p>In addition, we returned to our IP-MS experiment to analyse enrichment of R-loop-associated proteins in our SA1<sup>ΔCoh</sup> interactome. We overlapped the proteins identified in two independent IP-MS experiments for R-loop interactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cristini et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2018</xref>) to create a high-confidence ‘R-loop interactome’ and then used a hypergeometric distribution to determine the significance of this category in the SA1<sup>ΔCoh</sup> interactome (Methods). Both the custom R-loop interactome (termed ‘overlap’) as well as proteins from the individual studies were highly over-enriched in the SA1<sup>ΔCoh</sup> interactome (FDR = 1.1 × 10<sup>–15</sup>, 1.4x10<sup>–47</sup>, 7.7x10<sup>–19</sup>, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>). To directly measure this, we optimized a coIP method using the S9.6 antibody in RAD21<sup>mAC</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1h</xref>). In agreement with published results, we found that S9.6 precipitated the known R-loop helicases AQR, DHX9, RNase H2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sollier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cristini et al., 2018</xref>) as well as MCM3 and RNA Pol II (POLR2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Skourti-Stathaki et al., 2014</xref>). Both SA1 and SA2 precipitated with S9.6 and treatment with RNase H (RNH) revealed the specificity of the S9.6-SA interactions since the reduction of R-loop signal was proportional to the observed reduction in coIP of SA1 by S9.6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1h, i</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we used a high-resolution, genome-wide method to detect R-loops in HCT116 cells. RAD21<sup>mAC</sup> cells were treated with RNH to confirm the specificity of our method and with EtOH or IAA to assess the impact of cohesin loss on R-loops and subjected to DNA-RNA Immunoprecipitation coupled with sequencing (DRIP-seq) using the S9.6 antibody. We combined these datasets with our ChIP-seq for SA proteins, RAD21 and CTCF in EtOH or IAA conditions to confirm the associations described above. We detected 50,338 RNH-sensitive R-loop sites which were also sensitive to acute degradation of RAD21, albeit not to the same extent as RNH treatment (average S9.6 signal was reduced by 31.4% in RNH and 16.8% in IAA compared to EtOH control; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3h and i</xref>). Among the RNH-sensitive R-loop sites, we detected two regimes of SA-R-loop biology. A small proportion of R-loop sites directly overlapped with SA1/2, RAD21 and CTCF in control EtOH conditions. These sites were enriched at genes and both the SA1 and SA2 read density was sensitive to RAD21 loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3h and i</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1j</xref>, k). On the other hand, a larger proportion of R-loops had SA signals adjacent (bound within 2 kb of the R-loop peak). Interestingly, these SA sites were enriched in repressed chromatin and were not sensitive to RAD21 loss, in fact their read density was enriched compared to EtOH controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3h and i</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1j, k</xref>), reminiscent of the enrichment observed previously by STORM imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>NIPBL-independent cohesin loading mediated by SA proteins</title><p>Our results thus far revealed that SA<sup>ΔCoh</sup> is localized to clustered regions, engages with RNA and various RBPs and is localized to R-loops.

As expected, in NIPBL KD conditions, mean RAD21 re-loading efficiency was reduced, although surprisingly, this was incomplete (58% of siCon; mean re-loading siNIPBL, 2.1 vs siCon, 3.6), and did not represent a statistically significant difference (p=0.33) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d and e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>).

Thus, we repeated the experiments to include siRNA to SA1 and SA2 together (siSA), and a siNIPBL +siSA condition. In both population and single cell analysis of reloading, SA KD had a more dramatic effect on cohesin re-loading efficiency than NIPBL KD, reducing RAD21 on chromatin to 37% of siCon (mean siSA, 1.9 vs siCon, 5.1, p=0.002 for (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1d</xref>).

Given the differences between SA1 and SA2 reported herein, we also performed the reloading experiment to separate the effects of SA1 and SA2. As expected from our co-IP results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), RAD21 levels in RAD21<sup>mAC</sup> cells were more affected by siSA2 than siSA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1e</xref>). We observed that cohesin reloading was more efficient in siSA2 (where SA1 is present) than in siSA1 (where SA2 is present), and that siSA1 was similar in reloading to siSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1e</xref>). Together these observations suggest that the bulk of the reloading in RAD21<sup>mAC</sup> cells treated with IAA is supported by SA1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>SA proteins stabilize nascent RNA in the absence of cohesin</title><p>Given the association of SA proteins with RNA and RBPs and the dependence of cohesin reloading on SA1, we tested the requirement for RNA in cohesin reloading. Cells were treated as above with a pulse of 5 ethynyl uridine (EU) prior to collection. EU becomes actively incorporated into nascent RNA and can be measured by IF alongside the change in RAD21-mClover. While a significant reduction in nascent RNA signal was detected upon treatment with Triptolide (TRP), mClover signal was not significantly changed compared to IAA washoff conditions, indicating that RNA is not a key determinant of cohesin reloading per se (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>, left panel). However, we did observe a significant increase in nascent RNA upon acute RAD21 degradation which returned to EtOH levels when cohesin became reloaded onto chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>, right panel). These results pointed to the stabilization of nascent RNA in the absence of cohesin. Given the association of SA1<sup>ΔCoh</sup> with RNA and RBP, we repeated the experiment in siSA1 KD conditions. Again, we observed an increase in nascent RNA in IAA conditions compared to EtOH control, but this was no longer detected in cells treated with siRNA to SA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i</xref>). Our results point to a role for SA1 in the stabilization of nascent RNA in the absence of cohesin and a possible competition between SA-RNA and SA-cohesin associations.</p><p>Our results thus far showed that SA proteins remain chromatin associated in the absence of cohesin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), when they bind RBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and RNA and are localized to R-loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We also report that SA1 proteins contribute to cohesin’s re-association with chromatin and that this involves nascent RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Thus, we reasoned that SA may facilitate cohesin reloading at R-loops. It was technically challenging to measure reloading upon over-expression of ppyCAG-RNaseH. As an alternative, we used STORM imaging to assess the nuclear distribution of the reloaded cohesin in the context of R-loop clusters by comparing EtOH- and IAA-treated to IAA-washoff RAD21<sup>mAC</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4j</xref>). As before, we measured the ratio of signal (this time RAD21-mClover) inside and outside of the S9.6 mask. Interestingly, in EtOH conditions, RAD21 localizations were depleted from the S9.6 domain (mean ratio 0.95; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4j</xref>) similar to what we observed for SA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3h</xref>). Since STORM is such a sensitive approach, trace localizations of mClover will always be detected, even in IAA conditions when the bulk of the signal is lost. The few localizations we observed were indeed modestly enriched within the S9.6 mask, although these were not significantly different from EtOH (mean ratio 1.08, p=0.10). These localizations may represent either extremely stable or freshly loaded cohesin. Upon IAA washoff, new RAD21-mClover molecules are readily detected, became significantly enriched within S9.6 domains compared to EtOH treated cells (mean ratio 1.19, p=0.029) and were sensitive to treatment with RNase H (mean ratio 0.98; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4j</xref>).

Interestingly, the amino acid (aa) sequence of the spliced SA exons encode a highly basic domain within an otherwise acidic C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, inset). Overall, the SA paralogs are highly homologous, however the N- and C-termini diverge in their aa sequence. Despite this, e31 and e32 have retained their basic properties (pI = 10.4 and 9.9, respectively). Basic patches can act as regulatory domains and bind nucleic acids prompting us to ask whether these alternatively spliced basic exons contribute to the association of SA proteins with RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). We cloned cDNAs from HCT116 cells representing the exon32-containing SA2 (SA2<sup>e32+</sup>) and the canonical exon32-lacking SA2 (SA2<sup>e32∆</sup>), tagged them with YFP, expressed them in HCT116 cells and purified the tagged isoforms to compare their ability to interact with RNAusing CLIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). While the presence of e32 did not change the ability of SA2 to interact with RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>, blue arrows), cells expressing the alternative exon routinely enriched RBPs with molecular weights ~110–140 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>, black arrow), strongly suggesting that the e32 domain may act to stabilize the association of SA2 with RBPs.</p><p>To identify the proteins stabilized by the presence of e32, we coupled YFP-SA2 isoform CLIP with Mass Spectrometry. Three biological replicate IPs were prepared from HCT116OsTIR cells that were transfected with either YFP-SA2<sup>e32+</sup> or YFP-SA2<sup>e32∆</sup>. YFP IP efficiency for SA2<sup>e32+</sup> or SA2<sup>e32∆</sup> was similar and both isoforms interacted with core cohesin subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5s1sdata2">Figure 5—figure supplement 1—source data 2</xref>). We identified a total of 238 proteins, the majority of which overlap in the two SA IPs and with a previously published SA2 IP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1c, d</xref>). We used a pairwise analysis of SA2<sup>e32+</sup> vs SA2<sup>e32∆</sup> samples to generate a fold-change value for each putative interactor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata2">Figure 5—source data 2</xref>). GO analysis of proteins changed by at least 1.5-fold, and absent in Mock IP revealed a mild enrichment for post-translational modification category from the SA2<sup>e32∆</sup> IP (FDR = 0.0234, p=1.35e-06), and conversely an enrichment of the RNA Binding category from SA2<sup>e32+</sup> (FDR = 3.43E-05, p=6.56E-09). Interestingly, the enriched proteins included YTHDC1 and YTHDF3 (previously identified in the SA1<sup>ΔCoh</sup> interactome, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), DIS3 and POLR2B, all known to play key roles in RNA-protein complexes and stability, have molecular weights ~110–140 kDa and thus likely represent the specifically enriched band in the CLIP experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>, black arrow). Finally, the observation that a basic exon 32 domain in SA2 supports the stability of RNA-RBP interactions led us to investigate if exon 32 also stabilized SA2 at R-loops. We repeated the S9.6 IP in RAD21<sup>mAC</sup> cells expressing either YFP-SA2<sup>e32+</sup> or YFP-SA2<sup>e32∆</sup>. As before, AQR and MCM3 were enriched by S9.6 IP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>) and we found that SA2<sup>e32+</sup> was more enriched in the S9.6 IP compared to SA2<sup>e32∆</sup> (enrichment of 1.8-fold and 1.24-fold respectively, relative to endogenous SA2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f and g</xref>). Taken together, our results support a role for the alternatively spliced C-terminal basic domain of SA in stabilizing interactions with RBPs and R-loops.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Whether SA proteins function in their own right outside of the cohesin complex is rarely considered. Consequently, our understanding of how these proteins contribute to cohesin function and disease is incomplete. In this study, we shed light on this question by uncovering a diverse repertoire of SA1 interactors in cells acutely depleted of the cohesin ring. This ranges from proteins associated with translation and ribosome biogenesis to RNA processing factors and regulators of the epitranscriptome. These observations suggest that SA1 has a previously unappreciated role in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression which offers much-needed new insight into its roles in disease and cancer.</p><p>Acute depletion of the cohesin ring has allowed us to capture a moment in the normal life cycle of cohesin–DNA associations and unveiled a previously unknown step for SA proteins herein. We show that SA proteins, independent of the cohesin trimer, bind to DNA and RNA, either in the context of RNA:DNA hybrid structures, as we have shown here, or perhaps sequentially, and facilitate the loading of cohesin. Future work investigating the binding profiles of SA proteins and re-loaded cohesin following R-loop depletion in vivo, would help to confirm these findings. Furthermore, biochemical assessment of SA interaction with R-loops will help identify the mechanisms of SA’s roles at R-loops both in the presence or absence of cohesin rings.</p><p>Our results are supportive of biophysical observations of SA proteins and R-loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pan et al., 2020</xref>) and in vitro assessment of cohesin loading at DNA intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Murayama et al., 2018</xref>). These results point to the importance of DNA <italic>structure,</italic> as opposed to sequence, in the targeting of cohesin to chromatin. Furthermore, structural studies suggest that NIPBL and SA1 together bend DNA and cohesin to guide DNA entering into the cohesin ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Higashi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chao et al., 2015</xref>). Our work shows that in cells lacking either the canonical NIPBL/MAU2 loader complex or the SA proteins, cohesin can still associate with chromatin, suggesting that loading can occur with either component alone, albeit most effectively together.</p><p>Our results represent a new view onto the role of SA proteins in cohesin biology. Since SA paralogs have distinct terminal ends and nucleic acid targeting mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Countryman et al., 2018</xref>), their recruitment to chromatin may be specified by unique DNA, RNA or protein-interactions, or indeed all three. Such diversification of loading platforms would be important in large mammalian genomes to ensure sufficient amounts of cohesin on chromatin or to stabilize cell-type-specific chromatin structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pezic et al., 2023</xref>). Indeed, SA1 and SA2 show clear differences in interaction with F/YXF-motif containing proteins, despite the fact that both paralogs contain a CES domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2020</xref>), underscoring the importance of investigating interactions in vivo and arguing that additional features play an important role in complex stabilization. In this context, RNA-associated protein interaction has previously been shown to support cohesin stabilization at CTCF at the <italic>IGF2/H19</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yao et al., 2010</xref>). These results are in line with our findings that a basic domain in the unstructured C-terminal portion of SA supports RNA-associated protein interactions.</p><p>Our study suggests that SA1 may act as a novel regulator of R-loop homeostasis. It is noteworthy that other suppressors of R-loop formation include RNA processing factors, chromatin remodellers and DNA repair proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">García-Muse and Aguilera, 2019</xref> which all function in the context of nuclear bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Misteli, 2007</xref>). We find that SA1 proteins are enriched at very distal chromatin interactions in cohesin-depleted Hi-C data, interact with numerous RBPs known to condense in 3D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nozawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huo et al., 2020</xref>) and are enriched in S9.6 domains in cells where we find cohesin becomes associated with chromatin. Harnessing such condensates would provide an efficient loading platform for cohesin at sites of similar biological function. Yeast cohesin has been shown to mediate phase separated condensate structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ryu et al., 2020</xref>). Our results support this view and further suggest that it is SA (and possibly predominantly SA1 in HCT116 cells), with its propensity for intrinsically disordered domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pezic et al., 2023</xref>) that contribute to this formation, thereby linking cohesin loading to biological functions. We note that if SA paralogs or isoforms direct different localization of cohesin loading or stability of its association, this could have important implications in our understanding of disease where SA proteins are commonly mutated, such as in cancers.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and IAA-mediated degradation of Rad21</title><p>HCT116 cells with engineered RAD21-miniAID-mClover (RAD21mAC), or OsTIR1-only, or both (RAD21mAC-OsTIR) were obtained from Masato T.

x/1.40 NA Oil Plan-Apochromat objective lens (Carl Zeiss, Inc). Images were captured as z-stacks and under consistent digital gain, laser intensity and resolution for each experiment. Numerical analysis was carried out using Imaris software (Oxford Instruments, version 9.5.1) and representative images are shown as maximum z-projected views generated using Fiji Image J. In brief, z-stack images were imported into Imaris, cells were identified using DAPI and only those located 1 µm away from image boundary and sized between 120 and 800 µm<sup>3</sup> were selected. A seed-split function of 7.5 µm was used to separate closely situated cells. Fluorescence intensities of individual DAPI-selections in each channel were determined by Imaris and exported into Excel for further analysis. Distribution plots were generated from &gt;50 cells of each replicate with three biological replicates per experiment. Student’s <italic>t-</italic>test was performed between control and experimental conditions and statistical significance was determined by detecting the difference between means (unequal variance, two-tailed). Significance is denoted as p&gt;0.05 = not significant (ns), p≤0.05 = *, p≤0.005 = **, p≤0.0005 = *** and p≤0.0001 = ****.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Chromatin fractionation and co-Immunoprecipitation</title><p>Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS (Sigma Aldrich) and lysed in Buffer A (10 mM HEPES, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.34 M Sucrose, 10% Glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF/Pefabloc, protease inhibitor), supplemented with 0.1% T-X100, for 10 min on ice. Lysed cells were collected by scraping. Nuclei and cytoplasmic material was separated by centrifugation for 4 min at 1300 <italic>g</italic> at 4 oC. The supernatant was collected as the cytoplasmic fraction and cleared of any insoluble material with further centrifugation for 15 min at 20,000 <italic>g</italic> at 4 °C. The nuclear pellet was washed once with buffer A before lysis in buffer B (3 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF/Pefabloc, protease inhibitor) with rotation for 30 min at 4 oC. Insoluble nuclear material was spun down for 4 min at 1700 <italic>g</italic> at 4 °C and the supernatant taken as nuclear soluble fraction. The insoluble material was wash once with buffer B and then resuspended in high-salt chromatin solubilization buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 500 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 20% Glycerol, 0.1% NP-40, 1 mM PMSF/Pefabloc, protease inhibitor). The lysate was vortexed for 2 min to aid solubilization. Nucleic acids were digested with 85 U benzonase (Sigma-Aldrich) per 100x106 cells, with incubation for 10 min at 37 °C and 20 min at 4 °C. Chromatin was further solubilized with ultra-sonication for 3x10 s at an amplitude of 30. The lysate was diluted to 200 mM KCl and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 RPM for 30 min at 4 oC.</p><p>For coIP, antibodies were bound to Dynabead Protein A/G beads (ThermoFisher Scientific) for 10 min at room temperature and ~5 hr at 4 °C. For mock IgG IPs, beads were incubated with serum from the same host type as the antibody of interest. One mg of chromatin extract was incubated with the antibody-bead conjugate per IP for approximately 16 hr at 4 °C. IPs were washed x5 with IP buffer (200 mM chromatin solubilization buffer) and eluted by boiling in either 2 x Laemmeli sample buffer (BioRad) or 4 x NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (ThermoFisher Scientific). Proteins ≤250 kDa were separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis using 4–20% Mini-PROTEAN TGX Precast Protein Gels (BioRad) and transferred to Immobilon-P PVDF Membrane (Merck Millipore) for detection. Proteins ≥250 kDa were separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis using Invitrogen NuPAGE 3–8% Tris-Acetate precast protein gels. Transfer was extended to overnight with low voltage (20 V) to aid in transfer of the high-molecular-weight proteins. Membranes were incubated in primary antibody solution overnight at 4 °C and images were detected using chemiluminescent fluorescence. Densitometry was carried out using ImageStudio Lite software with statistical significance calculated by unpaired t test, unless otherwise specified. Fold enrichment quantifications were performed by first normalizing the raw densitometry value to its corresponding Histone H3 quantification and the comparing between the samples indicated.

To avoid digestion of RNA:DNA hybrids, samples were not treated with benzonase during chromatin solubilization and sonication was carried out for 10 min (Diagenode Biorupter) as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cristini et al., 2018</xref>. Where indicated, chromatin samples were treated with Ribonuclease H enzyme (NEB) overnight at 37 °C to digest RNA:DNA hybrids in the extract. To avoid detection of single-stranded RNA by the S9.6 antibody, all S9.6 IP samples were pre-treated with Purelink RNase A (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 0.25 µg/1 mg chromatin extract for 1 hr 30 min at 4 °C. The reaction was stopped with addition of 143 U Invitrogen SUPERase•In RNase Inhibitor (Thermo Fisher Scientific). RNA:DNA hybrid levels were assessed in chromatin samples by dot blot. Specifically, the chromatin lysate was directly wicked onto Amersham Protran nitrocellulose membrane (Merck) by pipetting small volumes above the membrane. Membranes were blocked in 5% (w/v) non-fat dry milk in PBS-0.1% Tween and incubated with S9.6 antibody overnight as for standard western blot. As above, detection was carried out using chemiluminescent fluorescence. RNase A-mediated digestion of RNA:DNA hybrids was performed using a non-ssRNA-specific enzyme (Thermo Scientific) at 1.5 µg/25 µg chromatin extract at 37 °C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>ChIP-sequencing, library preparation, and analysis</title><p>ChIP lysates were prepared from RAD21<sup>mAC</sup> cells treated with EtOH or IAA for 6 hr in two biological replicates. Formaldehyde (1%) was added to the culture medium for 10 min at room temperature. Fixation was blocked with 0.125 M glycine and cells were washed in cold PBS. Nuclear extracts were prepared by douncing (20 strokes, medium pestle) in swelling buffer (25 mM HEPES pH8, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCL, 0.1% NP40, 1 mM DTT and protease inhibitors) and centrifuged for 5 min at 2000 rpm at 4 C. Nuclear pellets were resuspended in Sucrose buffer I (15 mM Hepes pH 8, 340 mM Sucrose, 60 mM KCL, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.5% BSA, 0.5 mM DTT and protease inhibitors) and dounced again with 20 strokes. The lysate was carefully laid on top of an equal volume of Sucrose buffer II (15 mM Hepes pH 8, 30% Sucrose, 60 mM KCL, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM DTT and protease inhibitors) and centrifuged for 15 min at 4000 rpm at 4 °C. Nuclei were washed twice to remove cytoplasmic proteins, centrifuged and the pellet was resuspended in Sonication/RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Na-deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS and protease inhibitors) at a concentration of 5x10<sup>6</sup> nuclei in 130 μl buffer. This was transferred to a sonication tube (AFA Fiber Pre-Slit Snap-Cap 6x16 mm) and sonicated in a Covaris S2 (settings; 4 cycles of 60 s, 10% duty cycle, intensity: 5, 200 cycles per burst). Soluable chromatin was in the range of 200–400 bp. Triton X100 was added (final concentration 1%) to the sonicated chromatin and moved to a low-retention tube (Eppendorf) before centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C and pellets were discarded. 1/100<sup>th</sup> of the chromatin lysate was retained as the Input sample.</p><p>For Immunoprecipitation, 200 μg chromatin aliquots/IP were precleared with a slurry of Protein A/G (50:50) (Dynabeads) an incubated for 4 hr at 4 °C. Meanwhile, washed Protein A/G beads (40 μl per IP) were mixed with primary antibodies and incubated for 4 hr at 4 °C. The following amounts of antibodies were used: anti-CTCF, 5 μg/ChIP; anti-SA1, 15 μg/ChIP; anti-SA2, 10 μg of the mixed antibody pack/ChIP; anti-Smc3, 5 μg/ChIP and anti-IgG, 10 μg/ChIP. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref> for information about the antibodies. Washed, pre-bound Protein A/G beads +antibody were mixed with pre-cleared chromatin lysates and incubated overnight with rotation at 4 °C. The next day, the supernatant was removed and the beads were washed nine times with increasing salt concentrations. Protein-DNA crosslinks were reversed in ChIP elution buffer (1% SDS, 5 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris HCl pH 8)+2.5 μl of Proteinse K and incubated for 1 hr at 55 °C and overnight at 65 °C. Samples were phenol–chloroform extracted, resuspended in TE buffer and assessed by qPCR as a quality control. Libraries were prepared from 5 to 10 ng of purified DNA, depending on availability of material, using NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina kit and using NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina (Index Primers Set 2) according to manufacturer’s instructions using 6–8 cycles of PCR. ChIP-seq libraries from one biological set (all ChIP libraries for both EtOH and IAA) were multiplexed and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq2500 platform, 80 bp single-end reads. Each biological set was sequenced on a separate run.</p><p>Quality control of reads was preformed using FASTQC. Reads were aligned to the hg19 reference genome using Bowtie with three mismatches. PCR duplicates were detected and removed using SAMTOOLS. Bam files were imported into MISHA (v 3.5.6) and peaks were identified using a 0.995 percentile. Peaks that overlapped in both replicates were retained. Only replicate 1 of the SA1 library was used. Correlation plots of peaks across the genome from different ChIP libraries were compared with log-transformed percentiles plotted as a smoothed scatter plot. Comparison of peaks at regions of interest were carried out using deepTools (Version 3.1.0–2). For input into deepTools, peak data was converted to bigwig format, with a bin size of 500, using the UCSC bedGraphtoBigWig package. The signal matrix was calculated for a window 2000 bp up- and down-stream of the region of interest, missing data was treated as zero, and all other parameters were as default. Heatmaps were generated within deepTools, with parameters as default. Read density profile plots were plotted in ggplot using deepTools profilePlot -perGroup data and smoothed using geom_smooth default ‘gam’ settings.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>DRIP-sequencing</title><p>DRIP lysates were prepared from chromatin. Chromatin was fractionated as described for ChIP samples above, with the following changes. Samples were not fixed and were collected from the plate by scraping in ice-cold PBS. Sonication was performed to solubilize the chromatin using a picorupter with 10 cycles of 30 s on, 30 s off. Following sonication, 60 U of RNase I (Ambion) was incubated with each sample for 1.5 hr at 37 °C to reduce off-target RNA binding by S9.6. Protein was digested with 184 μg of proteinase K incubated with each sample for 2.5 hr at 45 °C and 3.5 hr at 55 °C. Samples were spun briefly and the supernatant taken. Nucleic acid material was isolated from the sample by phenol-chloroform extraction and isopropanol precipitation. Purified nucleic acid material was IP’d as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Skourti-Stathaki et al., 2019</xref>, including resuspension nuclear lysis buffer and fragmentation by sonication using a picorupter for 4 cycles of 30 s on, 30 s off. Following elution, reverse crosslinking, and proteinase K treatment the immunoprecipitated nucleic acid was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and isopropanol precipitation. Second strand synthesis was carried out according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nadel et al., 2015</xref> with minor changes. Namely, the reaction was set up in a PCR tube as:~28 μl eluted DRIP sample, ~27 μl nuclease-free water (depending on DRIP sample, for a total of 75 μl), 15 μl 5 X ss buffer, 2 μl 10 mM dNTP, 0.5 μl DNA ligase (<italic>E. coli</italic>, NEB cat. M0205S), 2 μl DNA polymerase I (<italic>E. coli</italic>, NEB cat. M0209S), 0.5 μl RNase H (2.5 units). This was incubated for 2 hr at 16 °C. dsDNA was purified using a 1.8 X ratio of SPRI beads and eluted in ultrapure water. Libraries were prepared using NEB Ultra II DNA library prep kit according to manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq platform, 100 bp paired-end reads (30 M per sample). Reads were aligned and processed as for the ChIP-seq samples above with two changes; (i) reads were quality trimmed using trimfq -b 14 -e 16, and (ii) a maximum insert size of 1000 was set for bowtie. DeepTools analysis was carried out as for ChIP-seq samples and with binSize set to 2 bp.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>ChromHMM</title><p>ChIP-seq data for YY1, CBX3, SIN3A, POLR2A, POLR2AphosphoS5, H3K27ac, H3K4me3, H3K4me1, H3K27me3, EZH2, and H3K9me3 from HCT116 cells were obtained from ENCODE and processed as above (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref> for references). ChIP-seq, DRIP-seq, and ENCODE ChIP-seq. BAM files were binarized in ChromHMM using a bin size of 200 bp and a shift of 150 bp.

Custom R scripts were written to identify Hi-C hotspots, that is regions of Hi-C maps with high contact frequency. To begin, for each chromosome, all contacts were extracted and subsetted for only high scoring ( ≥ 60) contacts between a band of 10e3 – 70e6. Using KNN, for each high scoring contact, the 250 nearest neighbour contacts were identified and subset for only the high-scoring neighbours. This created a list of high scoring neighbours for each high scoring contact, where the first neighbour is the contact itself with a distance of 0. This allowed the neighbour information to be converted into edge information, thereby allowing high score fend contacts to be grouped into cluster hotspots using the R package ‘igraph’. Hotspots that contained less than the minimum number of high scoring fends (&lt;100) were removed. The output list of hotspots were represented as 2D intervals which contained high scoring contacts. In total, 5539 hotspots were identified in EtOH and 759 in IAA Hi-C data.</p><p>Creating aggregate plots - To calculate and visualize the contact enrichment at hotspots in the EtOH and IAA Hi-C, we used the R package ‘shaman’. Firstly, we used the function ‘shaman_generate_feature_grid’ to calculate the enrichment profile at EtOH and IAA hotspots. Using the weighted centre for each hotspot, represented as a 2D interval we used the function to build grids for the EtOH and IAA hotspots in the HiC data at 3 specific bands, 100 k – 1 MB, 1MB – 5MB, 5MB – 10MB. A range of 250 kb was visualized around the weighted centre. The grid was built by taking all combinations interval1 and interval2 of the EtOH and IAA hotspot centres, with each combination termed a ‘window’. Hotspots were not filtered for size or shape. A score threshold of 60 was used to focus on enriched pairs, those windows that did not contain at least one point with a score of 60 were discarded. Each window was then split into 1000nt bins and the windows were summed together to generate a grid containing the observed and expected contacts. We visualized the grid using ‘shaman_plot_feature_grid’ using ‘enrichment’ mode and a plot_resolution value of 6000, due to the large range being visualized.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>STORM – Immunolabeling and imaging</title><p>Two clones of RAD21<sup>mAC</sup>-OsTIR cells were seeded at a density of 30,000 cells per well per 400 ul onto poly-L-lysine-coated 8-well chamber slides (Lab-Tek 155411) overnight.

Dual color STORM imaging was performed with a double activator and single reporter strategy by combining AF405_AF647 anti-Goat secondary with Cy3_AF647 anti-Rabbit secondary antibodies. Sequential imaging acquisition was performed (1 frame of 405 nm activation followed by 3 frames of 647 nm reporter and 1 frame of 560 nm activation followed by 3 frames of 647 nm reporter) with 10ms exposure time for 120,000 frames. 647 nm laser was used at constant ~2 kW/cm<sup>2</sup> power density and 405 nm and 560 nm laser powers were gradually increased over the imaging.

Localizations were identified based on a threshold and fit to a simple Gaussian to determine the x and y positions. Cluster analysis of CTCF, SA1 and SA2 STORM signal was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ricci et al., 2015</xref>) to obtain cluster size and positions and to measure Nearest Neighbour distributions (NND) between clusters of the same protein in individual nuclei. NND between clusters’ centroids of two different proteins (i.e. CTCF-SA1 and CTCF-SA2) was calculated by knnsearch.m Matlab function and the NND histogram of experimental data was obtained by considering all the NNDs of individual nuclei (histogram bin, from 0 to 500 nm, 5 nm steps). Simulated NNDs recapitulating random spatial distribution of cluster centroids were first obtained for each nucleus separately and then merged to calculate the simulated NND histogram (histogram bin, from 0 to 500 nm, 5 nm steps). The difference plot reports the difference between experimental NND and simulated NND.

Statistical significance is represented as indicated above.</p><p>Analysis for S9.6 experiments was performed in the following way. After generating localization lists for each STORM image, nuclear masks and S9.6 were generated to segment the obtained localizations belonging to nuclear areas inside or outside s9.6 enriched regions. Masks generation, quantification of masks’ areas and segmentation of STORM localizations were performed in Fiji/ImageJ. Nuclear masks were manually designed based on <italic>STAG1</italic>/GFP signal. S9.6 masks were generated by applying an automatic threshold on s9.6 images based on nuclear intensity signal. Masks were visually inspected individually and adjusted manually in cases where dim signal or noise from cytosolic signal compromised the identification of the mask. The area of all masks was calculated. Masks were applied to the STORM localization lists to generate segmented lists with the localizations belonging to the entire nucleus and to the s9.6 enriched areas. Finally, the density of localizations (number of localizations/area of the mask) for the areas inside and outside s9.6 masks was calculated and the ratio between both values was plotted.</p><p>Graphpad Prism software used for statistical analysis can be found at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.graphpad.com/scientific-software/prism/">https://www.graphpad.com/scientific-software/prism/</ext-link> MatLab software used for imaging data analysis can be found at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html">https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Mass spectrometry sample preparation and data collection</title><p>SA1 immunoprecipitation samples were analysed by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Alessandro Vannini (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The R-loop IFs shown detect large spots of fluorescence that seem to mark the nucleolus. This needs to be clarified, using a nucleolus marker, since it would be possible that most of the effect related to R loops are occurring mainly at the rDNA regions</p><p>2) Authors should show by DRIP-qPCR and ChIP of SA at a number of regions that SA is enriched at the sites where R loops are enriched and that recruitment is diminished by RNH treatment. Similar experiments could be performed by using inhibitors of transcription such as DRB or some other.</p><p>3) The IF and global IP data shown in gels need to be quantified and measured properly with right controls. In this sense, authors seem to be concluding that the stability of SA proteins depends on its binding to RNA. This could be tested more specifically bby showing that after RNH treatment the protein disappear at higher speed whereas other proteins remain.</p><p>4) Provide experimental evidence of the existence of SA1 and/or SA2 bound to chromatin in isolation (ie without other components of the cohesin complex) in unperturbed cells. If data exists in the literature already, this can also be sufficient to infer their model. No evidence is provided of the existence of SA1 (or SA2) complexes bound to R-loops (or anywhere else) in normal circumstances (ie without induced degradation of RAD21). A Chip experiment (SA1 and/or SA2 vs RAD21) or co-localization imaging data would be at least supportive for the existence of SA1 and SA2 independent of the cohesin complex. Otherwise, we might be well just looking at remnants of what were cohesin holo-complexes after induced degradation of RAD21 subunits. Thus,</p><p>5) The analysis only considers exon 31/32 inclusion in HCT cells. It would be interesting to know whether the pattern seen here is consistent in other cell types, including non-cancer cell lines – this would indicate how relevant the specific SA1/2 differences seen here are to other cell types.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The study is certainly interesting. However, the conclusions need additional experimental support. It is known that cohesins are enriched at transcribed DNA regions and the association that the authors are really finding a role for SA protein during transcription and metabolism of nascent RNA, although the function is unclear, provided that this is mainly observed in the absence of cohesins. Authors provide data suggesting a role for SA protein in post-transcriptional gene expression, but this effect is investigated at that level. Stability of RNA, RNA export or some processing experiments are not provided. The association with DNA-RNA hybrid regions is weak, and needs more specific support. A major problem of this type of study is that once shown that a particular protein works in the context of chromatin and transcription, it is not surprising to find it interacting with nuclear factors involved in gene expression as well as with RNA and DNA.</p><p>– The association with R-loops needs further support. As such results can be interpreted in different manners. The IFs shown detect large spots of fluorescence that seems to mark the nucleolus. This needs to be clarified, using a nucleolus marker, since it would be possible that most of the effect related to R loops are occurring mainly at the rDNA regions, where it is known that hybrids accumulate at higher levels. If so, this would argue against the conclusions</p><p>– Authors need to show by DRIP-qPCR and ChIP of SA at a number of regions that SA is enriched at the sites where R loops are enriched and that recruitment is diminished by RNH treatment.</p><p>– Similar experiments should be performed by using inhibitors of transcription such as DRB or some others.</p><p>– The IF and global IP data shown in gels are not convincing, a part that could only reflect indirect effects. Data needs to be quantified and measured properly with right controls. Besides, authors seem to be concluding that the stability of SA proteins depends on its binding to RNA. This should be tested more specifically by kinetics after RNH treatment to show that indeed the protein evaporates at higher speed when treated with RNH whereas other proteins remain stable. This is important because RNH expression is toxic to cells and creates a stress situation with pleotropic consequences.</p><p>– Authors should draw a model.</p><p>– The large amount of data provided does not help the comprehension of the goals of the study. Authors should work better the writing by connecting in a rational way the different approaches undertaken</p><p>– Discussion could be improved. The amount of data provided are not sufficiently discussed to support the conclusions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In order to show that cohesin loading occurs at R-loops, R-loop and cohesin ChIP after auxin wash off would be the ideal experiment. Ideally, this would include multiple timepoints and with/without SA depletion. However, this would be a significant amount of work and may be outside the scope of this work.</p><p>The analysis only considers exon 31/32 inclusion in HCT cells. It would be interesting to know whether the pattern seen here is consistent in other cell types, including non-cancer cell lines – this would indicate how relevant the specific SA1/2 differences seen here are to other cell types.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Cohesin-independent STAG proteins interact with RNA and localise to R-loops to promote complex loading.&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Kevin Struhl (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>We consider that the manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below, before its final acceptance.</p><p>The authors have improved considerably the manuscript by clarifying a number of issues raised in the first revision. As a consequence of this, conclusions are supported in its large part. However, the main conclusion that SA has a direct functional role in R-loop regulation is not fully supported. Given the association of many proteins with transcribed regions, it is not unexpected that part of those regions may form R-loops, so an overlap of binding is observed. However, the fact that authors are not able to find a reduction by treating with RNH is worrying and provided that no biochemistry is added either. The study is certainly interesting, but conclusions in this regard should be lessened, particularly in the title and Abstract, and limitations regarding this point of the study raised in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79386.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The R-loop IFs shown detect large spots of fluorescence that seem to mark the nucleolus.

R-loops have been identified within the nucleolus by IF <sup>1,2</sup> and specifically at the rDNA locus using ChIP-qPCR <sup>3</sup>. Indeed, our results recapitulate these observations, showing S9.6 signal within a Nucleolin mask by IF and S9.6 peaks within the intergenic spacer (IGS) of the rDNA consensus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1a</xref>, b).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>(a) RAD21mAC cells stained for S9.</title><p>6 representing R-loops and Nucleolin.

In fact, the literature supports this possibility. For example, it is known that cohesin is necessary for nucleolar integrity in yeast. Cohesin has been shown to bind to the nontranscribed region of the rDNA locus <sup>4</sup> and the 35S and 5S genes form loops that are dependent on Eco1, the cohesin subunit known to acetylate Smc3 and stabilize cohesin on chromatin <sup>5</sup>. Consequently, yeast with eco1 mutations exhibit disorganised nucleolar structure and defective ribosome biogenesis. Similarly, we have discovered that Stag1 regulates nascent rDNA transcription and nucleolar integrity for mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) pluripotency <sup>6</sup>. This is likely to be direct since Stag1 is bound to both the mouse and human rDNA coding region and IGS, as well as at LINE and SINE repetitive elements important for nucleolar biology. Importantly, SA1/2 binding at rDNA and SINEs is maintained in IAA-treated RAD21<sup>mAC</sup> cells and SA1<sup>ΔCoh</sup> interacts with nucleolar proteins involved in rDNA transcription and processing, including Polr1a, UBF1 in the FC; Fibrillarin (FBL) in the DFC; and Nucleophosmin (NPM) and Nucleolin (NCL) in the GC (Review Figure 1c). Taken together, we argue that SA1 has an important and conserved role in maintaining nucleolar R-loops and structure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Authors should show by DRIP-qPCR and ChIP of SA at a number of regions that SA is enriched at the sites where R loops are enriched and that recruitment is diminished by RNH treatment. Similar experiments could be performed by using inhibitors of transcription such as DRB or some other.</p></disp-quote><p>To further support our observations that SA proteins are localised to R-loops, we have prepared DRIP-seq in RAD21<sup>mAC</sup> cells treated with RNase H (RNH), to confirm specificity of the DRIP signal, and with EtOH or IAA to assess the impact of cohesin loss on R-loops. We combined these datasets with our ChIP-seq for SA proteins and RAD21 in EtOH or IAA conditions. These results are discussed below.</p><p>Despite our best efforts, we were unable to address the question of whether SA1<sup>ΔCoh</sup> is diminished by RNH treatment. First, RAD21<sup>mAC</sup> cells experienced massive cell death after both IAA treatment and RNH overexpression. Next, we did manage to prepare SA ChIP-seq and DRIP-seq libraries upon triptolide treatment to inhibit transcription, however the ChIP signal/noise was extremely poor and we were not confident in these results. In the interest of time and resources, we proceeded with the analysis of R-loop and SA using DRIP-seq.</p><p>This revealed several interesting observations which have now been incorporated into the revised manuscript in a new layout (Lines 296-350, 1160-1186, Figure 3h, i, Figure 3 —figure supplement 1), and to our existing accession GSE167887. We confirmed the specificity of the experiment by identifying RNH-sensitive R-loops, among which we observed two regimes of SA association with R-loops. A small proportion of R-loop sites directly overlapped with SA1/2 in control conditions. These sites were enriched at genes and the SA signal was sensitive to RAD21 loss. On the other hand, a larger proportion of R-loops had SA signals adjacent (bound within 2kb of the R-loop peak). Interestingly, these SA sites were enriched in repressed chromatin and were not sensitive to RAD21 loss, in fact they were enriched.</p><p>Thus, our results support those already provided from IF, STORM, mass spec and coIP to show that cohesin and SA are localised to R-loops in control conditions, and that acute depletion of RAD21 leads to the continued associated of residual SA proteins at R-loops.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The IF and global IP data shown in gels need to be quantified and measured properly with right controls. In this sense, authors seem to be concluding that the stability of SA proteins depends on its binding to RNA. This could be tested more specifically bby showing that after RNH treatment the protein disappear at higher speed whereas other proteins remain.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this point. While our results show that SA1<sup>ΔCoh</sup> binds RNA and interacts with a number of RBP, we acknowledge that we do not definitively know that the stability of SA proteins (with or without cohesin) depends on its binding to RNA. We acknowledge that the treatment of RNases can impact global levels of many proteins and that the observation that SA1<sup>ΔCoh</sup> is reduced upon RNH treatment is not sufficient in this context. Thus, we have removed the data from the manuscript and figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Provide experimental evidence of the existence of SA1 and/or SA2 bound to chromatin in isolation (ie without other components of the cohesin complex) in unperturbed cells. If data exists in the literature already, this can also be sufficient to infer their model. No evidence is provided of the existence of SA1 (or SA2) complexes bound to R-loops (or anywhere else) in normal circumstances (ie without induced degradation of RAD21). A Chip experiment (SA1 and/or SA2 vs RAD21) or co-localization imaging data would be at least supportive for the existence of SA1 and SA2 independent of the cohesin complex. Otherwise, we might be well just looking at remnants of what were cohesin holo-complexes after induced degradation of RAD21 subunits. Thus,</p></disp-quote><p>There are a number of pieces of evidence in the literature to support the existence of SA proteins on chromatin without core cohesin. These include a role for SA1 at telomeres <sup>7</sup>; the effect of NIPBL loss on SA levels in hepatocytes (Figure 1) <sup>8</sup>; and in vitro experiments of SAs ability to bind nucleic acids without cohesin <sup>9</sup>.</p><p>To formally address this in our cell system, we have performed a GFP-TRAP in untreated (EtOH) RAD21<sup>mAC</sup> cells. The results show efficient TRAP of RAD21, interactions with SA proteins as expected and ~20% ‘residual’ SA protein in the flow-through material after GFP-TRAP. We note that this amount of chromatin-bound SA which is not interacting with RAD21 in unperturbed cells is reminiscent of the amount of ‘residual’ chromatin-bound SA we observe upon acute degradation of RAD21. This result has been added to Figure 1 —figure supplement 1 and commented on at Lines 116-120 in the manuscript where we have also included Reference 7 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The analysis only considers exon 31/32 inclusion in HCT cells. It would be interesting to know whether the pattern seen here is consistent in other cell types, including non-cancer cell lines – this would indicate how relevant the specific SA1/2 differences seen here are to other cell types.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included an additional analysis of exon 31/32 inclusion data for SA proteins from mouse embryonic stem (mESC) and mouse Neural progenitor cell (mNPC) RNA-seq datasets, including ones we have produced ourselves as well as published work. The data show that the splicing in of exon 31 of SA1 and the splicing out of exon 32 of SA2 is conserved across cell types and species, arguing for an important role for this splicing event in SA function in general. This data has been added to Figure 5 —figure supplement 1 and commented on at Line 456-457 in the manuscript.</p><p>References:</p><p>1. García-Rubio, M.
