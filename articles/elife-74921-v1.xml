circuits. By combining neuronal cultures, and tools with approaches from network neuroscience and information theory, we can study how complex network topology emerges from local neuronal interactions. We constructed effective connectivity networks using a transfer entropy analysis of spike trains recorded from rat embryo dissociated hippocampal neuron cultures between 6 and 35 days in vitro to investigate how the topology evolves during maturation. The methodology for constructing the networks considered the synapse delay and addressed the influence of firing rate and population bursts as well as spurious effects on the inference of connections. We found that the number of links in the networks grew over the course of development, shifting from a segregated to a more integrated architecture. As part of this progression, three significant aspects of complex network topology emerged. In agreement with previous in silico and in vitro studies, a small-world architecture was detected, largely due to strong clustering among neurons. Additionally, the networks developed in a modular topology, with most modules comprising nearby neurons. Finally, highly active neurons acquired topological characteristics that made them important nodes to the network and integrators of modules. These findings leverage new insights into how neuronal effective network topology relates to neuronal assembly self-organization mechanisms.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>effective connectivity</kwd><kwd>network neuroscience</kwd><kwd>neuronal networks</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002322</institution-id><institution>Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Financial Code 001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Antonello</surname><given-names>Priscila C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001807</institution-id><institution>Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>process 2018/12605-8</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Porcionatto</surname><given-names>Marimélia</given-names></name><name><surname>Faber</surname><given-names>Jean</given-names></name><name><surname>Antonello</surname><given-names>Priscila C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Effectively connected neurons self-organize forming networks with a small-world architecture composed of modules, with most likely few and nearby neurons, integrated by more topologically important and high firing rate neurons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Self‐organizing systems are those capable of changing their internal structure and/or function from specific interactions of their components, given an appropriate exchange of matter or energy with the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Prokopenko, 2009</xref>). In these systems, the interaction among components generates stability against external noise, promoting physical conditions to the emergence of hierarchical structures and new functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banzhaf, 2009</xref>). Neural systems present all of these characteristics, where the interaction among neurons allows for the formation of complex patterns, suggesting that neural circuits are an example of a self-organizing system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Isaeva, 2012</xref>).</p><p>During neurodevelopment, synaptic connections are set up by activity- and non-activity-dependent factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goodman and Shatz, 1993</xref>). Initially, axonal outgrowth and neuronal migration are guided by chemical, mechanical, and geometric attractors/repellents for long distances, toward specific targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goodman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">SenGupta et al., 2021</xref>). Once axons or neurons reach the set of biochemically targeted neurons, they develop an overall coarse-grained scaffold of connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goodman and Shatz, 1993</xref>). From that point, neuronal activity refines the connections in very specific patterns, tuning the network to process information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhang and Poo, 2001</xref>). Synapses promote the structural and functional coupling of neurons, by allowing the propagation of biochemical and electric signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Südhof, 2021</xref>). However, to produce a significant post-synaptic effect the pre-synaptic stimuli need to follow some specific temporal and spatial requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Magee, 2000</xref>). Adaptative mechanisms regulate synapses by promoting cooperation and competition among them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhang et al., 1998</xref>). In this way, the maturation of synapses induced by neuronal spontaneous activity has an important role in the emergence of spatial and temporal patterns related to self-organizing systems.</p><p>However, the self-organization process happens under very specific environmental conditions, via mechanisms that are still not fully understood. For instance, how does neuronal activity influence these initial network structures, yielding specific configurations? Are there privileged network topologies that are ‘locked-in’ by neuronal intrinsic processes? What are the consequences of high or low heterogeneity of neuronal activity for the network configuration?</p><p>One way to address these questions is to model the development of neuronal assemblies as a network. Understanding how these networked architectures emerge from the interactions between neurons forming circuits may give us insights into factors that influence neuronal communication, information processing, and ultimately the emergence of neurodevelopmental disorders. Primary cultures of dissociated neural progenitors or immature neurons present spontaneous activity after a few days in vitro (DIV) and show dynamic changes over time as the neuronal assembly evolves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cohen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Maeda et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pasquale et al., 2008</xref>). The ability of neurons to develop connections and complex dynamics in vitro provides a convenient approach to studying activity-dependent self-organization. Once these preparations represent a simpler model of neural circuits where neuron properties can be studied separately. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Downes, 2012</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schroeter et al., 2015</xref> showed how complex topologies such as small-world architecture, modular organization, hubs, and rich-clubs emerge from functional networks. However, they considered a coarse-grained scale by using neuron populations as the fundamental element of the networks. Herein we propose to go deeper into these analyses by studying the emergence of complex network topology from networks where neurons are the main element, and the effective connectivity is the link between them. We computed effective connectivity networks using spike trains recorded from hippocampal neuronal cultures over the ~30 days of maturation. Additionally, we also considered neuronal firing rate and physical location to investigate how the self-organization of neuronal assembly relates to the network topology. Effective connectivity provides a measure of the influence one neuron exerts over another, to study the process in which effective networks organize into specific architectures may bring new perspectives on how neural circuits accommodate complex dynamics and functions.</p><p>Unlike other types of in vitro preparations, cultures of dissociated neurons display a consistent pattern of population bursts. Because many neurons fire synchronously during these bursts, it can be challenging to extract effective connections from the spiking data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ito et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Penn et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wagenaar et al., 2006</xref>). To address this issue as well as the bias caused by spurious connections, we applied a very stringent transfer entropy (TE) analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ito et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schreiber, 2000</xref>) which we then validated using synthetic data. For details, see the Materials and methods section. Even with this conservative approach, the resulting effective networks showed growth in edge density, progressing from a more segregated to a more integrated architecture. These topological changes drove a combination of neuron clustering and five specifically directed 3-node motifs over time. The neuronal population was divided into modules of a few near but not necessarily adjacent neighbors. In these modular organizations, the most active neurons served as ‘integrators,’ connecting distinct modules. These results demonstrate how network topology develops into segregated and integrated architectures and point toward a role for firing rate in regulating the emergence of complex network topologies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We analyzed the temporal evolution of effective network topology during the development of dissociated hippocampal neuronal assemblies isolated from rats’ embryos.

This type of inference in neural systems should be done carefully because of the number of influences that the analysis can have. Additionally, the relationship between the structural and effective connections may not fully match. Since the predicted transfer is computed from spike trains, not all possible dynamical states are presented in the spontaneous activity. With inhibition active, several communication paths may be inactive or silent, although structural connections may exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Park and Friston, 2013</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">James et al., 2016</xref> pointed out some limitations of TE in detecting information flow, they showed through simple examples of how TE can overestimate flow and underestimate the influence.

Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nigam et al., 2016</xref> discussed the importance of handling firing rate and population bursts influence, as well as spurious connections caused by common drive and transitivity to have a more accurate effective connections inference.</p><p>Underpinned by these works we constructed the present methodology. To test the accuracy of the effective connectivity inference we used Izhikevich’s network model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Izhikevich, 2006</xref>). The network dynamics was constructed based on the synaptic weights and delays between neuron activity propagation. The model reflects information flow pathways based on structural connections between cortical excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The mean firing rate of excitatory neurons was 4.78 ± 0.84 Hz (mean ± SD) and of inhibitory neurons was 16.82 ± 2.19 Hz (mean ± SD). This model helps us to test the ability of the pipeline in detecting the predictive information transfer. Since we compared the transferred information computation with the structural couplings of neurons that generated the information transfer.</p><p>To quantify the ability of the methodology adopted in this work to predict the known connections in the modeled networks, we computed the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. This metric provides an objective and non-parametric way to measure how the algorithm classified the connections, taking into account the number of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative cases in the connection inference. A result equal to 1 indicates that the algorithm was able to detect where there was and where there was no synaptic connection in the model with 100% of precision.

The fraction of networks represents the number of networks presenting at least one motif that has presented the pattern. The smaller fraction of networks that presented motif 13 might also be related to the small-time interval in which this pattern is higher than in random networks. According to the fraction of the networks in which each motif appeared, motifs 5 and 8 are easily found in the networks over time, since they were presented in more than 80% of the cultures in most of the DIV.

To investigate the emergence and role of these important nodes during the maturation of the networks we ranked the results for each neuron in the same culture, considering all DIV in which the culture was recorded, taking into account the degree, strength, betweenness centrality, and closeness centrality. Considering the 40% of the highest values for these four coefficients, neurons that ranked in all of them were classified as having a score of 4. If they ranked only for three coefficients (independently of which one), they were classified as having a score of 3, and so on for 2 and 1.

Effective networks showed non-random topological properties over time associated with the ongoing activity in individual neurons. Our results suggest that both the physical distances between neurons, as well as the heterogeneity of firing rates are key factors in the development of effective network organization. As the complex network topology emerged, we were able to investigate how it relates to the self-organization of neuronal assemblies.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Changes over time</title><p>We found that most of the metrics reported here underwent significant changes after 12 DIV. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> shows an increase in the edge density during the 12–14 DIV period. Additionally, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref> also shows that some networks had already started to present only one component after 12 DIV, indicating fully connected networks. Prior works investigating the dynamics of electrophysiological activity of dissociated hippocampal neuronal cultures maturation also found an increased number of network bursts at the same period (12–14 DIV) than in previous periods of the maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Biffi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cohen et al., 2008</xref>). Network bursts indicate the synaptic spreading of the action potential across neurons reflecting the effects of a fully connected network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hales et al., 2010</xref>). A significant number of edges and the integration of the whole network might have been responsible for the emergence of complex network framework properties.</p><p>Considering functional networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Downes, 2012</xref> argued that the small-world topology emerges from a random network. In contrast, our findings suggest that neurons are promoting neurite outgrowth and refining the effective connections to form a small-world architecture (or other complex network properties) since they are plated. During the early phases of development, the topology of the neuronal effective network is resembling a random network. However, this does not necessarily mean the connections are randomly established, but it may indicate that neurons do not have enough connections to form a complex framework. In this way, the complex architecture might emerge by inserting new connections and not by changing the existing topology. This hypothesis is supported by most of the results stabilizing over the 12–30 DIV period when the edge density increased to around 5% and the number of components decreased to around 1. Even though after 12 DIV the networks started to present complex network organization, the edge density kept growing and achieved stabilization only after 21 DIV. These results show that development is a multi-stage process that takes place over the course of weeks.</p><p>Conversely, after 30 DIV, the networks had a change in topology, ultimately returning to an architecture similar to a random network. As we used recordings from neurons in culture, this effect might be explained by neuronal death associated with the difficulties of maintaining a healthy cell culture beyond 4 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kaech and Banker, 2006</xref>). Indeed, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> shows a decrease in the number of recorded neurons, although no significant decrease in the number of network edges has been detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The impact on the topology after such a period includes a breakup of the networks into different components, as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>. This result can also indicate how the indiscriminate loss of neurons may drastically affect neural circuits during pathological conditions. However, the silencing of neurons may be a result of the multi-stage process of circuit refinement during development. To test this hypothesis novel in vivo studies should be performed.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Neuronal assemblies self-organization</title><p>Considering that dissociated neurons in a culture set up firstly structural connections that are refined by activity-dependent factors, patterns of effective connectivity might be a result of combined self-reinforcing mechanisms and a dispute for limited resources. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zheng et al., 2013</xref> related the self-reinforcing with Hebb’s postulate of synaptic plasticity, which establishes that two groups of neurons strengthen their synaptic connections when their firing patterns are correlated. And the competition for limited resources with the neuronal homeostatic mechanisms that scale the neural plasticity, where one synapse can only be strengthened by weakening another, making the sum of all the synapse weights of a neuron slightly constant.</p><p>In agreement, the ‘silent’ synapse concept seems to have an important role in neuronal assembly formation and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kerchner and Nicoll, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liao et al., 1999</xref> studied the presence of glutamate AMPA and NMDA receptors on silent synapses of hippocampal cultures during maturation to investigate their role in the alteration of synaptic strength. NMDA receptors are known for their modulatory mechanisms associating voltage-dependent magnesium blockage and high calcium permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Iacobucci and Popescu, 2017</xref>), whereas AMPA receptors act in fast excitatory transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Derkach et al., 2007</xref>). The authors showed that silent synapses are composed exclusively of NMDA receptors, indicating that presynaptic glutamate release does not generate an excitatory postsynaptic potential in the postsynaptic neuron. Such synapses can be activated by acquiring functional AMPA receptors by NMDA-receptor-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) mechanisms as previously reported by other work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kerchner and Nicoll, 2008</xref>). The authors also showed that during the first week in vitro, almost 95% of the synapses were silent, in the second week around 65%, and at about 40% in the third week, while the number of synapses expressing AMPA receptors increased. Although these results suggest the transition from silent to active synapses, one could question the role of inhibitory neurons in these interactions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ben-Ari et al., 1997</xref> reviewed how the principal transmitter of inhibitory signaling in the adult central nervous system, GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors may help to activate silent synapses. GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors act differently in immature neurons (until the second postnatal week in rats, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ben-Ari et al., 1997</xref>, 7–8 DIV in cultures, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Soriano et al., 2008</xref>), their activation leads to a cell depolarization which was considered truly responsible for the potentiation of NMDA receptors during the activation of a silent synapse.</p><p>When all these are considered, a possible interpretation is that after being plated the hippocampal neurons start to grow processes and make connections firstly with nearby neurons, and as the dendrites and axons outgrow with more distant neurons. However, during this period, the synapses are most likely the silent type. The synapses are activated by the induction of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) only where there is a time coincident fire between the pre and postsynaptic neurons, and/or with the GABA depolarization aid. In these cases, the activation of a synapse gives rise to an effective connection.</p><p>Furthermore, spatial distribution and firing rate of neurons may have an important role in the regulation of the synapse weights, interfering with the network structure, and consequently, the effective network topological properties. Once the interaction with neighboring neurons takes place first if the synapses among them are activated the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>I</sub> can reach an optimal point and make neurons stop outgrowing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kater and Mills, 1991</xref>). However, while neuron activity is not stabilized the neurites keep outgrowing and seeking for neurons to synchronize. Jointly, considering that the synapses are activated by synchronized spontaneous activity, if the firing rate of one or both neurons is higher it is most likely that pre- and postsynaptic neurons synchronize and consequently activate the synapse between them.</p><p>Indeed, the results of connection weight by connection distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) showed that most of the edges connect neurons that are nearest in the first DIV, this distance had a slight increase after 12 DIV, and then it is sustained after network maturation. Besides that, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ito et al., 2014</xref> found a higher density of connection for smaller distances and an exponential decay as the distance increased in organotypic hippocampal cultures. The results presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zheng et al., 2013</xref> also corroborate this hypothesis. The authors showed that STDP and scaling synapse mechanisms play an important role in the formation and maintenance of neural circuits, and they are essential to keep the connection strength distribution of the networks within the log-normal shape. We showed that the connection weights distribution has had a log-normal shape since the first day recorded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>), suggesting the participation of such mechanisms.</p><p>Although this work focused on the effective connectivity during the self-organization of neuronal assemblies, the relationship between structural and functional/effective connectivity has been a subject of interest in many other works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Meier et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Segall et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Suárez et al., 2020</xref>). To relate structural and effective connectivity is not an easy task since inhibitory activities do not allow all possible communication paths to be explored when effective connectivity is inferred from neuronal dynamics. As pointed out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Park and Friston, 2013</xref> structural networks constrain functional networks but also many patterns of functional connectivity can emerge from fixed structural ones and give rise to high-level neurocognitive functions. In this way, the silent synapses hypothesis might also explain functional connectivity results.

However, when we compared the topological measures for inferred networks with random networks the results were significantly different, showing the emergence of non-random topological properties and neurons’ tendency to connect with their neighbors.</p><p>Complex networks are defined as having highly interconnected units forming an irregular framework that evolves dynamically over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boccaletti et al., 2006</xref>). The study of the topology presented in this kind of network is an active area of research. The most-reported properties in empirical studies are the node degree, that is, the number of directed connections of a node, deviating from a Poisson distribution as presented in random networks to a power-law (scale-free, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Strogatz, 2001</xref>), a short path between any two nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amaral and Ottino, 2004</xref>), and the presence of specific short-cycle patterns or motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boccaletti et al., 2006</xref>). Regarding networks inferred from neuronal populations, different works have already shown that neurons cluster together during the network development to form a complex architecture, both structurally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Santos-Sierra et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shefi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Teller et al., 2014</xref>) and functionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Downes, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schroeter et al., 2015</xref>), but it remains an open question how this organization is guided. Effective connectivity indicates how the activity of one neuron directly influences the activity of another neuron. By looking at how effective network topology develops during the maturation of neuronal assemblies, we may infer how specific architectures emerge from neuronal interactions.</p><p>Small-worldness is a common complex network characteristic found in brain networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bassett and Bullmore, 2006</xref>). In our results, the emergence of this architecture is largely due to the clustering coefficient, given the path length did not significantly change for most of the DIV. The small-world property reflects a network configuration able to maximize communication efficiency while minimizing cost. The emergence of this architecture has been modeled in different ways. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Watts and Strogatz, 1998</xref> proposed a random rewiring scenario in which a few edges of a lattice network were randomly rewired, creating shortcuts and a topology that combined high clustering and short path length. Moving to a neural perspective, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kwok et al., 2007</xref> modeled a Hindmarsh–Rose spiking neuron network with random connection patterns rewired as a result of neuron synchrony. Briefly, they compared the synchronization of spikes (or bursts) of a chosen neuron with the entire network and kept or created a connection only for highly synchronized neurons and disconnected neurons with low synchrony. Interestingly, their model presented a substantial increase in the clustering coefficient and a small increase in the path length, leading the networks to a small-world architecture after some steps of rewiring. However, they discussed that this scenario of synchronicity comparison among unconnected neurons is possibly unrealistic. Reasonably, unconnected neurons could not ‘sense’ their degree of synchronization, given that as far as is known the substrate of neuronal communication is the synapse. Besides that, an extensive rewiring of synapses is extremely unlikely once such a process would require a high amount of time, wiring cost, and energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhang and Poo, 2001</xref>). In this way, we believe that the activation of silent synapses by the synchronicity between neurons is a better explanation for the small-world emergence. Because it is a more efficient and realistic scenario, supported by empirical evidence.</p><p>The comparison among these hypotheses is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. Therefore, if we consider three neurons A, B, and C connected by a silent synapse, and that neurons A and B have a synchronized activity that turns on the synapse between them. If neurons A and C also have their synapses activated by neuron synchronicity, likely, neurons C and B would also have a synchronized activity and so they would also have the silent synapse activated. This mechanism is a possible explanation for the increase in clustering coefficient as edge density increases. Conversely, the path length might assume similar values as in random networks for all DIV given the random nature of dendritic arborization and connection with neighboring neurons. Given that NMDA receptors are glutamatergic and voltage-dependent, the temporal lag between pre- and postsynaptic activity is important to the synapse activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Durand et al., 1996</xref>). However, the heavy-tailed distributions from which the firing rate log-normal distributions have originated, indicate that most of the neurons have a low firing rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buzsáki and Mizuseki, 2014</xref>). This suggests that the spontaneous synchronization of neuron firings can be difficult and the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor’s excitatory effect may play an important role to tune the network in the first stages of development.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Comparison of hypotheses on the emergence of Small-world architecture.</title><p>Alternative scenarios that might support the development of networks into highly clustered nodes reached by a small number of steps. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Watts and Strogatz, 1998</xref> firstly suggested that a random rewiring of a few edges in a lattice network can lead it to a small-world organization. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kwok et al., 2007</xref> adapted this hypothesis to the context of neuroscience, suggesting that neurons are initially randomly connected, and these connections are rewired by comparing the synchronization of one neuron to the entire network. Following a Hebbian rewiring rule, highly synchronized neurons receive or maintain a connection while unsynchronized neurons lose it, also leading the network to a small-world organization after a few steps of rewiring. Both hypotheses were raised in a computational model environment, however, the rewiring scenario would involve a high amount of time, wiring cost, and energy to take place in the brain. Considering the results from empirical data reported herein and the silent synapses activation evidence, we hypothesized that neurons might initially make silent synapses with nearby neurons and only synapses between synchronized neurons would be activated. Thus, considering 3 neurons A, B, and C connected by silent synapses. If the synapse between neurons A and B is activated, because they have a synchronized firing activity and the same occurs for neurons A and C. Likely, neurons B and C would also have a synchronized firing activity turning on the synapse between them. The activation of a significant number of synapses gives rise to a Small-world topology in effective networks by a mechanism of selection of structural connections instead of a rewiring process.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-74921-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Additionally, the direction of the connections between neighboring neurons is important to determine the network dynamics. Once the local patterns of connection are one of the most important features of neural circuits, studying network motifs may be an interesting way to relate these patterns to how neurons as oscillators are coupled to generate dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Makarov et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Using our connection inference methodology, it was not possible to identify which neurons were excitatory or inhibitory. Therefore, it is not possible to discuss the cause of motif formation. However, we can make some general observations. Motif 5 had the most stable results, appearing in more than 85% of all networks after 12 DIV. This motif is the only pattern found that does not involve reciprocal connections, meaning it is a feedforward loop that may support the activity propagation in only one direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beggs and Plenz, 2003</xref>). Motifs 8 and 11 have one reciprocal connection and had a higher variation on the fraction of networks that were present over DIV, most likely because of the higher complexity of a reciprocal connection. As shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">D’Huys et al., 2008</xref> oscillators coupled bidirectionally can have an attractive or repulsive effect. The same can be noticed for motif 12, with two reciprocal connections and for motif 13, with three reciprocal connections that presented a higher incidence than in random networks only after 21 DIV: the period when the networks stabilized their edge density and integrated into only one component. The combination of all these motifs (5, 8, 11, 12, and 13), comprising excitatory and inhibitory neurons, when organized in a small-world architecture might form the complex framework that gives rise to the zero-lag synchrony during population bursts in mature cultures, as shown in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Penn et al., 2016</xref>. Given that the neuron clustering in these patterns may combine the competition and cooperation of coupled oscillators necessary to synchronize the entire network.</p><p>Another widely found complex network property is the subdivision of the networks into modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Betzel and Bassett, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boccaletti et al., 2006</xref>). Our results showed that modules most likely having a small number of neurons emerged from the effective networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). Such preference for smaller modules could be explained by the higher global efficiency within modules comprising fewer neurons. The global efficiency relies on the inverse of path length, which itself is the inverse of connection weights. Additionally, the size of the module presented a positive correlation with its spatial dispersion, meaning that smaller modules have neurons closer together. Indeed, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows that most of the connections have a weight close to or higher than the geometric mean, and they have short physical distances. This result indicates that high global efficiency is achieved by keeping modules dense and spatially compact.</p><p>Global efficiency is a measure of integration since neurons can reach each other by taking a few steps, this allows communication with less noise or attenuation, resulting in better signal transmission. At the same time, a shorter physical connection between neurons would also generate lower wiring costs within modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Betzel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). Overall, greater efficiency reflects better communication inside modules, but how do neurons self-organize to elicit that? Considering the silent synapses activation hypothesis, it is expected that the nearest neurons will make silent synapses first, once dendrites and axons would reach neighboring neurons first as they outgrow. Therefore, taking into account that neurite outgrowth is dependent on low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] <sub>I</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kater and Mills, 1991</xref>) it is expected that neuronal processes stop outgrowing and making connections as the synapses are activated. As a result of this, the probability of neurons making connections with nearby neurons would be expected to be higher than with distant neurons. This synaptic spatial specificity has already been reported in other brain regions such as the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Holmgren et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ko et al., 2011</xref>) and the auditory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Levy and Reyes, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Oswald et al., 2009</xref>). Even more interesting, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ko et al., 2011</xref>) showed that not just the connection probability of nearby neurons is higher, but also that they have correlated functions. Regarding the number of neurons within modules, if time-correlated firing establishes an effective connection, we could expect that the density of edges would remain low. It could also explain why the edge density stops growing, and why not all nearby neurons are connected, once the firing rate of most of the neurons is low.</p><p>Indeed, although there is no overlap among modules in the effectively connected networks, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref> shows that modules overlap spatially. This suggests that synchronous neurons are not necessarily adjacent in the cultures. Given the limitation of synchronization between low firing rate neurons, it is expected that the number of neurons within modules be also limited. We interpret this as the importance of neuron firing rate heterogeneity, reported since the first recorded DIV even though neurons had few connections, to keep the size of modules low. Such a hypothesis fits the module definition since neurons within modules would be more synchronized with one another than with neurons in other modules, making more connections inside than outside the framework. The wiring cost results also suggested this effect. When compared to randomly connected networks, actual effective networks presented higher wiring costs inside modules, indicating a higher number of connections, and a lower value outside modules indicating the opposite.</p><p>In networks that are composed of local modules, it is expected to find nodes responsible for the integration of these frameworks. These hub nodes are more influential or essential to the network than others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sporns, 2015</xref>). The heterogeneity of impact and overall functioning of nodes in a network is another topological property of complex networks. The results presented herein suggest that this framework is also presented in the effective networks since there is a maintained heterogeneity in the number of connections among neurons independent of the development period. This indicates that most of the neurons have fewer connections while there is a minority of high-degree neurons. The same occurs for the strength distributions as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>. Our hubness definition considering node degree, connection strength, and node centrality showed a relationship between neuron rankings in these measures and the firing rate. This new concept indicates why these important neurons integrate modules. Considering the effective connection as a result of an LTP-like process, it is expected that neurons with a higher firing rate have a higher probability to synchronize with other neurons and have stronger connections with other high firing rate neurons. The multiplicative scaling of synapse weights is considered to have an important computation power by keeping at the same time the LTP and long-term depression (LTD) synapse effects as well as the firing rate of neurons within a stable range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Turrigiano and Nelson, 2004</xref>). The compensatory change of the input strengths to keep an overall resulting strength introduces competition between synapses.</p><p>If neurons with higher firing rates make stronger synapses, by competition, the synapses between neurons with a score of 4 would be privileged over synapses with lower firing rate neurons. Indeed, the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> result for neurons with a score of 4 is significantly higher than neurons with a score of 1, indicating their participation in other module connections. Additionally, we verified that the higher the score of a neuron the higher its median <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf7"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>, which suggests that the higher the score of a neuron the higher its firing rate and therefore the higher its likelihood to connect with high score neurons inside and outside its module. This hypothesis is corroborated by the rich-club results, which showed that neurons with a score of 4 comprised the largest fraction of higher weights in outside module connections when compared to neurons with a score of 1. The presence of neurons with a higher firing rate inside rich clubs was also reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nigam et al., 2016</xref>. They found that ‘rich’ neurons (considering all network connections in both in vivo and in vitro preparations) had on average two times the mean firing rate of the network.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref> shows that the neurons are equally divided among the scores in the interval of 21–27 DIV. Although only values for neurons with a score of 4 and a score of 1 were considered different for most of the results. Further, the significant difference between neurons with a score of 3 and neurons with a score of 1, as well as neurons with a score of 4 and neurons with a score of 2 in some DIV, suggests that the heterogeneity of the neuron role in a network is more complex than the definition of a hub and a non-hub node.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Limitations</title><p>One of the most significant issues associated with inferring connectivity using in vitro preparations is the sub-sampling of the networks. The culture itself is comprised of thousands of neurons; however, we are only analyzing those neurons close to the 60 electrodes, which leave out the vast majority of active neurons in the culture. This likely leads to bias in computing topological measures. Despite this issue, the high degree of consistency across cultures suggests to us that the results are robust, if possibly biased in one direction.</p><p>Effective/functional connectivity inference may be influenced by heterogeneous coverage of neurons on the substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Okujeni et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tibau et al., 2020</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Timme et al., 2016b</xref> coated themulti-electrode array (MEA) surface with polyethyleneimine (PEI) plus laminin when gathering the data set used in the present work.

However, using calcium imagine (with all neurons accessible) may improve the quality of the analysis and provide additional insights.</p><p>Another limitation is that individual neurons could not be tracked over multiple DIV, thus we had no control over which neuron was represented by each node for the same culture over time. Moreover, we were not able to identify which neuron was excitatory or inhibitory. Such distinction could elucidate the role of both types of neurons in the assembly self-organization. Mainly in the convergence, divergence, and recurrence of the information flow. Besides that, many of the concepts discussed herein were evidenced in excitatory synapses, however, little is known about their effect on inhibitory ones.</p><p>We formulated a hypothesis involving silent synapse activation and STDP mechanisms that might have a role in the activity-dependent self-organization of neural circuits. However, to provide insights into causal relationships between such hypothesis and integrations/segregation, modular organization, and important nodes, it would be interesting to construct a computational model showing the dependence of connectivity probability on Euclidean distance and that connections are established according to the synchronization of neurons. Another option is to apply electrical stimulation in neuronal cultures to induce control of the mentioned mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Future directions</title><p>While the emergence of complex networks may be partly explained by the role of spontaneous neural activity, it is still necessary to test the causal relations as our results are observational in nature.

Such mechanisms, despite being independent of the exact physical location of each neuron, showed to have a preference to link neurons that are closer to each other.

TE values are highly affected by the firing rate of neurons. As in this work, we are especially interested in information transfer by spike timing and not by spike rate; we controlled the firing rate influence by normalizing the TE values by the entropy of the receptor neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Faber et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Timme et al., 2016a</xref>).</p><p>Further, dissociated neuron cultures present population bursts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Maeda et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wagenaar et al., 2006</xref>) that may elevate the firing rate of many neurons in a time interval. Such an effect can increase the TE value between these neurons. To address this issue, we used the TE as a function of the applied delays to detect whether the time dependence is because of bursts’ influence or not. To control for the possibility of spurious connections due to the strict non-negativity of transfer entropy, we significance-tested each prospective edge using a Monte Carlo approach: jittering spikes to disrupt fine-grained temporal correlations, while approximately preserving the local firing rate and totally preserving the global firing rate. Finally, we tested our pipeline in a modeled network based on the Izhikevich algorithm. All these steps are better described in the following sections.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Extraction of the influence of population bursts</title><p>Hippocampal dissociated neuron cultures as utilized in this work present intermittent and spontaneous synchronicity of electrical activity known as population bursts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Penn et al., 2016</xref>). Population bursts refer to a transient, global increase in the coherent activity of a large number of neurons, and can vary with the number of cells and development stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wagenaar et al., 2006</xref>). As we used cultures during the maturation process in this work, the electrophysiological activity had high variations and we felt the need for some type of stable and adaptive methodology to extract the influence of population bursts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beggs and Plenz, 2003</xref> found that when plotting the TE values by multiple delays, the function tends to peak around the “natural” time delay of the two neurons producing a sharp distribution spanning around ~5 ms around this peak if the neurons are synaptically connected. If the connection is spuriously generated by population bursts, they observed a broad shape around 50–200 ms. We computed the TE value as a function of delays, and we divided the total area of the graph into two areas X and Y. Area X is defined as the 4 ms area around the TE peak and area Y as the rest of the area in the plot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ito et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nigam et al., 2016</xref>).

In order to analyze the significance of the connections, we used a Monte Carlo approach. As a null model, we jittered the spike times only from the sender neuron to conserve the auto-prediction of the receiver neuron. This approach preserves the firing rate and forces the temporal correlation between spikes in the two time series to occur by chance. We jittered each spike in the source series by using a Gaussian distribution centered in the actual spike time and with a standard deviation of 10ms. The Gaussian distribution and the short standard deviation make the analysis stringent. We jittered I and computed TE and CI 1000 times for each pair of neurons.

As we are analyzing the self-organization process during maturation, it is expected that the networks have different densities. Besides that, we would like to study whether self-organization has a random or a complex influence. Therefore, we compare the results of the measures previously described for the actual networks with a null model by averaging the outcome of the measures from 100 random networks, constructed by randomly rewiring each edge approximately 20 times.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Michael Frank as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jordi Soriano (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please clarify the following experimental details:</p><p>– According to Results and Methods, there were 424 networks used, which comprised from DIV 6 to 35. However, it is not clear whether the same cultures were present in the different days of analysis. For instance, some DIVs could include networks that were not present in the others. Since there at least 9 networks in each DIV, do these 9 correspond to 9 cultures that are present in all the other days?</p><p>– Please clarify the influence of the degree of neuronal aggregation in the neuronal cultures, i.e., whether neurons cover homogeneously the substrate or they group in islands. Is such information available? Aggregation could locally increase the density of neurons and potential connections. Different experimental studies have indeed shown that fluctuations in spatial neuronal density substantially affect network development and effective/functional connectivity traits (Okujeni et al., J Neurosci 2017; Tibau et al., IEEE Trans Net Sci Eng 2020). If the information is not available, the authors could mention such a limitation, and even explain that calcium imaging data (with all neurons accessible) could provide additional insight.</p><p>– From the spacing between electrodes, one gets about 1.5x1.5 mm^2 total square area. The lateral size of the square is of the order of the axonal length of neurons grown in culture, so potentially any neuron can easily connect with any other in the culture, making the approximation of a random connectivity in the simulations valid. This should be discussed. There are indeed works pointing out the importance of spatially embedding in cultures (e.g., Hernández-Navarro et al., Phys Rev Lett 2017), in which metric correlations can be neglected in small networks.</p><p>2) The authors seem to use the &quot;effective connectivity validation&quot; analysis to associate the inferred effective connections with structural ones, or at least a substantial part of them. This is a strong assumption that is later treated in the &quot;Neuronal networks self-organization&quot; section of the Discussion. However, it can be confusing when reading the Results, so an earlier clarification (in Results) of the limitations of effective connectivity inference is necessary, and the authors should explain that 'connections' in the article reflect strong paths for information flow rather than actual structural connections. Indeed, not all possible dynamical states of the network are present in a raster plot that portrays solely spontaneous activity; i.e., that information flow (from which effective connectivity is extracted) does not explore all possible structural paths. With inhibition active, several communication paths may be inactive or silent, although structural connections may exist. The extreme difficulty of inferring structure from dynamics has motivated experimentalists to compare effective connectivity inferred from evoked activity with spontaneous activity, to later compare with physiological information (see e.g., Bauer et a., Cerebral Cortex 2018), observing that evoked activity better captures the network's underlying circuitry.</p><p>3) Related to the above, it would be useful for the authors to run additional simulations of the same network with and without inhibition (i.e., by completely silencing the inhibitory neurons) and compare how many connections in the excitation-pure network are present in the excitation-inhibition one. A test relative to non-random graphs would also be helpful; in particular, spatial graphs in which connectivity probability depends on Euclidean distance (Orlandi et al., Nat Phys 2013) would be useful, and even help construct a model to explain the overall results, particularly in understanding that nearby neurons shape spatially compact communities.</p><p>4) Figures 1e shows the distribution of connections. The distribution shifts to higher k values as maturation progresses, indicating an increase of connectivity along development. The authors should include an inset showing the p(k) value for a given k (e.g., k=10, 20, and 40) to illustrate that p(k) gradually goes up.</p><p>5) Figure 1g shows the evolution of Euclidean connectivity distances along DIV. This is an important result since it illustrates the gradual evolution from a segregated to an integrated network. The authors could place the 'probability' color bar at the top of the figure in a horizontal manner and leave the bottom-right corner to plot the average connectivity distance as a function of DIV. Additionally, the panel of Figure 1g contains the results averaged over recordings. Can the authors show as a supplementary figure the evolution of the same network along DIV?</p><p>6) Neuronal circuits in vivo and in vitro experience GABA switch (Soriano et al., PNAS 2008; Tibau et al., Front Neur Circ 2013; Tibau et al., IEEE Trans Net Sci Eng 2020) in which inhibition behaves as excitatory up to DIV 7-8, and afterwards has its normal inhibitory role. In panel 1g, connections seem to extend a larger distance at DIV 6 than at DIV 9, and I think GABA switch is the explanation. At DIV 6, GABA structural connections (behaving as excitatory) could extend longer distances than the excitatory ones and lead to the emergence of long-distance effective connections, which suddenly vanish at DIV 9. If so, this could be explained in the discussion, also addressing the fact that GABA switch is not analyzed in this work. The authors address GABA switch in line 386, but they could extend the discussion a bit more.</p><p>7) Please clarify why most of the motifs (Figure 2f) to drop after DIV 27?</p><p>8) Many neural mechanisms including silent synapses and STDP are discussed in this manuscript. However, neither generative network model nor neural circuit model is developed to directly illustrate possible mechanisms underlying network formation and development. In the absence of a generative model providing insights into causal relationships between the modular organization, neuronal hubs and segregation/integration, the authors should clear state that their discussion of mechanisms is primarily speculative, and suggest strategies for gaining further mechanistic insight.</p><p>9) Effective connectivity is inferred by using a transfer entropy analysis of electrophysiological signals. However, it has been questioned that the transfer entropy (James, et al., 2016) does not quantify the flow of information as commonly assumed. Given this concern, some clarifications or comparisons with state-of-art methods need to be provided.</p><p>10) What is the relation between the log-normal distribution of coupling weights and that of firing rate? What do these heavy-tailed distributions mean for collective network states and whether they are related to the key connectivity properties such as neuronal hubs? Given that all these phenomena have been reported in previous studies, without an in-depth investigation of the problems, the novel contribution of this study is somewhat unclear to me.</p><p>11) In Figure 1c and Figure 1d, the log normal distribution is used to fit the data. Is this distribution better than other heavy-tailed distribution such as truncated Pareto distribution?</p><p>12) Line 88 – &quot;the term neuronal network to refer to the neuronal assemblies coupled to electrodes and effective networks to refer to the network inferred from the neural recordings&quot;. This sentence is not correctly highlighting these two central concepts of the paper. Considering what was written a few lines above, and by also looking at the Results and Methods sections, maybe it would be easier for the reader to follow something along these lines: &quot;the term neuronal networks to refer to transiently coupled neuronal assemblies and effective networks to refer to the circuits inferred from neural recordings&quot;. Of course, this is just a suggestion. The aim is to make as clear as possible the intentions of the authors to disentangle a dynamical aspect ('neuronal assembly') and a structural aspect ('effective network').</p><p>13) Line 145 – &quot;Only some connections extended for long distances, and these connections were more likely to also have a weight close to the geometric mean. Connections with lower and higher weight values were more likely to have shorter lengths.&quot; Very interesting! Can the authors provide a statistical characterization of these effects and a corresponding figure? In particular it is important to test if this feature is also present in the two other models (Watts-Strogatz and Kwok et al.). If yes, it should be mentioned. If not, then it is an important distinguishing feature, and in this case, this aspect should be considerably expanded.</p><p>14) Line 290 – &quot;the higher the neuron score, the higher the median firing rate over all DIVs.&quot; The authors took care of choosing the best inferring method available (transfer entropy). However, a big issue of the structure-from-dynamic approach is its circularity. Dynamical information is used to infer the structure of a network and to draw conclusions concerning how the dynamically-derived structure affects network dynamic itself. Therefore the correlation between firing rate and neuron 'hub' scoring (sentence at the beginning of this paragraph) more than being a result of the study might be a side-effect of the analysis approach. The authors already took the care of searching the available literature to find support (like Sung et al. 2005 for the firing rates of neurons), they are invited to expand their discussion on this point, and suggest experimental and analytical solutions, e.g. use electron microscopy to validate (at least a portion of) the activity-derived networks, or the literature they found to also compare their motifs results, or, in case, why their results cannot be compared with the available literature and electron microscopy data. The use of a spiking network to test the validity of the inference procedure is interesting and valid as a preliminary test, but would require an entire separate work to be able to use it to break the structure-from-dynamic circularity. So this point too needs to be clearly discussed.</p><p>15) Line 350 – Even though it is the discussion, it should be clearly indicated that by &quot;self-organization&quot;, in the context of the experimental strategy and presented results, the authors cannot mean functional connectivity (as it is hinted by the first paragraph, line 352-257), but only self-organization as self-reinforcement of synaptic connections between neurons with correlated firing (as it is done in the following paragraphs of discussion). If, for example, spatially organized stimuli through the electrode were used, and effects on the network structure were observed, it could have been possible to advance the idea that the network self-organization would be functional. In any case, the silent synapses hypothesis they suggest is fundamental to understand <italic>also</italic> functional results. They could maybe move the first paragraph to the end?</p><p>16) Line 62 &quot;The spontaneous emergence of spatio-temporal patterns driven by neuronal activity is characteristic of a self-organizing system.&quot; maybe could be a little expanded given that the rest of the article will be a balance of structure and dynamic running over it.</p><p>17) Line 75 &quot;DIV&quot; is first used without being defined. The definition (days in vitro) comes for the first time in the caption of figure 3 (line 1211)</p><p>18) Line 194, &quot;only 5 of the 13 patterns (5, 8, 11, 12, and 13), were&quot;, the comma after the right bracket should be dropped.</p><p>19) Line 216 &quot;Subgraphs&quot;, &quot;modules&quot;, and &quot;communities&quot; seem to be used interchangeably. However they underlie different meanings (respectively theoretical, architectural, and functional). Wouldn't it be easier for the reader to stick to one term, if just one meaning is intended, or explain the term and its use, where appropriate?</p><p>The clustering grows towards the 12 DIV then decreases, as path length and small-worldness (Figure 2cde). Is this backed up by other data? We are in use with the idea that brain networks are small-world, it looks like these networks, towards the 20 DIVs are not.</p><p>20) Line 290, &quot;Figure 4d shows that the higher…&quot;. It should be &quot;Figure 4e&quot;. Additionally, for clarity in the presentation of results, panel 4f (participation coefficient) should go above panel 4e (firing rate).</p><p>21) Line 346 &quot;neuron loss drastically impacted the topological organization of the effective networks, resulting in a breakup of the networks into different components&quot; In addition (and before) pathological conditions, the neuron loss can also be a (functional) feature of the multi-stage process of circuit refinement, as the authors found in the formation of communities.</p><p>22) Lines 428,429 There is a list of properties but is written in a series of sentences (lacking verbs). &quot;… Strogatz, 2001). A short path …&quot; should be &quot;.. Strogatz, 2001), a short path …&quot;. One line below, &quot;… Ottino, 2004).

Unfortunately, evidence of homogeneous neuron coverage in the cultures is not available in the data set. However, since the authors used the same protocol as Hales et al. (2010, doi: 10.3791/2056) and coated the MEA surface with polyethyleneimine (PEI) plus laminin, it indicates that neurons covered homogeneously the substrate. Hales et al. (2010; doi:10.3791/2056) reported that PEI provided less clustering of cells in the MEA than using polylysine. Besides that, in Figure 1A showed in Timme et al. (2016, 10.3389/fphys.2016.00425), work that reported the gathering of the data set used in this paper, neurons seem to be homogeneously distributed by the MEA.

However, when we compared the topological measures for inferred networks with random networks the results were significantly different, showing the emergence of non-random topological properties and neurons’ tendency to connect with their neighbors.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors seem to use the &quot;effective connectivity validation&quot; analysis to associate the inferred effective connections with structural ones, or at least a substantial part of them. This is a strong assumption that is later treated in the &quot;Neuronal networks self-organization&quot; section of the Discussion. However, it can be confusing when reading the Results, so an earlier clarification (in Results) of the limitations of effective connectivity inference is necessary, and the authors should explain that 'connections' in the article reflect strong paths for information flow rather than actual structural connections. Indeed, not all possible dynamical states of the network are present in a raster plot that portrays solely spontaneous activity; i.e., that information flow (from which effective connectivity is extracted) does not explore all possible structural paths. With inhibition active, several communication paths may be inactive or silent, although structural connections may exist. The extreme difficulty of inferring structure from dynamics has motivated experimentalists to compare effective connectivity inferred from evoked activity with spontaneous activity, to later compare with physiological information (see e.g., Bauer et a., Cerebral Cortex 2018), observing that evoked activity better captures the network's underlying circuitry.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments and suggestions.</p><p>Indeed, this is a very important issue, and it deserves more clarification.</p><p>We believe part of this misunderstanding is due to the comparison of our experimental results with the computational results. Indeed, in Izhikevich’s model, the network dynamics is constructed based on the synaptic weights and delays between neuron activity propagation. In this way, the model reflects the information flow pathways based on structural connections. However, our results from experimental data could reflect only information flow from effective connections. Furthermore, we did not intend to prove the accuracy of the methodology in inferring structural connections through effective ones.</p><p>We used the computational model to test the ability of the pipeline in detecting the predictive information transfer. Nonetheless, we agree that our “connection” definition was confusing. We also agree that the limitations in inferring effective connections, as well as in TE analysis need to be better discussed. We have therefore added the following paragraph to the section “Validation of effective connectivity” in the Results section, lines 163-189:</p><p>“In our analysis, since we have access only to neuron spiking activity, the term “connections” reflects strong paths for information flow rather than actual structural connections (Lizier and Prokopenko, 2010). This type of inference in neural systems should be done carefully because of the number of influences that the analysis can have. Additionally, the relationship between the structural and effective connections may not fully match. Since the predicted transfer is computed from spike trains, not all possible dynamical states are presented in the spontaneous activity. With inhibition active, several communication paths may be inactive or silent, although structural connections may exist (Park and Friston, 2013). James, Barnett, and Crutchfield (2016) pointed out some limitations of TE in detecting information flow, they showed through simple examples how TE can overestimate flow and underestimate the influence. On the other side Garofalo et al. (2009), Ito et al. (2011) and Orlandi et al. (2014) showed how using a combination of time delays and adequate binning may overcome these limitations and make TE analysis a powerful tool for inferring effective connections. Furthermore, Nigam et al. (2016b) discussed the importance of handling firing rate and population bursts influence, as well as spurious connections caused by common drive and transitivity to have a more accurate effective connections inference.</p><p>Underpinned by these works we constructed the present methodology. To test the accuracy of the effective connectivity inference we used Izhikevich’s network model (Izhikevich, 2006). The network dynamics was constructed based on the synaptic weights and delays between neuron activity propagation. The model reflects information flow pathways based on structural connections between cortical excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The mean firing rate of excitatory neurons was 4.78 ± 0.84 Hz (mean ± SD) and of inhibitory neurons was 16.82 ± 2.19 Hz (mean ± SD). This model helps us to test the ability of the pipeline in detecting the predictive information transfer. Since we compared the transferred information computation with the structural couplings of neurons that generated the information transfer.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Related to the above, it would be useful for the authors to run additional simulations of the same network with and without inhibition (i.e., by completely silencing the inhibitory neurons) and compare how many connections in the excitation-pure network are present in the excitation-inhibition one. A test relative to non-random graphs would also be helpful; in particular, spatial graphs in which connectivity probability depends on Euclidean distance (Orlandi et al., Nat Phys 2013) would be useful, and even help construct a model to explain the overall results, particularly in understanding that nearby neurons shape spatially compact communities.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, many works have been using evoked activity to better capture the network's underlying circuitry. However, since our analysis considered only baseline activities is expected that the activities and paths revealed by evoked stimuli could be radically different and hard to compare. Additionally, evoked activity may activate communication paths that were not active during the 1 hour of spontaneous activity recording which could yield different topological patterns. Furthermore, since we are using a bivariate theoretic information metric to compute the effective connections, if a neuron A fires and neuron B does not, as in an inhibitory synapse, this effect will decrease the uncertainty of the neuron B activity prediction considering the past activity of neuron A. In this way, the metric is also capable to capture inhibitory connections if the dynamics between A and B exist.</p><p>Nonetheless, we agree that the use of a computational model is a good way to get evidence. However, the suggested alterations in the model have some execution issues. When we silenced inhibitory neurons in the same networks used previously, the firing rate of excitatory neurons increase a lot going from on average ~5 Hz to ~350 Hz. This huge rise in firing rate produces an important technical issue since it took at least 5x more time to run the same model. We calculated that to generate 30 minutes of spike trains and compute the transfer entropy of these models, a process that also took a lot of time to run, it would spend about 1 month for each data set. Considering that we used 8 sets in our results, this new code would take around more than 8 months, at least, to run. As an alternative, we tried to use only 5 minutes of spike trains modeled, but the inferred network when compared with the modeled networks resulted in an area under the ROC curve equal to 0.5, showing the lack of accuracy to infer the networks. This result is probably due to the high firing rate, which affects the effectiveness of the null model in assisting the non-significative connections cut off. To make possible the use of only 5 minutes of the modeled high firing rate activity we would need to restrict the conditions to construct the null models, which will probably modify the results. Further, we also considered making a model where connectivity probability depends on Euclidean distance, which we agree would be very important to test our silent synapses hypothesis. Most of the time that we took to answer this revision was used by thinking, discussing, and running tests related to these models. However, we concluded that changing the model conditions would take a lot of time to build, run and run the transfer entropy analysis, which would use a lot more resources than was allocated to the execution of this work. In this way, we believe that the extension of the model to provide evidence other than to answer the central questions of this work would be very interesting and useful in further work.</p><p>We added the paragraph below in lines 663-670, addressing these considerations.</p><p>“We formulated a hypothesis involving silent synapse activation and STDP mechanisms that might have a role in the activity-dependent self-organization of neural circuits. However, to provide insights into causal relationships between such hypothesis and integrations/segregation, modular organization, and important nodes, it would be interesting to construct a computational model showing the dependence of connectivity probability on Euclidean distance and that connections are established according to the synchronization of neurons. Another option is to apply electrical stimulation in neuronal cultures to induce control of the mentioned mechanisms.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figures 1e shows the distribution of connections.

In panel 1g, connections seem to extend a larger distance at DIV 6 than at DIV 9, and I think GABA switch is the explanation. At DIV 6, GABA structural connections (behaving as excitatory) could extend longer distances than the excitatory ones and lead to the emergence of long-distance effective connections, which suddenly vanish at DIV 9. If so, this could be explained in the discussion, also addressing the fact that GABA switch is not analyzed in this work. The authors address GABA switch in line 386, but they could extend the discussion a bit more.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this important comment.</p><p>Indeed excitatory-inhibitory GABA switch is present during the neuronal assembly development period observed. However, as we are looking at information flow circuit formation is difficult to extend the discussion about this phenomenon without further evidence of its role in the process. Additionally, since we are using a bivariate theoretic information metric to compute the effective connections, if a neuron A fires and neuron B does not, as in an inhibitory synapse, this effect will decrease the uncertainty of the neuron B activity prediction considering the past activity of neuron A. In this way, the metric is also capable to capture inhibitory connections if the dynamics between A and B exist. Despite the difficulty in distinguishing which connection is excitatory and which connection is inhibitory (Garofalo et al. 2009, 10.1371/journal.pone.0006482, and Orlandi et al. 2014, 10.1371/journal.pone.0098842) Ito et al. (2011, doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0027431) showed an acceptable performance of transfer entropy in detecting inhibitory connections. This suggests that despite GABA influence being excitatory or inhibitory the communication path established by this neurotransmitter can be detected. The new Figure 2b e and Figure 2 —figure supplement 1c show that the shorter distances are more likely both in 6 and 9 DIV. The longer connections that are visualized in the 6 DIV distributions that are not present in the 9 DIV distributions may be a result of some specific culture that was recorded in the 6 DIV but was not recorded in 9 DIV, which would configure a sampling variation. This variance is also present in Figure 2e in the distance over the DIV plot (mean ± SEM). Figure 2 —figure supplement 1 shows the evolution of the joint probability distribution for the same network (Culture 1), we can notice that longer connections are emerging over time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Please clarify why most of the motifs (Figure 2f) to drop after DIV 27?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your question.</p><p>Since we did not make the experiments is hard to know exactly what might have happened. However, from the experiments done in our lab (not reported in this work), most probably this effect might be explained by neuronal death associated with the difficulties of maintaining a healthy cell culture beyond 4 weeks (Kaech and Banker, 2006, doi:10.1038/nprot.2006.356). Indeed, Figure 1b shows a decrease in the number of recorded neurons, although no significant decrease in the number of network edges has been detected (Figure 2a). The impact on the topology after such a period also includes a breakup of the networks into different components, as can be seen in Figure 2b. We also believe that the silencing of neurons might be a result of the multi-stage process of circuit refinement during development. But to test this hypothesis further in vivo studies should be performed. This discussion is presented in the “Changes over time” section in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Many neural mechanisms including silent synapses and STDP are discussed in this manuscript. However, neither generative network model nor neural circuit model is developed to directly illustrate possible mechanisms underlying network formation and development.

In fact, just a few works compared functional/effective connections and the physical distance between elements, which makes comparisons difficult.

However, a big issue of the structure-from-dynamic approach is its circularity. Dynamical information is used to infer the structure of a network and to draw conclusions concerning how the dynamically-derived structure affects network dynamic itself. Therefore the correlation between firing rate and neuron 'hub' scoring (sentence at the beginning of this paragraph) more than being a result of the study might be a side-effect of the analysis approach. The authors already took the care of searching the available literature to find support (like Sung et al. 2005 for the firing rates of neurons), they are invited to expand their discussion on this point, and suggest experimental and analytical solutions, e.g. use electron microscopy to validate (at least a portion of) the activity-derived networks, or the literature they found to also compare their motifs results, or, in case, why their results cannot be compared with the available literature and electron microscopy data. The use of a spiking network to test the validity of the inference procedure is interesting and valid as a preliminary test, but would require an entire separate work to be able to use it to break the structure-from-dynamic circularity. So this point too needs to be clearly discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments and suggestions.</p><p>We believe there might be a misunderstanding or a miswriting at some points.

However, we controlled the firing rate influence in the construction of the networks by comparing TE measured from spike trains in the actual data to TE measured from jittered spike trains, and we also normalized the TE results by the entropy of the receiver neuron.

If, for example, spatially organized stimuli through the electrode were used, and effects on the network structure were observed, it could have been possible to advance the idea that the network self-organization would be functional.

To relate structural and effective connectivity is not an easy task since inhibitory activities do not allow all possible communication paths to be explored when effective connectivity is inferred from neuronal dynamics. As pointed out by Park and Friston (2013) structural networks constrain functional networks but also many patterns of functional connectivity can emerge from fixed structural ones and give rise to high-level neurocognitive functions.

The terms “subgraphs” and “communities” were changed in all the text.</p><p>From an experimental perspective, we did not test over DIV, but looking at the boxplots of the clustering coefficient, we can notice a small fall after 12 DIV. However, this fall may be a result of the increase in physical or chemical environment changes. Neurons’ physiology in culture is very susceptible to variations in humidity, temperature, pH, osmolarity, etc. While the maturation of synapses is susceptible to cell density, number of glial cells (whose proliferation rates are high), etc. It is harder to maintain all these variables the same over time than start with the same conditions for every culture. That might explain the increase in the result variances. However, despite the variance, the results after 12 DIV for the small-worldness coefficient are still deemed significant when compared with random networks. Showing that, the small-world organization is present. From a theoretical perspective, it is hard for us to imagine that firstly the effective networks would develop a small-world architecture, and then for an interval of time in development they would develop another architecture and after this interval recover the small-world properties. Downes et al. (2012) suggested that the small-world topology emerges from a random one, we discussed this hypothesis in the Discussion section. Even though we propose a different conjecture, one architecture switch seems more reasonable than two. A better option to address these questions would be to study the development of the network topology by tracking which neuron is represented by each node. That would make it possible closely watch the formation of connections and information flow.

We extended the discussion in lines 374-385 as presented below.</p><p>“Conversely, after 30 DIV, the networks had a change in topology, ultimately returning to an architecture similar to a random network. As we used recordings from neurons in culture, this effect might be explained by neuronal death associated with the difficulties of maintaining a healthy cell culture beyond 4 weeks (Kaech and Banker, 2006). Indeed, Figure 1b shows a decrease in the number of recorded neurons, although no significant decrease in the number of network edges has been detected (Figure 2a). The impact on the topology after such a period includes a breakup of the networks into different components, as can be seen in Figure 2b. This result can also indicate how the indiscriminate loss of neurons may drastically affect neural circuits during pathological conditions. However, the silencing of neurons may be a result of the multi-stage process of circuit refinement during development. To test this hypothesis novel in vivo studies should be performed.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>22) Lines 428,429 There is a list of properties but is written in a series of sentences (lacking verbs). &quot;… Strogatz, 2001).
