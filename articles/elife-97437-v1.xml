the function of all genes in a genome is highly desirable, yet challenging in <italic>Leishmania</italic> due to a repetitive genome, limited DNA repair mechanisms, and lack of RNA interference in most species. While our introduction of a cytosine base editor (CBE) demonstrated potential to overcome these limitations (Engstler and Beneke, 2023), challenges remained, including low transfection efficiency, variable editing rates across species, parasite growth effects, and competition between deleterious and non-deleterious mutations. Here, we present an optimized approach addressing these issues. We identified a T7 RNAP promoter variant ensuring high editing rates across <italic>Leishmania</italic> species without compromising growth. A revised CBE single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) scoring system was developed to prioritize STOP codon generation. Additionally, a triple-expression construct was created for stable integration of CBE sgRNA expression cassettes into a <italic>Leishmania</italic> safe harbor locus using AsCas12a ultra-mediated DNA double-strand breaks, increasing transfection efficiency by ~400-fold to 1 transfectant per 70 transfected cells. Using this improved system for a small-scale proof-of-principle pooled screen, we successfully confirmed the essential and fitness-associated functions of CK1.2, CRK2, CRK3, AUK1/AIRK, TOR1, IFT88, IFT139, IFT140, and RAB5A in <italic>Leishmania mexicana</italic>, demonstrating a significant improvement over our previous method. Lastly, we show the utility of co-expressing AsCas12a ultra, T7 RNAP, and CBE for hybrid CRISPR gene replacement and base editing within the same cell line. Overall, these improvements will broaden the range of possible gene editing applications in <italic>Leishmania</italic> species and will enable a variety of loss-of-function screens in the near future.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Leishmania</italic></kwd><kwd>cytosine base editing</kwd><kwd>CRISPR</kwd><kwd>functional screening</kwd><kwd>Cas12a</kwd><kwd>loss-of-function</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF 727-2021</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beneke</surname><given-names>Tom</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100018694</institution-id><institution>HORIZON EUROPE Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>101064428 - LeishMOM</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beneke</surname><given-names>Tom</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>532631727</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beneke</surname><given-names>Tom</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>LOEWE Center DRUID</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Project D3 and B3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beneke</surname><given-names>Tom</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An optimized cytosine base editing system for <italic>Leishmania</italic> species improves editing efficiency, reduces toxicity, and ensures stable guide expression, enabling scalable loss-of-function screening and efficient creation of functional mutants.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing has greatly improved loss-of-function experiments in <italic>Leishmania</italic>, and bar-seq screens, which involve individually deleting, barcoding, and pooling mutants for analysis, have facilitated the functional dissection of large gene cohorts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beneke et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beneke et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beneke and Gluenz, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beneke et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burge et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Damianou et al., 2020</xref>). However, the applications of bar-seq screens are limited, and it remains difficult to target the vast <italic>Leishmania</italic> repertoire of repetitive genetic elements by gene replacement approaches. In addition, <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites lack crucial components of the non-homologous DNA end joining (NHEJ) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Passos-Silva et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). As a result, CRISPR-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) lead to unpredictable DNA deletions, increased cell death during DNA repair failures, prolonged repair times, and generally low editing rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang and Matlashewski, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang and Matlashewski, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). Without other means of selection, such as the selection of drug-resistance-associated edits, this complicates further the targeting of dispersed multi-copy genes and applications of pooled CRISPR transfection formats. While RNA interference (RNAi) could offer an alternative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Paiva et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lye et al., 2022</xref>), its use is confined to species within the <italic>Viannia</italic> subgenus, restricting its applicability in the majority of <italic>Leishmania</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lye et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ullu et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>We have recently shown how the use of the hyBE4max cytosine base editor (CBE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>) could potentially overcome these limitations. We demonstrated how the conversion of cytosine to thymine, and thereby the introduction of STOP codons, enables the functional disruption of single- and multi-copy genes in <italic>Leishmania</italic> species without requiring DSB, homologous recombination, the additional use of donor DNA, or isolation of clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Engstler and Beneke, 2023</xref>). Importantly, we presented how this method can be used to identify essential genes in pooled loss-of-function screens via the delivery of plasmid libraries, thereby providing a proof-of-principle experiment for how large-scale pooled CRISPR transfection fitness screens could be carried out in <italic>Leishmania</italic>. However, we also highlighted the need for additional improvements of our method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Engstler and Beneke, 2023</xref>).</p><p>For example, since we used a ribosomal promoter derived from <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> for expression of the CBE and single-guide RNA (sgRNA), editing efficiencies varied greatly between species, and for some <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites, sufficient editing could be only achieved after weeks in culture. Our attempts to use different promoters, such as the T7 RNA polymerase (RNAP) promoter, were unsuccessful, as their employment for CBE sgRNA expression resulted in strong growth defects. Furthermore, the transfection of pooled plasmid libraries led to combinatorial knockout effects, with approximately one-third of all transfectants harboring more than one CBE-sgRNA expression plasmid. In addition, the transfection efficiency of plasmid pools was generally low, yielding only ~1 transfectant out of 30,000 transfected cells. To compensate for combinatorial effects and the relatively low transfection rate, a large number of cells would need to be transfected to enable large-scale pooled CRISPR transfection screens. Lastly, we noticed that non-deleterious mutations within the CBE editing window can become dominant over desired mutations, especially when targeting essential or growth-affecting genes.</p><p>Here, we aimed to develop our base editing approach further and deliver needed improvements. We show how we have identified a T7 RNAP promoter variant that enables stable expression of CBE sgRNAs and results in high editing rates within a short period of time without having significant effects on parasite growth. In addition, we present a construct that allows to express not only T7 RNAP and the hyBE4max CBE but also a highly efficient variant of a Cas12a nuclease derived from <italic>Acidaminococcus</italic> sp. (AsCas12a ultra [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>], formerly AsCpf1). Using AsCas12a ultra-mediated DSBs, we have developed a novel approach to deliver and integrate CBE sgRNA expression cassettes into the <italic>Leishmania</italic> 18S rRNA safe harbor locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Misslitz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sörensen et al., 2003</xref>). We present evidence that the integration of these expression cassettes is precise at the target locus and we demonstrate that this approach has increased transfection rates by up to 400-fold. Using this improved CRISPR tool, we conducted a small-scale loss-of-function screen in <italic>L. mexicana</italic>, targeting nine known essential genes with 24 CBE sgRNAs and 15 non-targeting control sgRNAs. This approach successfully detected all growth-associated phenotypes in a pooled screening format. In a final optimization step, we have also improved our CBE sgRNA design and scoring tool,<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.leishbaseedit.net/">https://www.leishbaseedit.net/</ext-link>, to prioritize sgRNAs with fewer theoretical risks of generating edits that do not result in a STOP codon. We believe that these optimization steps now enable us to deliver a range of gene editing applications, including large-scale loss-of-function screens, in <italic>Leishmania</italic> species without limitations due to extreme cases of gene copy numbers, aneuploidy, and/or lack of RNAi components.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>T7 RNAP promoter variant-driven CBE sgRNA expression reduces toxicity and improves editing efficiency</title><p>In our first version of a CBE toolbox for <italic>Leishmania</italic>, we utilized a ribosomal promoter derived from <italic>L. donovani</italic> for CBE protein and sgRNA expression. While achieving high editing rates with this single plasmid system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Engstler and Beneke, 2023</xref>), efficiencies varied greatly among species, requiring for example over 40 days of incubation to reach significant editing in <italic>Leishmania major</italic> parasites. We previously attempted to minimize these species-specific variations by segregating the CBE expression from the CBE sgRNA cassette in a dual-construct system and by employing a T7 RNAP promoter for CBE sgRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, upon transfection of CBE sgRNA expression constructs into <italic>L. major</italic> T7 RNAP- and CBE-expressing parasites, the doubling time increased from 7 to about 14 hr, highlighting a significant growth defect through T7 RNAP-driven CBE sgRNA expression. On the contrary, we observed higher editing rates in a shorter period of time compared to our approach with the single plasmid ribosomal promoter system, indicating potential advantages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Engstler and Beneke, 2023</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Optimization of cytosine base editor (CBE) single-guide RNA (sgRNA) expression in <italic>L. major</italic>.</title><p>Schematics of base editing strategies to transfect <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites either with a (<bold>A</bold>) single or (<bold>B</bold>) dual base editing system.

Assuming that the growth defect resulted from excessive CBE sgRNA expression, we wondered whether modifying the T7 RNAP promoter sequence and altering the transcription initiation site could alleviate the observed toxicity. We therefore introduced a variety of CBE sgRNA expression plasmids into our previously established <italic>L. major</italic> cell line, expressing CBE and T7 RNAP from the β-tubulin locus, as well as tdTomato from the 18S rRNA locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Engstler and Beneke, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To drive CBE sgRNA expression, we thereby utilized two T7 RNAP promoter variants (T7 T-10 and T7 G-10), known for their ability to reduce transcription activity in the closely related parasite <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wirtz et al., 1998</xref>). We also manipulated the transcription initiation site by altering the number of guanines (either two or one), a factor believed to impact transcription yield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Padmanabhan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Additionally, we compared CBE sgRNA expression via T7 RNAP promoters with the ribosomal promoter derived from <italic>L. donovani</italic>, either in a single- or dual-construct system setup. For our measurements, we transfected CBE sgRNA expression plasmids with two tdTomato-targeting CBE sgRNAs. While the ‘target’ CBE sgRNA was designed to yield an early STOP codon through cytosine-to-thymine (C-to-T) conversion, the ‘control’ CBE sgRNA was designed to induce a C-to-T conversion that results in a neutral substitution (codon change but no amino acid change). Following transfection, we then analyzed growth rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and tdTomato reporter signals in the resulting non-clonal populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). Our aim was to identify the promoter variant with the highest activity and least toxicity.</p><p>As anticipated, when utilizing the ribosomal promoter for CBE sgRNA expression, the dual-construct system resulted in a more significant reduction of the tdTomato reporter signal compared to the single plasmid system. The complete knockdown of the tdTomato reporter was also achieved using all T7 RNAP promoter variants with the dual-construct system. While there were no detectable differences in these knockdown efficiencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>), there were notable variations in the growth rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Consistent with our prior observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Engstler and Beneke, 2023</xref>), cells transfected with constructs containing the unmodified T7 RNAP promoter sequence (T7wt GG in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) exhibited an almost twofold increase in doubling time. On the contrary, employing for CBE sgRNA expression the T7 T10 GG, T7 G10 GG, and ribosomal promoter resulted in no significant growth rate increase. The doubling times here ranged from 7.5 to 8.1 hr. While this aligned with measurements obtained for cells transfected with our single plasmid system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), the complete knockdown of the tdTomato reporter was much more rapid using any dual-construct system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Specifically, the complete depletion of the tdTomato reporter signal was achieved in just 7 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) compared to 33 days when using the same CBE sgRNA in <italic>L. major</italic> parasites previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Engstler and Beneke, 2023</xref>). Compared to our first toolkit version (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Engstler and Beneke, 2023</xref>), this demonstrates a major improvement in our method to generate loss-of-function mutants in non-clonal populations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>DSBs introduced by AsCas12a ultra increase integration rates of donor DNA constructs</title><p>Having successfully improved editing efficiencies, while at the same time reducing the toxicity of CBE sgRNA expression and targeting, we next attempted to increase transfection rates of the CBE sgRNA expression constructs. Previously, we have shown that ~30,000 <italic>L</italic>. <italic>mexicana</italic> wildtype cells need to be transfected with our single plasmid system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) to obtain one transfectant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Engstler and Beneke, 2023</xref>). Since genomic dropout screens need to be performed at a high representation of about 500 cells per sgRNA construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sanjana et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yau and Rana, 2018</xref>), this relatively low transfection rate would make any large-scale screen challenging. In addition, we wanted to enable screening of base editor libraries over long periods and in complex environments, such as in vivo experiments, without risking that parasites would lose their CBE sgRNA plasmid, vary their plasmid copy number or transfer plasmids between cells. Therefore, we wanted to integrate CBE sgRNA expression constructs into a safe harbor locus. Strategies to increase transfection rates and stably integrate expression cassettes by homologous recombination have been previously developed in <italic>T. brucei</italic>. Here, the use of an I-SceI mega- (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Glover and Horn, 2009</xref>) or zinc finger- (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schumann et al., 2017</xref>) nuclease-induced DSB at a safe harbor locus has been shown to increase the transfection efficiency for the integration of RNAi expression constructs significantly. In combination with improved transfection protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burkard et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Glover and Horn, 2009</xref>), this has enabled RNAi loss-of-function screens on a genome-wide scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glover et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Horn, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schumann Burkard et al., 2011</xref>). Alternatively, it has been shown in <italic>Leishmania</italic> that CRISPR/Cas9-induced DSBs can increase the rate of correct donor DNA integration, regardless of homology flank length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beneke et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>To develop a strategy for stable integration of CBE sgRNA expression constructs in <italic>Leishmania</italic> species, we decided to employ a Cas12a nuclease variant from <italic>Acidaminococcus</italic> species. Specifically, we generated an expression construct (pTB107 or pTB106) to co-express in <italic>Leishmania</italic> the AsCas12a ultra variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>), a T7 RNAP, and the hyBE4max CBE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Engstler and Beneke, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The use of AsCas12a ultra had several advantages compared to other approaches mentioned above. First, compared to the use of I-SceI meganuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Glover and Horn, 2009</xref>), it allowed us to select any TTTV-PAM containing locus of interest to insert our CBE sgRNA expression construct, simply by just changing the Cas12a crRNA sequence. Second, Cas12a editing – just like any CRISPR strategy – is much simpler to design than a zinc finger nuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schumann et al., 2017</xref>) or TALENs approach. Third, compared to a functional SpCas9 nuclease, there was no risk of interference between the Cas9 base editor and Cas9 nuclease sgRNAs. Finally, since AsCas12a has an intrinsic RNase activity that allows processing of its own crRNA array (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Paul and Montoya, 2020</xref>), multiplexing of guide sequences is possible, which could expand the scope of standard CRISPR knockin and knockout approaches in <italic>Leishmania</italic> in future studies. For example, Cas12a crRNA arrays with four or more guides can be assembled and transfected to introduce multiple DSBs within one gene. Since Cas12a generates sticky DNA ends that facilitate recombination via microhomology-mediated end joining and homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>), this approach could effectively disrupt target genes without requiring the addition of donor DNA and this may provide an alternative approach to our here presented base editing method in the future. Moreover, CBE sgRNAs could be multiplexed by interspacing them with Cas12a direct repeats (DRs), enabling simultaneous targeting of multiple genes in one cell. Ultimately, we figured that the co-expression of the AsCas12a ultra nuclease, a T7 RNAP, and the CBE would generate a hybrid gene editing toolbox that has many possible applications.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Developing an AsCas12a-mediated integration system.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the Cas12a-mediated integration approach.

Using a T7 RNA polymerase (RNAP) promoter, the Cas12a crRNA template DNA is in vivo transcribed to facilitate a Cas12a-mediated double-strand break (DSB) at the 18S rRNA SSU locus. Using homology flanks the reporter construct is efficiently integrated at the site of the DSB.

Specifically, we designed two overlapping oligos capable of being mutually amplified, generating a Cas12a crRNA template DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This resulting template featured an unmodified T7 RNAP promoter sequence, facilitating the in vivo transcription of the Cas12a crRNA. To ensure high binding affinity of AsCas12a with its Cas12a crRNA, we used an optimized DR from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">DeWeirdt et al., 2021</xref>. Subsequently, this enabled AsCas12a ultra-mediated DSBs for donor DNA integration. To test this approach, we utilized a donor DNA construct containing mNeonGreen (mNG) as a reporter and blasticidin as a resistance marker, allowing for a relatively straightforward assessment of integration accuracy and transfection rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Additionally, we varied the length of homology flanks to investigate whether Cas12a-mediated integration of donor DNA remained independent of homology flank length, as previously observed with Cas9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beneke et al., 2017</xref>). Using homology flanks routinely used for integration into the 18S rRNA safe harbor locus of various <italic>Leishmania</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Misslitz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sörensen et al., 2003</xref>), we then designed one Cas12a crRNA targeting the 200 bp region between both homology regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To evaluate if Cas12a could enhance the transfection rate, we compared transfections of these reporter constructs with and without the addition of Cas12a crRNA.</p><p>Like findings with Cas9, we observed that Cas12a-induced DSBs in <italic>L. mexicana</italic> increased the rate of correct donor DNA integration, irrespective of homology flank length. Integration of reporter constructs with 600 nt homology flanks showed no difference in reporter signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), but the addition of Cas12a crRNA boosted transfection efficiency by approximately 25-fold when assessing blasticidin-resistance rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). When reducing homology flank length to 60 nt, we observed no impact on the reporter signal or transfection rate when Cas12a crRNA was present during transfections. However, in the absence of Cas12a crRNA, no transfectants were obtained, confirming that homologous recombination of the reporter is only independent of homology flank length if a Cas12a-mediated DSB has occurred. Further reducing the homology flank length to 30 nt did not significantly decrease transfection efficiency. However, the percentage of mNG positive cells decreased from ~99% in all other samples to 96.7% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), likely due to imprecise recombination events in some cells. Conversely, Sanger sequencing the integration sites of these non-clonal populations indicated flawless recombination for all constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, B, and C</xref>). Interestingly, diversity in the reporter signal was also noted when transfecting the mNG construct as an episome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), possibly pointing toward plasmid copy number variants between transfected cells. In addition, episomal transfections using the same number of DNA molecules resulted in a significantly lower number of transfectants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), concluding the advantages of integrating expression constructs via Cas12a-mediated DSBs.</p><p>We then wondered whether employing different Cas12a crRNAs could enhance the transfection efficiency even further. Three additional Cas12a crRNAs within the 18S rRNA SSU locus were selected for testing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In addition, we sought to examine the integration into a ‘landing-pad’, such as a previously introduced resistance marker. We expected that this would further increase the accuracy and efficiency of the transfection. We therefore decided to test our system in a tdTomato-expressing <italic>L. mexicana</italic> cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Engstler and Beneke, 2023</xref>) and designed two Cas12a crRNAs to integrate mNG-blasticidin donor DNA constructs within their neomycin-resistance marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Given that 60 nt homology flank length was sufficient for accurate and efficient integration of donor DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>), we decided to test all six Cas12a crRNAs in combination with donor DNA constructs containing 60 nt homology flanks. This meant that homology flanks could be easily adapted through long-primer PCR without the need for bacterial cloning.</p><p>Across all six Cas12a crRNAs tested, no significant changes in the proportion of mNG-expressing cells were observed when analyzing non-clonal populations post transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). However, there was a substantial variation in the rate of blasticidin-resistant cells, indicative of Cas12a crRNA efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). For Cas12a crRNA-1, we confirmed our previous results, yielding 1 transfectant per ~8500 transfected cells. However, other Cas12a crRNAs, particularly Cas12a crRNA-4, performed significantly better, resulting in 1 transfectant out of approximately 2300 transfected cells. Interestingly, despite being only 44 bp upstream of Cas12a crRNA-4, Cas12a crRNA-3 exhibited a 500-fold lower integration efficiency. Surprisingly, both neomycin-targeting Cas12a crRNAs were less efficient than the majority of 18S rRNA SSU locus-targeting guides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Given the exceptional efficiency of Cas12a crRNA-4, we verified the integration of donor DNA at its site in the non-clonal population through Sanger sequencing, confirming flawless integration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D, E, and F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Integration of CBE sgRNA expression cassettes via AsCas12a ultra-introduced DSBs increases editing rates</title><p>After successfully validating our here developed AsCas12a ultra-mediated integration system, we then decided to combine our Cas12a knockin system with our optimized CBE sgRNA expression cassette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). For this purpose, we developed two CBE sgRNA expression plasmids, namely pTB104 and pTB105, each incorporating a puromycin-resistance marker and the most effective T7 RNAP promoter variant (T7 T10 GG) for CBE sgRNA expression (as identified in assays above; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D, and E</xref>). While pTB104 featured 350 nt homology flanks adjacent to the neomycin-targeting Cas12a crRNA-6, pTB105 included 350 nt homology flanks adjacent to our best-performing Cas12a crRNA-4, targeting the 18S rRNA SSU locus. This design allowed for the integration of both CBE sgRNA expression cassettes with and without the addition of Cas12a crRNAs. To assess if such a system could effectively generate a functional null mutant through C-to-T conversion, we chose to target tdTomato again and tested a tdTomato-targeting CBE sgRNA in <italic>L. donovani</italic>, <italic>L. mexicana</italic>, and <italic>L. major</italic>. Parasites expressed tdTomato, along with the CBE, Cas12a ultra, and T7 RNAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Additionally, we investigated whether the efficiency of the tdTomato knockdown would be influenced by how the CBE sgRNA expression cassette was integrated. We therefore compared Cas12a crRNA-4 and 6 in combination with 60 and 350 nt homology flanks.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Integration of cytosine base editor (CBE) single-guide RNA (sgRNA) expression cassettes via AsCas12a ultra.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of Cas12a-mediated integration of the CBE sgRNA expression construct.

The Cas12a crRNA template DNA is in vivo transcribed and consists of an unmodified T7 RNA polymerase (RNAP) promoter (T7wt, light green), a Cas12a direct repeat (DR, red) and a 20 nt Cas12a guide target sequence (SPACER, blue). The CBE sgRNA expression construct is integrated into the 18S rRNA SSU locus, following the Cas12a-mediated double-strand break (DSB).

This occurred irrespective of homology flank length. However, integrating cassettes into the neomycin-resistance marker (‘landing-pad approach’) resulted in only partial tdTomato knockdowns in <italic>L. major</italic> and <italic>L. donovani</italic>, while a complete knockdown could again be achieved in <italic>L. mexicana</italic>. Although we have not further investigated the cause for this, we assume that either the low efficiency of Cas12a crRNA-6 or the number of tdTomato-neomycin-expression cassettes caused this discrepancy. Overall, this highlights that integrating CBE sgRNA expression cassettes into the 18S rRNA SSU locus using Cas12a crRNA-4 in combination with plasmid pTB105 would yield the highest CBE sgRNA editing efficiency. We therefore tested next the transfection rate of CBE sgRNA expression cassettes using Cas12a crRNA-4 for integration in <italic>L. mexicana</italic>, <italic>L. major</italic>, and <italic>L. donovani</italic>. We reached high transfection efficiencies, yielding up to one transfectant out of ~470 transfected <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites, with <italic>L. donovani</italic> being the most and <italic>L. major</italic> being the least efficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, left panel).</p><p>We then wondered whether we could increase the transfection efficiency even further by using the Lonza Nucleofector technology. Previous studies in <italic>T. brucei</italic> demonstrated that the improved transfection rate achieved through I-SceI meganuclease-mediated cleavage could be further increased when combined with the Lonza Nucleofector technology, resulting in up to 1 transfectant per 100 transfected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Glover and Horn, 2009</xref>). Considering this, we explored whether this approach would be as effective in <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites. We therefore conducted a side-by-side comparison of the transfection efficiency between the Lonza Nucleofector Basic Parasite kit and the <italic>Trypanosoma</italic>-optimized buffer (Tb-BSF buffer, see Materials and methods section for further details) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schumann Burkard et al., 2011</xref>), both in combination with an Amaxa Nucleofector 2b electroporator. To increase the number of parasites per transfection even further, we compared our standard transfection protocol using 5×10<sup>6</sup> cells per transfection with up-scaled transfection formats involving 1×10<sup>8</sup> cells and 2.5×10<sup>8</sup> cells per electroporation. Testing these conditions in <italic>L. mexicana</italic>, we confirmed that the Lonza Nucleofector technology could indeed boost transfection efficiency by an additional 20-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, right panel). When transfecting 1×10<sup>8</sup> cells per transfection with 10 µg of PacI-linearized pTB105 plasmid DNA, we achieved up to one transfectant out of 70 transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, right panel). This represents a more than 400-fold increase in transfection efficiency compared to our previous rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Engstler and Beneke, 2023</xref>). Moreover, it demonstrates that a CBE sgRNA library with 40,000 constructs could be transfected at a representation rate of 500-fold using just 20×10<sup>8</sup> cells across 20 transfection cuvettes. Ensuring a 500-fold library representation represents a substantial improvement compared to previous RNAi screens in <italic>T. brucei</italic>, where screens typically achieved about five- to ninefold library representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glover et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Horn, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Morris et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schumann Burkard et al., 2011</xref>). This high representation rate is considered crucial for large-scale dropout screens, as it can affect hit identification by minimizing variations between replicates. However, it’s worth noting that drug-resistance screens can also be conducted at much lower coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sanjana et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yau and Rana, 2018</xref>).</p><p>While the significantly enhanced transfection rates are a central aspect of our improved base editing method presented here, it is crucial to emphasize that these improvements were achieved without impacting parasite growth. Through an assessment of doubling times in transfected and parental cell lines, we confirmed that the expression of CBE, T7 RNAP, AsCas12a ultra, and the CBE sgRNA had minimal or no impact on parasite growth across all three species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This marks a substantial improvement, considering that the expression of CBE and/or CBE sgRNA in our first toolbox version, using the pLdCH-hyBEmax plasmid, could lead to significant growth defects in some <italic>Leishmania</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Engstler and Beneke, 2023</xref>).</p><p>Having established this optimized system, we next decided to target PF16, a gene encoding a central pair protein of the axoneme that has been demonstrated to be essential for <italic>Leishmania</italic> flagellar motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beneke et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Engstler and Beneke, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martel et al., 2017</xref>). For our test, we chose to utilize a previously employed PF16-targeting CBE sgRNA, namely PF16-3. This specific CBE sgRNA induces paralysis in <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites by introducing a thymidine homo-polymer (‘TTTTT’) within the PF16 coding sequence (CDS). While our usual design for CBE sgRNAs aims to introduce STOP codons through C-to-T conversion, we selected PF16-3 for this test because its editing activities are known to vary across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Engstler and Beneke, 2023</xref>). In earlier attempts, we had to express CBE sgRNA PF16-3 in non-clonal populations for 42 days to achieve sufficient editing in <italic>L. major</italic> when using our pLdCH-hyBE4max single vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Engstler and Beneke, 2023</xref>).

However, here we chose to target PF16 in two cell lines: (i) one that possessed the pTB107 construct and a tdTomato reporter, and (ii) one that possessed the pTB107 construct only (WT pTB107). Additionally, we took this opportunity to compare motility and CBE editing rates in cells that had been transfected with Cas12a crRNAs that target the neomycin-resistance marker (Cas12a crRNA-6) and the 18S rRNA SSU locus (Cas12a crRNA-4).</p><p>Our results clearly showed that just 6 days post transfection, the PF16 target site was fully edited, and the overwhelming majority of all cells were paralyzed in all tested scenarios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). However, surprisingly editing slowly reversed in <italic>L. mexicana</italic> cells harboring the pTB107 construct only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). Although we decided not to further investigate the reason for this unexpected result, we assumed that it might be caused by a small proportion of cells where the CBE sgRNA expression cassette was incorrectly integrated. This could potentially result in the silencing of the CBE sgRNA expression or even lead to the deletion of the guide cassette. Since the PF16 mutation in <italic>L. mexicana</italic> is known to be associated with a mild growth defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beneke et al., 2019</xref>), PF16-deficient mutants would eventually be outcompeted over time, leading slowly to the reversal of editing rates. While this escape or reversal of mutant phenotypes might initially appear problematic for detecting growth-associated or other phenotypes in pooled screens, it is important to note that this phenomenon has also been observed with other loss-of-function tools. For instance, RNAi escape has been reported in <italic>T. brucei</italic> when targeting growth-associated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ariyanayagam et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schlecker et al., 2005</xref>). Nevertheless, genome-wide loss-of-function screens have been successfully performed in these parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alsford et al., 2011</xref>). But more importantly the reversal of the PF16 mutation was not observed in any other tested cell line when comparing editing and motility rates 6 and 16 days post transfection. Both tested <italic>L. donovani</italic> cell lines and the tested <italic>L. mexicana</italic> cell line that possessed the pTB107 construct and the tdTomato expression cassette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>) remained paralyzed over the entire observation time. To confirm that these cells would have no potential ever to reverse their phenotype, we decided to Illumina sequence these non-clonal paralyzed <italic>L. mexicana</italic> PF16 mutant populations 16 days post transfection. Analyzing their sequencing data, we did not find a single read of an unedited PF16 CDS (with approximately 35× genome coverage), confirming that indeed all cells within this transfected non-clonal population were completely mutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Cas12a-mediated DSB ensures the integration of one CBE sgRNA per <italic>L. mexicana</italic> transfectant</title><p>We next wanted to verify how exactly the CBE sgRNA expression cassette had been integrated via Cas12a-mediated DSB in these non-clonal <italic>L. mexicana</italic> populations that possessed the pTB107 construct and the tdTomato reporter, as well as the PF16-targeting CBE sgRNA expression construct 16 days post transfection. Since the tdTomato expression cassette is just ~400 nt upstream of the Cas12a crRNA-4 target sequence, we wondered whether it had come to any obvious interference between the tdTomato and CBE sgRNA expression cassettes. Given the highly repetitive nature of the 18S rRNA SSU locus, we employed Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) sequencing to determine the exact integration pattern of both cassettes. For the analysis of sequencing reads, we mapped them against two customized genomes. In the first genome, we assumed that the tdTomato expression cassette was integrated separately from the CBE sgRNA construct, implying that each cassette had integrated on the opposite allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In the second genome, we assumed that both cassettes were integrated on the same allele and could be detected on a single ONT read (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, we could only map unique ONT reads to the first scenario, where cassettes were assumed to be integrated on separate alleles and present in only one copy in the genome. These ONT reads covered the entire tdTomato or CBE sgRNA expression cassette, as well as sequences adjacent to homology flanks used for integration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>).</p><p>We also used our ONT data to validate whether the tdTomato and CBE sgRNA expression cassettes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>) had integrated into any unintended genetic loci. The CDS of the tdTomato reporter gene and the sgRNA expression cassette, comprising the optimized T7 RNAP promoter (T7 T10 GG), PF16-3 targeting spacer, and Cas9 sgRNA scaffold sequence, were analyzed using a standard nucleotide BLAST search (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Then, all matched ONT reads were extracted and we verified whether the full expression cassettes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>) were correctly integrated at the intended position within the 18S rRNA SSU locus. As expected, all identified cassettes in the extracted contigs were correctly integrated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C and D</xref>). Importantly, no ONT reads containing the tdTomato or CBE sgRNA cassettes could be linked to any other locus. Moreover, no contigs contained multiple or both, the tdTomato and CBE sgRNA expression cassettes, suggesting again that these cassettes had integrated into opposite alleles and are present in only one copy in the genome.</p><p>To validate our findings, we then revisited our Illumina sequencing data and analyzed the coverage of relevant genetic features. Specifically, we normalized all reads to the total number of reads per chromosome and compared the normalized coverage of reads mapped to the CDS of PF16, the CBE sgRNA cassette, the CDS of tdTomato, and the CDS of the neomycin-resistance marker. While we found equal read coverage of PF16-mapped reads and the chromosome harboring PF16, read coverage for the CBE sgRNA cassette, the CDS of tdTomato, and the CDS of the neomycin-resistance marker were approximately half of the read coverage of their harboring chromosome 27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This further confirmed our hypothesis that indeed the CBE sgRNA expression cassette had only been integrated on one allele, and most likely, this meant that only one CBE sgRNA cassette copy was present per <italic>L. mexicana</italic> cell. Given that the recognition site of Cas12a crRNA-4 is contained within the homology flank used for tdTomato integration at the 18S rRNA locus, this may contribute to the integration pattern we observe. But since the homology sequences are identical to the original sequences at the locus, the reasons to why this affects the integration of the CBE sgRNA expression cassettes remain unclear.</p><p>Nevertheless this represents an improvement since, in our previously used single-vector episomal system, approximately one-third of all <italic>L. mexicana</italic> transfectants possessed more than one CBE-sgRNA expression plasmid, potentially causing combinatorial knockout effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Engstler and Beneke, 2023</xref>). To verify that in our new dual system each cell indeed harbored only one CBE sgRNA, we decided to test if isolated clones from a transfected library would possess one or multiple CBE sgRNA sequences. In addition to testing this in <italic>L. mexicana</italic>, we also wanted to assess this for <italic>L. donovani and L. major</italic>, as we had not sequenced respective mutants via ONT and Illumina sequencing.</p><p>Using again Cas12a crRNA-4 for the integration of a small-scale pTB105 CBE sgRNA expression cassette library (containing 13 different CBE sgRNA sequences), we isolated 10 clones from each species, PCR amplified the integrated CBE sgRNA locus, and sequenced it by Sanger sequencing. As expected, we found only unique sequencing reads for all tested <italic>L. mexicana</italic> clones, confirming the integration of only one guide per transfectant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, for <italic>L. donovani</italic> and <italic>L. major</italic>, 2 out of 10 sequencing reads showed mixed guide sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting that multiple CBE sgRNAs can be integrated per cell. Furthermore, the integration of multiple sgRNAs per cell remained random. While testing other Cas12a crRNAs in the future may identify a more unique integration locus for <italic>L. donovani</italic> and <italic>L. major</italic> parasites, any compensatory effects through the integration of multiple CBE sgRNAs in these species will likely be minimal and presumably not detectable in large-scale screens with a high library representation rate. Alternatively, a ‘landing-pad’ for integrating CBE sgRNA expression cassettes could be used, such as the neomycin-resistance gene targeted by the Cas12a crRNA-6 presented here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Therefore, we believe that this method is suitable not only for screens in <italic>L. mexicana</italic> but also in <italic>L. donovani</italic> and <italic>L. major</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Detection of fitness-associated phenotypes in a pooled loss-of-function screen</title><p>To provide evidence that our improved CRISPR base editing system can indeed detect a range of mutant phenotypes in pooled screens, including fitness-associated phenotypes, and to confirm significant improvements over our previous method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Engstler and Beneke, 2023</xref>), we next performed a small-scale loss-of-function fitness screen in <italic>L. mexicana</italic> parasites. First, we pooled 39 CBE sgRNAs and cloned them into pTB105, the vector designed for integration into the 18S rRNA locus using the best-performing Cas12a guide, crRNA-4. Of these sgRNAs, 24 were designed to introduce a STOP codon within the first half of open-reading frames (ORFs) essential for survival or normal proliferation in promastigote culture. Targeted genes included five essential kinases for which null mutants could not be generated in individual studies or in the kinome-wide bar-seq screen carried out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker et al., 2021</xref>. These included casein kinase 1 isoform 2 (CK1.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rachidi et al., 2014</xref>), cdc2-related kinase 2 and 3 (CRK2, CRK3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Duncan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hassan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yagoubat et al., 2020</xref>), Aurora kinase 1 (AUK1/AIRK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chhajer et al., 2016</xref>), and target of rapamycin kinase (TOR) 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Madeira da Silva and Beverley, 2010</xref>). We also included sgRNAs targeting the Ras-related protein (Rab) 5a, believed to be essential as null mutants could not be generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rastogi et al., 2016</xref>), and sgRNAs targeting three intraflagellar transport (IFT) proteins (IFT139, IFT140, and IFT88), all predicted to result in growth-associated phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beneke et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Beneke et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sunter et al., 2018</xref>). As a control, our library also included 15 non-targeting sgRNA with random sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Doench et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The PacI-linearized library was then co-transfected with Cas12a crRNA-4 template DNA into <italic>L. mexicana</italic> carrying the pTB107 construct and the tdTomato expression cassette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). As shown earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), these parasites did not reverse their phenotype when inducing a PF16 mutation. A second cell line with an alternative pTB107 construct, pTB106, containing the <italic>Leishmania</italic>-derived Rad51 single-stranded DNA-binding domain – previously shown to enhance cytosine base editing rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Engstler and Beneke, 2023</xref>) – was also used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Following transfection in three independent replicates, cells were selected for CBE sgRNA library integration at the 18S rRNA locus and cultured for 288 hr before undergoing Illumina amplicon sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>). The data analysis compared sgRNA ratios before and after transfection at various time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). As expected, sgRNAs targeting essential and fitness-associated genes were strongly depleted, in contrast to non-targeting control sgRNAs, which remained unchanged. Notably, only two IFT88, two CRK3, and one CRK2 sgRNAs showed no reduction in abundance, while all other sgRNAs moved significantly outside the 99% confidence interval of the non-targeting controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). With a representation rate of ~25,000 cells/sgRNA, triplicate error margins were small. However, no substantial differences were observed between the two Rad51 variants used in the CBE system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Lastly, we compared the data from our improved base editing method with results from a previous screen conducted using our first base editing method version (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Engstler and Beneke, 2023</xref>). The comparison between method v1 and v2 revealed significant improvements: for one sgRNA targeting IFT88 and another targeting CRK3, the new method achieved ~10–20× stronger ratios with substantially reduced error margins for the non-targeting controls, enabling more accurate classification of fitness-associated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Overall, these results demonstrate that our method has been significantly improved, enabling robust and scalable loss-of-function screens to identify essential and fitness-associated genes in the future.

This has no significant impact on parasite growth and enables high editing rates in all these tested species. The utility of fitness screens is also demonstrated. However, as we noted in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Engstler and Beneke, 2023</xref>), high editing rates do not necessarily lead to a strong knockdown of the targeted protein. Cells with a deleterious mutation can be simply outcompeted by cells with a non-deleterious mutation. This issue is particularly relevant when not all available cytosine nucleotides within the CBE sgRNA editing window result in a STOP codon after thymine conversion. To address this, we have therefore improved the scoring of previously designed CBE sgRNAs by implementing a C-score that determines the ratio of available cytosines to resulting STOP codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). This new scoring system has been uploaded to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.leishbaseedit.net">https://www.leishbaseedit.net</ext-link> and will be systematically tested in future studies, e.g., by using editing reporters. We also considered the position at which the STOP codon would occur and designed a scoring matrix that rates CBE sgRNAs higher when the STOP codon is introduced within positions 4–8 and lower when introduced within positions 11–12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). While our ratio scoring aims to increase the chance of successfully generating a functional mutation through STOP codon insertion, it is important to note that the introduction of a STOP codon is not the only efficient way to generate a functional mutant. As shown above, the introduction of a thymidine homo-polymer (‘TTTTT’) within the PF16 CDS produces the same motility phenotype observed when using gene replacement strategies for knockout generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beneke et al., 2017</xref>). Ultimately, this expands the possibilities for upcoming mutational screens in <italic>Leishmania</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Co-expression of Cas12a and CBE enables a wide range of genetic manipulations</title><p>While these modifications to our sgRNA scoring tool represent a hypothetical but yet promising improvement in our method, the design of our triple expression construct (AsCas12a ultra, T7 RNAP, and Cas9 CBE) also offers opportunities for other advancements. For example, it enables hybrid approaches where classical CRISPR gene replacement and/or tagging methods can be combined with cytosine base editing experiments in one cell line. This is particularly interesting for targeting multiple genes simultaneously or dispersed multi-copy genes, and can also include the co-targeting of non-coding and coding genetic elements. Furthermore, since Cas12a has an intrinsic RNA cleavage activity, multiplexing of sgRNAs is possible and this expands the range of potential applications further as outlined above.</p><p>To explore the applicability of AsCas12a ultra for gene replacement strategies, such as the LeishGEdit approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beneke and Gluenz, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beneke and Gluenz, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beneke et al., 2017</xref>), we devised two Cas12a crRNAs targeting the 5’ and 3’ UTR of the PF16 ORF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Additionally, we designed 30 nt homology flanks adjacent to these crRNAs. We then PCR-amplified pTBlast and pTPuro cassettes from the LeishGEdit toolbox using primers containing these homology flanks and co-transfected them with Cas12a crRNA template DNA into <italic>L. mexicana</italic> parasites. These cells contained the pTB107 construct for co-expression of AsCas12a ultra, T7 RNAP, and CBE. Like the Cas9 LeishGEdit approach, transfected Cas12a crRNAs contained a T7 RNAP promoter for efficient in vivo transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Following transfection, we then confirmed that the ORF was successfully replaced by drug-resistance markers on both alleles and amplified the PF16 locus with two ORF spanning primers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). In addition, we performed Sanger sequencing over integration flanks to verify the integration of donor DNA fragments. This analysis confirmed the accurate integration of both donor DNA constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>).

The absence of a functional NHEJ pathway complicates the process of obtaining null mutants, typically demanding the additional use of donor DNA, selection of edits associated with drug resistance, or the time-consuming isolation of clones. These complexities also apply to loss-of-function screens. While pooled CRISPR screens that rely solely on sgRNA expression are feasible to some extend for drug-resistance studies in <italic>Leishmania</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Queffeulou et al., 2024</xref>), they are less likely to succeed in fitness-related phenotypic screens. While, bar-seq screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beneke et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beneke and Gluenz, 2020</xref>) and RNAi methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Paiva et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lye et al., 2022</xref>) offer potential solutions, they come with clear limitations. Most notably, the use of RNAi is restricted to <italic>Leishmania</italic> species within the <italic>Viannia</italic> subgenus, and bar-seq screens pose logistical challenges due to the necessity of generating thousands of individually created mutants. Furthermore, CRISPR gene replacement approaches, such as bar-seq methods, require multiple rounds of transfection when targeting dispersed multi-copy genes and are not suited to mutate interrupted tandemly arrayed coding and non-coding genes, which are abundantly present in the <italic>Leishmania</italic> genome.</p><p>Therefore, we recently introduced cytosine base editing as an alternative method for gene editing and large-scale screening in <italic>Leishmania</italic>, aiming to overcome these limitations. However, variations in editing efficiency, substantial reduction in parasite growth, competition between deleterious and non-deleterious mutations, and low transfection rates prompted further refinements of our method. Here, we present major improvements that collectively enhance our CBE method for <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites.</p><p>In our final setup, we effectively employ a dual-construct system, where a stable cell line is transfected with a CBE sgRNA expression construct. The stable cell line expresses the hyBE4max CBE, AsCas12a ultra, and T7 RNAP, with CBE sgRNA expression driven by a T7 RNAP promoter variant (T7 T-10 GG). Alongside our updated CBE sgRNA design tool, which now prioritizes sgRNAs with a low cytosine to resulting STOP codon ratio, this system achieves high editing rates without affecting parasite growth. Compared to our initial CBE single-vector method, this dual-construct system has the disadvantage that it requires the generation of a stable cell line first. However, it offers the clear advantage that CBE sgRNA expression constructs can be efficiently integrated using AsCas12a-mediated DSBs. Through testing a series of Cas12a crRNAs, we identified a specific Cas12a crRNA capable of efficiently integrating CBE sgRNA expression cassettes into the 18S rRNA SSU safe harbor locus. CBE sgRNA expression cassettes can thereby be generated by amplification or digestion of the plasmid pTB105. In combination with the Lonza Nucleofector technology, this approach increases transfection rates by ~400-fold, yielding up to 1 transfectant per 70 transfected cells. This improved base editing method enabled the successful execution of a small-scale loss-of-function screen, confirming the essential and/or growth-associated roles of several kinases (CK1.2, CRK2, CRK3, AUK1/AIRK, and TOR1), as well as proteins related to intraflagellar transport (IFT88, IFT139, and IFT140) and endocytosis (Rab5A). Lastly, the co-expression of Cas12a and CBE provides strategic advantages, enabling the use of CRISPR gene replacement and base editing approaches in the same cell line. Moreover, Cas12a can be easily employed for protein tagging and multiplexing of sgRNAs, offering in the future a wide range of possible editing experiments in combination with base editing. Overall, our improved toolbox sets the stage for various gene editing applications in <italic>Leishmania</italic>, including genome-wide CBE screens, and we believe that these will make significant advancements in the field.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

New sgRNA ranking scores were calculated based on various parameters, including the relative likelihood of generating a STOP codon from a cytosine base, the total number of possible STOP codons, the location of cytosines within the editing window, and the position of the guide’s target within the CDS of the gene. To generate the overall score, we weighted the contribution of each of these scores, with the likelihood of generating a STOP codon having four times more contribution than the other scores. We then normalized the total score on a scale of 0–100, where 0 represents the best score, and 100 represents the worst score.</p><p>The updated data sets and code can be accessed at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.leishbaseedit.net/">http://www.leishbaseedit.net/</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ElisabethMeiser/Collaboration_Beneke_Meiser">https://github.com/ElisabethMeiser/Collaboration_Beneke_Meiser</ext-link>, copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meiser, 2024</xref> respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s3-13"><title>Cas12a-mediated gene replacement for generation of knockout cell lines</title><p>For the Cas12a-mediated replacement of the PF16 CDS, we adapted the LeishGEdit approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beneke and Gluenz, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beneke and Gluenz, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beneke et al., 2017</xref>) and PCR-amplified two Cas12a crRNAs targeting the 5’ and 3’ UTR of the PF16 ORF (crRNA design as described above).

The authors reasonably conclude that in drug-selected cells there is a mixed population of edited and non-edited cells, possibly due to mis-integration of the sgRNA expression construct, and non-edited cells outcompete edited cells due to a growth defect in PF16 loss of function mutants. However, this suggests that the CBE tool will not work well for producing mutants with strong fitness phenotypes without incorporating a limiting dilution cloning step (at least in L. mexicana and quite possibly other Leishmania species). Furthermore, it suggests it will not be possible to incorporate genes associated with a growth defect into a pooled drop-out screen as described in the paper. This issue is not well explored in the paper and the authors have not validated their tool on a gene associated with a severe growth defect, or shown that their tool works in a mixed population setting.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank reviewer #2 for this helpful comment and valid point. We have now included a small-scale loss-of-function screen in <italic>L. mexicana</italic>, targeting nine known essential genes with 24 CBE sgRNAs and 15 non-targeting control sgRNAs. This approach successfully detected all known included growth-associated phenotypes in a pooled screening format. This experiment is now shown in Figure 5 and described in section “Detection of fitness-associated phenotypes in a pooled loss-of-function screen”.</p><p>In addition, we would like to re-iterate our initial public response to this comment. We believe that escapes or reversals of mutant phenotypes can be observed also with other genetic tools used for loss-of-function screening, including lentiviral CRISPR approaches in mammalian systems and RNAi in <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> (e.g. Ariyanayagam et al., 2005 and Schlecker et al., 2005). Notably, in lentiviral delivered CRISPR screens, sgRNA expression cassettes are integrated in random places within the genome and multiple cassettes can be integrated depending on the viral titre. In these type of screens, cells can escape phenotypes through various mechanisms, such as promoter silencing or selection of non-deleterious mutations. Additionally, not every CRISPR guide is efficient in generating a mutant phenotype, and RNAi constructs can also vary in their effectiveness. Despite these challenges, genome-wide loss-of-function screens have been successfully carried out in mammalian cells and Trypanosoma parasites. Therefore, we believe that the observed escape of one mutant phenotype does not preclude the detection of growth-associated or other phenotypes in pooled screens. Moreover, we did not observe a reversal of the mutant phenotype in <italic>L. mexicana</italic>, <italic>L. donovani</italic>, and <italic>L. major</italic> parasites expressing tdTomato from an expression cassette integrated into the 18S rRNA SSU locus (Figure 4). Our now included small scale fitness screen (Figure 5) confirms these assumptions and shows that we can detect “strong” growth associated phenotypes. We would also like to point out that we have recently successfully conducted several genome-wide loss-of-function screens in vivo and in vitro, ultimately confirming the feasibility of this type of screen on a genome-wide scale (manuscript in preparation).</p><p>We have included a discussion of these points under section “Integration of CBE sgRNA expression cassettes via AsCas12a ultra-introduced DSBs increase editing rates” and section “Detection of fitness-associated phenotypes in a pooled loss-of-function screen” in our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Although welcome, the improvements to the crRNA CBE design tool are hypothetical and untested.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the improvements to the CBE sgRNA design are currently hypothetical. We plan to systematically test our guide design principles in future studies. Since this will require testing hundreds of guides to draw robust conclusions, we believe that this aspect is beyond the scope of the current study. In section “Improved CBE sgRNA design to prioritize edits resulting only in STOP codons” of our revised manuscript we now discuss these future plans.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Sanger and Oxford Nanopore Technology analyses on integration sites of the sgRNA expression cassette integration will not detect the mis-integration of the sgRNA expression construct into an entirely different locus.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now re-analysed our ONT data and have extracted all ONT contigs that match the CBE sgRNA expression cassette. All extracted contigs align to the 18S rRNA SSU locus, showing integration of the cassette into this locus. It is important to note that here a population was sequenced and not a clone. Despite this, no contigs could be found that would link the CBE sgRNA expression cassettes to another locus. This is now shown in Figure 4 S2 and described in section “Cas12a-mediated DSB ensures the integration of one CBE sgRNA per <italic>L. mexicana</italic> transfectant”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Genetic manipulation of Leishmania has some challenges, including some limitations in the DNA repair strategies that are present in the organism and the absence of RNA interference in many species.

It is hard work in the submission to discern what direct evidence there is for editing rates being improved relative to earlier, Cas9-based approaches. Did they directly compare the editing by the new and old approach? If not, can they more clearly explain how they are able to make this claim, either by adding text or a new figure? A side-by-side comparison would emphasise the advance of the new approach more clearly.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank reviewer #3 for this helpful comment. We have directly compared our improved method to our previous base editing method in Figures 1E and 4, demonstrating higher editing rates in a much shorter time. Especially the L. major panel in Figure 4B shows that in a direct comparison between the previously published (Engstler and Beneke, eLife 2023) and our here presented new system, editing can be only observed with the version presented here. However, to clarify the improvements we made, we compare now data from our previous screen done in Engstler and Beneke, eLife 2023 with a loss-of-function screen carried out with our updated method (see Figure 5 and section “Detection of fitness-associated phenotypes in a pooled loss-of-function screen”).</p><p>In addition, we also feel that our title might have been misleading in a sense that we claim that Cas12a editing is more efficient than other Cas9 based approaches, which is something that we don’t want to state here. Given that we have now included a small scale CRISPR screen and given that we generally show improved base editing compared to our previous method (improved in terms of less toxicity, more editing in shorter time, higher transfection rates and less species specific variation), we have rephrased our title to: “Improved base editing and functional screening in Leishmania via co-expression of the AsCas12a ultra, a T7 RNA Polymerase, and a cytosine base editor”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The ultimate, stated goal of this work is (abstract) to 'enable a variety of loss-of-function screens', as the older approach had some limitations. This goal is not tested for the new tools that have been developed here; the experiment in Figure 5 merely shows that they can, not unexpectedly, make a gene mutant, which was already possible with available tools. Thus, to what extent is this paper describing a step forward? Why have the authors not run an experiment - even the same one that was described previously in Engstler and Beneke (2023) - to show that the new approach improves on previous tools in such a screen, either in scale or accuracy?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included a small-scale loss-of-function screen in <italic>L. mexicana</italic>, targeting nine known essential genes with 24 CBE sgRNAs and 15 non-targeting control sgRNAs.

We have addressed the major concern raised by including a small-scale loss-of-function screen in our revised manuscript. By targeting nine known essential genes with 24 CBE sgRNAs and 15 non-targeting control sgRNAs, this approach successfully detected growth-associated phenotypes in a pooled format (see section “Detection of fitness-associated phenotypes in a pooled loss-of-function screen” and Figure 5). Regarding the point of multiple sgRNA expression cassette integration, please see the next comment below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major points:</p><p>Integration of multiple sgRNA expression cassettes:</p><p>While Illumina-based gDNA-seq is well suited to determine changes in ploidy, I don't think it is sensitive enough to draw conclusions about possible double integration in a small percentage of cells. In fact, the data shown in Figure 4 S1D show a normalized coverage &gt;1.5 for sgRNA cassette and NeoR, suggesting that they may have integrated &gt;1 times in some cells.</p></disp-quote><p>To verify that the integration of the CBE sgRNA expression cassette is specific, we have re-analysed our ONT results and confirmed that only ONT contigs can be detected that link the CBE sgRNA expression to the 18S rRNA locus. No other integration sites can be found. We also do not detect any contigs containing multiple CBE sgRNA expression cassettes. This is now shown in Figure 4 S2 and described in section “Cas12a-mediated DSB ensures the integration of one CBE sgRNA per <italic>L. mexicana</italic> transfectant”.</p><p>Nevertheless, it is a valid concern that the sequencing depth is not sufficient to detect small percentage of cells that have integrated the CBE sgRNA expression multiple times. However, in this case we also like to make the point that this small percentage of cells within a screen is likely to be not relevant and we therefore now added a small scale pooled loss-of-function screen, targeting essential genes, to the manuscript (see new Figure 5) to proof our claim. If the integration of multiple sgRNAs into one cell would have any measurable combinatorial effect, the non-targeting controls in our screen would have been depleted as well. However, there is no detectable difference between all 15 included controls in our small-scale screen.</p><p>We have addressed all points in sections “Cas12a-mediated DSB ensures the integration of one CBE sgRNA per L. mexicana transfectant“ and “Detection of fitness-associated phenotypes in a pooled loss-of-function screen”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To avoid double integration, wouldn't it be easiest to just create an allele-specific &quot;landing pad&quot; on one chromosome? I believe that a double integration rate of ~20% could severely complicate the analysis of any large-scale screen later on.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion but we have tried to use an allele-specific &quot;landing pad&quot; and described this already in our first manuscript version (see section “DSBs introduced by AsCas12a ultra increase integration rates of donor DNA constructs”). Specifically, we integrated CBE sgRNA expression cassettes into the neomycin resistance marker contained in the tdTomato expression cassette (Figure 2 S1D, Cas12a crRNA-5 and 6) but this resulted in lower transfection rates (Figure 2F: crRNA-5 1 in ~47,000; crRNA-6 1 in ~32,000) then when using a Cas12a crRNA that targets the 18S rRNA locus directly (Figure 2F: crRNA-4 1 in ~2,000). As we believe a high transfection rate is key for pooled large-scale screens, we therefore pursued further experiments with crRNA-4. However, since a different crRNA can be easily selected for our tool, simply by just changing the Cas12a crRNA during transfection, users can chose a different integration site or other “landing pads” if they want to. We have updated section “Cas12a-mediated DSB ensures the integration of one CBE sgRNA per L. mexicana transfectant” to clarify these details.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, it is not clear to me how the integration of tdTomato could affect the integration of the sgRNA expression cassette 400 bp downstream.</p></disp-quote><p>As said above, our ONT data clearly shows that we can only see integration into one locus (Figure 4 S1 and S2). Given that the recognition site of crRNA-4 is contained in the homology flank used to integrate tdTomato into the 18S rRNA locus, this may contribute to the effect we observe. But since the homology sequences match the original sequences within the locus, the reasons to why this affects integration of the CBE sgRNA expression cassettes remain also elusive to us. We try to discuss this better now in the section “Cas12a-mediated DSB ensures the integration of one CBE sgRNA per L. mexicana transfectant”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Data accessibility:</p><p>The Illumina and ONT data should be made publicly available.</p></disp-quote><p>ONT and Illumina fastq reads are now available at the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA Accession Number: PRJEB83088)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor point:</p><p>Line 30: It would be easier for readers if the authors could briefly explain what bar-seq is.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added more details:[…] and bar-seq screens, which involve individually deleting, barcoding, and pooling mutants for analysis, have facilitated […].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 114, 120: I think the authors are referring to Figures 1E and F, not Figures 2E and F.</p></disp-quote><p>Many thanks for picking this up, we have corrected the Figure reference.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>This has the potential to be a valuable tool for the community if it is efficiently distributed.

Since Cas12a generates sticky DNA ends that facilitate recombination via microhomology-mediated end joining and homologous recombination (Zhang et al., 2021), this approach could effectively disrupt target genes without requiring the addition of donor DNA and this may provide an alternative approach to our here presented base editing method in the future. Moreover, CBE sgRNAs could be multiplexed by interspacing them with Cas12a direct repeats (DRs), enabling simultaneous targeting of multiple genes in one cell.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 193-194: can the authors offer an explanation for the reduction in mNG editing observed with 30nt homology flanks?</p></disp-quote><p>We assume this is caused by imprecise recombination events in some cells and have revised the original sentence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In several places in the manuscript, it is unclear if an analysis has been done on an individual clone or a population derived from multiple transfected cells. If on mixed population, clarify this and calculate the number of clones that the mixture represents.

Such clarification could be as simple as an extra paragraph or figure, clearly comparing the editing rates with the two systems in, as far as possible, equivalent conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We have directly compared our improved method to our previous base editing method in Figures 1E and 4, demonstrating higher editing rates in a much shorter time. Especially the L. major panel in Figure 4B shows that in a direct comparison between the previously published (Engstler and Beneke, eLife 2023) and new system, editing can be only observed with the version presented here. However, to clarify the improvements we made, we compare now data from our previous screen done in Engstler and Beneke, eLife 2023 with a loss-of-function screen carried out with our updated method (see Figure 5 and section “Detection of fitness-associated phenotypes in a pooled loss-of-function screen”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The significance of this work would be improved by running the type of loss of fitness screen described previously in Engstler and Beneke (2023), thereby showing that the new approach improves on previous tools. Without such data, questions remain about potential confounding effects that might not be anticipated from the targeted experiments provided in the current manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. The requested experiment is now presented in Figure 5 and described in section “Detection of fitness-associated phenotypes in a pooled loss-of-function screen”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
