Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK-1) is essential for both mitotic and meiotic cell divisions, with key functions being conserved in eukaryotes. The roles and regulation of PLK-1 during mitosis have been well characterised. However, the discrete roles and regulation of PLK-1 during meiosis have remained obscure. Here, we used <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> oocytes to show that PLK-1 plays distinct roles in meiotic spindle assembly and/or stability, chromosome alignment and segregation, and polar body extrusion during meiosis I. Furthermore, by a combination of live imaging and biochemical analysis we identified the chromosomal recruitment mechanisms of PLK-1 during <italic>C. elegans</italic> oocyte meiosis. The spindle assembly checkpoint kinase BUB-1 directly recruits PLK-1 to the kinetochore and midbivalent while the chromosome arm population of PLK-1 depends on a direct interaction with the centromeric-associated protein CENP-C<sup>HCP-4</sup>. We found that perturbing both BUB-1 and CENP-C<sup>HCP-4</sup> recruitment of PLK-1 leads to severe meiotic defects, resulting in highly aneuploid oocytes. Overall, our results shed light on the roles played by PLK-1 during oocyte meiosis and provide a mechanistic understanding of PLK-1 targeting to meiotic chromosomes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>meiosis</kwd><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd><kwd>oocyte</kwd><kwd>PLK1</kwd><kwd>centromere</kwd><kwd>kinetochore</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/R008574/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bel Borja</surname><given-names>Laura</given-names></name><name><surname>Soubigou</surname><given-names>Flavie</given-names></name><name><surname>Pelisch</surname><given-names>Federico</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>208833</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheerambathur</surname><given-names>Dhanya K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1650112</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Houston</surname><given-names>Jack</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM074215</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Houston</surname><given-names>Jack</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>105606/Z/14/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pelisch</surname><given-names>Federico</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007155</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Doctoral Training Programme</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Taylor</surname><given-names>Samuel JP</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

The remaining sister chromatids segregate in meiosis II, half of which are removed in a second polar body to produce a haploid gamete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marston and Amon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ohkura, 2015</xref>). Tight spatial and temporal control of protein localisation and activity is required to ensure chromosome/chromatid alignment and segregation occur efficiently and the correct number of chromosomes is present in each gamete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marston and Wassmann, 2017</xref>). Phosphorylation is a key post-translational modification utilised to regulate protein localisation and activity, which is fundamentally important for the success of both mitotic and meiotic cell divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marston and Wassmann, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Saurin, 2018</xref>). Therefore, the regulation of kinase or phosphatase localisation and activity is vital for proper cell division, with the balance of their effects determining the localisation/activity of substrate proteins that play important roles in the cell division process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gelens et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Novak et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Polo-like kinases (PLKs) are a family of Ser/Thr protein kinases first discovered in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Llamazares et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sunkel and Glover, 1988</xref>) and yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kitada et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ohkura et al., 1995</xref>), and later findings showed that PLKs are present in all eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zitouni et al., 2014</xref>). PLK-1 is essential for meiotic and mitotic cell divisions, with its localisation and functions proving well conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution. PLK-1 localises to the nuclear envelope in prophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Linder et al., 2017</xref>) and to the centrosomes, kinetochore, central spindle, and midbody during mitosis and is involved in numerous processes, including mitotic entry, spindle assembly, chromosome alignment, the spindle assembly checkpoint, and cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Archambault and Glover, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Petronczki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schmucker and Sumara, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zitouni et al., 2014</xref>). During mammalian meiosis, PLK1 localises to the chromosomes and spindle poles in prometaphase and metaphase. In anaphase, PLK1 is localised primarily in the central spindle between the segregating chromosomes and then the midbody during polar body extrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pahlavan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Solc et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tong et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wianny et al., 1998</xref>). Inhibition of PLK1 in mammalian oocytes has indicated roles in many processes, including germinal vesicle breakdown, spindle assembly, chromosome alignment, and polar body extrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Solc et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tong et al., 2002</xref>). To understand why PLK-1 is crucial for meiosis, it is critical to characterise precisely where PLK-1 is located and how it is recruited to specific regions, which will allow further dissection of the discrete roles of PLK-1 during meiosis.</p><p>PLK-1 interacts with proteins via its C-terminal polo-binding domain (PBD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Elia et al., 2003a</xref>). The PBD binds to phosphorylated motifs of the consensus Ser-phSer/phThr-X, where ph indicates a phosphorylated residue and X indicates any amino acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Elia et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Elia et al., 2003b</xref>). When X is a proline, phosphorylation of the central Ser/Thr residue is often mediated by a proline-directed kinase, notably Cdk1/Cyclin B during cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Elowe et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Qi et al., 2006</xref>) – this motif will henceforth be termed STP motif. When a non-proline residue occupies position X, PLK-1 itself can phosphorylate the central Ser/Thr, thereby enhancing its own recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Neef et al., 2003</xref>), referred to as self-priming. Furthermore, PLK-1 binding to STP motifs via the PBD induces a conformational change that enhances its kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mundt et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xu et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>While the mechanism of PLK-1 recruitment to the chromosomes during oocyte meiosis has not been characterised, recruitment of PLK1 to the kinetochore during mammalian mitosis has been investigated. In mammals, the constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN) complex of proteins binds to the histone variant CENP-A at centromeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Foltz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Izuta et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Okada et al., 2006</xref>). Outer kinetochore proteins bind to the CCAN and ultimately mediate chromosome alignment and segregation via interaction with microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Musacchio and Desai, 2017</xref>). Two proteins are primarily responsible for PLK1 recruitment to the kinetochore – CCAN component CENP-U (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Singh et al., 2021</xref>) and the spindle assembly checkpoint kinase BUB-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Elowe et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Qi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Singh et al., 2021</xref>), both of which directly bind to PLK1 via STP motifs in a Cdk1-dependent manner.</p><p>In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans,</italic> PLK-1 localisation in meiosis and mitosis is similar to other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chase et al., 2000</xref>). In mitosis, roles of PLK-1 include nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Martino et al., 2017</xref>), merge of parental genomes in the embryo through lamina disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rahman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Velez-Aguilera et al., 2020</xref>), centrosome maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cabral et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Decker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ohta et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Woodruff et al., 2015</xref>), and cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gómez-Cavazos et al., 2020</xref>) – indicating that major mitotic roles of PLK-1 are conserved in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. However, meiotic roles of PLK-1 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> oocytes have remained obscure as PLK-1 depletion results in severely defective NEBD and fertilised oocytes with a whole nucleus rather than condensed chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chase et al., 2000</xref>). In the PLK-1-depleted oocytes that ‘escaped’ the NEBD defect, chromosome congression, segregation, and polar body extrusion were severely disrupted. However, it is unclear whether these phenotypes are the indirect effects of the severe early meiotic defects or whether they result from specific functions of PLK-1 throughout meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chase et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, while PLK-1 was shown to localise broadly to chromosomes and the spindle during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chase et al., 2000</xref>), a more precise dynamic characterisation of PLK-1 localisation during meiosis is lacking.</p><p>Here, by temporally inhibiting an analogue-sensitive PLK-1 mutant we show that PLK-1 is involved in spindle assembly and/or stability, chromosome alignment and segregation, and polar body extrusion in <italic>C. elegans</italic> oocytes. Using live imaging and immunofluorescence, we find that PLK-1 localises to the spindle poles, chromosome arms, kinetochores, and midbivalent region between the homologous chromosomes during meiosis I in <italic>C. elegans</italic> oocytes. By a combination of live imaging and in vitro biochemical analysis, we have characterised the primary chromosomal recruitment mechanisms of PLK-1 during meiosis, showing that CENP-C<sup>HCP-4</sup> directly recruits PLK-1 to the chromosome arms while PLK-1 recruitment to the midbivalent and kinetochore is mediated by a direct interaction with BUB-1. Furthermore, BUB-1- and CENP-C-mediated PLK-1 recruitment to chromosomes is essential for meiosis I.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PLK-1 plays roles in spindle assembly and/or stability, chromosome alignment and segregation, and polar body extrusion in meiosis I</title><p>A previous study showed that PLK-1 localises to the meiotic spindle and chromosomes in <italic>C. elegans</italic> oocytes and depletion of PLK-1 using RNAi led to several defects, including defective NEBD, chromosome congression, segregation, and polar body extrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chase et al., 2000</xref>). While this suggested that PLK-1 plays several roles during meiosis, the use of RNAi presents a limitation to addressing them independently. In particular, the strong NEBD defect complicates delineation of the roles of PLK-1 at later stages of meiosis. Therefore, we sought to understand the distinct localisation and roles of PLK-1 during meiosis I.</p><p>To assess PLK-1 localisation during meiosis with high spatial and temporal resolution, we imaged endogenously tagged PLK-1::sfGFP in dissected oocytes. PLK-1 localises to the spindle poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, blue arrows), chromosome arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref>, yellow arrows), and midbivalent region between the homologous chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref>, magenta arrow) during prometaphase I. This localisation pattern was confirmed with immunostaining of fixed oocytes using a specific anti-PLK-1 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

We reasoned that acute PLK-1<sup>as</sup> inhibition for a short period of time would allow us to study the post-NEBD effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We tested a variety of analogues, and all of them led to embryonic lethality of the <italic>plk-1<sup>as</sup></italic> strain without severely affecting a wild type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We decided to continue our experiments with the 3-substituted benzyl PP1 derivative 3IB-PP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). A wild type strain in the presence of 3IB-PP1 and <italic>plk-1<sup>as</sup></italic> in the presence of vehicle control (‘EtOH’) behaved normally during meiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Addition of 10 µM 3IB-PP1 between 5 and 15 min before dissection and imaging of oocytes allowed us to bypass the NEBD defect, and six bivalents were easily identifiable within the newly fertilised oocyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, yellow arrows). Under these conditions PLK-1<sup>as</sup> inhibition led to drastic spindle defects with no observable bipolar spindle formation and no consequent chromosome segregation was observed, indicating that PLK-1 is involved in spindle assembly and/or stability during oocyte meiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We sought to minimise the spindle defects upon PLK-1 inhibition by reducing the concentration of 3IB-PP1 to 1 μM and omitting the pre-treatment step prior to dissection. Under these conditions, ~62% of oocytes had seemingly bipolar spindles and chromosomes remained somewhat associated with the spindle, although chromosome alignment was still affected in 78% of oocytes (≥2 misaligned chromosomes, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>). A more detailed analysis of chromosome dynamics after PLK-1 inhibition is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, where individual chromosomes are followed every 20 s and, as opposed to wild type, chromosomes from PLK-1-inhibited oocytes show a highly dynamic behaviour whereby they seem to briefly align and then become misaligned again (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> and arrows therein). We then used the pole marker ASPM-1 to allow proper characterisation of spindle bipolarity under these conditions and confirmed that even when two ASPM-1 poles are clearly discerned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, blue arrows), chromosome alignment fails (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, yellow arrows). Hence, it appears that PLK-1 participates in chromosome alignment in a manner that is at least partially independent of its roles in overall spindle assembly and/or stability.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>BUB-1 recruits PLK-1 to the midbivalent during oocyte meiosis</title><p>To further understand the role of PLK-1 during meiosis, we sought to identify the PLK-1 recruitment mechanism(s).

Since the interaction between STP motifs and the PBD of PLK-1 requires phosphorylation of the central Ser/Thr residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Elia et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Elia et al., 2003b</xref>), we conducted kinase assays to assess the phosphorylation of BUB-1<sup>190-628</sup>. Cdk1 and PLK-1 can both phosphorylate BUB-1<sup>190-628</sup> and Cdk1 can specifically phosphorylate the STP motif at T527 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, kinase assays conducted with Cdk1 and PLK-1 together produced a prominent shifted band representing phosphorylated protein that was not present with the individual kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

To test this hypothesis, we mutated T527 in the STP motif to alanine (‘BUB-1<sup>190-628</sup>(T527A)’) and assessed the resulting phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

Cdk1-phosphorylated BUB-1 formed a stable complex with MBP-PLK1<sup>PBD</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). SEC coupled with multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) indicated the stoichiometry of this complex is 1:1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). While unphosphorylated BUB-1 showed some interaction with MBP-PLK1<sup>PBD</sup>, this complex eluted from the column at a higher volume and bound to a lower proportion of MBP-PLK1<sup>PBD</sup>, suggestive of a weaker interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Interestingly, the CCAN appears to be largely absent in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maddox et al., 2012</xref>), and kinetochore assembly depends on the CENP-C orthologue, HCP-4 (hereafter CENP-C<sup>HCP-4</sup>) during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Oegema et al., 2001</xref>) and on CENP-C<sup>HCP-4</sup> and the nucleoporin ELYS<sup>MEL-28</sup> during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hattersley et al., 2022</xref>). CENP-C<sup>HCP-4</sup> localises to chromosomes throughout meiosis I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hattersley et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Monen et al., 2005</xref>). Like its mammalian counterpart, CENP-C<sup>HCP-4</sup> is predicted to be mostly disordered and it contains a putative N-terminal STP motif encompassing amino acids 162–164 that is conserved in nematode species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Although CENP-C<sup>HCP-4</sup> depletion does not have a major impact on meiosis I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hattersley et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Monen et al., 2005</xref>), RNAi-mediated depletion of CENP-C<sup>HCP-4</sup> abolished PLK-1 localisation on chromosome arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). PLK-1 is still present in the midbivalent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>, blue arrows), which suggests that BUB-1 and CENP-C<sup>HCP-4</sup> represent independent pathways for PLK-1 targeting. Additionally, CENP-C<sup>HCP-4</sup> depletion revealed a pool of PLK-1 which is kinetochore-associated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>, yellow arrows). To confirm that PLK-1 localises to the kinetochore, we took advantage of the fact that kinetochore proteins in <italic>C. elegans</italic> oocytes are also present in filaments referred to as ‘linear elements’, which are spindle- and cortex-associated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Monen et al., 2005</xref>). PLK-1 perfectly co-localises with KNL-3, part of the Mis12 kinetochore complex in spindle- and cortex-associated linear elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since the above data indicated that CENP-C<sup>HCP-4</sup> is involved in PLK-1 recruitment to chromosome arms, we sought to determine whether this involved a direct interaction via the putative STP motif identified in sequence alignments.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>CENP-C<sup>HCP-4</sup> contains a putative STP motif and is required for chromosomal PLK-1 targeting.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In situ GFP-tagged CENP-C<sup>HCP-4</sup> was followed through meiosis I in live, dissected oocytes.

However, the fact that disruption of both BUB-1 and CENP-C<sup>HCP-4</sup> recruitment pathways enhances the severity of the resulting meiotic defects indicates that the CENP-C<sup>HPC-4</sup> pathway does still play an active part in the roles of PLK-1 during meiosis I.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this article, we describe specific, post-NEBD roles played by PLK-1 during oocyte meiosis. PLK-1 is important for spindle assembly and/or stability, chromosome alignment and segregation, and polar body extrusion during meiosis I. We found that PLK-1 localises to spindle poles and chromosomes during metaphase I before localising to the chromosomes and central spindle in anaphase. Furthermore, we characterised the mechanisms of chromosomal PLK-1 targeting during oocyte meiosis, which rely on the centromere-associated protein CENP-C<sup>HCP-4</sup> and the spindle assembly checkpoint kinase BUB-1. While CENP-C<sup>HCP-4</sup> targets PLK-1 to chromosome arms, BUB-1 directs PLK-1 to the midbivalent and kinetochores. In both cases, interaction with PLK-1 relies on phosphorylated STP motifs within predicted disordered regions. While we have not confirmed that these sites are phosphorylated by Cdk1 in vivo, several lines of evidence indicate this is likely the case: (1) both motifs have Pro at position 3, indicative of potential proline-directed kinase substrates; (2) Cdk1 is the most prominent proline-directed kinase in cell division and known to phosphorylate STP motifs, including that of mammalian BUB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Qi et al., 2006</xref>); (3) both sites were phosphorylated by Cdk1 in vitro; and (4) fluorescence polarisation experiments indicate that phosphorylation of the Thr residues within the STP motifs is essential for the interaction with the PBD, clearly displaying why the alanine mutants have such a drastic effect on PLK-1 localisation in vivo. We found that mutating the STP motif in BUB-1 results primarily in chromosome alignment defects. While disrupting the CENP-C<sup>HCP-4</sup>-mediated localisation of PLK-1 to the chromosome arms does not have a significant phenotypic defect on its own, it does enhance the meiotic defects observed when the BUB-1-dependent kinetochore and midbivalent populations are disrupted. This suggests that while BUB-1 recruitment of PLK-1 may mediate the most important functions of PLK-1 during meiosis I, CENP-C<sup>HCP-4</sup> recruitment of PLK-1 to the chromosome arms also plays an active role in meiosis.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Expanding on the meiotic roles of PLK-1</title><p>By temporally inhibiting an analogue-sensitive PLK-1 mutant during <italic>C. elegans</italic> oocyte meiosis, we have shown that PLK-1 plays a major role in the regulation of the meiotic spindle. At high concentrations of analogue, this resulted in the complete lack of spindle bipolarity, and even at low concentrations the majority of oocytes (62%) imaged lacked an apparent bipolar spindle. While this clearly displays a key role of PLK-1 during meiosis is in the regulation of the meiotic spindle, we cannot distinguish more specific mechanisms using our experimental techniques. As a result, we have characterised the phenotype as a lack of spindle stability throughout this article, but it should be noted that we cannot distinguish whether these effects are on the spindle assembly process itself or on the maintenance of an assembled bipolar spindle. Potential mechanisms of meiotic spindle regulation by PLK-1 include the microtubule depolymerase KLP-7, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> ortholog of the MCAK/Kinesin 13 family. There is some evidence to indicate that PLK-1 may regulate the kinesin 13 microtubule depolymerases in other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ritter et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sanhaji et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sanhaji et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>) and KLP-7 localises to the chromosomes, during meiosis I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Connolly et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Danlasky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gigant et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Han et al., 2015</xref>), which overlaps with PLK-1 localisation. Furthermore, disrupting KLP-7 function prevents proper bipolar spindle assembly and results in microtubules protruding out of the meiotic spindle towards the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Connolly et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gigant et al., 2017</xref>), two phenotypes we also see with PLK-1 inhibition.</p><p>Aside from the large-scale spindle defects observed when PLK-1 is inhibited, chromosome alignment is still disrupted when the structure of the spindle appears bipolar and largely normal. Since the mechanism of chromosome alignment by acentrosomal meiotic spindles is not as well characterised as the centrosomal mitotic equivalent, speculating on the underpinning mechanisms of this phenotype is challenging. However, it should be noted that we cannot exclude the possibility that this phenotype is also a direct result of the dysregulated spindle upon PLK-1 inhibition. Indeed, there is some evidence to suggest that a chromosome-dependent pathway of microtubule formation may be an important aspect of chromosome alignment and segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conway et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Heald et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kiewisz et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Despite these specific hypotheses mentioned above, there will be many different proteins and pathways impacted by PLK-1 phosphorylation throughout meiosis I that will ultimately contribute to the severe defects we observe upon PLK-1 inhibition. While a focussed investigation into specific hypotheses would no doubt yield important results, an unbiased approach to identify the relevant PLK-1 substrates during meiosis would be particularly useful for investigation of the key effects of PLK-1 during meiosis. There are obvious technical challenges to overcome before this can be achieved, not least of which would be isolating a large enough sample of meiotic oocytes to perform robust quantitative proteomics. The work in this article undertaken to identify the mechanisms of PLK-1 targeting during oocyte meiosis I will be instrumental for a later characterisation of the localisation and meiotic stage-specific analysis of PLK-1 substrates.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Comparison with dual recruitment in mammals (CENP-U vs CENP-C)</title><p>During mammalian mitosis, PLK1 is recruited to kinetochores through BUB1 and CENP-U, relying on self-priming in addition to Cdk1-mediated priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Qi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Singh et al., 2021</xref>).

For the CENP-C<sup>HCP-4(1-214)</sup> assays in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and C</xref> 100 μl of assay was loaded onto a 100 μl loop and loaded onto the column with 0.4 ml of SEC buffer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Size-exclusion chromatography multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS)</title><p>An Agilent 1260 Infinity II HPLC system was used to inject 50 μl of protein (ranging from 0.5 to 2.5 mg/ml) onto a Superdex 200 10/300 gel filtration column (Cytiva) coupled to a Wyatt miniDawn multi-angle light scattering system and Wyatt Optilab differential refractive index (dRI) detector. A dn/dc value of 0.185 was used, UV extinction coefficients were calculated from RI and molecular weights were calculated using Zimm plot extrapolation. Astra v8.1 was used for data analysis. The following buffer was used in all experiments: 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Western blot</title><p>In vitro kinase assays were conducted as described above and separated by SDS-PAGE on 4–12% Bis-Tris gels (Thermo) with ~20 ng of protein loaded per well for the α-BUB-1 or α-HCP-4 blots and either 80 ng (BUB-1<sup>190-628</sup>) or 75 ng (CENP-C<sup>HCP-4(1-214)</sup>) loaded per lane for the phosphospecific antibodies. Transfer was conducted for 90 min at 90 V in transfer buffer (25 mM Tris, 200 mM glycine, 20% methanol) before membrane was washed in PBS-T (PBS with 0.1% Tween-20) and blocked with Intercept PBS blocking buffer (LI-COR). Membranes were washed in PBS-T before incubation with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. For the peptide competition blots, peptide or phosphopeptides were added to a final concentration of 1 μM alongside the primary antibodies. The next day, membranes were washed in PBS-T before incubation with LI-COR secondary antibodies (1:25,000) in 5% milk for 1 hr. Membranes were then washed once more in PBS-T before scanning in a LI-COR Odyssey CLx.</p><p>Worm extract western blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>) worms were grown and transferred to RNAi plates as described above. 50 worms per lane were picked and washed with M9 + 0.1% triton (x2) and M9 (x1). LDS buffer was then added to a final concentration of 1×, and samples were heated (70°C, 5 min), sonicated (Diagenode cell disruptor, high power, 10 cycles, 30 s ON/30 s OFF), and heated again (70°C, 10 min) before western blots were conducted following the protocol described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Fluorescence polarisation</title><p>Fluorescence polarisation assays were conducted using FITC-labelled peptides (peptide sequences indicated in figures). For all assays, a 1:2 dilution series of MBP-PLK1<sup>PBD</sup> was conducted in FP buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP) with a constant concentration of 100 nM FITC-labelled peptide. Assays were left for 20–60 min before being centrifuged and 10 μl of each concentration was loaded onto a black 384 well plate (Greiner) in triplicate. Plates were then centrifuged (2k rpm, 2 min) before being analysed in a PheraStar FS (BMG Labtech) under the following conditions: excitation: 485 nm; emission: 520 nm, 25 °C; settling time 0.2 s, 50 flashes per well, gain and focal height automatically adjusted prior to measurement. Mean mP for each triplicate was then used as the value for each independent experiment. Data represent the average of three independent experiments with K<sub>D</sub> values being estimated using GraphPad Prism 9 ‘Nonlinear regression, One Site – Total’ equation. The uncertainty indicated represents the standard deviation of the calculated K<sub>D</sub> from each independent replicate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Phenotype analysis</title><p>We defined misalignment as metaphase defects. Alignment was counted within the five frames (1 min) before anaphase onset, which was the frame prior to the detection of two separating chromosome masses. When one bivalent was misaligned (either in angle or distance to metaphase plate), it was recorded as mild metaphase defect. When two or more bivalents were misaligned, this was considered a severe metaphase defect. The anaphase phenotype was assess during segregation. If lagging chromosome were detected during chromosome segregation but this was resolved before polar body extrusion, it was scored as mild anaphase defect. If we could not detect two segregating masses of chromosomes or if these masses differed in size/intensity, it was quantified as a severe anaphase defect. Polar body defect was recorded when no polar body was extruded or if all of the maternal DNA content was extruded as a polar body, with no maternal DNA remaining in the cytoplasm. Graphs were prepared using GraphPad Prism 9.0.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Reviewing editor, <italic>eLife</italic></p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Resources, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>List of <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains used in this study.</title><p>The table details the fluorescent markers and/or mutations, strain name, genotype, and source.</p></caption><media xlink:href="elife-84057-supp1-v2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-84057-mdarchecklist1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>A supporting file containing all the information for the graphs presented in the manuscript has been added.</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Arshad Desai for sharing strains and antibodies and for helpful discussions and sharing results prior to publication; Pierre Gönczy for the PLK-1 antibody; Lionel Pintard for providing PLK-1 for the initial experiments and the plasmid for expression and purification; Bruce Bowerman for the GFP::ASPM-1 strain; Satpal Virdee for advice on fluorescence polarisation experiments, and Vincent Postis for guidance with the SEC-MALS experiments.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please generate and characterise a double hcp-4T163 bub-1527A mutant, as suggested by reviewers 2 and 3. The localization of a few RC/chromosomal proteins should be analysed in this mutant, to determine if they are delocalized (this analysis can be limited to a representative subset of proteins, for example KLP-19 and MCAK). If you find that other proteins are delocalized in this mutant (in addition to PLK-1), this should be discussed in the interpretation of the phenotypes.</p><p>2) Please report the number of samples and number of experiments for each figure.</p><p>3) Please perform the control experiment of treating wild type oocytes with 10uM 3-IB-PP1.</p><p>4) All the other reviewers' comments can be addressed by revising the text.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– For some of the figures, the images are very small – it would be helpful for the reader if the panels were resized/reconfigured to maximize the images sizes. For example, in Figure 1, the diagram of the bivalent (Figure 1A) is quite large, but the images in panel 1G are so small that they are hard to see, even when I increase the size of the figure on my screen. (Similar issues are in some of the other figures, e.g. Figure 3D, 6B, 6E). I recommend revisiting some of the figures with this comment in mind, minimizing white space in the figure and re-organizing the panels to maximize image size.</p><p>– Figure 1B: it is hard to see the midbivalent localization in the live images (the regions magenta arrows are pointing at) – showing zooms of this region would make this clearer (similar to what is shown for the fixed images in Figure 1D).</p><p>– Figure 1F: if these are stills from live imaging, timestamps should be added.</p><p>– Figure 1H: it would be helpful to label on this panel somewhere what concentration of inhibitor was used.</p><p>– Figure 1I: It would be helpful to add a label to the figure denoting how long the oocytes were treated with 3IB-PP1 (I couldn't find this information in the figure legend either). Also, the legend states that early metaphase spindles were chosen for each condition, but since the spindle is disrupted at the 10uM concentration, it is not clear how it would be possible to stage this spindle (so it should not be called early metaphase).</p><p>– Figure 2A/2B: the midbivalent localization is not clear – PLK-1 looks diffuse all over the chromosome, not specifically localized to the midbivalent. The imaging in Figure 3A (for a different experiment) is clearer – could the images in Figure 2A/2B be similarly improved to make the data more convincing?</p><p>– Figure 2C: the domain diagram is very helpful. It might be nice to also mark on this diagram the region expressed in the in vitro analysis (190-628) so the reader can easily see which domains this represents.</p><p>– In describing the analysis shown in Figure 2 —figure supplement 1, it would be helpful to explain to the reader that CDK-1 and PLK-1 can both phosphorylate BUB-1 even when T527 is mutated to alanine. This is in the figure, but never mentioned – I think it might help the reader understand the data better if you make it clear that these kinases can phosphorylate BUB-1 on other sites (not just T527), so they are not confused by the ProQ band in these lanes (and in Figure 2E).</p><p>– Figure 2F, 2G: what is the dashed line on the gels? Does it represent a specific fraction or elution volume, or is it just there as a comparison between gels? Explain this in figure legend for clarity.</p><p>– Figure 3C: the top row is labeled PLK-1 but I think it is supposed to be BUB-1.</p><p>– Throughout the manuscript, sometimes PLK-1 is denoted with a dash (PLK-1) and sometimes without (PLK1). This was particularly prominent in the sections describing the in vitro data (in the results and the figures; for example compare the labeling in Figure 5B and 5C to Figure 5 —figure supplement 1). This notation should be standardized throughout the paper and figures (a dash should always be used when describing <italic>C. elegans</italic> PLK-1).</p><p>– Figure 5G: the top row is labeled PLK-1 but I think it is supposed to be BUB-1.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Phenotypic analysis of the double hcp-4T163 bub-1527A mutant oocytes would be interesting to look at, as this genotype should &quot;surgically&quot; prevent PLK-1 recruitment without the need to entirely deplete BUB-1 and HCP-4 functions which might well have other roles beyond promoting PLK-1 recruitment, particularly BUB-1.</p><p>2) In the introduction page 3 line 51, please mention that PLK1 also localizes to the nuclear envelope in prophase (Linder et al. Dev Cell 2017).</p><p>3) Page 8 lane 138, I do not see any evidence indicating that 3IB-PP1 is more specific. While Figure 1-Figure S2 shows it is more potent, the evidence in the figure does not really address its specificity. Furthermore, for this figure the authors should indicate the number of embryos analyzed. It is not clear based on the figure and the figure legends.</p><p>4) The authors should explain how the graphs presented in Figure 3E, 6E have been generated. How many oocytes were analyzed? How many different experiments?</p><p>5) Several figures are lacking scale bars. (Figure 1D, 1G, 3A, 3C).</p><p>6) Molecular weight markers (MW) are missing on all the figures showing SDS-PAGE.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>My comment on the manuscript is that I was not able to find any number (how many samples were analyzed each experiment, how many times the experiments were performed).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84057.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please generate and characterise a double hcp-4T163 bub-1527A mutant, as suggested by reviewers 2 and 3.

To achieve this, we used an RNAi/rescue approach, whereby we depleted endogenous BUB-1 with RNAi and expressed RNAi-resistant wild type or T527A BUB-1 transgenes. The new Figure 9 now shows that:</p><p>1) wild type but not T527A BUB-1 rescues PLK-1 localisation. In the wild type <italic>hcp-4</italic> background this is observed in the midbivalent PLK-1. In the <italic>hcp-4<sup>T163A</sup></italic> background, BUB-1 is sufficient to drive kinetochore (see below for more discussion on kinetochore localisation) and midbivalent PLK-1 localisation.

We are following on this work to understand what proteins are regulated by PLK-1 in different chromosome domains and how this relates to the observed phenotypes. For this paper, a single Thr residue within an STP motif in a largely disordered region is far more specific than depleting HCP-4 or BUB-1, making it likely that these effects are mediated through PLK-1 targeting.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please report the number of samples and number of experiments for each figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included all the relevant information about number of independent experiments and sample size.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please perform the control experiment of treating wild type oocytes with 10uM 3-IB-PP1.</p></disp-quote><p>This control has now been included in Figure 1—figure supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) All the other reviewers' comments can be addressed by revising the text.</p></disp-quote><p>All comments have been addressed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– For some of the figures, the images are very small – it would be helpful for the reader if the panels were resized/reconfigured to maximize the images sizes.

This is in the figure, but never mentioned – I think it might help the reader understand the data better if you make it clear that these kinases can phosphorylate BUB-1 on other sites (not just T527), so they are not confused by the ProQ band in these lanes (and in Figure 2E).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now adapted the wording and added western blots with phospho-specific antibodies for the two STP motifs (phT527 BUB-1 and phT163 HCP-4) which makes this distinction clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 2F, 2G: what is the dashed line on the gels? Does it represent a specific fraction or elution volume, or is it just there as a comparison between gels? Explain this in figure legend for clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this comment – the dashed lines were previously included to aid comparison of the different gels within each experiment. On reflection, this does not make analysis of the result any clearer, so we have removed them from all gels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 3C: the top row is labeled PLK-1 but I think it is supposed to be BUB-1.</p></disp-quote><p>This has now been corrected. Thanks for pointing this out.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Throughout the manuscript, sometimes PLK-1 is denoted with a dash (PLK-1) and sometimes without (PLK1). This was particularly prominent in the sections describing the in vitro data (in the results and the figures; for example compare the labeling in Figure 5B and 5C to Figure 5 —figure supplement 1). This notation should be standardized throughout the paper and figures (a dash should always be used when describing <italic>C. elegans</italic> PLK-1).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comment. We have adapted the text so PLK1 is used for the information that specifically comes from mammalian systems while PLK-1 is used when discussing the protein in general and when specifically referring to the <italic>C. elegans</italic> protein.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 5G: the top row is labeled PLK-1 but I think it is supposed to be BUB-1.</p></disp-quote><p>This has now been corrected. Thanks for pointing this out.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) Phenotypic analysis of the double hcp-4T163 bub-1527A mutant oocytes would be interesting to look at, as this genotype should &quot;surgically&quot; prevent PLK-1 recruitment without the need to entirely deplete BUB-1 and HCP-4 functions which might well have other roles beyond promoting PLK-1 recruitment, particularly BUB-1.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed these experiments, which are now presented in Figure 9.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In the introduction page 3 line 51, please mention that PLK1 also localizes to the nuclear envelope in prophase (Linder et al.

While Figure 1-Figure S2 shows it is more potent, the evidence in the figure does not really address its specificity. Furthermore, for this figure the authors should indicate the number of embryos analysed. It is not clear based on the figure and the figure legends.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this comment, the text was not phrased well and has been adapted accordingly. The number of embryos analysed for viability assays is now stated in the ‘Methods’ section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors should explain how the graphs presented in Figure 3E, 6E have been generated. How many oocytes were analyzed? How many different experiments?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included in the Results section a more thorough explanation of how we generated these graphs (which was only present in the Methods in the previous version).
