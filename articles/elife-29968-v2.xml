ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> level is in part monitored by the store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (SOCE) system, an adaptive mechanism that senses ER luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations through the STIM proteins and facilitates import of the ion from the extracellular space. Here, we show that hepatocytes from obese mice displayed significantly diminished SOCE as a result of impaired STIM1 translocation, which was associated with aberrant STIM1 O-GlycNAcylation. Primary hepatocytes deficient in STIM1 exhibited elevated cellular stress as well as impaired insulin action, increased glucose production and lipid droplet accumulation. Additionally, mice with acute liver deletion of STIM1 displayed systemic glucose intolerance. Conversely, over-expression of STIM1 in obese mice led to increased SOCE, which was sufficient to improve systemic glucose tolerance. These findings demonstrate that SOCE is an important mechanism for healthy hepatic Ca<sup>2+</sup> balance and systemic metabolic control.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29968.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Obesity is a chronic metabolic disorder. Some people’s genetics make them more vulnerable to the condition, and it is generally caused by eating too much and moving too little. The resulting surplus of nutrients affects the cells and organs of the body in several adverse ways. For example, excessive nutrients impair a compartment within cells called the endoplasmic reticulum. This compartment is where many proteins and fats are made and transported. It is also the site for a lot of metabolic processes, and the main place in the cell where calcium ions are stored. Many proteins need calcium ions to work properly, including metabolic enzymes. In obesity, the endoplasmic reticulum becomes less able to store calcium ions.</p><p>A protein called STIM1 senses and regulates the levels of calcium ions in the endoplasmic reticulum. When calcium levels drop, STIM1 moves along the endoplasmic reticulum membrane towards the part that is next to the cell surface. Here, STIM1 joins up with a calcium channel called Orai1. The STIM1-Orai1 complex allows calcium ions to enter the cell and replenish its levels in the endoplasmic reticulum.</p><p>Arruda, Pers et al. have now asked if STIM1 is altered in obesity and, if so, whether it contributes to the endoplasmic reticulum’s inability to maintain proper calcium levels. High-resolution microscopy and biochemical techniques confirmed that STIM1 is indeed compromised in liver cells from obese mice. In these cells, STIM1 was found in unusual small clusters. It also could not move along the endoplasmic reticulum membrane when calcium levels dropped. As a result of these navigational errors, STIM1 failed to couple with Orai1, meaning less calcium could enter the cell. Further work identified that a small sugar molecule that is added onto STIM1 in obesity is behind its reduced ability to move accurately.</p><p>Arruda, Pers et al. next created mice that lacked STIM1 in their liver. These mice showed signs of metabolic abnormalities. Notably, when STIM1 levels were experimentally increased in obese mice, it restored calcium levels in the endoplasmic reticulum closer to normal, and improved metabolism too.</p><p>Thus, regulating calcium levels in the endoplasmic reticulum via proteins such as STIM1 is essential for maintaining a healthy metabolism. Interventions to correct calcium levels may have therapeutic promise to combat metabolic diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>endoplasmic reticulum</kwd><kwd>calcium</kwd><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>insulin resistance</kwd><kwd>SOCE</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK52539</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hotamisligil</surname><given-names>Gökhan S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000875</institution-id><institution>Pew Charitable Trusts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arruda</surname><given-names>Ana Paula</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007469</institution-id><institution>Alfred Benzon Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pers</surname><given-names>Benedicte Mengel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003554</institution-id><institution>Lundbeckfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pers</surname><given-names>Benedicte Mengel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Store operated calcium entry is defective in hepatocytes of obese mice, and restoring this process is sufficient to improve glucose metabolism.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a key cellular organelle coordinating a variety of essential processes such as protein synthesis and secretion, lipid biosynthesis, glucose metabolism and redox reactions. Additionally, ER is the main site of Ca<sup>2+</sup> storage in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gardner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hotamisligil, 2010</xref>). Structurally, ER comprises a complex network of membranes spread throughout the cytoplasm, which establishes physical and functional contacts with many other organelles including mitochondria, endosomes, lipid droplets and the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lynes and Simmen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Phillips and Voeltz, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Given its critical role in the cell, the functionality of the ER is tightly monitored by proteins that can communicate stress signals to other proteins or compartments of the cell in order to restore ER function. The most well-known adaptive pathway in the ER is the unfolded protein response (UPR), which has the general goal of restoring ER function by enhancing ER folding capacity, decreasing protein translation and increasing protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gardner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hetz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hotamisligil, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang and Kaufman, 2016</xref>). Over the past decade it has been widely documented that chronic stress imposed by excess nutrients and energy leads to ER dysfunction and UPR activation in a variety of metabolic tissues in both mouse models and obese humans, which is associated with cellular stress, inflammation, and metabolic dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boden et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gregor et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hotamisligil, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nakatani et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ozcan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sharma et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang and Kaufman, 2016</xref>). Alleviation of ER stress by chemical or molecular chaperones dramatically improves metabolic control and insulin sensitivity and reduces inflammation in mouse models of obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kammoun et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ozawa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ozcan et al., 2006</xref>) as well as in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kars et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xiao et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>More recently, it has become clear that Ca<sup>2+</sup> storage in the ER is compromised in the setting of obesity and other metabolic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arruda and Hotamisligil, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ozcan and Tabas, 2016</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the ER is essential for chaperone-mediated protein folding and secretion, as well as for the function of metabolic enzymes. Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in the ER is tightly regulated by coordinated action between SERCA, which pumps Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the cytosol into the ER lumen, and the IP<sub>3</sub> receptor (IP3R) or Ryanodine receptor, which release Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ER into the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clapham, 2007</xref>). In obesity, hepatic SERCA activity is compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meikle and Summers, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rong et al., 2013</xref>) while the activity of the IP3R1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel is increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arruda et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feriod et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). These alterations result in decreased ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> content, loss of folding capacity, ER stress, inflammation, impaired insulin action and abnormal glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arruda and Hotamisligil, 2015</xref>). Additionally, in this setting a ‘leaky’ ER contributes to both higher cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake, which has important implications for cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and mitochondrial dysfunction seen in metabolic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arruda et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feriod et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ozcan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xiao et al., 2011</xref>). Accordingly, strategies to restore hepatic ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, such as overexpression of SERCA or suppression of IP3R, improve ER function and promote metabolic homeostasis in mouse models of obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arruda et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feriod et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). In a similar fashion, administration of compounds that increase ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> content and improve ER function, e.g. SERCA agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kang et al., 2016</xref>), IP3R antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ozcan et al., 2012</xref>), or azoromide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fu et al., 2015</xref>), improves metabolic health in obese mice.</p><p>In addition to SERCA and IP3Rs, Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in the ER is sensed and regulated by a third major adaptive/homeostatic system orchestrated by the STIM-Orai complex. STIM proteins (STIM1 and STIM2) are found in the ER and sense luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> through N-terminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding EF hand domain. In the resting state, STIM proteins are bound to Ca<sup>2+</sup> and spread evenly throughout the ER membrane. Upon ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, STIM forms oligomers (seen in confocal microscopy as puncta), which translocate to junctions between ER and plasma membrane (PM), where they couple with the PM channel protein Orai1. This coupling results in the import of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the extracellular compartment to the cytosol, providing spatial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals that then influence cellular signaling and promote Ca<sup>2+</sup> replenishment into the ER lumen through SERCA, in the process known as store operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry or SOCE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Feske, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Prakriya and Lewis, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Soboloff et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wu et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Given that obesity leads to impaired ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling and this is a key mechanism associated with ER dysfunction in the obese condition, we examined whether alterations in SOCE system exist and contribute to the inability of ER to restore and or maintain Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. Here we show that STIM1 is modified and SOCE is defective in hepatocytes from obese mice due to the inability of STIM1 to translocate and couple with Orai1 at the PM. Hepatocytes lacking STIM1 displayed stress, increased glucose production and insulin resistance, whereas over-expression of STIM1 in the liver of obese mice significantly improved glucose intolerance. These findings support a critical role for STIM1-mediated SOCE in the maintenance of healthy Ca<sup>2+</sup> balance in the ER, insulin action, and systemic glucose metabolism.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In order to determine the impact of obesity on SOCE in the liver, we isolated primary hepatocytes from lean wild-type (WT) and genetically obese (<italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic>) mice and measured Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through STIM/Orai1 using the ratiometric calcium dye, Fura-2AM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Poenie and Tsien, 1986</xref>). First, the cells were incubated in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free medium, and ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> store depletion was induced by the addition of the SERCA inhibitor thapsigargin (Tg). In agreement with earlier reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arruda et al., 2014</xref>) the initial rise in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> induced by Tg, which reflects the ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> content, was significantly lower in hepatocytes isolated from obese animals compared with WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Next, we induced SOCE through STIM/Orai1 by substituting the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free media with a media containing 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>. As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in primary hepatocytes from obese mice was markedly reduced relative to control cells. To further confirm that the observed Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry was mediated by SOCE, we added the SOCE inhibitor 2-apb, which completely blocked Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in both genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, dotted lines). This finding is consistent with a report of impaired SOCE in the steatotic hepatocytes from Zucker rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wilson et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29968.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Obesity leads to decreased SOCE and impaired STIM1 translocation in primary hepatocytes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left panel: representative Fura-2AM based cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> measurements in primary hepatocytes isolated from wild type (WT) and leptin-deficient (<italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic>) obese mice.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, we did not detect differences in expression of Orai1 in the livers of mice with genetic or high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. Despite a modest increase in the mRNA levels of stim1 and stim2, protein levels of STIM1, STIM2 and Orai1 remained unchanged in the livers of mice with both genetic and diet induced obesity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, phospho-JNK (pJNK), a marker of inflammatory stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hirosumi et al., 2002</xref>) and phospho-Calmodulin kinase (pCaMKII), a marker of elevated cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ozcan et al., 2012</xref>), were increased in the livers of obese animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus decreased Ca<sup>2+</sup> import through SOCE in hepatocytes derived from obese mice appears to be independent of the expression levels of critical SOCE components.</p><p>We therefore asked whether the decreased Ca<sup>2+</sup> import through SOCE in hepatocytes from obese mice was a result of a functional alteration in STIM1 translocation in the ER membrane. To evaluate the activity of STIM1 proteins in obesity, we first validated antibodies for endogenous immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Next, we isolated primary hepatocytes from lean and obese mice, induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> store depletion with Tg and determined STIM1 localization by immunostaining. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>, while STIM1 was evenly distributed in the ER membrane of resting cells, Tg treatment led to a dramatic translocation to areas of the ER membrane in close proximity with the PM. This effect was observed within 5–10 min of Tg treatment and persisted for 30 min. However, in cells from obese (<italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic>) mice, STIM1 distribution at baseline was punctate throughout the entire ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), and its translocation to areas of ER/PM junction in response to Tg was dramatically impaired. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>, in WT cells, Tg treatment increased the number of high-intensity pixels, indicating the formation of the punctate structures, which represent oligomerization of STIM proteins. In contrast, hepatocytes derived from obese mice displayed higher intensity pixel counts at baseline with no further increase following Tg treatment. Defective STIM1 translocation in hepatocytes from obese animals is also illustrated in the line graphs showing the representative intensity profile of individual cells before and after Tg treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> and also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref> for image analysis details). In WT cells, Tg treatment increased the signal intensity at the edge of the cell and decreased it in the cytosol, quantified as the STIM1 ratio between these compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). In hepatocytes from obese mice, the average signal intensity at baseline was higher than in WT cells, and did not change significantly in response to Tg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), indicating that STIM1 translocation is markedly defective in these cells.</p><p>To examine STIM1 translocation after Tg stimulation in more detail and using an alternative analytical tool, we performed total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, in which fluorophores in the vicinity of the cell surface are selectively excited. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, in WT cells Tg treatment induced STIM1 puncta formation and accumulation in areas close to the PM. This response was diminished in cells derived from obese animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). In these experiments, Na<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup> ATPase was used as a constitutive marker of PM and its staining pattern did not change in the presence of Tg.</p><p>We also evaluated the time course of the defect in STIM1 trafficking during the development of obesity in mice. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>, after 3 and 5 weeks of HFD, STIM1 showed some degree of translocation towards the plasma membrane in resting cells, indicating that short term HFD exposure is sufficient to trigger ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, the driving force for STIM1 translocation. Additionally, at 3 weeks HFD, STIM1 translocation stimulated by Tg was not significantly impaired compared with cells derived from chow fed animals. However, the defect in STIM1 translocation induced by Tg was apparent in cells isolated from mice fed a HFD for 5 weeks and was more pronounced after 7 and 11 weeks of HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). These data support that defective STIM1 translocation may be a common feature of obesity in independent experimental models (<italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> and HFD) and that this phenotype occurs independent of blood glucose levels and prior to the emergence of marked hyper-insulinemia and insulin resistance found in obesity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p><p>Next, we examined the activation and translocation of STIM2 in cells from lean (WT) and obese (<italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic>) mice. The role of STIM2 in the regulation of SOCE has been explored only recently, and its activation seems to result from smaller fluctuations in Ca<sup>2+</sup> due to its lower affinity for the ion, while STIM1 is activated when the extent of ER depletion increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berna-Erro et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oh-Hora et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Prakriya and Lewis, 2015</xref>). In hepatocytes, STIM2 is expressed at a lower level than STIM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">López et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Williams et al., 2001</xref>), however it was detectable both by staining and by western blot analysis. We did not observe aberrant STIM2 puncta formation in cells from <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> mice but a tendency for translocation at baseline. Upon Tg-induced store depletion, we observed a marked STIM2 translocation to areas close to the PM in both WT cells and <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> cells, however the degree of translocation in <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> cells was less pronounced than in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Thus, the obesity-related defect in STIM2 translocation was present but less dramatic than that observed for STIM1. Overall, these findings suggest that defective SOCE in primary hepatocytes from obese mice is predominantly related to aberrant STIM1 puncta formation and inefficient STIM1 re-localization from the bulk ER membrane to ER/PM junction areas after ER Ca2+ store depletion.</p><p>In order to gain insight into mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, we considered the possibility that altered STIM1 post-translational modification could be involved in its defective translocation capacity in the context of obesity. Two known post-translational modifications of STIM1 which influence its trafficking are phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pozo-Guisado et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhu-Mauldin et al., 2012</xref>). Phosphorylation of STIM1 at Ser621 and Ser575 regulate its interaction with the microtubule plus-end-tracking protein EB1, enabling STIM1 to move in the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pozo-Guisado et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, we asked whether a reduction in STIM1 phosphorylation at these sites may explain its defective trafficking in obesity. Surprisingly however, we found that phosphorylation of STIM1 at Ser621 and Ser575 was actually increased in liver lysates from obese mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This indicates that lack of phosphorylation at these residues does not underlie the defective translocation of STIM1, and suggests that hepatic STIM1 may be released from EB1 in the basal state, potentially as a response to the decreased ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> level observed in hepatocytes from obese mice.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29968.011</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Post-translational modification of STIM1 by phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation in obesity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunoblot analysis of the phosphorylation level of STIM1 at Ser575 and Ser621 and of ERK phosphorylation in total liver lysates from WT and <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> animals (<bold>B</bold>) Immunoblot analysis of O-GlcNAcylation of total lysates extracted from primary hepatocytes derived from WT and <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> animals in the presence or absence of overnight treatment with 10 µM of PugNac, an inhibitor of O-GlcNAcase.

Previous work has shown that STIM1 O-GlcNAcylation impairs the ability of the protein to move in the ER membrane and to form punctate structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhu-Mauldin et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, conditions of nutrient and substrate excess, including obesity, lead to increase in cellular O-GlcNAcylation levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vosseller et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang and Qian, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dentin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2008</xref>). These studies indicate the possibility that metabolic stress may interfere with SOCE via O-GlcNAcylation of STIM1, which disrupts its proper trafficking. To test this hypothesis, we first examined global O-GlcNAcylation in primary hepatocytes from WT and obese mice. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, and in agreement with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baldini et al., 2016</xref>), global O-GlcNAcylation was higher in hepatocytes derived from obese animals compared with their controls. This effect was amplified by treatment with PugNac, a specific inhibitor of O-GlycNAcase (OGA), the enzyme that catalyzes removal of OglcNAc sugars from proteins. Next, we performed immunoprecipitation of O-GlcNAc-modified proteins using an OglcNAc-specific antibody from hepatocyte lysates. We found that STIM1 was present among the OglcNAcylated proteins and it was more abundant in cells from obese mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). As a complementary approach, we utilized biotinylated-succinylated wheat germ agglutinin (succinylated-WGA), a lectin that preferentially binds <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine versus other sugars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baldini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hu et al., 2010</xref>). Following precipitation with streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads, STIM1 was detected in the pool of proteins modified by O-GlcNac at higher levels in samples derived from obese animals relative to WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Additionally, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, OGT precipitates with STIM1 in hepatocytes derived from obese animals, indicating that OGT and STIM1 exist in a complex in obesity, consistent with higher levels of O-GlcNac-modified STIM1 in this condition. To explore whether STIM1 is also modulated by OglcNAcylation in the HFD context and study the time course of this modification, we isolated hepatocytes from animals fed a HFD for 3, 5 and 11 wks and pull down STIM1 using succinylated-WGA. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, STIM1 was progressively modified by O-GlcNac in this context starting at 3 weeks on HFD.</p><p>In order to test if O-GlcNAc modification may alter STIM1 function in hepatocytes, we first overexpressed OGT in Hepa1-6 cells. As expected, overexpression of OGT strongly increased global protein modification with O-GlcNac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We then co-expressed OGT and STIM1 tagged with a Flag peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>) to determine whether STIM1 can be directly O-GlcNacylated by OGT in this system. Immunoprecipitation of STIM1-Flag with a Flag specific antibody demonstrated its enhanced O-GlcNAc modification in OGT overexpressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Additionally, STIM1 is able to directly bind to OGT in this cell model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), similar to what we observed in hepatocytes derived from obese animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Having established this cellular system with enhanced STIM1 O-GlcNacylation, we then assessed its translocation in cells transfected with OGT labeled with RFP, using un-transfected cells in the same culture plate as internal controls for quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). These experiments showed that STIM1 puncta formation and translocation following Tg treatment was markedly impaired in cells overexpressing OGT compared with control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,H and I</xref>). Additionally, overexpression of OGT led to a significant impairment in SOCE compared with the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>), with no significant differences in the response to Tg (data not shown).</p><p>Next, to determine whether inhibition of the O-GlcNac modification could rescue STIM1 translocation defect in <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> cells, we used adenoviral gene delivery to express an shRNA targeting OGT to down-regulate OGT and thus the O-GlcNacylation capacity of the cell. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K and L</xref>, the expression of OGT shRNA lead to a 60% decrease in its expression and activity. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M and N</xref>, down-regulation of OGT resulted in increased STIM1 translocation capacity compared with cells expressing a scrambled shRNA. Taken together these data indicate that increased modification of STIM1 by OglcNAc could, at least in part, underlie defective STIM1 translocation and reduced hepatic SOCE in the context of obesity.</p><p>We then started to investigate the impact of defective STIM1-mediated SOCE on ER homeostasis, cellular stress responses and metabolic regulation in STIM1-deficient hepatocyte cell models. These included primary hepatocytes derived from mice with genetic STIM1 deficiency specifically in the liver (stim1<italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> Alb;Cre</italic>, identified here as stim1Δ<sup>LIVER</sup>) and Hepa1-6 cells stably expressing shRNAs targeting stim1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) or stim2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>) (identified here as shSTIM1 and shSTIM2 respectively). Primary hepatocytes derived from stim1Δ<sup>LIVER</sup> mice displayed lower ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> content and absence of Tg-triggered SOCE compared to controls (stim1<italic><sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Similarly, Hepa 1–6 cells in which STIM1 expression was down regulated showed markedly blunted SOCE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Imbalances in ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> content trigger cellular stress responses through various pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arruda and Hotamisligil, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ozcan and Tabas, 2016</xref>). In order to examine these responses in our cellular models of STIM deficiency, we measured phosphorylation of JNK as a benchmark measure of cellular stress and inflammatory activation, and phosphorylation of eIF2α as a marker of UPR activation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, in stim1<italic><sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> control cells, treatment with Tg induced phosphorylation of JNK and eIF2α at 30 min followed by a decrease in phosphorylation levels back to baseline after 90 min. However, in STIM1-deficient cells, the phosphorylation of JNK and eIF2α was enhanced at baseline and these cells displayed a stronger and more persistent response to Tg, with stress markers only returning to basal levels at 120 min. A similar profile was observed in Hepa1-6 cells with shRNA-mediated suppression of STIM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Interestingly, suppression of STIM2 alone did not alter the cellular response to Tg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Altogether, these data demonstrate that absence of core components of SOCE leads to elevated and prolonged stress responses in hepatocytes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29968.013</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>STIM1 deficiency leads to increased cellular stress, insulin resistance and lipid droplet accumulation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left panel: representative Fura-2AM-based cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> measurements in primary hepatocytes isolated from stim1<italic><sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and stim1Δ<sup>LIVER</sup> mice.

Accordingly, we found that primary hepatocytes derived from stim1Δ<sup>LIVER</sup> mice displayed impaired phosphorylation of IRβ and AKT in response to insulin relative to cells from stim1<italic><sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Likewise, gene silencing of stim1 in Hepa1-6 cells resulted in decreased insulin signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Additionally, primary hepatocytes isolated from stim1Δ<sup>LIVER</sup> mice maintained on HFD showed higher levels of glucose production stimulated by the gluconeogenesis substrates glycerol, pyruvate and glutamine compared to stim1<italic><sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> derived hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In agreement with our finding that STIM2 suppression does not amplify stress responses, we found that STIM2-deficient cells retained normal insulin responsiveness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>).</p><p>Recently, it has been shown that SOCE may regulate lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maus et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wilson et al., 2015</xref>) and animals with inducible STIM1/2 whole body deficiency exhibit increased lipid accumulation in multiple tissues such as skeletal muscle, heart and liver, as a consequence of impaired lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maus et al., 2017</xref>). We observed that primary hepatocytes isolated from stim1Δ<sup>LIVER</sup> mice showed modestly increased accumulation of lipid droplets at baseline and after incubation with 1 mM oleic acid and 40 µM of palmitic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). These results suggest that in addition to higher stress levels, insulin resistance and increased glucose production, SOCE deficiency may result in abnormal lipid metabolism.</p><p>We next assessed the systemic metabolic impact of STIM1 deficiency in hepatocytes in vivo in the stim1Δ<sup>LIVER</sup> mice described above. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>, liver lysates from stim1Δ<sup>LIVER</sup> mice displayed marked reduction in STIM1 and a mild increase in STIM2 protein. On a chow diet, stim1Δ<sup>LIVER</sup> mice gained weight equivalently to stim1<italic><sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>) and did not exhibit alterations in glucose tolerance and triglyceride content (Tg) (data not shown). In the HFD-fed mice, the weight gain was similar between genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Interestingly, at 6 weeks on a HFD, we observed a mild, but significant, glucose intolerance in the stim1Δ<sup>LIVER</sup> animals compared with the stim1<italic><sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Additionally, at this time point, insulin sensitivity was impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>). No significant differences were observed in Tg content between the two genotypes, although a tendency to higher Tg levels was detected in stim1Δ<sup>LIVER</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E</xref>). In long term HFD (20 weeks), the differences in glucose intolerance, insulin signaling and Tg content between stim1<italic><sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and stim1Δ<sup>LIVER</sup> groups were very mild and did not reach statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2F,G and H</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, although we haven’t observed overall changes in lipid accumulation in the liver specific STIM1 deficient animals, we have noticed that these animals showed higher content of microvesicular steatosis compared with controls where the majority of the lipid droplets are presented as large droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2I</xref>).</p><p>In light of the mild in vivo metabolic phenotype of constitutive hepatocyte-specific STIM1 deletion during development, we considered that STIM2 upregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) or alternative systems could compensate for the lack of STIM1 all throughout the embryonic life. Therefore, we examined the effect of acute deletion of STIM1 in hepatocytes, using adenovirus mediated gene delivery to express albumin-Cre recombinase (<italic>Alb;Cre</italic>) in adult stim1<sup>+/+</sup> and stim1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice. After weaning, littermate animals were subjected to HFD for 4 weeks (for a short-term stress induction) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Adenoviral delivery of <italic>Alb;Cre</italic> recombinase resulted in ~60% deletion of hepatic STIM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Importantly, there was no compensatory upregulation of STIM2 or Orai1 in this setting. Indeed, one week after adenovirus administration, the acute deletion of STIM1 resulted in significantly higher fasting glucose levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>) without any difference in insulin levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>) and body weight (data not shown). Interestingly, following STIM1 deletion, mice also exhibited significantly impaired glucose tolerance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). In summary, acute SOCE dysfunction in the liver results in amplified cellular stress and glucose intolerance in mice fed a HFD.</p><p>Based on these observations, and the marked SOCE defect associated with obesity we hypothesized that recovery of SOCE function in the livers of obese mice could improve metabolic homeostasis in obesity.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, in control <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> cells expressing GFP, STIM1 formed puncta at baseline and Tg-induced translocation of the protein was impaired, as we previously observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Delivery of STIM1-YFP lead to a significant increase in the protein level in liver cells. Interestingly, in non treated cells, we observed that some degree of the STIM1 protein was already localized in areas of close contact with the plasma membrane even prior to stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Additionally, exogenously expressed STIM1 was able to translocate towards the plasma membrane after Tg treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). To examine STIM1 translocation in <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> hepatocytes with higher resolution, we also performed TEM in cells expressing exogenous STIM1 fused with HRP. STIM1-HRP-expressing cells were fixed and treated with diaminobenzidine (DAB) in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. HRP catalyzes the polymerization and deposition of DAB, which recruits electron-dense osmium, providing contrast and revealing the localization of STIM1. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, exogenous delivery of STIM1-HRP resulted in rescue of translocation in cells from obese animals in a manner similar to that observed in lean, wild type cells. Taken together, these data indicate that exogenously increasing the amount of STIM1 protein is sufficient to partially overcome the STIM1 translocation defect in cells from obese mice.</p><p>The ability of STIM1-YFP overexpression to overcome, at least in part, the translocation defect of endogenous STIM1 in <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> cells suggests that at least some proportion of STIM1 in this setting may escape the O-GlycNac modification. To examine the degree of O-GlcNacylation of overexpressed STIM1-YFP in <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> cells, we used an O-GlcNac specific antibody to immunoprecipitate all proteins modified by O-GlycNacylation in GFP or STIM1 YFP overexpressing cells and examined STIM1 protein by immunoblotting. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, STIM1-YFP overexpression resulted in an ~20 fold increase in the expression of STIM1 protein. However, the amount of O-GlcNac modified STIM1 did not increase proportionally, indicating that in fact a significant amount of the overexpressed STIM1 escapes this post translation modification.</p><p>Additionally, it has been previously shown that overexpression of STIM1 in HeLa cells leads to morphological changes in the ER with an increased cortical ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Orci et al., 2009</xref>). In agreement with this finding, electron micrographs of primary hepatocytes derived from <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> mice show that STIM1-YFP expression led to a remodeling of ER with abundant ER stacks apposed to the PM, although the degree of ER remodeling varied from cell to cell, likely due to variable STIM1 expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This result suggests that, in addition to having more STIM1 that translocates to PM, overexpression of STIM1-YFP also remodels the ER, favoring the proximity of STIM1 to Orai at the plasma membrane.</p><p>After verifying that overexpression of STIM1-YFP was able to rescue STIM1 translocation defects in obese cells, we examined whether this actually resulted in improved SOCE. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> overexpression of STIM1-YFP in <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> cells resulted in increased ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> and SOCE compared to control cells. Thus, overexpression of STIM1 was a successful intervention to overcome the STIM translocation and SOCE defects, resulting in improved ER calcium handling.</p><p>Next, we asked whether the effects of the overexpression of STIM1-YFP in <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> primary hepatocytes would impact overall metabolism in vivo, and evaluated the effect of liver-specific STIM1 expression on systemic glucose metabolism in the <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> mice following the protocol displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>. Introduction of STIM1 by adenovirus gene delivery led to increased STIM1 protein levels in the liver. Interestingly, increased STIM1 expression was also accompanied by increased mRNA expression of Orai1 and with an increase in SERCA (Atp2a2) mRNA and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>). This is in accordance with previous work showing that the modulation of expression STIM1 affects the expression of other Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels or pumps, as SERCA, likely due to alterations in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abell et al., 2011</xref>). Remarkably, liver-specific overexpression of STIM1 led to a significant improvement in glucose tolerance relative to control (adGFP) animals as evaluated by a glucose tolerance test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Improved glucose tolerance resulting from overexpression of STIM1 was associated with enhanced in vivo insulin signaling evaluated by direct insulin injection into the livers that resulted in increased AKT phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Additionally, expression of genes involved in glycolysis were increased in livers overexpressing STIM1, accompanied by decreased levels of PCK1 (PEPCK), a rate limiting enzyme for gluconeogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F and G</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29968.023</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Overexpression of STIM1 leads to improved insulin signaling, glucose tolerance and lipid accumulation in obese animals.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the protocol for adenovirus mediated STIM1- YFP expression in <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> mice (<bold>B</bold>) mRNA expression levels of indicated genes evaluated by qPCR, normalized to 18S, n = 9 for WT and n = 10 for STIM1-YFP pooled from two independent experiments, *p=0.04 (<bold>C</bold>) Left panel: Immunoblot analysis of indicated proteins in liver total lysates from <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> mice expressing GFP or STIM1-YFP.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>, exogenous expression of STIM1 led to a reduction in total Tg content in the liver tissue of <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> mice compared to controls expressing GFP. Accordingly, STIM1 overexpression led to increase mRNA expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation, such as CPT1, while no change was observed in genes involved in lipogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Based on these results we conclude that SOCE is critical for glucose and lipid metabolism and that increasing hepatic SOCE through overexpression of STIM1 is able to revert, at least in part, the deleterious impact of obesity on systemic glucose homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the last several years, a growing number of studies have laid the foundation for the concept that disrupted intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in metabolic tissues is a key component of ER dysfunction and metabolic deterioration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arruda and Hotamisligil, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ozcan and Tabas, 2016</xref>). The abnormal Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling in the ER of hepatocytes in this setting is multi-faceted, involving both impairment of SERCA activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fu et al., 2011</xref>) as well as increased activity of IP3R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arruda et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feriod et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). This impacts not only Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in the ER and protein folding, but also mitochondrial oxidation and ROS production as well as the activation of cytosolic stress signaling pathways. Supporting the critical role of this biology, human genetic studies have shown that SNPs in SERCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Varadi et al., 1999</xref>) and IP3R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shungin et al., 2015</xref>) are associated with metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes. Here, our work reveals that another key mechanism supporting ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis, STIM-mediated SOCE, is also defective in obesity with important implications for the metabolic dysfunction in hepatocytes. Strikingly, we demonstrate that STIM1 gain-of-function improves cellular stress responses and glucose homeostasis in obese mice, underscoring the therapeutic potential of targeting Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis through STIM1 for metabolic disease treatment.</p><p>Our interest in this biology was heightened by our initial observation that in hepatocytes isolated from obese (<italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic>) mice, STIM1 was present in an aberrant punctate pattern along the ER membrane. One possible explanation was that <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> hepatocytes display increased SOCE even in baseline conditions in order to respond to low ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels induced by dysfunction of SERCA and IP3R1. However, our detailed examination revealed that in cells of obese mice, STIM1 puncta were not localized in areas of close proximity of the PM, but rather were distributed all throughout the cell away from the PM. Additionally, when we depleted ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores, STIM1 was not able to fully translocate to the PM, resulting in significantly reduced SOCE. Hence, metabolic stress impairs this critical component of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in obese liver tissue.</p><p>One question arising from these observations is the nature of the mechanism underlying STIM1 dysfunction in obesity. STIM activation and translocation is modulated by a complex array of factors that include post-translational modification of the protein itself, protein-protein interactions (for review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lopez et al., 2016</xref>), the interaction of STIM1 with lipids of the ER membrane and the ability of the ER itself to remodel and form ER/PM junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Derler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lopez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Prakriya and Lewis, 2015</xref>). Here we found that in hepatocytes derived from <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> mice, STIM1 displays significantly increased levels of O-GlcNAcylation, a post-translation modification that causes impaired STIM1 trafficking and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhu-Mauldin et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, overexpression of OGT in hepatocytes was sufficient to induce abnormal STIM1 puncta formation and impaired activation of SOCE while down-regulation of OGT in primary hepatocytes from obese mice partially rescued the STIM1 translocation defect. It will be interesting to explore the detailed location and impact of these modifications in future studies. In silico analysis, published literature and data in dbOGAP, suggest potential target sites coinciding with the domains involved in STIM1/Orai1 interactions with Orai1 in the CAD/SOAR domain or in the polybasic motif located at the C terminal of the protein that may be critical in oligomerization and puncta formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liou et al., 2007</xref>). Regardless, protein modification with O-GlcNAc is a reflection of the nutritional status, as it integrates glucose, amino acid, fatty acid and nucleotide flux through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) to produce <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-glucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), the obligatory substrate for OGT. Hence, conditions of nutrient and substrate excess, including obesity, lead to increased cellular O-GlcNAcylation levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vosseller et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang and Qian, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dentin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2008</xref>). Taken together, our findings demonstrate that O-GlcNAc modification of STIM1 alters organelle Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation with consequences for ER function and systemic metabolism and provide an important mechanistic insight into regulation of this critical metabolic integration point through organelle homeostasis in obesity.</p><p>Another important finding reported here is that impaired SOCE in hepatocytes by STIM1 deficiency was sufficient to induce markers of ER stress and inflammation, to impair of insulin action, increase glucose production and induce excessive lipid droplet accumulation. Recently, it has been reported that cells from patients with loss-of-function mutations in STIM1 or ORAI accumulate lipid droplets as a consequence of their inability to increase cAMP, mobilize fatty acids from lipid droplets, activate lipolysis, and oxidize fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maus et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, tamoxifen-induced whole body STIM1/2 deficiency leads to higher lipid content in the heart, muscle and liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maus et al., 2017</xref>). Here, although we detected increased accumulation of lipid droplets in hepatocytes lacking STIM1 in vitro, these phenomena were not clearly observed in vivo. Hepatocyte-specific deletion of STIM1 led to a mild metabolic phenotype in vivo suggesting that the activation of compensatory systems occurs when STIM1 is deleted during development. Indeed, STIM2 expression levels were slightly increased in STIM1 deficient liver. Furthermore, in lean animals, the rest of the ER calcium handling systems are intact, which may allow maintenance of the normal equilibrium. In contrast, acute down-regulation of STIM1 showed a more marked effect on glucose homeostasis.</p><p>Finally, we show here that exogenous expression of STIM1 in primary hepatocytes from obese mice is sufficient to overcome SOCE defects and partially correct ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and STIM1 re-localization upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> store depletion. Notably, we showed that a significant part of the exogenously expressed STIM1 is able to escape the O-GlcNAc modification, probably by a mass effect, and responds properly to ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion. Additionally, overexpression of STIM1 in hepatocytes from <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> animals led to remodeling of the ER with an increase in the amount of cortical ER possibly facilitating STIM1 translocation and Orai1 coupling. Indeed, it is known that STIM1 regulates the structure of the ER through its role in Tip Attachment Complex movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grigoriev et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Westrate et al., 2015</xref>), coordinating the growth and shrinkage of the ER tubule. Importantly, we show that upregulation of SOCE through STIM1 replenishment in the liver of obese mice results in significant metabolic benefit including improved insulin signaling and glucose tolerance and decreased lipid content likely as a result of enhanced fatty acid oxidation. When STIM1 is exogenously supplied to the liver tissue in obese mice, we also observed an increase in glycolytic gene expression. This is in agreement with recent report showing that in T cells SOCE regulates the expression of glycolytic genes through the modulation of the transcription factor NFAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vaeth et al., 2017</xref>). Overexpression of STIM1 also led to increased SERCA levels, which is necessary for the delivery of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the ER. In fact, it is proposed and validated experimentally and computationally that an adaptive feedback loop between components of Ca<sup>2+</sup> machinery exist to keep cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels under control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abell et al., 2011</xref>). Increased SERCA expression in the context of STIM1 overexpression may indeed be a critical component of the metabolic benefit resulting from STIM1 expression in the liver in obese mice. It is remarkable that the individual manipulation of multiple proteins involved in the maintenance of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels- SERCA, IP3R, and STIM1- all result in a similar phenotype. These findings underscore the importance of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and ER function to metabolic health, and indicate the strong potential for targeting these pathways to combat metabolic disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>General animal care and study design</title><p>All in vivo studies are approved by the Harvard Medical Area Standing Committee on Animals.

Hepa1-6 cells were seeded on 3.5 mm round glass dishes (1.5 mm) in Williams Medium in the presence of 5% CCS overnight at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The following morning, cells were washed, and in the afternoon they were incubated for a few minutes in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free medium (described in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging section) followed by 1 µM Tg treatment (or vehicle, DMSO) for the duration indicated in the figure legends. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature (RT) and washed 3x in PBS, before a 20 min permeabilization using 0.2% Triton-X100 in 2% BSA at RT. Primary antibodies were diluted 1:200 for STIM1 (Cell Signaling #4916), 1:100 for STIM2 (Cell Signaling #4917), for Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase α−1 -Alexa Fluor 488 (Sigma #16–243) and for Anti-KDEL antibody, Alexa fluor 488 (Abcam, ab184819) in PBS and the cells were incubated in this solution over night at 4°C in the dark. The next day, cells were washed 3x, including one long wash for more than 10 min. Secondary antibody was diluted 1:2500 in PBS, and the cells were incubated with it at RT for 1 hr in the dark. The cells were washed 3x, including one long wash, and if needed, Hoechst was used as nuclear marker, diluted 1:1000 in PBS for 10 min at RT. For the experiments described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref> cells were imaged at the Confocal and Light Microscopy Core Facility at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute with a Yokogawa CSU-X1 spinning disk confocal system (Andor Technology, South Windsor, CT) with a Nikon Ti-E inverted microscope (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY), using a 60x or 100x Plan Apo objective lens with a Hamamatsu OrcaER camera. Andor iQ software (Andor Technology, South Windsor, CT) was used for acquisition parameters, shutters, filter positions and focus control. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C, D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5D</xref>, cells were imaged at the Harvard Medical School Imaging Core with a Yokogawa CSU-X1 spinning disk confocal system (Andor Technology, South Windsor, CT) with an iXon EMCCD camera and Metamorph was the software used for acquisition parameters, shutters, filter positions and focus control.

All the images in the same experiment were analyzed using the same parameters. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, puncta number was counted using a custom made macro. After background subtraction of 15, images were subject to ‘Filter Gaussian blur’ of 1.00 and a threshold was set to define puncta from background signal. In order to localize the individual puncta ‘Find Maxima’ tool was used and puncta were counted using ‘Analyze Particles’ tool. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>, images were background subtracted and single cells or groups of cells either expressing OGT or not (identified by RFP expression), were cropped from the original image. Puncta above a threshold of 50 were counted using ‘Analyze Particles’, and normalized to number of cells in the field. Puncta pixel intensities: For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>, a 125 × 125 pixels box was placed in a representative region of the cell and pixel intensities were recorded in the entire box using a custom made macro. Intensities were distributed into a histogram with R, and plotted in Prism. No further normalization was performed, as the same number of pixels was evaluated in all the images.</p><p>Plot profile in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5E</xref>: A thin box of 40 × 250 pixels was placed across the cell and the average intensity contained in the box was plotted as a profile with Fiji.

In each experiment epifluorescence images were acquired and the PM marker was used to define the PM area for the TIRF imaging. The images were acquired a Zeiss Elyra PS.1 microscope with a 60 or 100 × 1.46 N.A. oil immersion TIRF objective (Carl Zeiss GmbH, Germany) in TIRF mode with an Andor EM-CCD camera (512 × 512 pixels) at the Harvard center for Biological Imaging, Cambridge, MA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>imaging using Fura-2 AM and Fluo-4</title><p>Cells were loaded with 4 μM Fura-2AM and 1 µM Pluronic F-127 in HBSS for ~60 min at room temperature. Before imaging, the cells were washed and kept in a medium containing 10 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM D-glucose, pH 7.4. Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free medium was prepared similarly to the buffer described above, in the absence of CaCl<sub>2</sub> and in the presence of 2 mM EGTA and 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Cells were stimulated with 1 µM Tg for indirect ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> measurements, and in some cases supplemented with 100 µM 2-APB for SOCE inhibition. Ratiometric Fura-2AM imaging was performed by alternatively illuminated with 340 and 380 nm light for 250 ms (Lambda DG-4; Sutter Instrument Co.), using an Olympus IX70 with 40x objective. Emission light &gt;510 nm was captured using a CCD camera (Orca-ER; Hamamatsu Photonics). Both channels were collected every 5 s, background corrected and analyzed with Slidebook and custom-made R-scripts. For the Fluo-4 experiments described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>, the same procedure described above as used except that the cells were incubate with Fluo-4 for 30 min to 1 hr. The images were acquired on a Leica SP8X and LAS X software was used for acquisition parameters, shutters, filter positions and focus control.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Loss of function experiments were performed in Hepa1-6 cells (a mouse hepatocyte cell line from ATCC, derivative of the BW7756 mouse hepatoma that arose in C57/L mouse) for STIM1, STIM2 and ORAI1. This cell line was negative for mycoplasma testing. Five different shRNA sequences targeting different regions of each gene were obtained from <italic>MISSION</italic> shRNA Library (Sigma) along with the Scramble shRNA control. Stable cell lines were generated by lentiviral infection of Hepa1-6 cells overnight in media (DMEM and 10% CCS and polybrene). After infection cells were incubated in growth media (DMEM and 10% CCS) and selected with 3 µg/µl puromycine. The knockdown efficiency of each shRNA was evaluated by western blot analysis and the experiments were done with the sequence that generated the highest efficiency. Cells were frozen at passage two after selection and fresh cells were thawed for each experiment. The sequences of the shRNA used in the study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. For the overexpression of OGT, a hOGT/RFP co-expression plasmid was generated using a self-cleaving P2A peptide linker. RFP was first cloned into pcDNA6 Myc/His B (Life Technologies V22120) at BamHI/XhoI sites. OGT-P2A was generated by PCR (F: 5’-CCC GGT ACC GCC ACC ATG GCGTCTTCCGTGGGCAA; R: 5’- CCC GGA TCC AGG TCC AGG GTT CTC CTC CAC GTC TCC AGC CTG CTT CAG CAG GCT GAA GTT AGT AGC TCC GCT TCC TGCTGACTCAGTGACTTC) and cloned into the above vector at KpnI/BamHI sites.The OGT-RFP plasmid was transfected into, cells using lipofectamine 2000 overnight in OptiMEM media and the experiment done after 36–48 hr after transfection.

Cells were washed in ice-cold PBS and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. For the insulin infusions in vivo, following 6 hr of food withdrawal, mice were anaesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of 2 mg/ml xylazine and 2 mg/ml ketamine, and insulin (0.75 IU kg<sup>−1</sup>) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) in 200 µl volume was infused into the portal vein. Three minutes after infusion, tissues were removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at –80°C until processing. For lipid loading experiments primary hepatocytes were isolated in the morning and kept in Williams E medium. After the cells were settled, Williams medium containing 1 mM Oleic acid and 40 µM palmitic acid was added to the culture. Cells before and after 16 hr of lipid loading and stained with BODIPY and Hoechst to visualize lipid droplets and nucleus, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)</title><p>For TEM, primary hepatocytes were fixed in a 1:1 ratio in a fixative buffer and Williams Medium. The fixative buffer contained: 4 parts of FP stock (2.5% PFA, 0.06% picric acid in 0.2M Sodium Cacodylate buffer pH 7.4) and 1 part of 25% glutaraldehyde for at least 2 hr. The samples were then placed in propyleneoxide for 1 hr and infiltrated in a 1:1 mixture of propyleneoxide and TAAB 812 Resin mixture (Marivac Canada Inc. St. Laurent, Canada). Sectioning and imaging: ultrathin sections (about 90 nm) were generated using a Reichert Ultracut-S microtome, JEOL microscope. Images were recorded with an AMT 2 k CCD camera. For the STIM-HRP labeled cells, primary hepatocytes were infected with adenovirus expressing STIM1-HRP. The construct was kindly provided by Dr. Lewis from Stanford University and cloned in an adenovirus (serotype 5, Ad5). Primary hepatocytes were fixed in a buffer containing 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate at room temperature for 1 hr, then quickly moved to ice and washed with 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer for 10 min. HRP was visualized with 0.5 mg ml diaminobenzidine and 0.03% hydrogen peroxide in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer for 5 min-20min. The reaction was stopped by five washes with cold 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to D Clapham and N Blair for their help in the Ca2 +imaging experiments and generously allowing the use of their laboratory facilities.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>It was agreed that the manuscript was very well crafted and written and the fundamental observation that SOCE is important for hepatic calcium homeostasis and glucose tolerance is solid. However, there are many basic questions remaining and the underlying mechanisms have not yet been clearly addressed. The reviewers raised many basic issues and on balance many of these would have to be clarified to raise the level of scientific impact to the point where the paper could be considered for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript describes a novel connection between obesity associated glucose intolerance and hepatic calcium transport into the ER mediated by the SOCE system. The concept that glucose intolerance in obesity is promoted by dysfunction of STIM mediated by O-glycNAcylation is of significant interest. However, there are several key points that the authors should consider in order to more completely document and strengthen this hypothesis:</p><p>1) It is not clear that the glucose intolerance (abnormal GTT) induced by the manipulations (STIM KO and over expression in liver) relates to systemic insulin resistance versus alterations in insulin, glucagon or other hormones during the GTT. Serum hormones and hyperinsulinemic clamp studies must be carried out to show that STIM KO suppresses insulin mediated inhibition of hepatic glucose output in vivo. The limited data indicates some reduction in insulin stimulated Akt, but it is not clear whether this translates to actual glucose production.</p><p>2) The authors suggest that overnutrition is associated with hyper-glyNAcylated proteins as is hyperglycemia. If the hyper-glyNAcylated STIM1 is promoted by hyperglycemia, then this is a secondary effect of the obesity and insulin resistance and not the cause it would seem. How early in the hyperglycemic stage of the ob/ob mouse is STIM1 translocation observed to be defective? Does it only occur well after the extreme hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia is established in these ob/ob animals? Does it occur early or late in HFD mice?</p><p>3) The KO and overexpression of STIM1 in liver don't mimic alterations in the obese state, since STIM1 expression is not altered in the ob/ob mouse, but rather its translocation. Under the overexpression conditions, one might predict that STIM1 is also hyper-glyNAcylated and therefore also defective. Is that the case, or does it escape this modification when highly expressed? In order to document that hyper-glyNAcylated STIM1 is the cause of altered calcium dynamics in the obese state, one would have to specifically block this modification only in STIM1, a difficult experimental feat. Thus, the hypothesis at this point is rather weakly supported as it is &quot;guilt by association&quot; rather than demonstrated causation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors present an interesting line of evidence that describes Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling as a key mechanism underlying hepatic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in obesity.

Conversely, over-expression of STIM1 in obese mice led to increased SOCE, which was sufficient to improve systemic glucose tolerance.</p><p>Reviewer Synopsis:</p><p>Overall the study is of potential significant interest to the field and the experiments described are well-performed. The major conceptual advance is that Ca<sup>2+</sup> balance regulation by SOCE in hepatocytes contributes to metabolic homeostasis. Major comments are listed below:</p><p>1) How does Ca<sup>2+</sup> balance regulates lipid accumulation in hepatocytes?</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, the authors show that STIM1 deficiency leads to accumulation of lipids following treatment with palmitic and oleic acid in vitro. Is the increased accumulation of lipids in hepatocytes due to the increase entry of fatty acids or a decreased fatty acid oxidation? in vivo, there was no increase in lipid accumulation in liver of mice with hepatocyte-specific deletion of STIM1. This could be due to a compensatory increase in STIM2. Therefore, silencing both STIM1 and 2 could reproduce in vivo the increased lipid accumulation in liver. The authors could use shRNA adenovirus targeting STIM1/2 and measure lipid accumulation. On the other hand, it could be due to the fact that the mice used in the experiment were fed a high fat diet and already display hepatic steatosis, which would mask the effect of STIM1 deficiency. Using mice fed a normal diet with deletion of STIM1 would be a better model to measure an increased lipid accumulation and glucose intolerance exacerbation.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, STIM1 overexpression in ob/ob mice improves glucose tolerance and insulin response, and decreases expression of gluconeogenic genes while increasing the expression of genes involved in glycolysis. What is the effect of STIM1 overexpression on hepatic steatosis: is there more TG accumulation in liver? Is the expression of genes involved in de novo lipogenesis, lipid uptake, FA oxidation affected by STIM1 overexpression?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Pers and colleagues present data linking obesity with defective calcium influx and endoplasmic reticulum dysfunction in mouse hepatocytes. In general, the manuscript is well written and the experimental logic is sound. The authors conclude that STIM1 trafficking from the ER to plasma membrane is perturbed in hepatocytes from obese mice due to aberrant/increased O-GycNAcylation. This coincides with increased ER stress and a variety of metabolic defects that are interesting but not at all surprising considering the very well-documented connection between ER calcium homeostasis and ER function. The most exciting portion of the manuscript is the demonstration that over-expression of STIM1-YFP rescues several of the metabolic defects observed in obese mice.</p><p>Unfortunately, it is not at all clear why this is the case or if it even involves increased STIM1 activity/SOCE in the obese hepatocytes. The data indicate that STIM1-YFP overexpression severely perturbs or alters ER morphology potentially allowing STIM1 to interact with Orai1 at the plasma membrane, essentially by chance. However, STIM1-YFP appears to be quite different than endogenous STIM1 as it is not affected by thapsigargin. Many questions remain: Is overexpressed STIM1 also O-GlcNAc-ylated? Is ER calcium homeostasis improved? Does over-expression of any ER-localized transmembrane protein provide relief in obese mouse hepatocytes? Why does overexpression of STIM1 result in increased transcription of Orai1 mRNA, SERCA mRNA? STIM1 overexpression may simply activate a compensatory response to ER dysfunction such as the UPR which improves the documented metabolic defects. Also, why/how does STIM1 overexpression increase glycolysis gene expression?</p><p>While the data is beautifully presented, the impact of the paper's findings are modest at best. The conclusion that SOCE is an important mechanism for healthy hepatocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and systemic metabolic control is of moderate interest.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29968.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This manuscript describes a novel connection between obesity associated glucose intolerance and hepatic calcium transport into the ER mediated by the SOCE system.

To address this issue, we measured fasting insulin levels in mice in which STIM1 was down regulated (STIM1KD), and found no differences compared with the WT controls (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). We had very limited serum samples from these animals and unfortunately were not able to determine other hormones during GTT. However, we decided to directly determine whether the absence of STIM1 influences hepatocyte glucose production, by measuring glucose production in primary hepatocytes isolated from WT and STIM1 deficient animals. As shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, glucose production stimulated by gluconeogenic substrates (pyruvate, glutamine and glycerol) was significantly higher in STIM1 deficient animals compared with WT. These data indicate that the effect of STIM1 deficiency in hepatocytes does in deed translate to higher glucose production.</p><p>While we agree that hyperinsulinemic clamps are the gold standard method for determination of glucose fluxes, it is not possible to perform these experiments in a timely manner considering the complexity and time demands. However, our new results showing significantly increased glucose production from primary hepatocytes with STIM1-deficiency add an additional and direct measure from hepatocytes to support our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors suggest that overnutrition is associated with hyper-glyNAcylated proteins as is hyperglycemia.

Does it occur early or late in HFD mice?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these comments. To answer this question, we followed a cohort of animals fed chow or HFD for 3, 5, 7 and 11 weeks. We choose to perform the experiment using HFD obesity model instead of the ob/ob because in leptin deficient animals, the hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia appears very early on (as early as 4 weeks) which would make it difficult to uncouple the STIM defects from the acute metabolic alterations found in this mouse model.</p><p>As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>, in HFD fed mice, body weight and insulin levels started to rise after 5 weeks of high fat feeding, reaching maximal levels after 7 weeks of HFD. However, the glucose levels were not significantly changed during this time frame.</p><p>We then analyzed STIM1 translocation in hepatocytes isolated from these mice. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A and 2B</xref>, at 3 weeks time point on HFD we detected some degree of translocation at the baseline (non-treated condition) indicating that short term HFD is sufficient to induce decreased levels of calcium in the ER, which is the driving force for STIM translocation. However, at this time point, STIM1 translocation upon TG stimulation was not significantly impaired compared with cells derived from chow fed animals. The defect in TG ‐induced STIM1 translocation was first observed in hepatocytes isolated from mice after 5 weeks of HFD, and was more pronounced at the 7 and 11-week timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A and 2B</xref>). Based on these findings, we conclude that the defect in STIM1 translocation is not related to hyperglycemia and starts before the frank hyper-insulinemia found in obesity at least in the HFD model <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>. We additionally observed that the O-GlcNAcylation levels of STIM1 are progressively increased in hepatocytes from HFD fed animals starting from 3 week on HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The KO and overexpression of STIM1 in liver don't mimic alterations in the obese state, since STIM1 expression is not altered in the ob/ob mouse, but rather its translocation.

Thus, the hypothesis at this point is rather weakly supported as it is &quot;guilt by association&quot; rather than demonstrated causation.</p></disp-quote><p>To answer this reviewer’s question we used adenovirus-mediated gene delivery to overexpress STIM1-YFP in primary hepatocytes derived from obese (ob/ob) animals. We immunoprecipitated O-GlcNac modified proteins in these cells using an OglcNac specific antibody and performed immunoblot to detect STIM1 among these proteins. As it can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, STIM1-‐YFP overexpression resulted in an approximately 20-fold increase in the expression of STIM1 protein. However, the amount of STIM1 observed in the O-‐GlcNac pull-‐down was not proportionally increased, indicating that a majority of the overexpressed STIM1 is able to “escape” this post translation modification.</p><p>So far, we have not been able to make satisfactory progress in determining the exact sites of STIM1 O-GlcNacylation in order to perform site direct mutagenesis. However, to determine if blocking this modification could rescue the defect in STIM1 translocation, we used an adenovirus expressing an shRNA against OGT to down-regulate OGT and therefore suppress O-GlcNacylation in primary hepatocytes from ob/ob animals. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K and L</xref>, adenovirus mediated expression of shRNA against OGT lead to 60% down-regulation in OGT and overall OglcNacylation. Importantly, down-‐regulation of OGT lead to increased levels of STIM1 translocation in response Tg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M and N</xref>). These results strengthen our conclusion that O-GlcNacylation is an important factor driving the defects in STIM translocation in obese cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The authors present an interesting line of evidence that describes Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling as a key mechanism underlying hepatic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in obesity.

The effects of STIM1 deficiency on lipid metabolism have been addressed recently by Maus et al., 2016. In this paper, the authors show that SOCE regulates lipolysis through the production of cyclic AMP and the expression lipases ATGL and HSL as well as the transcriptional regulators of fatty acid oxidation such as PGC-1a and PPARa. They also show, similar to us, that cells deficient in STIM1 accumulate lipid droplets. We have incorporated this reference into our discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In vivo, there was no increase in lipid accumulation in liver of mice with hepatocyte-specific deletion of STIM1. This could be due to a compensatory increase in STIM2. Therefore, silencing both STIM1 and 2 could reproduce in vivo the increased lipid accumulation in liver.

Using mice fed a normal diet with deletion of STIM1 would be a better model to measure an increased lipid accumulation and glucose intolerance exacerbation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. As suggested, we have measured glucose tolerance and TG content in the livers of STIM1 deficient animals under chow diet and we were not able to detect significant differences between the genotypes on the overall TG content and glucose tolerance. We added a line referring to this data in the text. We also performed a short term HFD study (6 weeks on HFD) and observed that in this case STIM1 deficient animals exhibited a modest but significant, impairment in a glucose tolerance test compared with the WT controls. Additionally, these animals showed decreased insulin signaling as measured by pIR and pAKT. In this context there were no significant differences in Tg content, although a tendency to be higher was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, although we haven’t observed overall changes in lipid accumulation in the liver specific STIM1 deficient animals, we have noticed that these animals show higher content of microvesicular steatosis compared with controls where the majority of the lipid droplets are presented as large droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Although not addressed in this paper, previous reports have shown that microsteatosis are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction (Tandra et al., 2011), which would fit with the findings from Maus et al., 2016, showing that STIM deletion affects mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation.</p><p>As the reviewer’s pointed out, the interpretation of the phenotype of liver specific STIM1 deficient animals is complex. Under chow diet, the absence of a phenotype in STIM1 deficient animals under chow diet could possibly be due to a compensation of STIM2. As the animals progress on HFD, as shown in our time course analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>), STIM becomes deficient, so the comparison of the WT on HFD (STIM deficiency) with a KO on a HFD (STIM absence) is hard to interpret. We agree that possibly a knockdown of both STIM1 and STIM2 in the liver could provide answers for this matter, but given the time frame of this experiments, we opted to focus only on STIM1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, STIM1 overexpression in ob/ob mice improves glucose tolerance and insulin response, and decreases expression of gluconeogenic genes while increasing the expression of genes involved in glycolysis. What is the effect of STIM1 overexpression on hepatic steatosis: is there more TG accumulation in liver? Is the expression of genes involved in de novo lipogenesis, lipid uptake, FA oxidation affected by STIM1 overexpression?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now measured TG content in liver from 3 different cohorts of ob/ob mice overexpressing STIM1-‐YFP and GFP control. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>, TG content was significantly decreased in livers overexpressing STIM1 compared with controls. Accordingly, mRNA expression of CPT1 and acadvl1, genes involved fatty acid oxidation, are increased in STIM1-‐YFP overexpression livers compared with controls, while no changes were observed in genes involved in lipogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] The data indicate that STIM1-‐YFP overexpression severely perturbs or alters ER morphology potentially allowing STIM1 to interact with Orai1 at the plasma membrane, essentially by chance.

We agree that determining the response of the STIM1-YFP is a critical control and we have performed this experiment and demonstrated its proper responsiveness in the original manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). We recognize that our description of the STIM1-‐YFP experiments and the effect on SOCE may not have been sufficiently emphasized in the first version of the manuscript. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, and quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, STIM1-YFP does respond to thapsigargin similarly to endogenous STIM1. To clarify this point further, we are now adding a live movie showing this response (Movie1) in the revised manuscript. Additionally, the STIM1-‐ YFP construct has been used multiple times in the literature, and shown to recapitulate the action of the endogenous protein (Sauc et al., 2015; Sundivakkam et al., 2012; Darbellay et al., 2010; Liou et al., 2005). The alterations in the ER morphology promoted by overexpression of STIM1 is likely related to the role of STIM1 as an ER structural protein. In resting cells STIM1 binds the plus-‐end-‐tracking protein (+TIP) of microtubules, anchoring the ER to the microtubules. However, to mediate SOCE, STIM1-YFP disconnects from the microtubules and needs to traffic within the ER, and this movement is driven by ER calcium depletion, phosphorylation and interaction with other proteins. To better clarify this process, we re-organize these data and its description accordingly in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is overexpressed STIM1 also O-‐GlcNAcylated?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this question. This issue was similarly raised by Reviewer 1. To address this reviewer’s question we used adenovirus-‐mediated gene delivery to express STIM1-‐YFP in primary hepatocytes derived from obese (ob/ob) animals. We immunoprecipitated O-GlcNac modified proteins in these cells using an O-GlcNac specific antibody and performed immunoblot experiments to detect STIM1 among these proteins. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, STIM1-YFP overexpression resulted in an approximately 20-fold increase in the expression of STIM1 protein. However, the amount of STIM1 observed in the O-GlcNac pull-down was not proportionally increased, indicating that a majority of the overexpressed STIM1 is able to “escape” this post translational modification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is ER calcium homeostasis improved?</p></disp-quote><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>in the revised manuscript, overexpression of STIM1 leads to increased ER Ca<sup>2+</sup>content and SOCE. Does over-‐expression of any ER-localized transmembrane protein provides relief in obese mouse hepatocytes?</p><p>We would not anticipate that this would be the case. For example, in our earlier work (Yang et al., 2015) overexpression of IRE1, an ER trans-membrane protein, does not change the metabolic status of ob/ob animals while the overexpression of a mutant IRE1 resistant to nitrosylation does. Another example was reported recently by our group where the overexpression of the ER bound transcription factor Nrf1/Nfe2L1 revert steatosis in a model of hyperlipidemia/hypercholesterolemia, but overexpression of ER-bound transcription-inactive mutant versions of this protein does not affect steatosis (Widenmaier et al., 2017).</p><p>These are two clear examples that the relief is related to the function of the protein rather than an unspecific effect. In the current study, we have demonstrated that exogenously expressed STIM1 is functional and responds to calcium fluxes in a similar way to the endogenous protein. Taken together, we do not think that any ER-localized transmembrane protein is capable of generating the relief.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why does overexpression of STIM1 result in increased transcription of Orai1 mRNA, SERCA mRNA?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this interesting question. Abell et al., 2011 have shown experimentally and computationally that there is a tight regulation and adaptation between the different components of cellular calcium homeostasis; Knockdown of one of the players (i.e. SERCA, STIM1, PMCA, IP3R) will result in a compensatory regulation of the other proteins to maintain calcium homeostasis. Although Abell et al. did not directly assess the effect of overexpression of these calcium-‐regulating proteins, based on their knockdown experiments they formulated the hypothesis that an adaptive feedback loop exists between the components of the cellular calcium homeostasis. Hence, the increased SERCA and Orai levels in STIM1-‐OE hepatocytes, could likely be a compensatory response to restore cytosolic calcium levels which otherwise will be detrimental for the cell. We have incorporated explanation of this point into the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, why/how does STIM1 overexpression increase glycolysis gene expression?</p></disp-quote><p>It has been shown very recently that in T cells, SOCE controls the expression of glycolytic genes specifically through the regulation of the transcriptional factor NFAT (Vaeth et al., 2017). Although not experimentally addressed in our paper, a similar mechanism could exist in hepatocytes. We added a line of discussion about these findings in our manuscript.</p><p>References:</p><p>Tandra S, Yeh MM, Brunt EM, Vuppalanchi R, Cummings OW, Ünalp-‐Arida A, Wilson LA, Chalasani N.
