harmful DNA lesions and their repair is crucial for cell viability and genome integrity. The readout of DSB repair may depend on whether DSBs occur at transcribed versus non-transcribed regions. Some studies have postulated that DNA-RNA hybrids form at DSBs to promote recombinational repair, but others have challenged this notion. To directly assess whether hybrids formed at DSBs promote or interfere with the recombinational repair, we have used plasmid and chromosomal-based systems for the analysis of DSB-induced recombination in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. We show that, as expected, DNA-RNA hybrid formation is stimulated at DSBs. In addition, mutations that promote DNA-RNA hybrid accumulation, such as <italic>hpr1∆</italic> and <italic>rnh1∆ rnh201∆</italic>, cause high levels of plasmid loss when DNA breaks are induced at sites that are transcribed. Importantly, we show that high levels or unresolved DNA-RNA hybrids at the breaks interfere with their repair by homologous recombination. This interference is observed for both plasmid and chromosomal recombination and is independent of whether the DSB is generated by endonucleolytic cleavage or by DNA replication. These data support a model in which DNA-RNA hybrids form fortuitously at DNA breaks during transcription and need to be removed to allow recombinational repair, rather than playing a positive role.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DNA-RNA hybrids</kwd><kwd>DSB repair</kwd><kwd>ssDNA breaks</kwd><kwd>replication</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>homologous recombination</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC2014 AdG669898 TARLOOP</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aguilera</surname><given-names>Andrés</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BFU2016-75058-P</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aguilera</surname><given-names>Andrés</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014440</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PDI2019-104270GB-I00</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aguilera</surname><given-names>Andrés</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011011</institution-id><institution>Junta de Andalucía</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P12-BIO-1238</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aguilera</surname><given-names>Andrés</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008530</institution-id><institution>European Regional Development Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aguilera</surname><given-names>Andrés</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003176</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Educación, Cultura y Deporte</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD FPU fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ortega</surname><given-names>Pedro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011011</institution-id><institution>Junta de Andalucía</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mérida-Cerro</surname><given-names>Jose Antonio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011011</institution-id><institution>Junta de Andalucía</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P18-FR-566</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aguilera</surname><given-names>Andrés</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic and physical analyses reveal that DNA-RNA hybrids form fortuitously at DNA double-strand breaks during transcription and need removal to allow repair by homologous recombination.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are extremely cytotoxic DNA lesions that can arise as a consequence of direct DNA breakage or by replication fork blockage at DNA lesions, including single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) breaks. Two main mechanisms have evolved to repair DSBs: non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which consists of the direct ligation of the DNA ends after some minimal processing; and homologous recombination (HR), which relies on the homology of a template DNA to bypass the break and complete replication, thus restoring the genetic information at the break. DSBs are preferentially repaired by sister chromatid recombination (SCR), an HR reaction that uses the intact sister chromatid as a template, being key during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">González-Barrera et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnson and Jasin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kadyk and Hartwell, 1992</xref>). Interestingly, the transcriptional context in which DSBs occur influences the repair pathway choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marnef et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, DSBs occurring within actively transcribed chromatin are preferentially repaired by HR compared to non-transcribed sequences located in euchromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aymard et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wei et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>DNA breaks facilitate the formation of DNA-RNA hybrids in yeast and mammalian cells. Although DNA-RNA hybrids can function in a number of physiological processes, their unscheduled formation is a well-known source of genome instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">García-Muse and Aguilera, 2019</xref>). In accordance, cells have evolved multiple mechanisms to counteract their formation including RNA coating by RNA biogenesis factors, such as the THO complex, DNA-RNA unwinding by different helicases including Senataxin and UAP56/DDX39B, RNA degradation by RNase H enzymes, as well as DNA repair-mediated removal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">García-Muse and Aguilera, 2019</xref>). Despite evidence indicating that DSBs promote DNA-RNA hybridization, the effect of such hybrids at DSBs is yet unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguilera and Gómez-González, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marnef and Legube, 2021</xref>). Thus, whereas different helicases have been shown to remove DNA-RNA hybrids at DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sessa et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yu et al., 2020</xref>), other reports postulated that RNA molecules could act as a functional intermediate for DSB repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D'Alessandro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Keskin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ohle et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, RNase H enzymes have been claimed to either play a crucial role at DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ohle et al., 2016</xref>) or no role at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Trying to add light to this question, we have investigated how DNA-RNA hybrids formed at DSBs influence their repair. We used the HO endonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kostriken et al., 1983</xref>) or a mutated FLP nickase (Flp-H305L, FLPm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tsalik and Gartenberg, 1998</xref>) to induce either replication-independent or replication-born DSBs, respectively. We observed that plasmids were lost at high frequency upon DSB induction in transcribed DNA regions in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> mutants with high levels of DNA-RNA hybrids. Hybrids are accumulated co-transcriptionally at sites where breaks are induced and interfere with DSB repair by HR. The data support a model in which unscheduled DNA-RNA hybrids form co-transcriptionally at DNA breaks and need to be removed in order to allow efficient DSB repair and genome stability.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>High loss of cleaved plasmids in DNA-RNA hybrid-accumulating mutants</title><p>To analyze the potential impact that DNA-RNA hybrids putatively accumulated at DSB sites could have on DNA repair, we assessed the frequency of plasmid loss upon break induction in yeast DNA-RNA hybrid accumulating mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

For the two FRT constructs, the frequency of plasmid loss under low or repressed transcription of the <italic>leu2</italic> allele (+dox) was below 5% in all strains tested, despite FLPm being expressed for 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). In contrast, under high <italic>leu2</italic> transcription, the frequency augmented to more than 20% in <italic>rnh1∆ rnh201∆</italic> and <italic>hpr1∆</italic> cells. The levels of spontaneous plasmid loss under no cleavage induction were barely detectable in any of the strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>).

Upon transcription activation, however, wild-type cells reduced the frequency of plasmid loss to 8% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). This is in agreement with our previous observation that HO endonuclease activity at the HO site is less efficient at highly transcribed chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">González-Barrera et al., 2002</xref>). Importantly, plasmid loss levels were above 25% in <italic>rnh1∆ rnh201∆</italic> and <italic>hpr1∆</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Similar results were obtained after 3 hr of cleavage induction, with levels differing from 25% in wt cells to 55% in the mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, whereas <italic>rnh1Δ rnh201Δ</italic> and <italic>hpr1Δ</italic> cells led to similar loss levels of cleaved plasmids by either FLPm or HO under low transcription of the plasmid-born <italic>leu2</italic> allele, loss frequencies were specifically augmented when <italic>leu2</italic> transcription was induced. Moreover, despite the fact that RNase H1 overexpression can be toxic and cause DNA damage and replicative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Paulsen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Domínguez-Sánchez et al., 2011</xref>), which could contribute to further plasmid loss, we observed that it fully suppressed the increase of plasmid loss induced by <italic>hpr1∆</italic> in both FRT and HO constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), indicating that the high loss of cleaved plasmids was caused by DNA-RNA hybrids. These results suggest that DNA-RNA hybrids could interfere with the repair of DSBs, regardless of whether directly generated by an endonuclease or during replication.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Impaired repair of replication-born DSBs in hybrid-accumulating mutants</title><p>To directly study DSB repair upon DNA-RNA hybrid accumulation, we took advantage of the TINV recombination system. This system is based on a centromeric plasmid with two <italic>leu2</italic> inverted repeats, one of which containing an endonuclease site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">González-Barrera et al., 2003</xref>). We first focused on the repair of replication-born DSBs (FLPm-induced), taking advantage of the existence of the previously validated TINV-FRT plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ortega et al., 2019</xref>), which we investigated in two versions (FRT-T and FRT-NT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). We measured the appearance of breaks (2.4 and 1.4-kb fragments) by Southern blot after FLPm induction and observed by alkaline gel electrophoresis that ssDNA cleavage reached up to 20% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a–b</xref>), but the percentage of DSB molecules was always below 1% as revealed by neutral gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c–d</xref>).

This could be a consequence of either a major efficiency of breakage or a lower efficiency of DSB repair, which in these FRT-based constructs occurs preferentially by SCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ortega et al., 2019</xref>). To determine the frequency of SCR, we quantified the events involving an exchange between unequal repeats in the two sister chromatids (unequal sister chromatid exchange, uSCE), which leads to a dicentric dimer intermediate that can be visualized by the 4.7 and 2.9-kb bands resulting from XhoI and SpeI digestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">González-Barrera et al., 2003</xref>). Given the proximity of the 4.7-kb band to the strong 3.8-kb band arising from the digestion of the more abundant intact plasmid, we relied on the 2.9-kb band to quantify SCR as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ortega et al., 2019</xref>). Other recombination reactions are also possible but known to occur at a minor and irrelevant frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cortés-Ledesma et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, to estimate repair at each time point, we calculated the ratio between the SCR-derived molecules (2.9-kb fragment, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) and the sum of repaired and cleaved molecules (2.9, 2.4, and 1.4-kb fragments, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) (see Materials and methods).

For this, we developed an allelic recombination system (DGL-FRT), consisting in a diploid yeast strain carrying two versions of the <italic>lys2</italic> allele in each of the homologous chromosomes II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>).

In this system, replication-born DSBs at each of the FRT sites would lead to Lys<sup>+</sup> recombinants by allelic recombination between the homologous chromosomes. Spontaneous recombination frequencies were below 10<sup>−4</sup> and similar in both constructs and both transcriptional conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>).

This phenomenon happens regardless of the origin of the break, whether replication-born or direct endonucleolytic cleavage, and whether in plasmid-born or chromosomal recombination systems. Importantly, rather than helping DNA repair, they can interfere with the repair by HR causing genetic instability, which suggests that hybrids at DNA breaks are mainly the result of the accidental co-transcriptional event facilitated by the release of the supercoil constraint.</p><p>We detected DNA-RNA hybrids at the break site even in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). This seems to happen when the efficiency of break induction is high enough (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) since, upon low cleavage induction, such as in the case of the FLPm-induced DSBs, it was necessary to delete the DNA-RNA hybrid resolution machinery, such as the RNases H, to observe such break-induced hybrids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This result supports the previous reports showing that DNA-RNA hybrid removal by RNase H enzymes contributes to DSB repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amon and Koshland, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Britton et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ohle et al., 2016</xref>) in addition to removal by helicases, as shown for Senataxin, DDX1, or DDX5 in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sessa et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yu et al., 2020</xref>) and possibly other factors yet to be explored. Indeed, persistent hybrids caused by depletion of RNase H, helicases, or the human exosome have been shown to affect RPA binding and/or DNA end resection in yeast or human cell studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Daley et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Domingo-Prim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ohle et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rawal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sessa et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yu et al., 2020</xref>). It is therefore possible that DNA-RNA hybrid accumulation in <italic>hpr1∆</italic> and <italic>rnh1∆ rnh201∆</italic> affects repair by negatively interfering with DSB resection. This could be particularly important when the hybrid covers the 5′ end that needs to be resected, although we have observed the formation of break-induced DNA-RNA hybrids at both sides of the break (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref> , <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref> , <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The hybrid formed in the 3′ end might initially favor resection of the complementary strand as we previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguilera and Gómez-González, 2017</xref>), but we envision that it would need to be removed later to allow the loading of RPA and subsequently Rad51. The increased loss of transcriptionally active cleaved plasmids in DNA-RNA hybrid-accumulating mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) may be explained as a consequence of the observed HR defects. Similarly, DNA-RNA hybrids accumulated at breaks in Senataxin-depleted cells have been shown to channel repair towards NHEJ with deleterious consequences such as increased translocations in yeast and lethality in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rawal et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The detection of break-induced DNA-RNA hybrids at both sides of the break (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) is in agreement with the results of a recent report in which DNA-RNA hybrids were detected at both sides of HO cleavage at the MAT loci, particularly upon Senataxin depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rawal et al., 2020</xref>). However, we show that this phenomenon is completely dependent on transcription of the construct driven by the <italic>tetp</italic> in the case of FLPm-induced breaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) and partially dependent in the case of HO-induced breaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that DNA breaks lead to DNA-RNA hybrids at both sides of the break due to pre-existing ongoing transcription rather than the de novo RNA synthesis previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ohle et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rawal et al., 2020</xref>). In agreement with our observations, analysis of DSBs-induced genome-wide in human cell cultures has recently shown that pre-existing transcription is critical for the formation of DNA-RNA hybrids at breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bader and Bushell, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohen et al., 2018</xref>). Based on the observation that R-loops are induced in mutants with increased RNA polymerase II backtracking in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zatreanu et al., 2019</xref>), it has been proposed that RNA polymerase backtracking could be the source of hybrids upstream of the break site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marnef and Legube, 2021</xref>). However, we cannot discern from the DRIP analysis whether hybrids at both sides of the break are formed by different or the same RNA molecule. In any case, we favor the idea that break-induced hybrids are rather the incidental consequence of DNA breakage during transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Indeed, the transient transcriptional shutdown that is known to happen soon after DSBs promoting repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pankotai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shanbhag et al., 2010</xref>) might also contribute to preventing such incidental hybridization. Our results therefore disfavor the possibility that such DNA-RNA hybrids are an intermediate required for the repair reaction in contrast to other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D'Alessandro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Keskin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ohle et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ouyang et al., 2021</xref>). Indeed, RNase H overexpression caused no defect in our repair systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model of DNA-RNA hybrid formation upon breakage of transcribed DNA.</title><p>During transcription, nascent RNA is coated by mRNA biogenesis factors, such as the THO complex, that prevent RNA from hybridizing with its complementary DNA.

Such hybrids need to be removed by RNase H enzymes or helicases to allow further repair by homologous recombination (HR). </p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-69881-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>A nice report in human cells has recently shown that transcription increases HR frequency after break induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ouyang et al., 2021</xref>), which supported by in vitro studies with synthetic DNA-RNA hybrids and Cas9-mediated DNA-RNA hybrid formation led to the intriguing proposal that hybrids are regular intermediates of HR with a positive role in the reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ouyang et al., 2021</xref>). However, we did not observe that transcription, required to generate the RNA involved in hybrids, increased the frequency of HR after break induction in any of our systems (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). Indeed, it has been shown that transcription can stimulate HR just as a consequence of the chromatin status of transcriptionally active loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aymard et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clouaire and Legube, 2015</xref>). This, together with the fact that we clearly detected break-induced hybrids in a transcription-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) but no positive effect of transcription on HR frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) suggests that DNA-RNA hybrids rather than being an intermediate with a positive role in DSB repair, forms accidentally at breaks interfering with their repair. Certainly, we cannot discard that hybrids formed at specific DNA regions in a regulated manner or formed by a Cas9-driven reaction could play a positive role in DSB repair. Notwithstanding, it is also worth mentioning that the scenario we propose is compatible with the scheduled synthesis of damage-induced ncRNAs de novo, which could serve the purpose of DSB signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burger et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D'Alessandro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Francia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Michelini et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pessina et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vítor et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Our systems allow us to conclude that break-induced hybrids are not only transcription-dependent but independent of the origin of the DSB, which we induced by either direct endonucleolytic HO cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) or by the replication of single-strand breaks (SSBs) caused by FLPm at the T or NT strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Although directing the SSBs to the T or NT strand led to DSBs that were repaired with the same efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), we observed that the appearance of repair intermediates was slightly faster when transcription was high than when transcription was low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This has been reported before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chaurasia et al., 2012</xref>) and could be attributed to increased accessibility of repair factors to transcribed regions, as recently shown for human RAD51 and RAD52 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aymard et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wei et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yasuhara et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, the repair of transcribed DNA might be at the same time hampered by the incidental formation of hybrids, as we observed here, and fostered by the enhanced recruitment of the repair machinery.</p><p>A priori, all conditions promoting DNA-RNA hybridization (break-specific or not) could potentially impair HR at transcribed regions since HR was affected even when DNA-RNA hybrids were already accumulated before cleavage induction, as it is the case of the <italic>hpr1∆</italic> mutant from the THO complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Therefore, our results support a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) in which DNA-RNA hybrids at DSBs, either pre-existing or promoted by the induction of the break at transcribed loci, need to be removed in order to allow further repair and maintain genome stability. Hybrid removal at breaks could potentially be performed by multiple redundant factors in addition to RNases H. However, not all factors that have been shown to remove DNA-RNA hybrids must necessarily act at breaks. We envision that both overlapping and specific functions counteract the harmful potential of DNA-RNA hybrids in each physiological process affected. On the one hand, a cohort of factors has evolved to prevent or remove DNA-RNA hybrids co-transcriptionally, these factors being likely associated with transcription elongation as exemplified by the THO complex and its interaction with the Sub2/UAP56 helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pérez-Calero et al., 2020</xref>). On the other hand, hybrids can be dissolved during replication and, when causing replication fork impairments, they are counteracted by replication-associated repair factors, such as the Fanconi anemia pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">García-Rubio et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hatchi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schwab et al., 2015</xref>) or the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bayona-Feliu et al., 2021</xref>). Similarly, hybrids hampering DSB repair can be counteracted by DSB repair-associated factors, as exemplified in human cells by BRCA2 retaining the DDX5 helicase at DSBs boosting its activity to unwind DNA-RNA hybrids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhatia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mersaoui et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sessa et al., 2021</xref>) or in yeast by the recruitment of Senataxin to DSBs by Mre11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rawal et al., 2020</xref>). Further research would be required to unravel the final puzzle of how DNA-RNA hybrids are physiologically regulated in each of the circumstances and which general and specific DNA-RNA hybrid counteracting factors have a function at DNA breaks.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic></td><td valign="top">W303 background strains with different gene deletions</td><td valign="top">Various</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">(See Materials and methods section)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">Yeast expression plasmids and recombination systems</td><td valign="top">Various</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">(See Materials and methods section)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sequence-based reagent</td><td valign="top">Primers for DRIP, RT-PCR and probe amplification</td><td valign="top">Condalab</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">(See Materials and methods section)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">S9.6 anti DNA:RNA hybrids (mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">ATCC Hybridoma cell line</td><td valign="top">Cat # <break/>HB-8730, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_G144">CVCL_G144</ext-link></td><td valign="top">(1 mg/ml)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay kit</td><td valign="top">Macherey-Nagel DNA purification</td><td valign="top">Macherey-Nagel</td><td valign="top">Cat # <break/>740588.250</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay kit</td><td valign="top">Qiagen’s RNeasy</td><td valign="top">Qiagen</td><td valign="top">Cat # <break/>75162</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay kit</td><td valign="top">Reverse transcription kit</td><td valign="top">Qiagen</td><td valign="top">Cat # <break/>205311</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">Zymolyase 20T</td><td valign="top">US Biological</td><td valign="top">Z1001</td><td valign="top">(15 mg/ml)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Doxycyclin hyclate</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">D9891</td><td valign="top">(5 mg/ml)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">Proteinase K (PCR grade)</td><td valign="top">Roche</td><td valign="top">Cat # 03508811103</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">Rnase A</td><td valign="top">Roche</td><td valign="top">Cat # 10154105103</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">Rnase III</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td valign="top">Cat # <break/>AM2290</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">Spermidine</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat # <break/>S2626</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">Spermine</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat # <break/>S3256</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">iTaq Universal SYBR Green</td><td valign="top">Bio-Rad</td><td valign="top">Cat # <break/>1725120</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">GraphPad <break/>Prism V8.4.2</td><td valign="top">GraphPad Software, <break/>La Jolla, CA, USA</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_002798">SCR_002798</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains and plasmids</title><p>Yeast strains and plasmids used in this study are listed and described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p><p>pCM189-L2FRT-T and pCM189-L2FRT-NT, carrying the <italic>leu2-FRT-T</italic> and <italic>leu2-FRT-NT</italic> alleles, were constructed by cloning the BamHI-HindIII fragment of pRS316-FRTa and pRS316-FRTb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ortega et al., 2019</xref>), respectively, into BamHI-HindIII digested pCM189-L2HOr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">González-Barrera et al., 2003</xref>).

Samples were cleaned again using chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1) and isopropanol. DNA was then digested with 50U SpeI-XhoI (New England Biolabs), and analyzed by Southern blot hybridization into Hybond XL+ membranes (GE Healthcare) with a 32<sup>P</sup>-labeled 218-bp <italic>LEU2</italic> probe.

The signals of the Southern blot membrane were quantified using PhosphorImager Fujifilm FLA-5100 and ImageGauge (Fujifilm) programs. Quantification was performed by calculating the signal corresponding to the DSBs (2.4 and 1.4-kb bands) and SCR+ICR (2.9-kb band) relative to the total DNA in each line from each transformant strain. For every band in the gel, we subtracted the background signal from the same line. The repair ratio was determined by dividing the signal corresponding to SCR+ICR (2.9-kb band) by the sum of the total signal corresponding to DSBs (2.4 and 1.4-kb bands) plus SCR+ICR (2.9-kb band). For the analysis of nicks, DNA samples were additionally subjected to electrophoresis at 4°C in alkaline conditions (50 mM NaOH, 1 mM EDTA). Nicks were calculated as two times the difference between the media of total breaks (signal in 2.4 and 1.4-kb bands in alkaline gels) and the media of DSBs (signal in 2.4 and 1.4-kb bands in native conditions).

requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>The manuscript by Ortega et al. aims to answer a very important question in the field. Specifically, the authors ask whether DNA-RNA hybrids formed at the positions of double-strand breaks (DSBs) promote or interfere recombinational repair of the DSBs. Using plasmid-based systems and a chromosomal system in budding yeast, the authors demonstrate that high levels or unprocessed RNA-DNA hybrids interfere with recombination-mediated DSB repair in plasmids and the chromosome. The authors conclude that RNA-DNA hybrids form accidentally at DSBs in transcribed regions must be removed for productive recombinational repair.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;DNA-RNA hybrids at DSBs interfere with repair by homologous recombination&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Wolf-Dietrich Heyer as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript could be improved by the following text additions and clarifications. No additional experimentation is required but the authors may want to consider adding experimentation to address the concern about the efficiency of break formation in the mutants (#5).</p><p>1) Abstract: The abstract should include a sentence about the chromosomal system, as this is critical to generalize the findings with the plasmid-systems.</p><p>2) Figure 1: In 1B, which plasmid data are shown? Please expand this part and show spontaneous loss data for all three plasmids.</p><p>In 1C, could the author comment on why upon HO break the low transcribed substrate is showing elevated plasmid loss compared to the highly transcribed substrate (in WT background)?</p><p>In 1D, could the authors comment on their data in the WT background for replication-dependent DSB on a highly transcribed substrate: RNAseH OE seems to decrease repair efficiency and enhance plasmid loss (2.1 to 14.1), which would argue for a positive function of R-loops in this context. This appears to be different at HO induced breaks, could the authors also comment? Could this indicate that R-loop may be of different nature in these two contexts?</p><p>Why the loss is higher for the lower transcription case? How does it support the model? In general, the case of HO breaks looks very different from FRT-T and FRT-NT (Figure 1c), and this includes the frequencies of plasmid loss in all mutants. So, it is unclear how the results shown in these two panels (Figure 1c vs 1d) are consistent with the model.</p><p>3) Figure 1: The two FLPm plasmids and the HO plasmid have not been analyzed by DRIP for RNA-DNA hybrids, as have the other plasmid and chromosomal systems. Is there a reason for this? The remaining data are strong and include DRIP data, posing the question whether the effort is worth the gain to add such data here. Maybe this part could be moved to the supplement and a caveat about the lack of DRIP data could be added?</p><p>4) Is it possible that hpr1 and rnh1rnh2 mutations affect DSB resection and this could affect the efficiency of repair?</p><p>5) How do we know that the efficiency of DSB formation is not affected by various mutations (hpr1 or rnh1rnh2)? Is it possible that accumulation of DSBs reflects not only the efficiency of break formation, but also the kinetics of their repair? How to be sure that the comparison of repair efficiency is conducted under the conditions of equal number of breaks?</p><p>6) The addition of the chromosomal system is critical to confirm the plasmid-based data. It would be helpful to the reader to have a few sentences on the caveats of the plasmid system.</p><p>7) Figure 2: The normalization of the TINV recombination system should be clarified. I did not fully understand it from the description.</p><p>The difference between the highly transcribed and the low transcribed substrates are not really obvious, as the rnh1rhn201 δ strain also displays a slight decrease in Figure 2c. Could the authors add p values compared to the WT for Figure 2B/c?</p><p>8) Figure 3: Figure 3a and Figure 3b, left: Why are the levels of R-loops the same in wt with and without transcription (compare the level in a vs b)? Is there another mechanism of RNA/DNA hybrid formation in the absence of promoter? Could it be that PolIII is attracted (in addition to PlII) as it was demonstrated in mammalian cells?</p><p>9) Figure 4: The drawing of the repair product for the TINV-HO system is unclear to me. It is the same as Figure 2, where the main inducing lesion is a nick and not a DSB. Shouldn't the product be as drawn in Figure 5 and the product be the same length as the substrate (3.8 kb)? The quantitation and normalization require better description. What are the intermediates, what are/is the product?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69881.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript could be improved by the following text additions and clarifications.

Thank you.</p><p>‘To directly assess whether hybrids formed at DSBs promote or interfere with recombinational repair we have used plasmid and chromosomal-based systems for the analysis of DSB-induced recombination in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>….// Importantly, we show that high levels or unresolved DNA-RNA hybrids at the breaks interfere with their repair by homologous recombination. This interference is observed for both plasmid and chromosomal recombination and is independent of whether the DSB is generated by endonucleolytic cleavage or by DNA replication.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 1: In 1B, which plasmid data are shown? Please expand this part and show spontaneous loss data for all three plasmids.</p></disp-quote><p>This is the result of experiments of spontaneous plasmid loss performed with three transformants with the FRT-T construct and three transformants with the NT construct. However, since there is not break induction, the results can be extrapolated to the HO construct as all three are the same plasmid in which the only variation is the sequence inserted in the leu2 allele (FRT-T FRT-NT or HO). Therefore, we do not expect any difference in the spontaneous source of breaks by changing such short sequences. Since, as stated in the methods section, we preformed these experiments by plating in selective and non-selective media directly after break induction, and not after several rounds of replication in nonselective media, the levels are extremely low (almost undetectable in many cases). Thus, we have now specified the systems used (FRT-T and FRT-NT) and moved this to supplemental (Figure 1—figure supplement 1b) and clarified the text when describing the FRT results (page 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In 1C, could the author comment on why upon HO break the low transcribed substrate is showing elevated plasmid loss compared to the highly transcribed substrate (in WT background)?</p></disp-quote><p>This could be the result of the increased accessibility or affinity of the HO endonuclease to the HO site at repressed chromatin. Indeed, we previously observed that this is the case and demonstrated that the HO cleavage was 2.5- fold lower with high transcription in a similar plasmid (González-Barrera et al. Genetics 2002, Figure 1c).</p><p>We have added this to the text on page 7:</p><p>‘Upon transcription activation, however, wild-type cells reduced the frequency of plasmid loss to 8% (Figure 1b). This is in agreement with our previous observation that HO endonuclease activity at the HO site is less efficient at highly transcribed chromatin (González-Barrera et al., 2002).’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In 1D, could the authors comment on their data in the WT background for replication-dependent DSB on a highly transcribed substrate: RNAseH OE seems to decrease repair efficiency and enhance plasmid loss (2.1 to 14.1), which would argue for a positive function of R-loops in this context. This appears to be different at HO induced breaks, could the authors also comment? Could this indicate that R-loop may be of different nature in these two contexts?</p></disp-quote><p>We have repeated this experiment with two more transformants and we are now representing the mean of 3 or 4 experiments performed with independent transformants for all the plasmid loss data. As it is now stated in the legends and method section, each experiment was performed with 6 colonies from each transformant, from which we considered the median value, as we do for the recombination tests.</p><p>Despite the fact that there is a tendency to an increased plasmid loss when RNase H is overexpressed in the FRT constructs, as mentioned, this is not statistically significant in any of the conditions. This can be caused by the toxic effect of RNase H that has been observed in previous reports (Paulsen et al., 2009; Dominguez-Sanchez et al., 2011). The reason why this is not observed in the HO construct might have to do with the fact that these breaks are replication-independent but also with the fact that RNase H overexpression occurs during 24 hours in the FRT plasmid loss assay and only 1h in the HO. Thus, we modified the text to specify the timing of the experiments on pages 6 and 7 and acknowledged the toxicity of RNAse H overexpression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why the loss is higher for the lower transcription case? How does it support the model? In general, the case of HO breaks looks very different from FRT-T and FRT-NT (Figure 1c), and this includes the frequencies of plasmid loss in all mutants. So, it is unclear how the results shown in these two panels (Figure 1c vs 1d) are consistent with the model.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated above, we believe that this is due to the higher efficiency of HO cleavage under low transcription conditions that has been previously reported (González-Barrera et al., 2002). It is interesting that this is not the case for the FLP but we believe that this is out of the scope of the manuscript. However, the high plasmid loss observed under low transcription might mask the effect of the mutants. Thus, we decided to repeat the experiment upon longer time of HO induction (3 hours instead of 1h). Under these circumstances, we observed that plasmid loss levels rose up to 70% under low transcription conditions demonstrating that higher levels were possible and detectable in our assay. Moreover, we observed that at high transcription conditions, the rnh1Δ rnh2Δ and hpr1Δ mutants showed more than 50% plasmid loss as compared to the 25% of the wild-type strain. These data are now included in the Results section (page 7) and in Figure 1—figure supplement 1c:</p><p>‘Importantly, plasmid loss levels were above 25% in rnh1Δ rnh201Δ and hpr1Δ mutants (Figure 1b). Similar results were obtained after 3h of cleavage-induction, with levels differing from 25% in wt cells to 55% in the mutants (Figure 1–figure supplement 1c).[…] Therefore, whereas rnh1Δ rnh201Δ and hpr1Δ cells led to similar loss levels of cleaved plasmids by either FLPm or HO under low transcription of the plasmidborn leu2 allele, loss frequencies were specifically augmented when leu2 transcription was induced.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 1: The two FLPm plasmids and the HO plasmid have not been analyzed by DRIP for RNA-DNA hybrids, as have the other plasmid and chromosomal systems. Is there a reason for this? The remaining data are strong and include DRIP data, posing the question whether the effort is worth the gain to add such data here. Maybe this part could be moved to the supplement and a caveat about the lack of DRIP data could be added?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that the effort is not worth the gain since the plasmids are similar, except for the additional leu2 repeat that allows us to study repair. We indeed preferred to study the presence of hybrids in the same systems in which we study directly repair and not only plasmid loss. Admitting that it is a possibility, we prefer not moving figure 1 to supplemental since it is the start point for the two types of breaks covered in the study (replication-born and induced by endonucleolitic cleavage). We have now started the second section of results as follows:</p><p>“To directly study DSB repair upon DNA-RNA hybrid accumulation, we took advantage of the TINV recombination system.”</p><p>and the third section of results as follows:</p><p>“To assay whether DNA-RNA hybrids accumulate upon break induction in our repair systems”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Is it possible that hpr1 and rnh1rnh2 mutations affect DSB resection and this could affect the efficiency of repair?</p></disp-quote><p>Certainly, it is possible that the DNA-RNA hybrids accumulated affect resection, since, as discussed on page 12, persistent hybrids caused by depletion of RNase H, helicases or the human exosome have been shown to affect RPA binding and/or DNA end resection in other yeast or human cell studies (Daley et al., 2020; Domingo-Prim et al., 2019; Li et al., 2016; Ohle et al., 2016; Rawal et al., 2020; Sessa et al., 2021; Yu et al., 2020). We have now added the following sentences to the Discussion section to state this possibility clearly. Thank you.</p><p>“It is therefore possible that DNA-RNA hybrid accumulation in hpr1Δ and rnh1Δ rnh201Δ affects repair by negatively interfering with DSB resection. This could be particularly important when the hybrid covers the 5’ end that needs to be resected, although we have observed the formation of break-induced DNA-RNA hybrids at both sides of the break (Figure 3, Figure 3—figure supplement 1, Figure 5, Figure 5—figure supplement 1, Figure 6 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1). The hybrid formed in the 3’ end might initially favor resection of the complementary strand as we previously proposed (Aguilera and Gómez-González, 2017), but we envision that it would need to be removed later to allow the loading of RPA and subsequently Rad51.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) How do we know that the efficiency of DSB formation is not affected by various mutations (hpr1 or rnh1rnh2)? Is it possible that accumulation of DSBs reflects not only the efficiency of break formation, but also the kinetics of their repair? How to be sure that the comparison of repair efficiency is conducted under the conditions of equal number of breaks?</p></disp-quote><p>We cannot establish the efficiency of DSB formation itself but the levels of molecules with nicks or DSBs, which are certainly the result of break formation and repair at each time point. This is indeed the reason why DSBs accumulate at later time points in the hpr1 and rnh1rnh2 mutants, in which we believe that defective repair is occurring. To study this reaction, we estimate the repair efficiency as the ratio between repaired molecules and total molecules that are either cleaved or repaired. We have tried to explain this better on page 7 now as follows:</p><p>“The levels of DSBs detected were higher in rnh1Δ rnh201Δ and hpr1Δ mutants (Figure 2—figure supplement 1c-d). This could be a consequence of either a major efficiency of breakage or a lower efficiency of DSB repair, which in these FRT-based constructs occurs preferentially by SCR (Ortega et al., 2019).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The addition of the chromosomal system is critical to confirm the plasmid-based data. It would be helpful to the reader to have a few sentences on the caveats of the plasmid system.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this information to page 11. Thank you.</p><p>“Although plasmid systems have been recurrently validated as models to study DNA repair and recombination, we wanted to confirm our conclusions in chromosomal DSBs to make sure that any putative local difference in chromatin or topology, even though unlikely, did not affect results.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 2: The normalization of the TINV recombination system should be clarified. I did not fully understand it from the description.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated above, we have explained this better on page 7 now and also in the figure legend. Thank you.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The difference between the highly transcribed and the low transcribed substrates are not really obvious, as the rnh1rhn201 δ strain also displays a slight decrease in Figure 2c. Could the authors add p values compared to the WT for Figure 2B/c?</p></disp-quote><p>We added the information about p-value of two-way Anova tests in the figure 2 legend (p &gt; 0.1 in all cases) and stated in the text that the differences were not significant. On page 7, it now reads:</p><p>“Under high transcription of the FRT site, a subtle but not significant defect in repair was detected in rnh1Δ rnh201Δ cells in both FRT-T and FRT-NT constructs and in hpr1Δ in the FRT-T construct (Figure 2b). Interestingly, such a tendency was not observed under low transcription (Figure 2c) suggesting that although subtle, there could be a repair defect that was transcriptiondependent.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 3: Figure 3a and Figure 3b, left: Why are the levels of R-loops the same in wt with and without transcription (compare the level in a vs b)?</p></disp-quote><p>These are backup levels of hybrids that were not induced by the break. There is no evidence that hybrids form spontaneously at this short leu2 gene, unless Hpr1 is removed, as we see here. In Figure 3b, the signals are not even reduced by RNase H treatment, likely reflecting that they are not hybrids but background signal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is there another mechanism of RNA/DNA hybrid formation in the absence of promoter? Could it be that PolIII is attracted (in addition to PlII) as it was demonstrated in mammalian cells?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting possibility, but we have not observed any break-induced hybrids in the absence of transcription in either of the FRT systems (plasmid in Figure 3b or chromosomal system in Figure 6e). In contrast, some breakinduced hybrids are still present upon transcription inhibition in the HO system, although at lower levels as compared to high transcription conditions (Figure 5e). Thus, we favor the idea that they reflect the leaky transcription from the tet promoter upon transcriptional repression (Figure 1—figure supplement 1a) when levels of breaks are high as those obtained with the HO endonuclease. To be more accurate in the discussion, we have now changed the text as follows:</p><p>“However, we show that this phenomenon is completely dependent on the induction of transcription of the construct driven by the TET promoter in the case of the FLP-induced breaks (Figures 3 and 6) and partially reduced in the case of HO-induced breaks (Figure 5). Therefore, we conclude that DNA breaks lead to DNA-RNA hybrids at both sides of the break due to pre-existing ongoing transcription rather than de novo RNA synthesis previously proposed (Ohle et al., 2016; Rawal et al., 2020).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Figure 4: The drawing of the repair product for the TINV-HO system is unclear to me. It is the same as Figure 2, where the main inducing lesion is a nick and not a DSB. Shouldn't the product be as drawn in Figure 5 and the product be the same length as the substrate (3.8 kb)? The quantitation and normalization require better description. What are the intermediates, what are/is the product?</p></disp-quote><p>We have re-drawn and re-described the systems in figures 2 and 4. Thank you. On page 8, when describing the TINV-FRT systems, we have added:</p><p>“To determine the frequency of SCR we quantified the events involving an exchange between unequal repeats in the two sister chromatids (unequal sister chromatid exchange, uSCE), which leads to a dicentric dimer intermediate that can be visualized a by the 4.7 and 2.9-kb bands resulting from XhoI and SpeI digestion (Figure 2a) (González-Barrera et al., 2003). Given the proximity of the 4.7-kb band to the strong 3.8-kb band arising from the digestion of the more abundant intact plasmid, we relied on the 2.9-kb band to quantify SCR as previously described (Ortega et al., 2019). Other recombination reactions are also possible but known to occur at a minor and irrelevant frequency (Cortés-Ledesma et al., 2007). Thus, to estimate repair at each time-point, we calculated the ratio between the SCR-derived molecules (2.9-kb fragment, Figure 2a) and the sum of repaired and cleaved molecules (2.9-kb, 2.4 and 1.4-kb fragments, Figure 2a) (see Methods).”</p><p>And on page 11, when describing the TINV-FO system, we have modified the text as follows:</p><p>“As in the previous systems, the 2.4 and 1.4-kb bands corresponded to DSBs and the 2.9-kb band to HR repair intermediates, which in this case would mostly result from BIR initiated from one of the DSB ends invading the truncated repeat located in the same chromatid, an intrachromatid recombination (ICR) reaction (Figure 4a). This is so because an intact sister chromatid for SCR would only be present in G2 when only one of the chromatids was cleaved by chance, and we determined the HR repair ratios (Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
