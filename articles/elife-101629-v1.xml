science. However, kokumi has not been well studied in gustatory physiology, and the underlying neuroscientific mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Our previous research demonstrated that ornithine (L-ornithine), which is abundant in shijimi clams, enhanced taste preferences in mice. The present study aimed to build on these findings and investigate the mechanisms responsible for kokumi in rats. In two-bottle preference tests, the addition of ornithine, at a low concentration that did not increase the favorability of this substance alone, enhanced the animals’ preferences for umami, sweet, fatty, salty, and bitter solutions, with the intake of monosodium glutamate showing the most significant increase. Additionally, a mixture of umami and ornithine synergistically induced significant responses in the chorda tympani nerve, which transmits taste information to the brain from the anterior part of the tongue. The observed preference enhancement and increase in taste-nerve response were abolished by antagonists of the G-protein-coupled receptor family C group 6 subtype A (GPRC6A). Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis indicated that GPRC6A was expressed in a subset of type II taste cells in rat fungiform papillae. These results provide new insights into flavor-enhancement mechanisms, confirming that ornithine is a kokumi substance and GPRC6A is a novel kokumi receptor.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ornithine</kwd><kwd>kokumi</kwd><kwd>GPRC6A</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP17K00835</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yamamoto</surname><given-names>Takashi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP22K11803</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ueji</surname><given-names>Kayoko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The enhanced taste and flavor of food induced by the addition of L-ornithine, referred to as 'kokumi' in humans, may be mediated by GPRC6A receptors expressed in taste cells.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Enjoying delicious food is a fundamental pleasure in daily life and contributes toward both physical and mental well-being. The perception of deliciousness requires the harmonious integration of various sensory experiences, including the five basic tastes (sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami), the taste of fat, spices, aroma, texture, temperature, sight, and sound. These inputs are transmitted to the brain via sensory nerves, where sensory modalities and qualitative information are analyzed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rolls, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Spector and Travers, 2005</xref>). Beyond these cognitive aspects, the brain further processes these sensations to evoke emotional responses, contributing to palatability or unpleasantness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Small, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yamamoto, 2008</xref>). Therefore, sensory information from substances entering the oral and nasal cavities influences both cognition and emotions.</p><p>Conversely, despite having minimal direct taste effects and a lack of clear information for the brain to process, some substances and their receptors can modify taste information mainly at the peripheral level, thereby controlling palatability. Specifically, recent research on taste modification has focused on ‘kokumi’ substances and receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmad and Dalziel, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kuroda, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yamamoto and Inui-Yamamoto, 2023</xref>). Kokumi is a Japanese word that denotes enhanced tastiness of food comprising complex ingredients. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ohsu et al., 2010</xref>, when kokumi substances such as glutathione or γ-Glu-Val-Gly are added to chicken consommé at low concentrations that do not produce a specific taste of their own, they bind to the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) to induce kokumi by enhancing the ‘thickness’, ‘mouthfulness’, and ‘continuity’ of the dish.</p><p>These three attributes were originally introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ueda et al., 1997</xref>, who translated Japanese terms describing the profound characteristics of kokumi, which are deeply rooted in Japanese culinary culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yamamoto and Inui-Yamamoto, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nishimura, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yamamoto, 2019</xref>). However, these simply translated terms have caused global misunderstanding and confusion because they sound like somatosensory rather than gustatory descriptions. Therefore, to clarify that kokumi attributes are inherently gustatory, in the present study we use the terms ‘intensity of whole complex tastes (rich flavor with complex tastes)’ instead of thickness, ‘mouthfulness (spread of taste and flavor throughout the oral cavity)’, and ‘persistence of taste (lingering flavor)’ instead of continuity.</p><p>Several studies have been conducted on CaSR agonists as candidate kokumi substances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Feng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kuroda et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kuroda et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Salger et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shibata et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Toelstede et al., 2009</xref>), although neuroscientific research on the mechanism of kokumi induction remains limited and underdeveloped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bigiani and Rhyu, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rhyu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yamamoto and Mizuta, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Maruyama, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yamamoto and Mizuta, 2022</xref>). In contrast, our previous study in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mizuta et al., 2021</xref>) focused on ornithine, a non-protein amino acid, as a potential kokumi substance and suggested that the G-protein-coupled receptor family C group 6 subtype A (GPRC6A) is responsible for its action, given that ornithine has a high affinity for this receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wellendorph and Bräuner-Osborne, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Christiansen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Oya et al., 2013</xref>). As this is the only published study to propose GPRC6A as a potential kokumi receptor other than CaSR, this hypothesis needs to be confirmed.</p><p>Neuroscientific studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Maruyama et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yamamoto and Mizuta, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yamamoto et al., 2009</xref>) in mice and rats provide evidence that glutathione and y-Glu-Val-Gly activate CaSRs, and modify behavioral responses to other tastants in a way that may correspond to kokumi as experienced by humans. However, to our best knowledge, only our prior study in mice has examined ornithine as a kokumi candidate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mizuta et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, the current study aimed to investigate the effects of ornithine on sweet, salty, sour, bitter, umami, and fatty taste enhancement in rats and to clarify the involvement of the GPRC6A receptor. Whether rodents are suitable models for kokumi research is unclear; however, if the expression of kokumi flavor is fundamental to the enjoyment of delicious food, there should be basic mechanisms common to humans and rodents, even if a similar human perception of kokumi is difficult to detect in rats. Elucidating these neuroscientific mechanisms may shed light on the elusive nature of kokumi in humans.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Two-bottle preference tests in rats</title><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Additive effects of ornithine at different concentrations</title><p>To investigate whether ornithine has a favorable taste, we conducted a preference test by comparing distilled water (DW) with aqueous solutions containing various ornithine concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Next, we examined the additive effect of ornithine at the same concentrations on the preference for 0.03 M monosodium glutamate (MSG; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Subsequent Bonferroni analyses indicated that the addition of ornithine at concentrations ranging from 1 to 30 mM resulted in significantly greater intake (p&lt;0.001) than that for MSG alone.

However, the rats showed no difference in preference for citric acid regardless of the addition of 1 mM ornithine. In contrast, QHCl with ornithine was preferred at three of the four concentrations, suggesting that the aversive taste of QHCl was attenuated by ornithine.

A small subpopulation of GPRC6A-immunopositive cells was found to be immunoreactive for IP3R3, a marker for the majority of the type II cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Approximately 11% of GPRC6A-positive cells overlapped with IP3R3 (9 double-positive cells/80 GPRC6A-positive cells), while approximately 8.3% of IP3R3-positive cells expressed GPRC6A (9 double-positive/109 IP3R3-positive cells).

Similar increases in ingestion were observed in a short-term two-bottle preference test using MSG supplemented with ornithine, indicating that this effect was due to the taste sensation in the oral cavity rather than post-ingestive effects. Furthermore, the disappearance of ornithine’s effect on MSG following the application of GPRC6A antagonists and transection of the CT nerve, which innervates taste buds in the anterior tongue, suggests that GPRC6A, which was expressed in the taste cells in this area, is involved in this effect. Supporting this finding, the response of the CT nerve to MSG increased with ornithine supplementation, and the action of a GPRC6A antagonist abolished this change. In addition, immunohistochemical staining showed that GPRC6A predominantly appeared in the fungiform papillae of the anterior tongue rather than in the foliate or circumvallate papillae of the posterior tongue. Despite the differences described below, these results align with our previous findings in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mizuta et al., 2021</xref>). Together with those from our human study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), these results confirm that ornithine is a potential kokumi substance and that GPRC6A is a candidate kokumi receptor. These insights provide basic neuroscientific knowledge for interpreting the observation in humans that adding ornithine to miso soup, which has a rich umami flavor with slightly sweet and salty tastes, enhances the three elements of kokumi: intensity of whole complex tastes, mouthfulness (spread of taste in the oral cavity), and persistence of taste.</p><p>Several similarities and differences are apparent when comparing the results obtained with those of our previous study in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mizuta et al., 2021</xref>). In both studies, the same concentration of ornithine was used for supplementation (1 mM). The addition of ornithine increased the favorability of basic tastes including umami, sweet, fatty, salty, and bitter tastes, with a more pronounced preference for MSG than IMP among the umami substances. However, while a weak increase in citric acid preference was observed in mice, no such effect was identified in rats. The effects of GPRC6A antagonists and the CT-nerve responses were consistent between the two species. However, the expression of GPRC6A differed considerably; in mice, this protein was expressed throughout the tongue, particularly in the posterior part, whereas in rats, it was predominantly localized to the anterior region of the tongue. Finally, another major difference is that while mice avoided high concentrations of ornithine, rats seemed to prefer them.</p><p>Regarding the increased preference for the umami substances IMP, MSG, and MPG when supplemented with ornithine, one may naturally interpret this as an ornithine-enhanced umami response. However, the possibility that umami substances enhance the response to ornithine should be considered. Depending on its concentration, ornithine may stimulate at least three receptors, namely GPRC6A, CaSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Conigrave et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shin et al., 2020</xref>), and the conventional amino acid receptor, the T1R1/T1R3 heterodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nelson et al., 2002</xref>). At the low concentration of 1 mM used in the present study, GPRC6A may be exclusively stimulated, whereas higher concentrations may also stimulate T1R1/T1R3, thereby transmitting ornithine taste information via this receptor. Compared with GPRC6A, CaSR may have limited to no involvement, since EGCG, a GPRC6A-specific antagonist, significantly abolished the increased preference induced by ornithine. Umami substances may promote the binding of ornithine to these receptors. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tanase et al., 2022</xref> showed that the taste intensity of ornithine increased in the presence of IMP in humans. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ueda et al., 1997</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dunkel et al., 2007</xref> reported that the taste thresholds for glutathione and glutamyl peptides, agonists of CaSR, were reduced by umami solutions. In rats, ornithine has a favorable taste, and its palatability increased with its concentration (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). When added to ornithine, MSG may enhance the response to ornithine, thereby increasing its palatability. This concept also explains the mixed effects of ornithine and MSG observed in mice. The taste of ornithine itself was increasingly disliked as its concentration was raised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mizuta et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, although the addition of ornithine at concentrations below 3 mM increased palatability, its favorability ceased at concentrations of 10 and 30 mM. Taste information sent by ornithine as its concentration increases, whether pleasant or unpleasant, is likely mediated by the conventional amino acid receptor T1R1/T1R3 rather than GPRC6A. Thus, umami substances may facilitate ornithine stimulation of both kokumi and amino acid receptors in a concentration-dependent manner. Ornithine and umami substances interact to produce synergistic effects on palatability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yamamoto and Inui-Yamamoto, 2023</xref>).</p><p>The essence of kokumi expression is the enrichment of tastes associated with deliciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yamamoto and Inui-Yamamoto, 2023</xref>). In our experiments with rats (present study) and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mizuta et al., 2021</xref>), adding ornithine to favorable-tasting solutions such as umami, sweet, and fatty solutions increased their tastiness. This can be explained by the enhanced electrophysiological responses to these tastes induced by ornithine, as evidenced by increased CT-nerve responses for MSG in rats and mice and for other tastes in mice. Conversely, the increased palatability of the aversive bitter taste in both species suggests that ornithine suppresses the response to bitterness. Although the addition of ornithine to quinine slightly decreased the CT-nerve response in mice, this difference was not statistically significant. Reports have shown that ornithine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tokuyama et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ogawa et al., 2005</xref>) and arginine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pi et al., 2018</xref>), which is structurally highly similar to ornithine, both decrease the bitter taste sensation in humans; however, the underlying mechanism is not well understood. We conducted additional experiments in rats using gallate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), which has been reported as an agonist of GPRC6A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Melis and Tomassini Barbarossa, 2017</xref>). Similar to ornithine, gallate increased the palatability of MSG and quinine, although this effect was abolished by EGCG. Notably, this suggests that GPRC6A agonists may augment responses to favorable tastes such as umami and sweetness, while inhibiting responses to bitter tastes, leading to an overall enhancement of deliciousness.</p><p>The CaSR agonist γ-Glu-Val-Gly similarly enhanced the preference for umami, sweet, and fatty tastes in rats, but showed no effect on the favorability of salty, sour, or bitter tastes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yamamoto and Mizuta, 2022</xref>). Additionally, while ornithine increased the preference for MSG more than that for IMP, γ-Glu-Val-Gly had the opposite effect. Unlike those of ornithine, the effects of γ-Glu-Val-Gly were not altered by severance of the CT nerve, likely because CaSR is expressed in both the anterior and posterior parts of the tongue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">San Gabriel et al., 2009</xref>). The results of the present study, along with those of our previous animal experiments, clearly demonstrate that the binding of kokumi substances to their receptors triggers the expression of kokumi. However, the mechanism by which this binding enhances the response to umami, fatty, sweet, and other tastes remains unknown. Considering our observation that GPRC6A was co-expressed in type II taste cells positive for IP3R3, some of these cells may be affected by GPRC6A activation. However, it is difficult to explain why co-expression with α-gustducin, which binds to taste receptors in type II cells, was not observed. While we did not examine the co-expression of GPRC6A with the T1R or T2R families, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Maruyama et al., 2012</xref> reported that CaSR is not co-expressed with receptors for umami, sweet, or other tastes in mice. Some form of intercellular communication within taste buds that affects these tastes is possible, although the detailed mechanism requires further research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Maruyama, 2024</xref>). Whether GPRC6A and CaSR colocalize to the same taste cells should also be considered; however, we have not yet identified any taste cells in which these proteins are co-expressed in our ongoing experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition to the above, it is noteworthy that kokumi-active γ-glutamyl peptides have a stronger affinity for the T1R1-MSG receptor complex than for the T1R2-sucrose receptor complex, as demonstrated by molecular modeling approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yang et al., 2022</xref>). This suggests that these peptides exhibit a greater umami-enhancing effect without the involvement of kokumi-specific receptors.</p><p>While many candidate kokumi substances have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kuroda, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Feng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Salger et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shibata et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Toelstede et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bigiani and Rhyu, 2023</xref>), we are currently exploring the underlying neuroscientific mechanisms using CaSR agonists such as glutathione and γ-Glu-Val-Gly, and GPRC6A agonists such as ornithine and gallate. A common finding in our animal experiments is that these substances enhanced umami to a greater extent than other tastes. They also enhanced sweet and fatty tastes, and to a lesser extent, saltiness. CT recordings indicate that the effects of kokumi stimuli on taste enhancement occur primarily in the peripheral taste organs. When taste responses are individually enhanced and the resulting sensory signals are then transmitted to the brain, where they are processed by the central gustatory and flavor systems, the ‘intensity of whole complex tastes (or rich flavor with complex tastes)’ associated with kokumi may arise. Kokumi substances may reduce the threshold concentrations as well as increase the suprathreshold responses of tastants. Once the threshold concentrations are lowered, additional taste cells in the oral cavity become activated, and this information is transmitted to the brain. As a result, the brain perceives this input as coming from a wider area of the mouth, leading to the sensation of ‘mouthfulness’. Regarding the ‘persistence of taste (lingering flavor)’, it is common sensory physiological knowledge that a strong stimulus causes a large response that takes more time to return to baseline, thereby inducing a longer-lasting sensation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kawasaki et al., 2016</xref>). Using a kokumi substance to enhance umami, a taste known for its mouthfulness and lingering quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yamamoto and Inui-Yamamoto, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kawasaki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yamaguchi, 1998</xref>), further intensifies these characteristics. The comparatively prolonged aftertaste of umami is due to the dominance of umami receptors in taste buds located in the grooves of the circumvallate and foliate papillae at the back of the tongue, where umami substances are less likely to be washed away. This is evidenced by stronger and more specific umami responses from the posterior rather than the anterior part of the tongue in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Danilova and Hellekant, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ninomiya and Funakoshi, 1989</xref>) and primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yamaguchi, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hellekant et al., 1997</xref>). Moreover, MSG binds deeply within the Venus flytrap domain of the umami receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>), making it difficult to dislodge.</p><p>In conclusion, when kokumi substances are present in complex foods containing umami substances, their interaction primarily enriches the umami taste, followed by sweet and fatty tastes, and to a lesser extent salty and possibly other tastes. This enhancement is at the core of richness, which is accompanied by the secondary sensations of mouthfulness and persistence of taste. Since ornithine is abundant in foods such as shijimi clams (<italic>Corbicula japonica</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Uchisawa et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wu and Shiau, 2002</xref>), cheese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Renes et al., 2019</xref>), and shimeji and maitake mushrooms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Oka et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wagemaker et al., 2007</xref>), we can enjoy the kokumi-enhanced flavor of cuisines that incorporate these ingredients.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Eight-week-old male Wistar rats were obtained from Japan SLC (Shizuoka, Japan).

The next three groups were used for respective brief-exposure tests of (1) DW vs. DW with 1 mM ornithine and 0.03 M MSG vs. 0.03 M MSG with 1 mM ornithine, (2) MSG vs. MSG with ornithine, both containing 60 or 300 μM calindol, and (3) MSG vs. MSG with ornithine, both containing 30 or 100 μM EGCG. The final eight groups underwent long-term tests. Six of these were used to assess different concentrations of IMP, MSG, MPG, sucrose, Intralipos, and NaCl with and without 1 mM ornithine, respectively. One group was used to test both citric acid and QHCl with and without 1 mM ornithine. The last group was used to test both MSG and QHCl with and without 1 mM ethylene gallate.</p><p>When examining the range of ornithine and tastant concentrations, we presented the solutions to the animals starting with the lowest concentration. If two different tastants were tested in one group, as in the first of the brief-exposure tests and the long-term test for citric acid and QHCl, the order of presentation was counterbalanced. Statistical analyses were performed within groups or between taste stimuli with and without ornithine, but not across different groups or taste stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Transection of the CT nerve</title><p>Eight naïve rats were randomly divided into transection and sham-operation groups (four rats each). They underwent the long-term two-bottle preference test as described above, with the bottles containing 0.03 M MSG with and without 1 mM ornithine. Thereafter, the animals were anesthetized via intraperitoneal injection of a combination anesthetic (0.3 mg/kg medetomidine, 4.0 mg/kg midazolam, and 5.0 mg/kg butorphanol). In the transection group, the ear ossicles through which the CT innervates the taste buds on the anterior part of the tongue were removed bilaterally, whereas in the sham-operation group, the operation was stopped immediately before the removal of ear ossicles. Postoperatively, the rats were injected with penicillin G sodium (100 mg/kg) to prevent infection. After 6 days of recovery, the same rats were subjected to the long-term two-bottle preference test using the same taste stimuli. The mean group preferences were then compared. After the experiment, transection was confirmed by microscopic verification of the loss of taste buds on the tongue.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Taste-nerve recordings</title><p>Five naïve rats were deeply anesthetized as described above. Each rat was tracheotomized and secured in a head-holder. The left CT nerve was exposed using a lateral approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yamamoto and Kawamura, 1972</xref>), excised as it exited the tympanic bulla, and dissected from the underlying tissue. The nerve was placed onto a platinum-wire recording electrode (0.1 mm diameter), while an indifferent electrode was placed in contact with a nearby exposed tissue. The responses were processed using a bandpass filter with cutoff frequencies ranging from 40 Hz to 3 kHz and visualized using an oscilloscope (VC11; Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan). The responses were fed to a digitally controlled summator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Walsh and Halpern, 1974</xref>). The number of discharges was summed over 500 ms epochs using a spike counter (DSE-345; DIA Medical System, Tokyo, Japan) to derive summated responses. The data were stored on a PC, and the total spikes over the entire 30-second stimulus period were counted using the PowerLab system (PowerLab/4SP; ADInstruments, Bella Vista, NSW, Australia) for quantitative analyses.</p><p>Each taste stimulus (3 mL) was applied to the anterior dorsal tongue for 30 seconds, followed by rinsing with DW for at least 60 seconds. The response to each stimulus was expressed relative to the magnitude of responses to 0.1 M NH<sub>4</sub>Cl. The analyses of CT results were based on the average values from at least three repeated trials in individual animals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Male Wistar rats (8–12 weeks old) were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and transcardially perfused with saline followed by 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer. To label serotonin-accumulating type III taste cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yee et al., 2001</xref>), rats were injected with 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophan at 80 mg/kg body weight 1 hour before anesthesia. Their tongues were dissected out, soaked in 20% sucrose/0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) overnight at 4°C, embedded in optimal-cutting-temperature compound (Sakura Finetek, Tokyo, Japan), and cut into 20 µm thick sections using a cryostat. The sections were immersed in 0.01 M PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and incubated overnight at 4°C with rabbit anti-GPRC6A antibody (1:50; orb385435; Biorbyt, Cambridge, UK) in combination with either goat anti-IP3R3 (1:100; NB100-2545; Novus, Centennial, CO, USA), anti-α-gustducin (1:500; LSB4942; LSBio, Seattle, WA, USA), anti-5-HT (1:100; ab66047; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), anti-SNAP25 antibody (1:100; ab31281; Abcam), or mouse anti-CaSR antibody (1:100; ab19347; Abcam) diluted in the same Triton X-100-containing solution. This was followed by Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG; 1:500; A-21207; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and 488-conjugated anti-goat IgG secondary antibodies (1:500; A-11055; Thermo Fisher Scientific). After washing, the sections were cover-slipped with Fluoromount (Diagnostic BioSystems, Pleasanton, CA, USA) and imaged using a Nikon A1Rs confocal laser scanning microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). The specificity of the anti-GPRC6A antibody was verified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mizuta et al., 2021</xref>) (data not shown). IP3R3 is a marker protein in most type II taste cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sekerková et al., 2005</xref>). Further, α-gustducin, 5-HT, and SNAP25 are markers of a subset of types II, III, and III taste cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mizuta et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yee et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sekerková et al., 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Human sensory testing</title><p>We recruited 22 participants (19 women and 3 men, aged 21–28 years) from Kio University who were not affiliated with our laboratory, including students and staff members. All participants passed a screening test based on taste sensitivity. According to the responses obtained from a pre-experimental questionnaire, we confirmed that none of the participants had any sensory abnormalities, eating disorders, or mental disorders, or were taking any medications that may potentially affect their sense of taste. All participants were instructed not to eat or drink anything for 1 hour prior to the start of the experiment. We provided them with a detailed explanation of the experimental procedures, including safety measures and personal data protection, without revealing the specific goals of the study.

Subsequently, three test soups were prepared by dissolving 1, 3, or 10 mM L-ornithine in the control soup. An aliquot of 30 mL of each test soup was randomly served in a paper cup along with a cup of control soup. Intensity of taste, mouthfulness, and persistence of taste were evaluated according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ohsu et al., 2010</xref>. Intensity was expressed as the increased taste intensity 5 seconds after tasting. Persistence was defined as lingering taste intensity 20 seconds after tasting. Finally, mouthfulness was described as the reinforcement of taste sensations throughout the mouth, not just on the tongue. The participants evaluated the three attributes of the test soups on a 5-point rating scale ranging from –2 (apparently suppressed) to +2 (apparently strong). Additionally, the palatability of each sample was evaluated on a similar scale ranging from –2 (apparently bad) to +2 (apparently good). All the values for the three kokumi attributes and palatability were set to 0 for the control soup.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Data are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). A Shapiro–Wilk test was performed to confirm that the data were normally distributed.

Additionally, to analyze more than three groups, we used a one-way ANOVA or repeated-measures two-way ANOVA with post hoc Bonferroni tests to account for multiple comparisons. All statistical analyses were conducted in SPSS Statistics Version 25.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.05, except when the Bonferroni correction was used.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - original draft</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>We recruited 22 participants (19 women and three men, aged 21–28 years) from Kio University who were not affiliated with our laboratory, including students and staff members.

Ornithine also increases CT nerve responses to MSG. Additionally, the authors provide evidence that the effects of ornithine are mediated by GPRC6A, a G-protein-coupled receptor family C group 6 subtype A, and that this receptor is expressed primarily in fungiform taste buds. Taken together, these results indicate that ornithine enhances the palatability of multiple taste stimuli in rats, and that the enhancement is mediated, at least in part, within fungiform taste buds. This finding could stand on its own. The question of whether ornithine produces these effects by eliciting kokumi-like perceptions (see below) should be presented as speculation in the Discussion section.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>I am still unconvinced that the measurements in rats reflect the &quot;kokumi&quot; taste percept described in humans. The authors conducted long-term preference tests, 10-min avidity tests and whole chorda tympani (CT) nerve recordings. None of these procedures specifically model features of &quot;kokumi&quot; perception in humans, which (according to the authors) include increasing &quot;intensity of whole complex tastes (rich flavor with complex tastes), mouthfulness (spread of taste and flavor throughout the oral cavity), and persistence of taste (lingering flavor).&quot; While it may be possible to develop behavioral assays in rats (or mice) that effectively model kokumi taste perception in humans, the authors have not made any effort to do so. As a result, I do not think that the rat data provide support for the main conclusion of the study--that &quot;ornithine is a kokumi substance and GPRC6A is a novel kokumi receptor.&quot;</p><p>Why are the authors hypothesizing that the primary impacts of ornithine are on the peripheral taste system? While the CT recordings provide support for peripheral taste enhancement, they do not rule out the possibility of additional central enhancement. Indeed, based on the definition of human kokumi described above, it is likely that the effects of kokumi stimuli in humans are mediated at least in part by the central flavor system.</p><p>The authors include (in the supplemental data section) a pilot study that examined the impact of ornithine on variety of subjective measures of flavor perception in humans. The presence of this pilot study within the larger rat study does not really make sense. If the human studies are so important, as the authors state, then why did the authors relegate them to the supplemental data section? Usually one places background and negative findings in this section of a paper. Accordingly, I recommend that the human data be published in a separate article.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.101629.4.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study the authors set out to investigate whether GPRC6A mediates kokumi taste initiated by the amino acid L-ornithine. They used Wistar rats, a standard laboratory strain, as the primary model and also performed an informative taste test in humans, in which miso soup was supplemented with various concentrations of L-ornithine. The findings are valuable and overall the evidence is solid. L-Ornithine should be considered to be a useful test substance in future studies of kokumi taste and the class C G protein coupled receptor known as GPRC6A (C6A) along with its homolog, the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) should be considered candidate mediators of kokumi taste. The researchers confirmed in rats their previous work on Ornithine and C6A in mice (Mizuta et al Nutrients 2021).</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The overall experimental design is solid based on two bottle preference tests in rats. After determining the optimal concentration for L-Ornithine (1 mM) in the presence of MSG, it was added to various tastants including: inosine 5'-monophosphate; monosodium glutamate (MSG); mono-potassium glutamate (MPG); intralipos (a soybean oil emulsion); sucrose; sodium chloride (NaCl; salt); citric acid (sour) and quinine hydrochloride (bitter). Robust effects of ornithine were observed in the cases of IMP, MSG, MPG and sucrose; and little or no effects were observed in the cases of sodium chloride, citric acid; quinine HCl. The researchers then focused on the preference for Ornithine-containing MSG solutions. Inclusion of the C6A inhibitors Calindol (0.3 mM but not 0.06 mM) or the gallate derivative EGCG (0.1 mM but not 0.03 mM) eliminated the preference for solutions that contained Ornithine in addition to MSG. The researchers next performed transections of the chord tympani nerves (with sham operation controls) in anesthetized rats to identify a role of the chorda tympani branches of the facial nerves (cranial nerve VII) in the preference for Ornithine-containing MSG solutions. This finding implicates the anterior half-two thirds of the tongue in ornithine-induced kokumi taste. They then used electrical recordings from intact chorda tympani nerves in anesthetized rats to demonstrate that ornithine enhanced MSG-induced responses following the application of tastants to the anterior surface of the tongue. They went on to show that this enhanced response was insensitive to amiloride, selected to inhibit 'salt tastant' responses mediated by the epithelial Na+ channel, but eliminated by Calindol. Finally they performed immunohistochemistry on sections of rat tongue demonstrating C6A positive spindle-shaped cells in fungiform papillae that partially overlapped in its distribution with the IP3 type-3 receptor, used as a marker of Type-II cells, but not with (i) gustducin, the G protein partner of Tas1 receptors (T1Rs), used as a marker of a subset of type-II cells; or (ii) 5-HT (serotonin) and Synaptosome-associated protein 25 kDa (SNAP-25) used as markers of Type-III cells.</p><p>At least two other receptors in addition to C6A might mediate taste responses to ornithine: (i) the CaSR, which binds and responds to multiple L-amino acids (Conigrave et al, PNAS 2000), and which has been previously reported to mediate kokumi taste (Ohsu et al., JBC 2010) as well as responses to Ornithine (Shin et al., Cell Signaling 2020); and (ii) T1R1/T1R3 heterodimers which also respond to L-amino acids and exhibit enhanced responses to IMP (Nelson et al., Nature 2001). These alternatives are appropriately discussed and, taken together, the experimental results favor the authors' interpretation that C6A mediates the Ornithine responses. The authors provide preliminary data in Suppl. 3 for the possibility of co-expression of C6A with the CaSR.</p><p>In the Discussion, the authors consider the potential effects of kokumi substances on the threshold concentrations of key tastants such as glutamate, arguing that extension of taste distribution to additional areas of the mouth (previously referred to as 'mouthfulness') and persistence of taste/flavor responses (previously referred to as 'continuity') could arise from a reduction in the threshold concentrations of umami and other substances that evoke taste responses. This concept may help to design future experiments.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The authors point out that animal models pose some difficulties of interpretation in studies of taste and raise the possibility in the Discussion that umami substances may enhance the taste response to ornithine (Line 271, Page 9).</p><p>The status of one of the compounds used as an inhibitor of C6A, the gallate derivative EGCG, as a potential inhibitor of the CaSR or T1R1/T1R3 is unknown. It would have been helpful to show that a specific inhibitor of the CaSR failed to block the ornithine response.</p><p>It would have been helpful to include a positive control kokumi substance in the two bottle preference experiment (e.g., one of the known gamma glutamyl peptides such as gamma-glu-Val-Gly or glutathione), to compare the relative potencies of the control kokumi compound and Ornithine, and to compare the sensitivities of the two responses to C6A and CaSR inhibitors.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.101629.4.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yamamoto</surname><given-names>Takashi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Kio University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Nara</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ueji</surname><given-names>Kayoko</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Kio University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Nara</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Mizuta</surname><given-names>Haruno</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Kio University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Nara</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Inui-Yamamoto</surname><given-names>Chizuko</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Osaka University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Osaka</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kumamoto</surname><given-names>Natsuko</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Nagoya City University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Nagoya</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Shibata</surname><given-names>Yasuhiro</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Nagoya City University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Nagoya</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ugawa</surname><given-names>Shinya</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Nagoya City University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Nagoya</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper contains what could be described as a &quot;classic&quot; approach towards evaluating a novel taste stimuli in an animal model, including standard behavioral tests (some with nerve transections), taste nerve physiology, and immunocytochemistry of taste cells of the tongue.

Additionally, the authors provide evidence that the effects of ornithine are mediated by GPRC6A, a G-protein-coupled receptor family C group 6 subtype A, and that this receptor is expressed primarily in fungiform taste buds. Taken together, these results indicate that ornithine enhances the palatability of multiple taste stimuli in rats and that the enhancement is mediated, at least in part, within fungiform taste buds. This is an important finding that could stand on its own. The question of whether ornithine produces these effects by eliciting kokumi-like perceptions (see below) should be presented as speculation in the Discussion section.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>I am still unconvinced that the measurements in rats reflect the &quot;kokumi&quot; taste percept described in humans. The authors conducted long-term preference tests, 10-min avidity tests and whole chorda tympani (CT) nerve recordings. None of these procedures specifically model features of &quot;kokumi&quot; perception in humans, which (according to the authors) include increasing &quot;intensity of whole complex tastes (rich flavor with complex tastes), mouthfulness (spread of taste and flavor throughout the oral cavity), and persistence of taste (lingering flavor).&quot; While it may be possible to develop behavioral assays in rats (or mice) that effectively model kokumi taste perception in humans, the authors have not made any effort to do so. As a result, I do not think that the rat data provide support for the main conclusion of the study--that &quot;ornithine is a kokumi substance and GPRC6A is a novel kokumi receptor.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Kokumi can be assessed in humans, as demonstrated by the enhanced kokumi perception observed when miso soup is supplemented with ornithine (Fig. S1). Currently, we do not have a method to measure the same kokumi perception in animals. However, in the two-bottle preference test, our previous companion paper (Fig. 1B in Mizuta et al. 2021, Ref. #26) confirmed that miso soup supplemented with 3 mM L-ornithine (but not D-ornithine) was statistically significantly (P &lt; 0.001) preferred over plain miso soup by mice.</p><p>Of the three attributes of kokumi perception in humans, the “intensity of whole complex tastes (rich flavor with complex tastes)” was partly demonstrated in the present rat study. In contrast, “mouthfulness (the spread of taste and flavor throughout the oral cavity)” could not be directly detected in animals and had to be inferred in the Discussion. “Persistence of taste (lingering flavor)” was evident at least in the chorda tympani responses; however, because the tongue was rinsed 30 seconds after the onset of stimulation, the duration of the response was not fully recorded.</p><p>It is well accepted in sensory physiology that the stronger the stimulus, the larger the tonic response—and consequently, the longer it takes for the response to return to baseline. For example, Kawasaki et al. (2016, Ref. #45) clearly showed that the duration of sensation increased proportionally with the concentration of MSG, lactic acid, and NaCl in human sensory tests. The essence of this explanation has been incorporated into the Discussion (p. 12).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why are the authors hypothesizing that the primary impacts of ornithine are on the peripheral taste system? While the CT recordings provide support for peripheral taste enhancement, they do not rule out the possibility of additional central enhancement. Indeed, based on the definition of human kokumi described above, it is likely that the effects of kokumi stimuli in humans are mediated at least in part by the central flavor system.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s comment. Our CT recordings indicate that the effects of kokumi stimuli on taste enhancement occur primarily at the peripheral taste organs. The resulting sensory signals are then transmitted to the brain, where they are processed by the central gustatory and flavor systems, ultimately giving rise to kokumi attributes. This central involvement in kokumi perception is discussed on page 12. Although kokumi substances exert their effects at low concentrations—levels at which the substance itself (e.g., ornithine) does not become more favorable or (in the case of γ-Glu-Val-Gly) exhibits no distinct taste—we cannot rule out the possibility that even faint taste signals from these substances are transmitted to the brain and interact with other taste modalities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors include (in the supplemental data section) a pilot study that examined the impact of ornithine on variety of subjective measures of flavor perception in humans. The presence of this pilot study within the larger rat study does not really mice sense. While I agree with the authors that there is value in conducting parallel tests in both humans and rodents, I think that this can only be done effectively when the measurements in both species are the same. For this reason, I recommend that the human data be published in a separate article.</p></disp-quote><p>Despite the reviewer’s suggestion, we intend to include the human sensory experiment. Our rationale is that we must first demonstrate that the kokumi of miso soup is enhanced by the addition of ornithine, and then follow up with basic animal experiments to investigate the potential underlying mechanisms of kokumi in humans.</p><p>In our previous companion paper (Fig. 1B in Mizuta et al., 2021, Ref. #26), we confirmed with statistical significance (P &lt; 0.001) that mice preferred miso soup supplemented with 3 mM L-ornithine (but not D-ornithine) over plain miso soup. However, as explained in our response to Reviewer #2’s first concern (in the Public review), it is difficult to measure two of the three kokumi attributes—aside from the “intensity of whole complex tastes (rich flavor with complex tastes)”—in animal models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors indicated on several occasions (e.g., see Abstract) that ornithine produced &quot;synergistic&quot; effects on the CT nerve response to chemical stimuli. &quot;Synergy&quot; is used to describe a situation where two stimuli produce an effect that is greater than the sum of the response to each stimulus alone (i.e., 2 + 2 = 5). As far as I can tell, the CT recordings in Fig. 3 do not reflect a synergism.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate your comments regarding the definition of synergy. In Fig. 5 (not Fig. 3), please note the difference in the scaling of the ordinate between Fig. 5D (ornithine responses) and Fig. 5E (MSG responses). When both responses are presented on the same scale, it becomes evident that the response to 1 mM ornithine is negligibly small compared to the MSG response, which clearly indicates that the response to the mixture of MSG and 1 mM ornithine exceeds the sum of the individual responses to MSG and 1 mM ornithine. Therefore, we have described the effect as “synergistic” rather than “additive.” The same observation applies to the mice experiments in our previous companion paper (Fig. 8 in Mizuta et al. 2021, Ref. #26), where synergistic effects are similarly demonstrated by graphical representation. We have also added the following sentence to the legend of Fig. 5:</p><p>“Note the different scaling of the ordinate in (D) and (E).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study the authors set out to investigate whether GPRC6A mediates kokumi taste initiated by the amino acid L-ornithine. They used Wistar rats, a standard laboratory strain, as the primary model and also performed an informative taste test in humans, in which miso soup was supplemented with various concentrations of L-ornithine. The findings are valuable and overall the evidence is solid. L-Ornithine should be considered to be a useful test substance in future studies of kokumi taste and the class C G protein coupled receptor known as GPRC6A (C6A) along with its homolog, the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) should be considered candidate mediators of kokumi taste. The researchers confirmed in rats their previous work on Ornithine and C6A in mice (Mizuta et al Nutrients 2021).</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The overall experimental design is solid based on two bottle preference tests in rats. After determining the optimal concentration for L-Ornithine (1 mM) in the presence of MSG, it was added to various tastants including: inosine 5'-monophosphate; monosodium glutamate (MSG); mono-potassium glutamate (MPG); intralipos (a soybean oil emulsion); sucrose; sodium chloride (NaCl; salt); citric acid (sour) and quinine hydrochloride (bitter). Robust effects of ornithine were observed in the cases of IMP, MSG, MPG and sucrose; and little or no effects were observed in the cases of sodium chloride, citric acid; quinine HCl. The researchers then focused on the preference for Ornithine-containing MSG solutions. Inclusion of the C6A inhibitors Calindol (0.3 mM but not 0.06 mM) or the gallate derivative EGCG (0.1 mM but not 0.03 mM) eliminated the preference for solutions that contained Ornithine in addition to MSG. The researchers next performed transections of the chord tympani nerves (with sham operation controls) in anesthetized rats to identify a role of the chorda tympani branches of the facial nerves (cranial nerve VII) in the preference for Ornithine-containing MSG solutions. This finding implicates the anterior half-two thirds of the tongue in ornithine-induced kokumi taste. They then used electrical recordings from intact chorda tympani nerves in anesthetized rats to demonstrate that ornithine enhanced MSG-induced responses following the application of tastants to the anterior surface of the tongue. They went on to show that this enhanced response was insensitive to amiloride, selected to inhibit 'salt tastant' responses mediated by the epithelial Na+ channel, but eliminated by Calindol. Finally they performed immunohistochemistry on sections of rat tongue demonstrating C6A positive spindle-shaped cells in fungiform papillae that partially overlapped in its distribution with the IP3 type-3 receptor, used as a marker of Type-II cells, but not with (i) gustducin, the G protein partner of Tas1 receptors (T1Rs), used as a marker of a subset of type-II cells; or (ii) 5-HT (serotonin) and Synaptosome-associated protein 25 kDa (SNAP-25) used as markers of Type-III cells.</p><p>At least two other receptors in addition to C6A might mediate taste responses to ornithine: (i) the CaSR, which binds and responds to multiple L-amino acids (Conigrave et al, PNAS 2000), and which has been previously reported to mediate kokumi taste (Ohsu et al., JBC 2010) as well as responses to Ornithine (Shin et al., Cell Signaling 2020); and (ii) T1R1/T1R3 heterodimers which also respond to L-amino acids and exhibit enhanced responses to IMP (Nelson et al., Nature 2001). These alternatives are appropriately discussed and, taken together, the experimental results favor the authors' interpretation that C6A mediates the Ornithine responses. The authors provide preliminary data in Suppl. 3 for the possibility of co-expression of C6A with the CaSR.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The authors point out that animal models pose some difficulties of interpretation in studies of taste and raise the possibility in the Discussion that umami substances may enhance the taste response to ornithine (Line 271, Page 9).</p></disp-quote><p>Ornithine and umami substances interact to produce synergistic effects in both directions—ornithine enhances responses to umami substances, and vice versa. These effects may depend on the concentrations used, as described in the Discussion (pp. 9–10). Further studies are required to clarify the precise nature of this interaction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One issue that is not addressed, and could be usefully addressed in the Discussion, relates to the potential effects of kokumi substances on the threshold concentrations of key tastants such as glutamate. Thus, an extension of taste distribution to additional areas of the mouth (previously referred to as 'mouthfulness') and persistence of taste/flavor responses (previously referred to as 'continuity') could arise from a reduction in the threshold concentrations of umami and other substances that evoke taste responses.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this important suggestion. If ornithine reduces the threshold concentrations of tastants—including glutamate—and enhances their suprathreshold responses, then adding ornithine may activate additional taste cells. This effect could explain kokumi attributes such as an “extension of taste distribution” and possibly the “persistence of responses.” As shown in Fig. 2, the lowest concentrations used for each taste stimulus are near or below the thresholds, which indicates that threshold concentrations are reduced—especially for MSG and MPG. We have incorporated this possibility into the Discussion as follows (p.12):</p><p>“Kokumi substances may reduce the threshold concentrations as well as they increase the suprathreshold responses of tastants. Once the threshold concentrations are lowered, additional taste cells in the oral cavity become activated, and this information is transmitted to the brain. As a result, the brain perceives this input as coming from a wider area of the mouth.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The status of one of the compounds used as an inhibitor of C6A, the gallate derivative EGCG, as a potential inhibitor of the CaSR or T1R1/T1R3 is unknown. It would have been helpful to show that a specific inhibitor of the CaSR failed to block the ornithine response.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this important comment. We attempted to identify a specific inhibitor of CaSR. Although we considered using NPS-2143—a commonly used CaSR inhibitor—it is known to also inhibit GPRC6A. We agree that using a specific CaSR inhibitor would be beneficial and plan to pursue this in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would have been helpful to include a positive control kokumi substance in the two bottle preference experiment (e.g., one of the known gamma glutamyl peptides such as gamma-glu-Val-Gly or glutathione), to compare the relative potencies of the control kokumi compound and Ornithine, and to compare the sensitivities of the two responses to C6A and CaSR inhibitors.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this comment. In retrospect, it may have been advantageous to directly compare the potencies of CaSR and GPRC6A agonists in enhancing taste preferences—and to evaluate the sensitivity of these preferences to CaSR and GPRC6A antagonists. However, we did not include γ-Glu-Val-Gly in the present study because we have already reported its supplementation effects on the ingestion of basic taste solutions in rats using the same methodology in a separate paper (Yamamoto and Mizuta, 2022, Ref. #25).

It was based on the impacts of selected mutations in the receptor's Venus FlyTrap domain (Broadhead JBC 2011) on the responses to AAs and glutathione analogs. The significantly more active analog, S-methylglutathione is of additional interest because, like glutathione itself, it is present in mammalian body fluids. My apologies to the authors for not more carefully explaining this point.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. Both CaSR and GPRC6A are recognized as broad-spectrum amino acid sensors; however, their agonist profiles differ. Aromatic amino acids preferentially activate CaSR, whereas basic amino acids tend to activate GPRC6A. For instance, among basic amino acids, ornithine is a potent and specific activator of GPRC6A, while γ-Glu-Val-Gly in addition to amino acids is a high-potency activator of CaSR. It remains unclear how effectively ornithine activates CaSR and whether γ-glutamyl peptides also activate GPRC6A. These questions should be addressed in future studies.</p></body></sub-article></article>
