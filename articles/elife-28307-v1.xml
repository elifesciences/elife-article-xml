This is true for the heart, whose function critically relies on well-ordered communication between neighboring cells, which is established and fine-tuned during embryonic development. For an integrated understanding of the development of structure and function, we need to move from isolated snap-shot observations of either microscopic or macroscopic parameters to simultaneous and, ideally continuous, cell-to-organ scale imaging. We introduce cell-accurate three-dimensional Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mapping of all cells in the entire electro-mechanically uncoupled heart during the looping stage of live embryonic zebrafish, using high-speed light sheet microscopy and tailored image processing and analysis. We show how myocardial region-specific heterogeneity in cell function emerges during early development and how structural patterning goes hand-in-hand with functional maturation of the entire heart. Our method opens the way to systematic, scale-bridging, <italic>in vivo</italic> studies of vertebrate organogenesis by cell-accurate structure-function mapping across entire organs.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28307.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The heart has a built-in pacemaker that sets the rhythm of the heartbeat. Pacemaker cells produce electrical signals that spread across the heart in a coordinated wave. As each cell receives its signal, ion channels open in its membrane. Calcium ions rush in from the spaces around the cells, triggering the release of more calcium ions from internal stores. The rise in calcium ion levels causes the heart muscle to contract.</p><p>Standard techniques for studying how the activation process spreads across the heart typically involve removing the organ from the animal. One reason for this is that no microscopy technique had been able to provide the detail needed to observe the activity of individual cells across the whole heart during its activation cycle.</p><p>Zebrafish embryos have a simple heart with two chambers that can be visually explored because the embryos are transparent. Their hearts are activated in a pattern that has been maintained throughout evolution with principal similarities in many different species. These properties make fish embryos well suited for the non-invasive examination of the heart.</p><p>Weber, Scherf et al. have studied genetically engineered zebrafish embryos whose heart muscle cells contained a calcium-sensitive fluorophore, using a technique called light sheet microscopy. This method illuminates the heart with a thin sheet of laser light, which causes the fluorescent dye to glow in a way that indicates changes in the concentration of calcium ions in the cells. A fast and sensitive camera detects these signals and stacks of movies are recorded and synchronized, allowing cardiac activation to be mapped in three dimensions as it spreads across the heart.</p><p>Applying this new technique revealed that different parts of the heart conduct activation signals at different speeds. These speeds finely match the anatomical features of the heart, yielding planar progression of the activation signal over the increasingly complex shape of the developing heart. Weber, Scherf et al. also showed that the heart only requires a handful of pacemaker cells to reliably set the heart’s rhythm.</p><p>Future modifications to the technique of Weber, Scherf et al. could help us investigate how the heart works in even finer detail. For example, it might reveal how electrical activity, calcium handling, and contraction influence one another, and how they individually and collectively respond to drug treatments. This will help us understand how the normal heart rhythm develops, how it can be modified, and how the heart adapts to changes in its environment, including damage during cardiac disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Cardiac conduction</kwd><kwd>Cardiology</kwd><kwd>Light sheet microscopy</kwd><kwd>Organogenesis</kwd><kwd>Optical mapping</kwd><kwd>image analysis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SmartMic</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weber</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name><name><surname>Scherf</surname><given-names>Nico</given-names></name><name><surname>Huisken</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001656</institution-id><institution>Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Young Investigator Program (VH-NG-736)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meyer</surname><given-names>Alexander M</given-names></name><name><surname>Panáková</surname><given-names>Daniela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CardioNECT</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kohl</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The combination of high-speed light sheet microscopy and suitable data analysis facilitates cell-accurate measurements across entire organs and opens the way to systematic, scale-bridging, in vivo studies of organogenesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Organogenesis builds on cell–cell interactions that shape tissue properties, and tissue-level cues that control maturation of cell structure and function. During cardiogenesis, region-specific heterogeneity in cellular activity patterns evolves as the heart undergoes large-scale morphological changes: The spontaneously active heart tube develops into the mature heart, in which pacemaker cells near the inflow site initiate the rhythmic excitation that spreads with differential velocities through distinct regions of the myocardium. This controlled cardiac activation gives rise to an orderly sequence of atrial and ventricular calcium release and contraction. An integrated understanding of cardiogenesis at the systems level requires simultaneous cell and organ scale imaging, under physiological conditions <italic>in vivo</italic>. Here, we present a high-speed light sheet microscopy and data analysis pipeline to measure fluorescent reporters of cardiomyocyte location and activity across the entire electro-mechanically uncoupled heart in living zebrafish embryos during the crucial looping period from 36 to 52 hr post fertilization (hpf). By noninvasively reconstructing the maturation process of the myocardium in its entirety at cellular resolution, our approach offers an integrative perspective on tissue and cell levels simultaneously, which has previously required separate experimental setups and specimens. Our method opens a new way towards systematic assessment of the mutual interrelations between cell- and tissue properties during organogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The zebrafish is an appealing vertebrate model system with a simple, yet functionally conserved heart.

We built a light sheet microscope tailored for high-speed imaging of the heart in the living zebrafish embryo. By fine-tuning the magnification and restricting camera readout to the center area of the chip, we balanced the field of view and the spatial and temporal sampling to record cardiac activation in the entire heart with cellular precision (Materials and methods).</p><p>We investigated whether post-acquisition synchronization could be extended to visualizing calcium transients in cardiac myocytes across the entire heart of living embryonic zebrafish expressing the fluorescent calcium reporter GCaMP5G under the <italic>myl7</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In a side-by-side comparison, the calcium signal had good and stable fluorescent yield at low excitation power, superior to genetically expressed voltage reporters.

By mounting zebrafish embryos in low concentration agarose inside polymer tubes, we could position the embryos for precise optical investigation without anesthesia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a,b</xref>).

The distribution of calcium transient rise times (from 10% to 90% of calcium transient peak amplitude) revealed the emergence of distinct upstroke characteristics in different locations within the 3D network (by 52 hpf). Rise times were shortest for atrial muscle cells, intermediate in the atrio-ventricular canal (AVC), and longest for ventricular cardiomyoctes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c’’</xref>), in keeping with higher vertebrates where atrial myocyte contraction is faster than that of ventricular cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brandenburg et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>To get a more quantitative understanding of the 3D distribution of activity patterns, a canonical description of cell locations was needed.

They are located in the sinus venosus at the heart’s inflow side, which is a homologue of the primary cardiac pacemaker region in adult heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Poon and Brand, 2013</xref>). Our data further show that the ring-like arrangement of pacemaker cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>), together with a preferential orientation of myocardial cells in that region perpendicular to the inflow-outflow direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Auman et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8</xref>), generates the initial planar ‘ring-like’ activation front that propagates evenly into the atrium.</p><p>To visualize the 3D conduction pattern, the heart can be represented as a curved cylinder with varying diameter and s-shaped deformations in the coronal and in the sagittal plane.

Interestingly, by following the orientation of this reference system along the midline, we noticed torsion associated with the cardiac looping, which is most pronounced around the AVC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Männer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Christoffels et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harvey, 2002</xref>).

During the crucial period between 36 and 52 hpf, ventricular cell number increased by about 45%, the initial heart tube developed into a two-chambered organ, the midline of the heart became increasingly curved and twisted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), and the activation frequency increased – all signs of organ maturation. In spite of a net increase in cell numbers, the time required for activation to propagate from inflow to outflow decreased. A progressive crowding of calcium transient activation dynamics indicated maturation of cells, with two groups differentiating from the early more homogeneous pattern: working cardiomyocytes in atrium and ventricle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–f</xref>). At 36 hpf, activation propagated evenly across the myocardium, compatible with peristalsis. Subsequently, calcium dynamics became increasingly structured. By 52 hpf, propagation of activation was fast across atrium and ventricle, while it remained slow in the AVC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>). With organ maturation during these 16 hr, cells in the ventricular part of the network showed longer calcium transient rise time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b</xref>) but faster inter-cellular spread of activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g–l</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2c</xref>). Conduction also changed within chambers, such as along the outer curvature in the atrium.

For each thus identified ‘cell volume’, a calcium transient was extracted by averaging the signal over all voxel within the reference volume at each time step.

The quest for this essential knowledge has been elusive partly due to limitations with imaging instrumentation. In this manuscript, Huisken and colleagues adapt their pioneering technology of high-speed, high-resolution light sheet microscopy to study how conductivity evolves and matures during zebrafish heart development. Specifically, they built a high-speed, dual-color light sheet microscope to image the heart at subcellular resolution, based on a published design called post-acquisition synchronization. They then developed a set of computational tools to analyze calcium activity at cellular resolution. These include a curved cylindrical coordinate system to describe cell position along the midline, a graph-based method to calculate the conduction speed in terms of the number of cells per unit time, and a 2D projection method to display cellular properties across the 3D heart. Finally, they applied these methods to measure the emergence of region-specific activation and conduction between 36 hpf and 44 hpf that accompanies the morphological emergence of three regions of the heart.</p><p>The biological insights revealed are in line with what is known in the developing heart, including the faster Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise time in atrial vs. ventricular cardiomyocytes and slower conduction velocities in proximal atrial myocytes and in AVC. These data validate that the temporal and spatial sampling rates were adequate so that the inherent lag between the beginning of biological phenomena and image capture would be irrelevant. Comparison of physical conduction velocity, afforded by this technology, and the routine biological conduction velocity revealed that the larger dimensions of atrial cardiomyocytes gave rise to faster physical conduction velocity. Altogether, this study presented a set of impressively careful technical characterization that will benefit the field. In particular, this manuscript makes a very important contribution by reconstructing the geometry of the heart, and then transforming it to a convenient &quot;map&quot; of the cell positions, permitting the neighbor relationships to be more easily seen and analyzed. Moreover, the manuscript is well written with beautiful figures that are well organized, intuitively informative and aesthetically appealing. However, the manuscript has several limitations in its current form (as described below) that should be addressed in a revised version.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors must be clear in their title, Abstract, and elsewhere in the text that these are hearts without excitation-contraction coupling. This is an understandable decision in the experimental design, but this does mean that the normal mechanics of the contractile tissues and the normal forces from the blood flow through the system are absent. It is probably beyond the scope of this paper to perform the study with function intact, but the authors can only argue this if they are clear in the title, Abstract, and text.</p><p>2) The authors discuss proudly the performance of the microscope used, and they show lovely data. However, beyond knowing what it is better than, the paper does not really teach the reader what the microscope is. More detail is desirable here.</p><p>3) The key steps in re-assembly of the imaging data into the volumetric rendering are underspecified, and more detail is needed.</p><p>4) The authors quantify that, strikingly, less than 10 pacemaker cells serve as the origin of electrical activation at 52 hpf. The location of these cells is the sinus venosus at the heart's inflow in a ring-like formation. The authors cite an earlier work which indicate that the myocardial cells in the outer curvature are oriented perpendicular to the inflow-outflow direction. Do the authors suggest that the pacemaker cells exhibit anisotropy at the level of individual cell morphology, linking them in a ring-like manner, and this is paralleled by neighboring atrial myocytes oriented orthogonal to the inflow-outflow line? If so, it may be easier to see this by illustrating the estimated cell shapes of the pacemaker cells as scaled ellipsoids.</p><p>5) In terms of the biology presented here, there seem to be some missed opportunities. Could the authors address how the magic transition occurs between 36 hpf and 44 hpf (e.g. gradual and smooth, or sudden appearance with chaotic transition)? Could they address whether heterogeneity exists at the cellular level (aside from the pacemaker) and, if so, whether cellular heterogeneity matters in the transition?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28307.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors must be clear in their title, Abstract, and elsewhere in the text that these are hearts without excitation-contraction coupling.

Our new data shows clearly that cells at the atrial inflow site are indeed elongated and arranged in a ring-like fashion, perpendicular to the cardiac axis. It also illustrates that ventricular cells – which multiply rapidly at this stage – are much smaller, explaining the shallower interrelation between biophysical (distance based) and biological (cell number based) conduction velocities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>). We describe the sample preparation and imaging modalities used to record the new data in the two new sections “Sample preparation for confocal and two-photon microscopy” and “Confocal and two-photon microscopy” in the “Materials and methods” part. We have also added two authors crucially involved in gathering this information: Alexander M. Meyer and Daniela Panáková who developed the transgenic <italic>myl7</italic>:lck-eGFP zebrafish line.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In terms of the biology presented here, there seem to be some missed opportunities.

Judging by the calcium transient data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and the changes in regional conduction velocities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) we would argue that the transition is gradual. We made this clearer in the revised manuscript by inserting relevant descriptions, e.g. “The gradual formation of atrial (1) and ventricular (2) populations with increasingly different calcium transients is highlighted by the dashed lines at 52 hpf.” and “A progressive crowding of calcium transient activation dynamics indicated maturation of cells, with two groups differentiating from the early more homogeneous pattern: working cardiomyocytes in atrium and ventricle…”.</p><p>A key biological aspect, in our view, is the fact that it is not the pacemaker and AVC ‘nodal equivalents’ that progressively specialize during development (as is often implied in adult cardiac cell electrophysiology research), but the atrial and ventricular working myocardium. This is stated as follows: “Myocardial cells in the two chambers remodel and specialize into functional tissue of working atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes, while cells in the pacemaker and AVC regions continue to resemble the earlier phenotype from the tubular stage.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
