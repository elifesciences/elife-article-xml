Heart rhythm disturbances, that is cardiac arrhythmias, are important examples as they are often triggered by specific patterns of preceding stimuli. In this study, we investigated how ectopic arrhythmias can be induced by external stimuli in cardiac tissue containing a localised area of depolarisation. Using optogenetic in vitro experiments and in silico modelling, we systematically explored the dynamics of these arrhythmias, which are characterised by local oscillatory activity, by gradually altering the degree of depolarisation in a predefined region. Our findings reveal a bi-stable system, in which transitions between oscillatory ectopic activity and a quiescent state can be precisely controlled, that is by adjusting the number and frequency of propagating waves through the depolarised area oscillations could be turned on or off. These frequency-dependent responses arise from collective mechanisms involving stable, non-self-oscillatory cells, contrasting with the typical role of self-oscillations in individual units within biophysical systems. To further generalise these findings, we demonstrated similar frequency selectivity and bi-stability in a simplified reaction–diffusion model. This suggests that complex ionic cell dynamics are not required to reproduce these effects; rather, simpler non-linear systems can replicate similar behaviour, potentially extending beyond the cardiac context.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>resonance</kwd><kwd>ectopy</kwd><kwd>arrhythmia</kwd><kwd>non-linear dynamics</kwd><kwd>bi-stability</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0472cxd90</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>101044831</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pijnappels</surname><given-names>Daniël A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04jsz6e67</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>917143</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pijnappels</surname><given-names>Daniël A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01yaj9a77</institution-id><institution>ZonMw</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>04510012110051</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Coster</surname><given-names>Tim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Collective frequency-selective resonance in depolarised cardiac tissue enables reversible switching between quiescent and ectopic oscillations through hidden bi-stability, which is shaped by light intensity, illuminated area, and pacing frequency.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Biological systems like the heart typically display complex dynamical behaviour through interactions among components such as genes, proteins, or cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dana et al., 2008</xref>). These systems exhibit non-linear dynamics, feedback loops, and adaptability, reflecting phenomena like homeostasis, evolution, and rhythm stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xiong and Garfinkel, 2023</xref>). Central to the framework of dynamical systems is the concept of the phase space, a multidimensional representation in which each point corresponds to a unique state of the system. In geography, when a small ball rolls on a raised-relief map, a state would include the planar position, elevation, speed, and acceleration of the ball.</p><p>Within the phase space, the long-term behaviour of a system can often be described in terms of attractors, which are subsets of the phase space that trajectories tend towards over time. Attractors can take various forms, including fixed points, periodic orbits, and chaotic sets, reflecting the rich diversity of behaviours possible in dynamical systems. By replacing the ball with local rain in the raised-relief map, rivers, lakes, and other bodies of water are attractors where that rain is collected. A watershed, also known as a drainage basin, is an area of land where any rain that falls will drain into the same river, lake, or body of water. Therefore, they are basins of attraction. Mountain ridges are separatrices that divide the watersheds, or more formally theoretical surfaces that divide the phase space into different basins of attraction. A separatrix therefore denotes the transition between different regions of the phase space. The terminology introduced here comes back throughout our paper, with the addition of a ‘state’, that is one of the attractors in the system. When the system is not interacted with, it will stay at the same point(s) in phase space.</p><p>Some systems only have a single basin of attraction. However, in others, the phenomenon of bi-stability emerges, where two distinct attractors coexist, each with its own basin of attraction. Bi-stability is a hallmark of many natural and engineered systems, from climate dynamics to neural networks, ecological models, and cardiac dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angeli et al., 2004</xref>). The interplay between basins in such systems can give rise to complex behaviours, making the characterisation of these basins a critical component of a system’s analysis.</p><p>In this manuscript, the focus is on the complex system of the heart. At rest, ventricular cardiomyocytes (i.e muscle cells of the lower heart chamber) have a membrane potential of –80 to –90 mV. This resting state is an attractor of the system. When pushed out of equilibrium (e.g. due to an influx of Na<sup>+</sup> ions or electrical stimulation), cardiomyocytes first depolarise and subsequently get attracted again towards the resting state by an efflux of K<sup>+</sup> ions. In phase space, the trajectory that gets mapped out resembles a cycle, corresponding to one heartbeat. When multiple of these cells are connected to each other, emergent behaviour can arise. Within this dynamic system of cardiomyocytes, we investigated emergent bi-stability (a concept that will be explained more thoroughly later on) in cell monolayers under the influence of spatial depolarisation patterns. By using a train of external (electrical) waves, the system could be actively moved from one basin of attraction to another.</p><p>Cardiac arrhythmias are typically initiated by specific triggers, with point-source waves, that is ectopic waves, being the most prevalent. To study ectopy in laboratory settings, control needs to be exerted over the depolarisation of cardiomyocytes. This can be achieved by optogenetics, that is a biological technique to control the activity of cells with light. This approach relies on the introduction of recombinant genes encoding light-activatable proteins into cells to endow them with a new biological function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tan et al., 2022</xref>). One way to depolarise a cardiomyocyte is by using a mini-singlet oxygen generator (miniSOG). Upon activation with blue light, miniSOG converts molecular oxygen from its ground state (<sup>3</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) into highly reactive singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>). The resulting oxidative damage induces a state of prolonged depolarisation in cardiomyocytes following electrical stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jangsangthong et al., 2016</xref>). In such a system, it was previously observed that spatiotemporal illumination can give rise to collective behaviour and ectopic waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Teplenin et al., 2018</xref>) originating from illuminated/depolarised regions (with spatial high curvature). These waves resulted from the interplay between the diffusion current (also known in biology/biophysics as the gap junction mediated current) and the single-cell bi-stable state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Teplenin et al., 2018</xref>) that was induced in the illuminated region.</p><p>Although effects of illuminating miniSOG with light might lead to formation of depolarised areas, it is difficult to control the process precisely since it depolarises cardiomyocytes indirectly. Therefore, in this manuscript, we used light-sensitive ion channels to obtain more refined control over cardiomyocyte depolarisation. These ion channels allow the cells to respond to specific wavelengths of light, facilitating direct depolarisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ördög et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ördög et al., 2021</xref>). By inducing cardiomyocyte depolarisation or hyperpolarisation only in the illuminated areas, optogenetics enables precise spatiotemporal control of cardiac excitability, an attribute we exploit in this manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). With the aid of the light-gated ion channel CheRiff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hochbaum et al., 2014</xref>), ectopic waves similar to those obtained in the miniSOG system could be elicited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Due to the superior control over depolarisation imposed by CheRiff, we uncovered new effects and unobserved behaviour related to the transition from a monostable cardiac system to a bi-stable one that displays periodic oscillations. This transition resulted from the interaction of depolarised cardiomyocytes in an illuminated region with an external wave train not originating from within the illuminated region. More specifically, we found that our system displayed frequency selectivity: it oscillated only as a reaction to a specific range of inter-pulse external stimuli times. In neuroscience, this behaviour is classified as ‘resonance’. However, to avoid confusion with classical resonance, where the strength of the response is dependent on the input, here the phenomenon is called ‘induced pacemaker activity’. Evidence for this induced pacemaker activity will be presented both in vitro and in silico.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Bi-stability in cardiomyocyte monolayers was realised both in vitro and in silico (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In vitro, this happened through patterned illumination applied to neonatal rat ventricular myocyte (NRVM) monolayers, which were optogenetically modified using the blue light-activatable cation channel CheRiff (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In silico, use was made of a slightly modified (see Materials and methods) NRVM computational model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Majumder et al., 2016</xref>) complemented with a model for a depolarising light-gated ion channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Williams et al., 2013</xref>). In both cases, the illumination pattern consisted of a rectangle of variable light intensities. After initiating a periodic wave train (of variable pulse number and interpulse interval/period) from a pacing electrode, two main outcomes and one special case were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The first outcome was that the tissue stayed in the stationary rest state (STA). The second outcome was that the illuminated region became a pacemaker, which sent out pulses from its edges as a form of oscillatory behaviour (OSC). The special case consisted of an in-between case, in which the illuminated region only sends out a limited amount of pulses before returning to the stationary state, thus showing transient oscillatory behaviour (TR.OSC). Except for the occasional mention, this last behaviour of transient oscillations will be reserved for more detailed discussion in the supplement. All light intensity-influenced monolayer behaviours are visualised together in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> and the accompanying <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>. Here, we will focus on the two main behaviours after periodic wave trains: STA and OSC. As shown below, these two behaviours can exist within the same monolayer under bi-stability and transitions from one state to the other are possible using periodic wave trains. The occurrence of this phenomenon appears to be influenced by the light intensity applied to the illuminated region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In a step-by-step manner, we unravelled the intricacies of this tissue level (i.e. collective) bi-stability between oscillatory and stationary behaviour, linking experiment to theory.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Bi-stability between stationary behaviour and collective oscillations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental timeline for a monolayer of optogenetically modified neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) under constant illumination of its centre: (1) observation of a collective stationary state (STA); (2) periodic wave train from the pacing electrode; and (3) outcome observation of collective behaviour, either stationary (STA) or oscillatory (OSC).

At each moment in time, the middle line of the monolayer image was plotted. White shows depolarised tissue, while black signifies repolarised cells. From these plots, intermediate stimulation periods (600 ms) were observed to change the monolayer from a collective stationary state to a collective oscillatory state, while low (200 ms) or high (1200 ms) ones had no effect. It was observed that the oscillatory state consisted of ectopic pacemaker activity with a frequency (1.361 Hz or a 735-ms period) that was different from the stimulus train frequency (1.666 Hz or a 600-ms period).

We previously identified three important parameters influencing such transitions: light intensity, number of pulses, and frequency of pulses. Scanning through all three variables revealed the specific conditions at which transition from the stationary state towards the oscillatory state occurred, as shown in the rightmost panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> with slices for fixed illumination extracted from this 3D plot shown at the left. With increasing light intensity, the parameter range (pulse and period) in which bi-stability can be detected increases (the total area of TR.OSC + OSC becomes larger), and transient oscillatory states transition towards oscillatory states.</p><p>Except for the three aforementioned parameters, a fourth one was found to have an influence on the state transitions: the size of the illuminated region. Also, this parameter was first tested in vitro, resulting in 5 biological replicates/monolayers showing transitions to the oscillatory state and 6 biological replicates/monolayers showing transient oscillations. The effect of the size of the illuminated area on the occurrence of bi-stability was qualitatively reproduced in silico (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Varying the number and frequency of pulses together with the illuminated area at a fixed light intensity of 1.7200 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> resulted in the dynamic behaviour shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>. For the conditions that resulted in stable oscillations, the green vertical lines in the middle and right slices represent the natural pacemaker frequency in the oscillatory state. After the transition from the stationary towards the oscillatory state, oscillatory pulses emerging from the illuminated region gradually dampen and stabilise at this period, corresponding to the natural pacemaker frequency. The location of this line depends on the light intensity and the size of the illuminated region. However, it is independent of the number of pulses and the frequency of the stimulus train. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, D</xref> also illustrates that no oscillatory state could be induced with a high number of pulses for stimulus trains of high frequency (i.e. low stimulation period).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Termination of collective pacemaker activity</title><p>A closer look at the high-frequency range showed that it not only prevented the initiation of ectopic pacemaker activity, but can also cause its termination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Once ongoing, eight pulses in the high-frequency range (5.000 Hz or period 200 ms) terminated the ectopic pacemaker activity and made the tissue go back to its resting state. When copying this experimental protocol in silico, qualitative correspondence was shown using four pulses with a period of 500 ms to initiate pacemaker activity, and seven pulses with a period of 180 ms to terminate it.

Bi-stability is a wide-spread phenomenon and can take place at the single-cell level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guevara, 2003</xref>), which would be the simplest assumption for our monolayer system as well. When this would be the case, all cells would become oscillatory under illumination. We tested this hypothesis by making use of one of the four parameters we investigated earlier: the illuminated area. This parameter shows a transition from the stationary state towards the oscillatory state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) just like the light intensity parameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) resulting in spontaneous oscillatory behaviour with waves emanating from the centre of the illuminated area for a large area size and at a constant low light intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). These circumstances allowed us to compare the voltage traces between the centre of the irradiated area and the bulk of the tissue, both in vitro and in silico. While the cells outside of the illuminated area showed oscillating membrane potentials, those in the centre of the illuminated region, that is those least affected by the coupling current of neighbouring cells, displayed a stable elevation of membrane potential. Hence, this implies that not all illuminated cells became oscillatory. We can therefore reject the simplest hypothesis of bi-stability at the single-cell level, but have to speak of a collective phenomenon. It is for this reason that throughout the manuscript the observed effects are referred to as ‘collective’ pacemaker activity.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Wave train-induced pacemaker activity is a multicellular collective phenomenon.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Illuminated area (under constant light intensity) influences collective behaviour of excitable systems, transitioning between a stationary state for small illuminated areas and an oscillatory state for large illuminated areas.

These pulses were applied when the tissue was either in the oscillatory state (top two rows) or the stationary state (bottom two rows). The stimulus amplitude of –20 mV that was necessary to get the single cell with a bias current into the second stable equilibrium, also terminates oscillatory behaviour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D-2</xref>) while the other two amplitudes of –58 and 50 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D-1 and 3</xref>) do not alter the behaviour of the tissue. However, when starting from the stationary state, the behaviour is opposite and the intermediate amplitude of –20 mV fails to induce collective oscillatory behaviour while the other two amplitudes do elicit this behaviour. We thus conclude that high stimulation frequencies and intermediate stimulus amplitudes are capable of terminating collective oscillatory behaviour by transitioning through a quasi-steady state.</p><p>We call this kind of bi-stability capable of terminating collective oscillatory behaviour ‘<italic>hidden bi-stability</italic>’ for two reasons: (1) Single-cell bi-stability depends on electronic interactions.

In the presence of a diffusion current (or bias current in the case of a single cell), the illuminated cells transition to a second equilibrium under high-frequency pacing. Because this second equilibrium only appears in a coupled system (or in the presence of a bias current), we can also speak of a hidden bi-stability. Hence, hidden bi-stability (high vs. low stationary resting membrane) is shown to underlie the collective phenomena (stationary vs. oscillatory behaviour) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></list-item></list><p>Below, we compare these phenomena to different types of arrhythmic events and mechanisms of bi-stability in cardiac tissue, and extend the relevance of our mechanisms to spiking behaviour in neuronal and other biophysical systems.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Ectopic pacemaker activity in cardiology</title><p>The generation of ectopic beats is considered as one of the main mechanisms triggering and maintaining cardiac arrhythmias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pogwizd et al., 1992</xref>). In most cases, ectopic sources are believed to be a result of triggered activity, which can manifest itself as early afterdepolarisations (EADs) or delayed afterdepolarisations (DADs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Qu et al., 2014</xref>). Such ectopic sources are typically initiated by high-frequency pacing resulting in a Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload that triggers EADs and DADs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lerman et al., 2024</xref>). However, as we did not observe Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload, the phenomenon observed in this study resembles induced pacemaker activity instead. In contrast with ectopy, this pacemaker activity is initiated at low pacing frequencies. Therefore, our findings might explain the phenomenon of bradycardia-induced triggered activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brachmann et al., 1983</xref>). The initiation of oscillations in our monolayers is the result of the spatial dynamics of the system, which stands in contrast with the frequency dependency of EADs that can be explained on a single-cell level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tran et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Qu et al., 2014</xref>). Our optogenetic current is absent in normal cardiac tissue, but its associated depolarisation could be caused by other late activating inward currents, which are also essential in the induction of EADs or DADs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Song et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Qu et al., 2014</xref>): for example, the late Na current (<inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf35"><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math><tex-math id="inft35">\begin{document}$I_{Na,L}$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Belardinelli et al., 2015</xref>), reactivation of <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf36"><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math><tex-math id="inft36">\begin{document}$I_{CaL}$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tran et al., 2009</xref>), or NCX activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Song et al., 2015</xref>).

Due to the additional inward current produced by the activation of CheRiff, a single uncoupled illuminated cell goes to a steady depolarised state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). However, in a multicellular environment, there is a repolarising electrotonic coupling current working against this depolarising light-induced current. This repolarising current is a consequence of the interaction between depolarised and non-depolarised parts in the monolayer. By playing with the illumination intensity and the size of the illuminated region, we were able to balance these de- and re-polarising effects to create a bi-stable regime (STA vs. OSC). This also explains why there are no oscillations present in the centre of a large illuminated region, since there the electrotonic current is lower than at its edges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). On the other hand, if the electrotonic current is too strong, it will prevent depolarisation by the optogenetic current and, as a consequence, the system will stay in the stationary state. The balancing of currents also explains why the oscillatory boundary moves closer to the edge of the illuminated region at higher light intensities, since under those circumstances the depolarising current will overpower the spatial effects. However, when the illumination is very strong, it is possible to have oscillations that do not need to be induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and can even come from the corners of the illuminated region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Teplenin et al., 2018</xref>). This last-mentioned phenomenon appears because the curvature of the boundary between illuminated and not-illuminated regions influences the electrotonic current.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Interplay between microscopic (single cell) and macroscopic (monolayer) behaviour</title><p>Collective bi-stability, as described in the previous section, is a bi-stability between two distinct behaviours (stationary STA and oscillatory OSC behaviour) that occur at the macroscopic level (monolayer). However, by looking more deeply at the dynamics that happen at the microscopic level (single cell), we can get more insight into the underlying mechanism(s). At the single-cell level, the dynamic transition between a stationary monolayer and one showing induced pacemaker activity relies on two main processes:</p><list list-type="order" id="list2"><list-item><p>For the initiation of pacemaker activity, pulse accumulation (at intermediate frequencies) is necessary to bring the system into the attracting region of the oscillatory state.</p></list-item><list-item><p>For the termination of pacemaker activity, an interaction takes place between ‘hidden’ bi-stable dynamics and coupling currents at high frequencies.</p></list-item></list><p>Both these processes occur as a consequence of wave pulses outside of the illuminated region. At low frequencies, no oscillatory activity can be induced. At intermediate frequencies, it is possible to escape the attracting zone of the stationary state and cross the separatrix into the attracting zone of the oscillatory state. However, for even higher frequencies, the system gets pushed out of the attracting zone of the oscillatory state again and through hidden bi-stability, it returns to the stationary state.</p><p>Our data on the termination mechanism of induced pacemaker activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) indicate that we are not dealing with classical STA–OSC bi-stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Winfree, 2001</xref>). In systems displaying classical bi-stability between a limit cycle and the resting state, pacemaker annihilation can be achieved by applying sufficiently high-frequency voltage perturbations. Through pulse accumulation, it is then possible to exit the basin of attraction in the reverse direction from which it was entered. In contrast, our system enters (from outside the limit cycle) and leaves (towards the inside of the limit cycle) the attraction zone in opposite directions. This was concluded from the absence of a Hopf bifurcation in our system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>The seemingly fragile nature of hidden bi-stability might be a requirement for coexistence of excitable and bi-stable regimes. Otherwise, if the hills and dips of the N-shaped steady-state <italic>IV</italic> curve were large (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C-1</xref>), they would have similar magnitudes as the large currents of fast ion channels, preventing the subtle interaction between these strong ionic cell currents and the small repolarising coupling currents (≈0.1 pA).</p><p>Although the termination mechanism was shown to be amplitude-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C, D</xref>), the appropriate perturbation amplitudes are ‘automatically’ selected by a high-frequency train of travelling waves of excitation without any a priori knowledge about the state of the system. This wave train terminated ectopic triggers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), which is in accordance with previous publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Moak and Rosen, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Glikson et al., 2021</xref>). These publications also showed that uniform high voltage shocks are unable to terminate ectopic sustained activity, similar to our findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>Although its manifestations are clear in a monolayer system, hidden bi-stability might be challenging to observe in single-cell patch-clamp experiments. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C-1</xref>, the height of dips and hills of the N-shaped steady-state <italic>IV</italic> curve under bias current are ≈0.2 pA/pF. While it is possible to perform patch-clamping on individual cells in a monolayer experiencing diffusion currents, measurements of small amplitudes can be hindered by the statistical and instrumental errors of voltage-clamp recordings. The voltage bi-stability we are looking for can, for example, easily be lost via a shift in current balance due to the non-zero resistance of the patch pipette in current clamp mode. This might explain why the phenomenon of hidden bi-stability has only rarely been reported, for example, in an in silico study dedicated to myotony in muscle fibres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cannon et al., 1993</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Extrapolation and translation</title><p>All key aspects of the initiation and termination of induced pacemaker activity, that is the points itemised above were also demonstrated in a simplified 3-variable reaction–diffusion model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>), implicating the more general nature of this observed phenomenon. A rigorous mathematical analysis can be accomplished in future work, but might be challenging due to the lack of efficient analytical tools to describe fully developed limit cycle oscillations in reaction–diffusion systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sherratt and Smith, 2008</xref>). Based on the reproduction of our results in such a simplified model, we showed that we do not need the full complexity of an ionic cardiomyocyte model, enabling extrapolation and translation of our results towards other scientific disciplines.</p><p>Frequency-dependent initiation and termination of oscillatory activity is not exclusive to cardiac systems, but is well known in a variety of non-linear biophysical systems. For example, the actomyosin cortex in the social amoeba <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> responds to short pulses of 3′,5′-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) by damped oscillations in average actin content, thereby allowing fine time-selective responses to either internal (pseudopodia initiation) or external (cAMP release) perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Westendorf et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, in synthetic gene regulatory networks, subthreshold stimuli might be used to discriminate environmental stimuli (e.g. growth factor release, heat shock) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guantes and Poyatos, 2006</xref>). Also, neurons can differentiate external stimuli depending on their frequency. As mentioned in the introduction, the frequency-dependent initiation and termination of oscillatory activity is known as ‘<italic>resonance</italic>’ in neuroscience. It is interesting to compare the resonance properties of our system with those actively studied in neurons.</p><p>Resonant neurons, also known as resonate-and-fire neurons or type II excitability neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Izhikevich, 2000</xref>), are governed by sub-threshold oscillations initiated due to proximity of the resting state to a Hopf bifurcation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hutcheon and Yarom, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roach et al., 2018</xref>). They react to a stimulus train as follows: The first pulse initiates a damped sub-threshold oscillation of the membrane potential, while the effect of the second pulse depends on its timing. If timed correctly, it adds to the first pulse and either increases the amplitude of the sub-threshold oscillation or evokes repetitive spiking (transition to a limit cycle). Thus, the response and spiking of the resonator neuron depends on the frequency content of the input. These types of spiking neurons are usually associated with Bogdanov–Takens bifurcations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Izhikevich, 2000</xref>). However, another type of bifurcation, a saddle-node-loop (SNL) bifurcation, is also capable of generating spiking neurons and allows a bi-stability regime, in which the stable state lies outside the limit cycle similar to our case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>SNL bifurcations were previously identified in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hesse et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hesse and Schreiber, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schleimer et al., 2021</xref>), in a model of transcriptional regulation of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ciliberto et al., 2005</xref>), and in the design of combined genetic switches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Perez-Carrasco et al., 2018</xref>). Our result might represent the emergent analogue of an SNL bifurcation with resonant transitions on a neuronal/non-linear network level. SNL bifurcations have already been identified in the networks of coupled Kuramoto limit cycle oscillators both in a broad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Martens et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Childs and Strogatz, 2008</xref>) and in a neuroscience context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buendía et al., 2021</xref>). In these studies, SNL bifurcations were identified using dimensionality reduction techniques while ignoring the whole wealth of transient and finite-size phenomena. Moreover, the Kuramoto model is a model without many physical details, describing a weak forcing regime on an idealised limit cycle oscillator, in which oscillations cannot be destroyed but only phase shifted. In our case, we provide a more realistic biophysically motivated model, which allows a strong forcing regime and destruction of oscillations due to the phenomenon of hidden bi-stability. This gives us reason to believe that idealised Kuramoto models could possess resonant properties if augmented/modified with sufficient physical/biophysical details. SNL bifurcations and hidden bi-stability could also be studied in a range of other unexplored biophysical situations including high-frequency stimulation for the termination of neuronal oscillations during Parkinson's disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Touboul et al., 2020</xref>), multi-compartment cable computational models of the neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schwemmer and Lewis, 2012</xref>), and bi-stability in neurons in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Le et al., 2006</xref>).

Our collective ‘resonance’ mechanism could be used to study or control collective states in cardiac but also other excitable systems.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Preparation of monolayers of NRVMs expressing the light-activatable cation channel CheRiff</title><p>All animal experiments were reviewed and approved by the Animal Experiments Committee of the Leiden University Medical Center and carried out in accordance with Directive 2010/63/EU of the European Union on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes.

The mapping setup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) was based on a 100 × 100 pixel CMOS Ultima-L camera (Scimedia, Costa Mesa, CA). The field of view was 16 × 16 mm resulting in a spatial resolution of 160 µm/pixel. For targeted illumination of monolayers, the setup was optically conjugated to a digitally controlled micro-mirror device, the Polygon 400 (Mightex Systems, Toronto, ON), with a high power blue (470 nm) LED (BLS-LCS-0470-50-22-H, Mightex Systems). Before starting the actual experiments, all monolayers were mapped during 1 Hz electrical point stimulation to check baseline conditions. Electrical stimulation was performed by applying 10-ms-long rectangular electrical pulses with an amplitude of 8 V to a bipolar platinum electrode with a spacing of 1.5 mm between anode and cathode. Only cultures with an action potential duration (APD) at 80% repolarisation (APD80) below 350 ms and a conduction velocity (CV) above 18 cm/s were used for further experiments. Stimuli were applied in trains that varied in number and period. Whenever the outcome was reproducible three consecutive times in a single monolayer, it was counted as successful and included as one measurement in the total dataset. The constant light intensity was varied in the range of (0.03125–0.25 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) to search the critical value for the bi-stable regime. For experiments in which the light intensity was varied the rectangular-shaped area of illumination was in the range of 4 × 4 to 6 × 6 mm. The highest achievable irradiation intensity (0.3125 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) was used to perform size modulation experiments. The resulting electrical activity was recorded for 6–24 s at exposure times of 6 ms per frame.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Post-processing of optical mapping data</title><p>Data processing was performed using specialised BV Ana software (Scimedia), ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>) and custom-written scripts in Wolfram Mathematica (Wolfram Research, Hanborough, Oxfordshire, United Kingdom).

They study the electrophysiological behaviour of cultured neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes expressing the light-gated cation channel Cheriff, allowing them to induce local depolarization of varying area and amplitude, the latter titrated by the applied light intensity. In addition, they used computational modeling to screen for critical parameters determining state transitions, and for dissecting the underlying mechanisms. Two stable states, thus bistability, could be induced upon local depolarization and electrical stimulation, one state characterized by a constant membrane voltage and a second spontaneously firing, thus oscillatory state. The resulting 'state' of the monolayer was dependent on the duration and frequency of electrical stimuli, as well as the size of the illuminated area and the applied light intensity determining the degree of depolarization as well as the steepness of the local voltage gradient. In addition to the induction of oscillatory behaviour, they also tested frequency-dependent termination of induced oscillations.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The data from optogenetic experiments and computational modelling provide quantitative insights into the parameter space determining the induction of spontaneous excitation in the monolayer. The most important findings can also be reproduced using a strongly reduced computational model, suggesting that the observed phenomena might be more generally applicable.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>While the study is thoroughly performed and provides interesting mechanistic insights into scenarios of ventricular arrhythmogenesis in the presence of localized depolarized tissue areas, the translational perspective of the study remains relatively vague.

To accomplish this, they use a careful calibration of electrical pacing characteristics (i.e., frequency, number of pulses) and illumination characteristics (i.e., light intensity, surface area) to show that there exists a &quot;sweet spot&quot; where oscillatory excitations can emerge proximal to the optogenetically depolarized region following electrical pacing cessation, akin to pacemaker cells. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate that a high-frequency electrical wave-train can be used to terminate these oscillatory excitations. The authors observed this oscillatory phenomenon both in vitro (using neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocyte monolayers) and in silico (using a computational action potential model of the same cell type). These are surprising findings and provide a novel approach for studying triggered activity in cardiac tissue.</p><p>The study is extremely thorough and one of the more memorable and grounded applications of cardiac optogenetics in the past decade. One of the benefits of the authors' &quot;two-prong&quot; approach of experimental preps and computational models is that they could probe the number of potential variable combinations much deeper than through in vitro experiments alone. The strong similarities between the real-life and computational findings suggest that these oscillatory excitations are consistent, reproducible, and controllable.</p><p>Triggered activity, which can lead to ventricular arrhythmias and cardiac sudden death, has been largely contributed to sub-cellular phenomena, such as early or delayed afterdepolarizations, and thus to date has largely been studied in isolated single cardiomyocytes. However, these findings have been difficult to translate to tissue- and organ-scale experiments, as well-coupled cardiac tissue has notably different electrical properties. This underscores the significance of the study's methodological advances: use of a constant depolarizing current in a subset of (illuminated) cells to reliably result in triggered activity could facilitate the more consistent evaluation of triggered activity at various scales. An experimental prep that is both repeatable and controllable (i.e., both initiated and terminated through the same means) is a boon for further inquiry.</p><p>The authors also substantially explored phase space and single cell analyses to document how this &quot;hidden&quot; bi-stable phenomenon can be uncovered during emergent collective tissue behavior. Calibration and testing of different aspects (e.g.: light intensity, illuminated surface area, electrical pulse frequency, electrical pulse count) and other deeper analyses, as illustrated in Figures S3-S8 and Video S1, are significant and commendable.</p><p>Given the study is computational, it is surprising that the authors did not replicate their findings using well-validated adult ventricular cardiomyocyte action potential models, such ten Tusscher 2006 or O'Hara 2011. This may have felt out-of-scope, given the nice alignment of rat cardiomyocyte data between in vitro and in silico experiments. However, it would have been helpful peace-of-mind validation, given the significant ionic current differences between neonatal rat and adult ventricular tissue. It is not fully clear whether the pulse trains could have resulted in the same bi-stable oscillatory behavior, given the longer APD of humans relative to rats. The observed phenomenon certainly would be frequency-dependent and would have required tedious calibration for a new cell type, albeit partially mitigated by the relative ease of in silico experiments.</p><p>There are likely also mechanistic differences between this optogenetically-tied oscillatory behavior and triggered activity observed in other studies. This is because the constant light-elicited depolarizing current is disrupting the typical resting cardiomyocyte state, thereby altering the balance between depolarizing ionic currents (such as Na+ and Ca2+) and repolarizing ionic currents (such as K+ and Ca2+). The oscillatory excitations appear to later emerge at the border of the illuminated region and non-stimulated surrounding tissue, which is likely an area of high source-sink mismatch. The authors appear to acknowledge differences in this oscillatory behavior and previous sub-cellular triggered activity research in their discussion of ectopic pacemaker activity, which are canonically observed in genetic, pharmacologic, or pathological ionic conditions. Regardless, it is exciting to see new ground being broken in this difficult-to-characterize experimental space, even if the method illustrated here may not necessarily be broadly applicable.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>I have read the authors' rebuttal to our earlier comments and do not have any further questions or comments.

They study the electrophysiological behaviour of cultured neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes expressing the light-gated cation channel Cheriff, allowing them to induce local depolarization of varying area and amplitude, the latter titrated by the applied light intensity. In addition, they used computational modeling to screen for critical parameters determining state transitions and to dissect the underlying mechanisms. Two stable states, thus bistability, could be induced upon local depolarization and electrical stimulation, one state characterized by a constant membrane voltage and a second, spontaneously firing, thus oscillatory state. The resulting 'state' of the monolayer was dependent on the duration and frequency of electrical stimuli, as well as the size of the illuminated area and the applied light intensity, determining the degree of depolarization as well as the steepness of the local voltage gradient. In addition to the induction of oscillatory behaviour, they also tested frequency-dependent termination of induced oscillations.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The data from optogenetic experiments and computational modelling provide quantitative insights into the parameter space determining the induction of spontaneous excitation in the monolayer. The most important findings can also be reproduced using a strongly reduced computational model, suggesting that the observed phenomena might be more generally applicable.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>While the study is thoroughly performed and provides interesting mechanistic insights into scenarios of ventricular arrhythmogenesis in the presence of localized depolarized tissue areas, the translational perspective of the study remains relatively vague. In addition, the chosen theoretical approach and the way the data are presented might make it difficult for the wider community of cardiac researchers to understand the significance of the study.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>In the presented manuscript, Teplenin and colleagues use both electrical pacing and optogenetic stimulation to create a reproducible, controllable source of ectopy in cardiomyocyte monolayers. To accomplish this, they use a careful calibration of electrical pacing characteristics (i.e., frequency, number of pulses) and illumination characteristics (i.e., light intensity, surface area) to show that there exists a &quot;sweet spot&quot; where oscillatory excitations can emerge proximal to the optogenetically depolarized region following electrical pacing cessation, akin to pacemaker cells. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate that a high-frequency electrical wave-train can be used to terminate these oscillatory excitations. The authors observed this oscillatory phenomenon both in vitro (using neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocyte monolayers) and in silico (using a computational action potential model of the same cell type). These are surprising findings and provide a novel approach for studying triggered activity in cardiac tissue.</p><p>The study is extremely thorough and one of the more memorable and grounded applications of cardiac optogenetics in the past decade. One of the benefits of the authors' &quot;two-prong&quot; approach of experimental preps and computational models is that they could probe the number of potential variable combinations much deeper than through in vitro experiments alone. The strong similarities between the real-life and computational findings suggest that these oscillatory excitations are consistent, reproducible, and controllable.</p><p>Triggered activity, which can lead to ventricular arrhythmias and cardiac sudden death, has been largely attributed to sub-cellular phenomena, such as early or delayed afterdepolarizations, and thus to date has largely been studied in isolated single cardiomyocytes. However, these findings have been difficult to translate to tissue and organ-scale experiments, as well-coupled cardiac tissue has notably different electrical properties. This underscores the significance of the study's methodological advances: the use of a constant depolarizing current in a subset of (illuminated) cells to reliably result in triggered activity could facilitate the more consistent evaluation of triggered activity at various scales. An experimental prep that is both repeatable and controllable (i.e., both initiated and terminated through the same means).</p><p>The authors also substantially explored phase space and single-cell analyses to document how this &quot;hidden&quot; bi-stable phenomenon can be uncovered during emergent collective tissue behavior. Calibration and testing of different aspects (e.g., light intensity, illuminated surface area, electrical pulse frequency, electrical pulse count) and other deeper analyses, as illustrated in Appendix 2, Figures 3-8, are significant and commendable.</p><p>Given that the study is computational, it is surprising that the authors did not replicate their findings using well-validated adult ventricular cardiomyocyte action potential models, such as ten Tusscher 2006 or O'Hara 2011. This may have felt out of scope, given the nice alignment of rat cardiomyocyte data between in vitro and in silico experiments. However, it would have been helpful peace-of-mind validation, given the significant ionic current differences between neonatal rat and adult ventricular tissue. It is not fully clear whether the pulse trains could have resulted in the same bi-stable oscillatory behavior, given the longer APD of humans relative to rats. The observed phenomenon certainly would be frequency-dependent and would have required tedious calibration for a new cell type, albeit partially mitigated by the relative ease of in silico experiments.</p><p>For all its strengths, there are likely significant mechanistic differences between this optogenetically tied oscillatory behavior and triggered activity observed in other studies. This is because the constant light-elicited depolarizing current is disrupting the typical resting cardiomyocyte state, thereby altering the balance between depolarizing ionic currents (such as Na+ and Ca2+) and repolarizing ionic currents (such as K+ and Ca2+).

The authors appear to acknowledge differences in this oscillatory behavior and previous sub-cellular triggered activity research in their discussion of ectopic pacemaker activity, which is canonically expected more so from genetic or pathological conditions. Regardless, it is exciting to see new ground being broken in this difficult-to-characterize experimental space, even if the method illustrated here may not necessarily be broadly applicable.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their thoughtful and constructive feedback, as well as for recognizing the conceptual and technical strengths of our work. We are especially pleased that our integrated use of optogenetics, electrical pacing, and computational modelling was seen as a rigorous and innovative approach to investigating spontaneous excitability in cardiac tissue.</p><p>At the core of our study was the decision to focus exclusively on neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes. This ensured a tightly controlled and consistent environment across experimental and computational settings, allowing for direct comparison and deeper mechanistic insight. While extending our findings to adult or human cardiomyocytes would enhance translational relevance, such efforts are complicated by the distinct ionic properties and action potential dynamics of these cells, as also noted by Reviewer #2. For this foundational study, we chose to prioritize depth and clarity over breadth.</p><p>Our computational domain was designed to faithfully reflect the experimental system. The strong agreement between both domains is encouraging and supports the robustness of our framework. Although some degree of theoretical abstraction was necessary (thereby sometimes making it a bit harder to read), it reflects the intrinsic complexity of the collective behaviours we aimed to capture such as emergent bi-stability. To make these ideas more accessible, we included simplified illustrations, a reduced model, and extensive supplementary material.</p><p>A key insight from our work is the emergence of oscillatory behaviour through interaction of illuminated and non-illuminated regions. Rather than replicating classical sub-cellular triggered activity, this behaviour arises from systems-level dynamics shaped by the imposed depolarizing current and surrounding electrotonic environment. By tuning illumination and local pacing parameters, we could reproducibly induce and suppress these oscillations, thereby providing a controllable platform to study ectopy as a manifestation of spatial heterogeneity and collective dynamics.</p><p>Altogether, our aim was to build a clear and versatile model system for investigating how spatial structure and pacing influence the conditions under which bistability becomes apparent in cardiac tissue. We believe this platform lays strong groundwork for future extensions into more physiologically and clinically relevant contexts.</p><p>In revising the manuscript, we carefully addressed all points raised by the reviewers. We have also responded to each of their specific comments in detail, which are provided below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the Authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Please find my specific comments and suggestions below:</p><p>(1) Line 64: When first introduced, the concept of 'emergent bi-stability' may not be clear to the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>We concur that the full breadth of the concept of emergent bi-stability may not be immediately clear upon first mention. Nonetheless, its components have been introduced separately: “emergent” was linked to multicellular behaviour in line 63, while “bi-stability” was described in detail in lines 39–56. We therefore believe that readers could form an intuitive understanding of the combined term, which will be further clarified as the manuscript develops. To further ease comprehension of the reader, we have added the following clarification to line 64:</p><p>“Within this dynamic system of cardiomyocytes, we investigated emergent bi-stability (a concept that will be explained more thoroughly later on) in cell monolayers under the influence of spatial depolarization patterns.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Lines 67-80: While the introduction until line 66 is extremely well written, the introduction of both cardiac arrhythmia and cardiac optogenetics could be improved. It is especially surprising that miniSOG is first mentioned as a tool for optogenetic depolarisation of cardiomyocytes, as the authors would probably agree that Channelrhodopsins are by far the most commonly applied tools for optogenetic depolarisation (please also refer to the literature by others in this respect). In addition, miniSOG has side effects other than depolarisation, and thus cannot be the tool of choice when not directly studying the effects of oxidative stress or damage.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is absolutely correct in noting that channelrhodopsins are the most commonly applied tools for optogenetic depolarisation. We introduced miniSOG primarily for historical context: the effects of specific depolarization patterns on collective pacemaker activity were first observed with this tool (Teplenin et al., 2018). In that paper, we also reported ultralong action potentials, occurring as a side effect of cumulative miniSOG-induced ROS damage. In the following paragraph (starting at line 81), we emphasize that membrane potential can be controlled much better using channelrhodopsins, which is why we employed them in the present study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Line 78: I appreciate the concept of 'high curvature', but please always state which parameter(s) you are referring to (membrane voltage in space/time, etc?).</p></disp-quote><p>We corrected our statement to include the specification of space curvature of the depolarised region:</p><p>“In such a system, it was previously observed that spatiotemporal illumination can give rise to collective behaviour and ectopic waves (Teplenin et al. (2018)) originating from illuminated/depolarised regions (with high spatial curvature).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Line 79: 'bi-stable state' - not yet properly introduced in this context.</p></disp-quote><p>The bi-stability mentioned here refers back to single cell bistability introduced in Teplenin et al. (2018), which we cited again for clarity.</p><p>“These waves resulted from the interplay between the diffusion current and the single cell bi-stable state (Teplenin et al. (2018)) that was induced in the illuminated region.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Line 84-85: 'these ion channels allow the cells to respond' - please describe the channel used; and please correct: the channels respond to light, not the cells. Re-ordering this paragraph may help, because first you introduce channels for depolarization, then you go back to both de- and hyperpolarization. On the same note, which channels can be used for hyperpolarization of cardiomyocytes? I am not aware of any, even WiChR shows depolarizing effects in cardiomyocytes during prolonged activation (Vierock et al. 2022). Please delete: 'through a direct pathway' (Channelrhodopsins a directly light-gated channels, there are no pathways involved).</p></disp-quote><p>We realised that the confusion arose from our use of incorrect terminology: we mistakenly wrote hyperpolarisation instead of repolarisation. In addition to channelrhodopsins such as WiChR, other tools can also induce a repolarising effect, including light-activatable chloride pumps (e.g., JAWS). However, to improve clarity, we recognize that repolarisation is not relevant to our manuscript and therefore decided to remove its mention (see below). Regarding the reported depolarising effects of WiChR in Vierock et al. (2022), we speculate that these may arise either from the specific phenotype of the cardiomyocytes used in the study, i.e. human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived atrial myocytes (aCMs), or from the particular ionic conditions applied during patch-clamp recordings (e.g., a bath solution containing 1 mM KCl). Notably, even after prolonged WiChR activation, the aCMs maintained a strongly negative maximum diastolic potential of approximately –55 mV.</p><p>“Although effects of illuminating miniSOG with light might lead to formation of depolarised areas, it is difficult to control the process precisely since it depolarises cardiomyocytes indirectly. Therefore, in this manuscript, we used light-sensitive ion channels to obtain more refined control over cardiomyocyte depolarisation. These ion channels allow the cells to respond to specific wavelengths of light, facilitating direct depolarisation (Ördög et al. (2021, 2023)). By inducing cardiomyocyte depolarisation only in the illuminated areas, optogenetics enables precise spatiotemporal control of cardiac excitability, an attribute we exploit in this manuscript (Appendix 2 Figure 1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Figure 1: What would be the y-axis of the 'energy-like curves' in B? What exactly did you plot here?</p></disp-quote><p>The graphs in Figure 1B are schematic representations intended to clarify the phenomenon for the reader. They do not depict actual data from any simulation or experiment. We clarified this misunderstanding by specifying that Figure 1B is a schematic representation of the effects at play in this paper.</p><p>“(B) Schematic representation showing how light intensity influences collective behaviour of excitable systems, transitioning between a stationary state (STA) at low illumination intensities and an oscillatory state (OSC) at high illumination intensities. Bi-stability occurs at intermediate light intensities, where transitions between states are dependent on periodic wave train properties. TR. OSC, transient oscillations.”</p><p>To expand slightly beyond the paper: our schematic representation was inspired by a common visualization in dynamical systems used to illustrate bi-stability (for an example, see Fig. 3 in Schleimer, J. H., Hesse, J., Contreras, S. A., &amp; Schreiber, S. (2021). Firing statistics in the bistable regime of neurons with homoclinic spike generation. Physical Review E, 103(1), 012407.). In this framework, the y-axis can indeed be interpreted as an energy landscape, which is related to a probability measure through the Boltzmann distribution: <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="sa3m1"><mml:mstyle><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="false"><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mi>ln</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math><tex-math id="inft61">\begin{document}$E=\beta \ln \left(\frac{1}{p}\right)$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>. Here, p denotes the probability of occupying a particular state (STA or OSC). This probability can be estimated from the area (BCL × number of pulses) falling within each state, as shown in Fig. 4C. Since an attractor corresponds to a high-probability state, it naturally appears as a potential well in the landscape.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Lines 92-93: 'this transition resulted for the interaction of an illuminated region with depolarized CM and an external wave train' - please consider rephrasing (it is not the region interacting with depolarized CM; and the external wave train could be explained more clearly).</p></disp-quote><p>We rephrased our unclear sentence as follows:</p><p>“This transition resulted from the interaction of depolarized cardiomyocytes in an illuminated region with an external wave train not originating from within the illuminated region.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Figure 2 and elsewhere: When mentioning 'frequency', please state frequency values and not cycle lengths. Please also reconsider your distinction between high and low frequencies; 200 ms (5 Hz) is actually the normal heart rate for neonatal rats (300 bpm).</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised version, we have clarified frequency values explicitly and included them alongside period values wherever frequency is mentioned, to avoid any ambiguity. We also emphasize that our use of &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; frequency is strictly a relative distinction within the context of our data, and not meant to imply a biological interpretation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Lines 129-131: Why not record optical maps? Voltage dynamics in the transition zone between depolarised and non-depolarised regions might be especially interesting to look at?</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to clarify that optical maps were recorded for every experiment, and all experimental traces of cardiac monolayer activity were derived from these maps. We agree with the reviewer that the voltage dynamics in the transition zone are particularly interesting. However, we selected the data representations that, in our view, best highlight the main mechanisms. When we analysed full voltage profiles, they didn’t add extra insights to this main mechanism. As the other reviewer noted, the manuscript already presents a wide range of regimes, so we decided not to introduce further complexity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) Lines 156-157: Why was the model not adapted to match the biophysical properties (e.g., kinetics, ion selectivity, light sensitivity) of Cheriff?</p></disp-quote><p>The model was not adapted to the biophysical properties of Cheriff, because this would entail a whole new study involving extensive patch-clamping experiments, fitting, and calibration to model the correct properties of the ion channel. Beyond considerations of time efficiency, incorporating more specific modelling parameters would not change the essence of our findings. While numeric parameter ranges might shift, the core results would remain unchanged. This is a result of our experimental design where we applied constant illumination of long duration (6s or longer), thus making a difference in kinetical properties of an optogenetic tool irrelevant. In addition, we were able to observe qualitatively similar phenomena using many other depolarising optogenetic tools (e.g. ChR2, ReaChR, CatCh and more) in our <italic>in-vitro experiments.</italic> We ended up with Cheriff as our optotool-of-choice for the practical reasons of good light-sensitivity and a non-overlapping spectrum with our fluorescent dyes.</p><p>Therefore, computationally using a more general depolarising ion channel hints at the more general applicability of the observed phenomena, supporting our claim of a universal mechanism (demonstrated experimentally with CheRiff and computationally with ChR2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) Line 158: 1.7124 mW/mm^2 - While I understand that this is the specific intensity used as input in the model, I am convinced that the model is not as accurate to predict behaviour at this specific intensity (4 digits after the comma), especially given that the model has not been adapted to Cheriff (probably more light sensitive than ChR2). Can this be rephrased?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not aim for quantitative correspondence between the computational model and the biological experiments, but rather for qualitative agreement and mechanistic insight (see line 157). Qualitative comparisons are computationally obtained in a whole range of different intensities, as demonstrated in the 3D diagram of Fig. 4C. We wanted to demonstrate that at one fixed light intensity (chosen to be 1.7124 mW/mm^2 for the most clear effect), it was possible for all three states (STA, OSC. TR. OSC.) to coexist depending on the number of pulses and their period. Therefore the specific intensity used in the computational model is correct, and for reproducibility, we have left it unchanged while clarifying that it refers specifically to the <italic>in silico</italic> model:</p><p>“Simulating at a fixed constant illumination of 1.7124 𝑚𝑊∕𝑚𝑚<sup>2</sup> and a fixed number of 4 pulses, frequency dependency of collective bi-stability was reproduced in Figure 4A.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) Lines 160, 165, and elsewhere: 'Once again, Once more' - please delete or rephrase.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that we could have written these binding words better and reformulated them to:</p><p>“Similar to the experimental observations, only intermediate electrical pacing frequencies (500-𝑚𝑠 period) caused transitions from collective stationary behaviour to collective oscillatory behaviour and ectopic pacemaker activity had periods (710 𝑚𝑠) that were different from the stimulation train period (500 𝑚𝑠). Figure 4B shows the accumulation of pulses necessary to invoke a transition from the collective stationary state to the collective oscillatory state at a fixed stimulation period (600 𝑚𝑠). Also in the in silico simulations, ectopic pacemaker activity had periods (750 𝑚𝑠) that were different from the stimulation train period (600 𝑚𝑠). Also for the transient oscillatory state, the simulations show frequency selectivity (Appendix 2 Figure 4B).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(13) Line 171: 'illumination strength': please refer to 'light intensity'.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised our formulation to now refer specifically to “light intensity”:</p><p>“We previously identified three important parameters influencing such transitions: light intensity, number of pulses, and frequency of pulses.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(14) Lines 187-188: 'the illuminated region settles into this period of sending out pulses' - please rephrase, the meaning is not clear.</p></disp-quote><p>We reformulated our sentence to make its content more clear to the reader:</p><p>“For the conditions that resulted in stable oscillations, the green vertical lines in the middle and right slices represent the natural pacemaker frequency in the oscillatory state.

I suggest providing the parameters (e.g., 800 ms cycle length, 2 pulses, etc) for all combinations, but not rate them with low, high, etc. (see also comment above).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments and have revised the caption for figure 7, which now reads as follows:</p><p>“Figure 7.

However, for β and γ, the stable limit cycle is approached from outside and inside, respectively, and ectopic pacemaker activity is induced.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(16) Line 258: 'other dimensions by the electrotonic current' - not clear, please rephrase and explain.</p></disp-quote><p>We realized that our explanation was somewhat convoluted and have therefore changed the text as follows:</p><p>“Rather than producing oscillations, the system returns to the stationary state along dimensions other than those shown in Figure 7C (Voltage and x<sub>r</sub>), as evidenced by the phase space trajectory crossing itself.

This also applies elsewhere- the selection of parameters seems quite arbitrary, please make sure the selection process is more transparent to the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>Our choice of parameters was guided by the dynamical properties of the illuminated cells as well as by illustrative purposes. The value of –58 mV corresponds to the stimulation threshold of the model. The values of 50 mV and –20 mV match those used for single-cell stimulation (Figure 8C2, right panel), producing excitable and bistable dynamics, respectively. We refer to this point in line 288 with the phrase “building on this result.” To maintain conciseness, we did not elaborate on the underlying reasoning within the manuscript and instead reported only the results.</p><p>We also corrected the previously missed minus sign: -58 mV.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(20) Figure 8 and corresponding text: I don't understand what stimulation with a voltage means. Is this an externally applied electric field? Or did you inject a current necessary to change the membrane voltage by this value? Please explain.</p></disp-quote><p>Stimulation with a specific voltage is a standard computational technique and can be likened to performing a voltage-clamp experiment on each individual cell. In this approach, the voltage of every cell in the tissue is briefly forced to a defined value.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(21) Figure 8C- panel 2: Traces at -20 mV and + 50 mV are identical. Is this correct? Please explain.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, that is correct. The cell responds similarly to a voltage stimulus of -20 mV or one of 50 mV, because both values are well above the excitation threshold of a cardiomyocyte.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(22) Line 344 and elsewhere: 'diffusion current' - This is probably not the correct terminology for gap-junction mediated currents. Please rephrase.</p></disp-quote><p>A diffusion current is a mathematical formulation for a gap junction mediated current here, so , depending on the background of the reader, one of the terms might be used focusing on different aspects of the results. In a mathematical modelling context one often refers to a diffusion current because cardiomyocytes monolayers and tissues can be modelled using a reaction-diffusion equation. From the context of fine-grain biological and biophysical details, one uses the term gap-junction mediated current. Our choice is motivated by the main target audience we have in mind, namely interdisciplinary researchers with a core background in the mathematics/physics/computer science fields.</p><p>However, to not exclude our secondary target audience of biological and medical readers we now clarified the terminology, drawing the parallel between the different fields of study at line 79:</p><p>“These waves resulted from the interplay between the diffusion current (also known in biology/biophysics as the gap junction mediated current) and the bi-stable state that was induced in the illuminated region.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(23) Lines 357-58: 'Such ectopic sources are typically initiated by high frequency pacing' - While this might be true during clinical testing, how would you explain this when not externally imposed? What could be biological high-frequency triggers?</p></disp-quote><p>Biological high-frequency triggers could include sudden increases in heart rates, such as those induced by physical activity or emotional stress. Another possibility is the occurrence of paroxysmal atrial or ventricular fibrillation, which could then give rise to an ectopic source.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(24) Lines 419-420: 'large ionic cell currents and small repolarising coupling currents'. Are coupling currents actually small in comparison to cellular currents? Can you provide relative numbers (~ratio)?</p></disp-quote><p>Coupling currents are indeed small compared to cellular currents. This can be inferred from the I-V curve shown in Figure 8C1, which dips below 0 and creates bi-stability only because of the small coupling current. If the coupling current were larger, the system would revert to a monostable regime. To make this more concrete, we have now provided the exact value of the coupling current used in Figure 8C1.</p><p>“Otherwise, if the hills and dips of the N-shaped steady-state IV curve were large (Figure 8C-1), they would have similar magnitudes as the large currents of fast ion channels, preventing the subtle interaction between these strong ionic cell currents and the small repolarising coupling currents (-0.103649 ≈ 0.1 pA).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(25) Line 426: Please explain how ‘voltage shocks’ were modelled.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to refer the reviewer to our response to comment (20) regarding how we model voltage shocks. In the context of line 426, a typical voltage shock corresponds to a tissue-wide stimulus of 50 mV. Independent of our computational model, line 426 also cites other publications showing that, in clinical settings, high-voltage shocks are unable to terminate ectopic sustained activity, consistent with our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(26) Lines 429 ff: 0.2pA/pF would correspond to 20 pA for a small cardiomyocyte of 100 pF, this current should be measurable using patch-clamp recordings.</p></disp-quote><p>In trying to be succinct, we may have caused some confusion. The difference between the dips (<italic>≈</italic>-0.07 pA/pF) and hills (_≈_0.11 pA/pF) is approximately 0.18 pA/pF. For a small cardiomyocyte, this corresponds to deviations from zero of roughly ±10 pA. Considering that typical RMS noise levels in whole-cell patch-clamp recordings range from 2-10 pA , it is understandable that detecting these peaks and dips in an I-V curve (average current after holding a voltage for an extended period) is difficult. Achieving statistical significance would therefore require patching a large number of cells.</p><p>Given the already extensive scope of our manuscript in terms of techniques and concepts, we decided not to pursue these additional patch-clamp experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Given the deluge of conditions to consider, there are several areas of improvement possible in communicating the authors' findings. I have the following suggestions to improve the manuscript.</p><p>(1) Please change &quot;pulse train&quot; straight pink bar OR add stimulation marks (such as &quot;*&quot;, or individual pulse icons) to provide better visual clarity that the applied stimuli are &quot;short ON, long OFF&quot; electrical pulses. I had significant initial difficulty understanding what the pulse bars represented in Figures 2, 3, 4A-B, etc. This may be partially because stimuli here could be either light (either continuous or pulsed) or electrical (likely pulsed only). To me, a solid &amp; unbroken line intuitively denotes a continuous stimulation. I understand now that the pink bar represents the entire pulse-train duration, but I think readers would be better served with an improvement to this indicator in some fashion. For instance, the &quot;phases&quot; were much clearer in Figures 7C and 8D because of how colour was used on the Vm(t) traces. (How you implement this is up to you, though!)</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed the reviewer’s concern and updated the figures by marking each external pulse with a small vertical line (see below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Please label the electrical stimulation location (akin to the labelled stimulation marker in circle 2 state in Figure 1A) in at least Figures 2 and 4A, and at most throughout the manuscript. It is unclear which &quot;edge&quot; or &quot;pixel&quot; the pulse-train is originating from, although I've assumed it's the left edge of the 2D tissue (both in vitro and silico). This would help readers compare the relative timing of dark blue vs. orange optical signal tracings and to understand how the activation wavefront transverses the tissue.</p></disp-quote><p>We indicated the pacing electrode in the optical voltage recordings with a grey asterisk. For the <italic>in silico</italic> simulations, the electrode was assumed to be far away, and the excitation was modelled as a parallel wave originating from the top boundary, indicated with a grey zone.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Given the prevalence of computational experiments in this study, I suggest considering making a straightforward video demonstrating basic examples of STA, OSC, and TR.OSC states. I believe that a video visualizing these states would be visually clarifying to and greatly appreciated by readers. Appendix 2 Figure 3 would be the no-motion visualization of the examples I'm thinking of (i.e., a corresponding stitched video could be generated for this). However, this video-generation comment is a suggestion and not a request.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a video showing all relevant states, which is now part of the Supplementary Material.</p><p>(4) Please fix several typos that I found in the manuscript:</p><p>(4A) Line 279: a comma is needed after i.e. when used in: &quot;peculiar, i.e. a standard&quot;. However, this is possibly stylistic (discard suggestion if you are consistent in the manuscript).</p><p>(4B) Line 382: extra period before &quot;(Figure 3C)&quot;.</p><p>(4C) Line 501: two periods at end of sentence &quot;scientific purposes..&quot; .</p><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for pointing out these typos. We have corrected them and conducted an additional check throughout the manuscript for minor errors.</p></body></sub-article></article>
