Our previous work demonstrated that TNFAIP2 activates RAC1 to promote TNBC cell proliferation and migration. However, the mechanism by which TNFAIP2 activates RAC1 is unknown. In this study, we found that TNFAIP2 interacts with IQGAP1 and Integrin β4. Integrin β4 activates RAC1 through TNFAIP2 and IQGAP1 and confers DNA damage-related drug resistance in TNBC.

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bray et al., 2018</xref>). Although the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer has entered the era of molecular typing, 35% of breast cancers still experience recurrence, metastasis, and treatment failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>). According to the expression of estrogen receptor (ERα), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2), breast cancer is divided into ER/PR-positive, HER2-positive, and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sotiriou and Pusztai, 2009</xref>). For ER/PR- and HER2-positive breast cancer, endocrine therapies such as tamoxifen and anti-HER2 targeted therapy such as trastuzumab have achieved good efficacy. Targeted drugs for TNBC patients with BRCA1/2 mutations include two poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, olaparib and talazoparib. These targeted drugs cannot fully meet the clinical needs of patients with various TNBC subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bai et al., 2021</xref>). Currently, DNA damage chemotherapy drugs, including epirubicin and cisplatin, are widely used for TNBC treatment.</p><p>TNBC often recurs and metastasizes due to the development of chemoresistance, although it is initially responsive to chemotherapeutic drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jamdade et al., 2015</xref>). Chemoresistance severely impacts the clinical outcomes of patients. Tumor cells become resistant to chemotherapeutic agents through several mechanisms, such as improving DNA damage repair, changing the intracellular accumulation of drugs, or increasing anti-apoptotic mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hill et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, characterization of the underlying molecular mechanisms by which resistance occurs will provide opportunities to develop precise therapies to enhance the efficacy of standard chemotherapy regimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Longley and Johnston, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rincón et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>TNFAIP2 is abnormally highly expressed in a variety of tumor cells, including TNBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jia et al., 2016</xref>), nasopharyngeal carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2011</xref>), malignant glioma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng et al., 2015</xref>), uroepithelial carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Niwa et al., 2019</xref>), and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xie and Wang, 2017</xref>), and is associated with poor prognosis. Our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jia et al., 2018</xref>) showed that TNFAIP2, as a KLF5 downstream target protein, can interact with RAC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Didsbury et al., 1989</xref>), a member of the Rho small GTP enzyme family, and activate RAC1 to alter the cytoskeleton, thereby inducing filopodia and lamellipodia formation and promoting the adhesion, migration, and invasion of TNBC cells. After activation, RAC1 can activate AKT, PAKs, NADPH oxidase, and other related signaling pathways to promote cell survival, proliferation, adhesion, migration, and invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rul et al., 2002</xref>). Activation of RAC1 can reduce the therapeutic response to trastuzumab in breast cancer and increase the resistance of TNBC cells to paclitaxel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2019</xref>), but the specific mechanism of action is not completely clear.</p><p>RAC1 has been shown to play an important role in DNA damage repair. Activated RAC1 can promote the phosphorylation of the DNA damage response-related molecules ATM/ATR, CHK1/2, and H2AX by activating the activity of protein kinases such as ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wu et al., 2019</xref>), thus improving the DNA damage repair ability and inhibiting tumor cell apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hervieu et al., 2020</xref>). RAC1 also promotes aldolase release and activation by changing the cytoskeleton and activates the ERK pathway to increase the pentose phosphate pathway to promote nucleic acid synthesis, providing more raw materials for DNA damage repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feng et al., 2010</xref>). At the same time, the interaction of RAC1 and PI3K promoted AKT phosphorylation and glucose uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Higuchi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hu et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, RAC1 is well established to promote the chemoresistance of breast cancer by promoting DNA damage repair.</p><p>Integrin β4 (ITGB4) is a major component of hemidesmosomes and a receptor molecule of laminin. Studies have shown that laminin-5 interacts with ITGB4 to activate RAC1 activity and promote cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hamill et al., 2009</xref>) and polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wu et al., 2018</xref>) by altering the cytoskeleton. Since ITGB4-positive cancer stem cell (CSC)-enriched mesenchymal cells were found to reside in an intermediate epithelial/mesenchymal phenotypic state, ITGB4 can be used to enable stratification of mesenchymal-like TNBC cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bierie et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, the expression of ITGB4 on ALDH<sup>high</sup> breast cancer and head and neck cancer cells was significantly greater than that on ALDH<sup>low</sup> cells, proving the effects that ITGB4 targets on both bulk and CSC populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ruan et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, ITGB4-overexpressing TNBC cells provided cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) with ITGB4 proteins via exosomes, and ITGB4-overexpressing CAF-conditioned medium promoted the proliferation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and invasion of breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sung et al., 2020</xref>). ITGB4 also promotes breast cancer cell resistance to tamoxifen-induced apoptosis by activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and promotes breast cancer cell resistance to anoikis by activating RAC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). However, how ITGB4 activates RAC1 is not completely clear.</p><p>RAC1 activity is regulated by guanylate exchange factors (GEFs), GTPase activation proteins (GAPs), and guanine separation inhibitors (GDIs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cherfils and Zeghouf, 2013</xref>). GAPs typically provide the necessary catalytic groups for GTP hydrolysis, but not all GAPs function as hydrolases. IQGAP1 lacks an arginine in the GTPase binding domain and cannot exert the hydrolysis effect of GAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schmidt, 2012</xref>). IQGAP1 can increase the activity of RAC1 and CDC42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Smith et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gorisse et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we demonstrated that TNFAIP2 interacts with IQGAP1 and ITGB4. ITGB4 promotes TNBC drug resistance via the TNFAIP2/IQGAP1/RAC1 axis by promoting DNA damage repair. Our results suggest that ITGB4 and TNFAIP2 might serve as promising therapeutic targets for TNBC.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TNFAIP2 promotes TNBC DNA damage-related drug resistance</title><p>To explore the functional significance of TNFAIP2 in TNBC drug resistance, we constructed stable TNFAIP2 overexpression and TNFAIP2 knockdown HCC1806 and HCC1937 cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–E</xref>, overexpression of TNFAIP2 significantly increased cell viability when treated with Epirubicin (EPI) and Talazoparib (BMN). Additionally, knockdown of TNFAIP2 significantly decreased cell viability when treated with EPI and BMN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–J</xref>).

PARP inhibitors can cause DNA damage repair defects and have synergistic lethal effects with HRD. Meanwhile, chemotherapy and PARP inhibitor resistance is also a major problem in the clinic.</p><p>In this study, we first found that TNFAIP2 promotes TNBC drug resistance and DNA damage repair through RAC1. Next, we found that TNFAIP2 interacts with IQGAP1and ITGB4. We verified that ITGB4 promotes TNBC drug resistance and DNA damage repair through the TNFAIP2/IQGAP1/RAC1 axis. Interestingly, we discovered for the first time that ITGB4 and TNFAIP2 promote RAC1 activity through IQGAP1. Our study reveals that ITGB4 promotes TNBC resistance through TNFAIP2-, IQGAP1-, and RAC1-mediated DNA damage repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This study provides new targets for reversing TNBC resistance.</p><p>ITGB4 is well known to promote breast cancer stemness and can be activated by laminin-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Campbell et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, ITGB4 is generally in partner with ITGA6, which is another marker of breast CSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali et al., 2011</xref>) and drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Campbell et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, whether ITGA6 has similar functions needs further study. It was reported that ITGB4 activates RAC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Friedland et al., 2007</xref>), but the mechanism is unclear. For the first time, we revealed that ITGB4 activates RAC1 through TNFAIP2 and IQGAP1. More importantly, ITGB4 promotes drug resistance through the TNFAIP2/IQGAP1/RAC1 axis.</p><p>TNFAIP2 plays important roles in different cellular and physiological processes, including cell proliferation, adhesion, migration, membrane TNT formation, angiogenesis, inflammation, and tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jia et al., 2018</xref>). We previously found that TNFAIP2 was regulated by KLF5 and interacted with the small GTPases RAC1 and CDC42, thereby regulating the actin cytoskeleton and cell morphology in breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jia et al., 2016</xref>). However, the detailed mechanism is not clearly understood. In this study, we found that IQGAP1 mediates this process. IQGAP1 is a crucial regulator of cancer development by scaffolding and facilitating different oncogenic pathways, especially RAC1/CDC42, thus affecting proliferation, adhesion, migration, invasion, and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wei and Lambert, 2021</xref>). In addition, IQGAP1 is increased during the differentiation of ovarian CSCs and promotes aggressive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 2015</xref>). In our study, we found that TNFAIP2 interacts with IQGAP1 and thus activates RAC1 to induce chemotherapy and PARP inhibitor drug resistance.</p><p>Furthermore, TNFAIP2 was reported to induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and confer platinum resistance in urothelial cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Niwa et al., 2019</xref>), and in embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation, TNFAIP2 was found to be important in controlling lipid metabolism, which supports the ESC differentiation process and planarian organ maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deb et al., 2021</xref>). Another study found that TNFAIP2 overexpression enhanced TNT-mediated autophagosome and lysosome exchange, preventing advanced glycation end product (AGE)-induced autophagy and lysosome dysfunction and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barutta et al., 2023</xref>). In cancer treatment, TNFAIP2 was chosen as one of the six signature genes predicting chemotherapeutic and immunotherapeutic efficacies, with high-senescore patients benefiting from immunotherapy and low-senescore patients responsive to chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>These reports provide a possible explanation for previous studies showing that ITGB4 is important in EMT and cancer stemness. According to our results that there is an interaction between ITGB4 and TNFAIP2, ITGB4 might regulate EMT and stemness through TNFAIP2. TNFAIP2 is one of the important factors induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). Interestingly, TNFα release could be induced by therapeutic drugs from multiple tumor cell lines. The acquisition of docetaxel resistance was accompanied by increased constitutive production of TNFα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guo and Yuan, 2020</xref>). In addition, TNFα is a key tumor-promoting effector molecule secreted by tumor-associated macrophages. In vitro neutralizing TNFα was observed to inhibit tumor progression and improve the curative effect of bevacizumab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, the mechanism by which TNFα promotes chemotherapeutic resistance in breast cancer should be further investigated.</p><p>For future studies, it will be important to develop <italic>Tnfaip2</italic> knockout mice to investigate the exact role of TNFAIP2 physiologically. According to recent studies and our findings, agents targeting the interaction among ITGB4/TNFAIP2/IQGAP1 would be a promising trend for developing drugs to overcome the resistance phenomenon.</p><p>In summary, ITGB4 and TNFAIP2 play important roles in breast cancer chemoresistance. TNFAIP2 activates RAC1 to promote chemoresistance through IQGAP1. In addition, ITGB4 activates RAC1 through TNFAIP2 and IQGAP1 and confer DNA damage-related drug resistance in TNBC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>).

Mechanistically, it was demonstrated that TNFAIP2 bind with IQGAP1 and ITGB4 activating Rac1 and the following drug resistance. The present study focused on breast cancer cell lines with supporting data from mouse model and patient breast cancer tissues. The study is interesting. The experiments were well controlled and carefully carried out. The conclusion is supported by strong evidence provided in the manuscript. The authors may want to discuss the link between ITGB4 and Rac 1, between IQGAP1 and Rac1, and between TNFAIP2 and Rac1 as compared with the current results obtained. This is important considering some recent publications in this area (Cancer Sci 2021, J Biol Chem 2008, Cancer Res 2023).

One of subtypes in breast cancer is so called triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which represents the most difficult subtype to treat and cure in the clinic. Chemotherapy drugs including epirubicin and cisplatin are widely used for TNBC treatment. However, drug resistance remains as a challenge in the clinic. The authors uncovered a molecular pathway involved in chemotherapy drug resistance, and molecular players in this pathway represent as potential drug targets to overcome drug resistance. The experiments are well designed and the conclusions drawn mostly were supported by the data. The findings have potential to be translated into the clinic.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.88483.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>A summary of what the authors were trying to achieve:</p><p>- TNFAIP2 promotes TNBC drug resistance and DNA damage repair.</p><p>- Mechanistically, TNFAIP2 interacts with IQGAP1 and Integrin β4 to mediate RAC1 activation and thus promotes TNBC drug resistance.</p><p>- Clinically, TNFAIP2 expression levels positively correlated with ITGB4 in TNBC tissues.</p><p>- ITGB4 and TNFAIP2 might serve as promising therapeutic targets for TNBC.</p><p>-An account of the major strengths and weaknesses of the methods and results.</p><p>The authors performed numerous rescue experiments in vitro to confirm the relationship among ITGB4, TNFAIP2, IQGAP1 and Rac1. However, clinical relevance is somehow limited. Additional experiments are needed to demonstrate the above conclusions in clinical samples.</p><p>-An appraisal of whether the authors achieved their aims, and whether the results support their conclusions.</p><p>To most extent, the authors achieved their aims, and the results demonstrate their conclusions &quot;TNFAIP2 interacts with IQGAP1 and ITGB4. ITGB4 promotes TNBC drug resistance via the TNFAIP2/IQGAP1/RAC1 axis by promoting DNA damage repair&quot;.</p><p>-A discussion of the likely impact of the work on the field, and the utility of the methods and data to the community.</p><p>Drug resistance is always a challenge for TNBC treatment. This paper found that TNFAIP2 interacts with IQGAP1 and ITGB4 to activate Rac1, thus conferring DNA chemo-resistance to TNBC cells. In addition, positive correlation between the expression of TNFAIP2 and ITGB4 in TNBC tissues were presented. This paper suggests that the ITGB4/TNFAIP2/IQGAP1/Rac1 axis provides potential therapeutic targets to overcome chemo-resistance (DNA damage drugs) in fighting with TNBC.</p><p>Additional context to help readers interpret or understand the significance of the work:</p><p>This work reported a new mechanism related to TNBC chemo-resistance, which mainly depends on ordered interactions among ITGB4/TNFAIP2/IQGAP1/Rac1 and the following activation of pathways. Thus micro-peptide targeting technique, which is widely used to develop targeted drugs for protein-protein interactions, could show extraordinary potentials and application significance.</p><p>At present, cell penetrating peptide, a type of micro-peptide targeting technique, makes functional micro-peptides more stable by cross-linking some amino acid side chains. In recent years, it has been found that binding peptides can not only stabilize peptides, make them easier to enter cells, but also not easy to be hydrolyzed by proteases. At the same time, they have high affinity for targets and can target protein interactions, thus becoming a new way to develop protein interaction targeting inhibitors. To make it easier to enter cells, cell-penetrating peptides can be used in combination, such as HIV TAT. Cell-penetrating peptides can carry a variety of biologically active substances into the cell, is a good targeting drug carrier, with low toxicity, not limited by cell type, into the cell speed and high transduction efficiency. Based on the mechanism reported here, researchers can explore new micro-peptides targeting the interactions between ITGB4 and TNFAIP2 or TNFAIP2 and IQGAP1 to enhance the sensitivity of TNBC cells to drugs by cell-penetrating peptide technology.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.88483.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Fang</surname><given-names>Huan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Kunming Institute of Zoology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">kunming</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ren</surname><given-names>Wenlong</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Science &amp; Technology of China</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Hefei</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Cui</surname><given-names>Qiuxia</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>national cancer center/national clinical research for cancer/cancer hospital &amp; shenzhen hospital</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">shenzhen</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Liang</surname><given-names>Huichun</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Kunming Institute of Zoology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">kunming</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Chuanyu</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Kunming Institute of Zoology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">kunming</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Wenjing</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Kunming Institute of Zoology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">kunming</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Xinye</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Kunming Institute of Zoology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">kunming</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Xue</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Shanghai University of Medicine &amp; Health Sciences</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">shanghai</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>Yujie</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">zhengzhou</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Feng</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>The Second Affiliated Hospital of the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen)</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">shenzhen</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Ceshi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Kunming Medical University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Kunming</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p><p>In this study, Fang H et al. describe a potential pathway, ITGB4-TNFAIP2-IQGAP1-Rac1, that may involve in the drug resistance in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Mechanistically, it was demonstrated that TNFAIP2 bind with IQGAP1 and ITGB4 activating Rac1 and the following drug resistance. The present study focused on breast cancer cell lines with supporting data from mouse model and patient breast cancer tissues. The study is interesting. The experiments were well controlled and carefully carried out. The conclusion is supported by strong evidence provided in the manuscript. The authors may want to discuss the link between ITGB4 and Rac1, between IQGAP1 and Rac1, and between TNFAIP2 and Rac1 as compared with the current results obtained. This is important considering some recent publications in this area (Cancer Sci 2021, J Biol Chem 2008, Cancer Res 2023). In addition, some key points need to be addressed in order to support their conclusion in full.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your positive comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. It is rarely found studies using the term of &quot;DNA damage drug resistance&quot;. Do the authors mean &quot;DNA damage and drug resistance&quot; or &quot;DNA damage-related drug resistance&quot; or &quot;DNA damage-induced drug resistance&quot;? It is better to define &quot;DNA damage drug resistance&quot; in the manuscript if it is not a common term in the field.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with you that the description &quot;DNA damage-related drug resistance&quot; is better so that we revised it uniformly in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. For Figure 4A, it is stated the IQGAP1 is identified via IP-MS. However, the MS results are not presented in the Figure or in the supplementary. In Figure 4A, only the IP results with silver staining was presented. Moreover, based on the silver staining here, a bunch of proteins were increased in TNFAIP2 overexpression group compared to the vector group. Especially, there is a much clearer band at 52kDa. The authors didn't explain why they chose IQGAP1 and ITGB4 which are less clear than the protein(s) at 52kDa.</p></disp-quote><p>Supplementary file 1 is our mass spectrometry results. There are two reasons for choosing ITGB4 and IQGAP1. Firstly, we selected the proteins that indeed interact with TNFAIP2 according to our verification experiments. Secondly, we were interested in the mechanism by which TNFAIP2 promoting DNA damage-related drug resistance, and we found that ITGB4 promoted drug resistance, while IQGAP1 activated Rac1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

In Figure 5B, I wonder whether the authors can explain why the IgG could immunoprecipitate similar amount of ITGB4 protein as input group.</p></disp-quote><p>In this experiment, the Input group had relatively less loading amount (5%), while the IgG group had nonspecific binding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. According to the results from Figure 6B, the inhibition efficiency of shITGB4#1 is much higher than shITGB4#2. However, the effects of shITGB4#1 on GTP-Rac1 are similar to or even weaker than those of shITGB4#2 in both HCC1806 and HCC1937. Can this be explained?</p></disp-quote><p>The possible reason is that downregulation of ITGB4 expression to a certain level is sufficient to inhibit the activation of Rac1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In Figure 6F, there are double bands for ITGB4 while only one band shows in other Figures.

These experiments were conducted by different person. Each individual chose different internal controls based on the protein sizes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. I cannot find Table 1 for the correlation results for TNFAIP2 and ITGB4. I wonder whether Figure 8E is the Table 1 as is mentioned, since it is stated in line 561 that Figure 8E is &quot;the work model of this paper&quot; but actually Figure 8F is. If Figure 8E is the correlation results, I highly recommended the scatter plots graph is used here to present more clear and visualized correlation between TNFAIP2 and ITGB4.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 8E is indeed the correlation result. In addition, Figure 8E could not be presented as scatter plot graph because the pattern of TNFAIP2 and ITGB4 expression is negative or positive according to the determination of IHC results which was carried out by professional pathologists.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9.

One of subtypes in breast cancer is so called triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which represents the most difficult subtype to treat and cure in the clinic. Chemotherapy drugs including epirubicin and cisplatin are widely used for TNBC treatment. However, drug resistance remains as a challenge in the clinic. The authors uncovered a molecular pathway involved in chemotherapy drug resistance, and molecular players in this pathway represent as potential drug targets to overcome drug resistance. The experiments are well designed and the conclusions drawn mostly were supported by the data.
