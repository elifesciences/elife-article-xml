melanocytes. For example, activation of the Gα<sub>q/11</sub> signaling pathway is a characteristic initiating event in primary melanomas that arise in the dermis, uveal tract, or central nervous system. It is rare in melanomas arising in the epidermis. The mechanism for this specificity is unknown. Here, we present evidence that in the mouse, crosstalk with the epidermal microenvironment actively impairs the survival of melanocytes expressing the GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> oncogene. We found that GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup>, in combination with signaling from the interfollicular epidermis (IFE), stimulates dendrite extension, leads to actin cytoskeleton disorganization, inhibits proliferation, and promotes apoptosis in melanocytes. The effect was reversible and paracrine. In contrast, the epidermal environment increased the survival of wildtype and Braf<sup>V600E</sup> expressing melanocytes. Hence, our studies reveal the flip side of Gα<sub>q/11</sub> signaling, which was hitherto unsuspected. In the future, the identification of the epidermal signals that restrain the GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> oncogene could suggest novel therapies for <italic>GNAQ</italic> and <italic>GNA11</italic> mutant melanomas.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>melanoma</kwd><kwd>signaling</kwd><kwd>epidermis</kwd><kwd>oncogene</kwd><kwd>PLCB4</kwd><kwd>GNAQ</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP-79511</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Van Raamsdonk</surname><given-names>Catherine D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJT-168868</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tanentzapf</surname><given-names>Guy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>G alpha q/11 signaling can either promote or inhibit melanocyte growth through a reversible switch that is controlled by the microenvironment and that shapes the mutational diversity of melanoma subtypes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>GNAQ</italic> and <italic>GNA11</italic> encode heterotrimeric G protein alpha subunits (Gα<sub>q</sub> and Gα<sub>11</sub>) that are best known for signaling through phospholipase C-beta (PLC-Β) to release intracellular calcium stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Runnels and Scarlata, 1999</xref>). The somatic substitution of glutamine 209 or arginine 183 in either <italic>GNAQ</italic> or <italic>GNA11</italic> generates constitutive activity of the G protein and is a characteristic early event in uveal melanoma, occurring in up to 90% of cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Van Raamsdonk et al., 2010</xref>). A subset of cases without <italic>GNAQ</italic> or <italic>GNA11</italic> mutations exhibits a gain-of-function hotspot mutation in <italic>PLCB4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Johansson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">van de Nes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Phan et al., 2021</xref>). These mutations are also frequent in blue nevi and primary melanomas of the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Van Raamsdonk et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Van Raamsdonk et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Küsters-Vandevelde et al., 2010</xref>). Activation of the pathway in uveal melanoma drives cell proliferation and stimulates the mitogen activated protein kinase (‘MAPK’) pathway through RasGRP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Gα<sub>q/11</sub> activation also activates the Hippo pathway through nuclear localization of YAP1 via a Trio-Rho/Rac signaling circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feng et al., 2014</xref>). On the other hand, Q209 and R183 mutations in either <italic>GNAQ</italic> or <italic>GNA11</italic> are rare in melanocytic neoplasms arising in the epithelium, which are more likely to carry mutations in the MAPK pathway components, <italic>BRAF</italic>, <italic>NRAS,</italic> and <italic>NF1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Van Raamsdonk et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fecher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nissan et al., 2014</xref>). The underlying mechanism for the restriction of <italic>GNAQ</italic> and <italic>GNA11</italic> mutations to non-epithelial melanomas is unknown.</p><p>There are several possible, non-exclusive explanations for this phenomenon. First, an over-representation of mutations in specific genes in certain neoplasms could be related to exposure to different mutagens in different parts of the body. Concerning melanoma, the skin areas exposed to UV radiation via sunlight accumulate many somatic mutations; characteristically, these are C to T transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pfeifer et al., 2005</xref>). Most UV radiation does not penetrate very deeply into the body and some areas of the body are rarely exposed, which could generate a varying spectrum of mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hodis et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Second, melanocytes arise from neural crest cells all along the anterior-posterior axis. The molecular pathways for melanocyte cell fate determination along this axis are poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Soldatov et al., 2019</xref>). However, there are demonstrated differences in the potential for melanomagenesis of melanocytes arising at different anterior-posterior positions in the mouse embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Urtatiz et al., 2020</xref>). It is possible that the developmental origin of a melanocyte could influence its migration during embryogenesis, its differentiation potential, and program long-term gene expression patterns. Therefore, some melanocytes might only respond to specific driver mutations due to intrinsic differences generated during development.</p><p>Last, different microenvironments surround melanocytes located in different parts of the body, which could impact the effects of mutations. Direct cell-cell contact or paracrine signaling produced by the tissue-specific microenvironment might allow the transformation of cells only with certain mutational events, forcing the selection of specific driver mutations in melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pandiani et al., 2017</xref>). Epidermal melanocytes interact mainly with keratinocytes, while internal melanocytes interact with various mesodermal stromas. Therefore, crosstalk between melanocytes and their cellular neighbors might prevent transformation or proliferation driven by specific signaling pathways.</p><p>In this paper, we investigated these possibilities. We forced the expression of oncogenic GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> in all melanocytes in mice beginning in adulthood using <italic>Tyr-creER</italic>. This drove the loss of melanocytes from the interfollicular epidermis (IFE) of the tail, while dramatically increasing melanocyte growth in the dermis. This observation demonstrated that GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> expression was not simply neutral for epidermal melanocytes; it was deleterious. We established primary cultures of normal or GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> expressing melanocytes sorted from the mouse tail epidermis and used time lapse microscopy to quantify melanocyte cell dynamics in the presence of either mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) or keratinocytes. We discovered that paracrine signaling from the epidermis reversibly switches GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> from an oncogene to an inhibitor of melanocyte survival and proliferation. Differential expression analysis of melanocytes sorted from the tail epidermis showed that the melanocytes expressing GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> exhibited alterations in gene expression related to cell adhesion, axon extension, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Hence, our studies reveal the flip side of the Gα<sub>q/11</sub> signaling pathway in melanocytes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Forced GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> reduces melanocytes in mouse tail IFE</title><p>We previously generated a conditional GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> allele wherein oncogenic human GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> is expressed from the <italic>Rosa26</italic> locus in mice following the removal of a loxP-flanked stop cassette (‘<italic>R26-fs-GNAQ<sup>Q209L’</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2015</xref>).

To test whether GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> affected melanocyte establishment or melanocyte maintenance, we used the tamoxifen (TM) inducible melanocyte-specific Cre transgene, tyrosinase <italic>(Tyr)-creERT</italic><sup>2</sup> with <italic>R26-fs-GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup></italic> to induce GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> expression in melanocytes beginning in adulthood. We also included the <italic>Rosa26-LoxP-Stop-LoxP-LacZ</italic> reporter to label cells expressing GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> with LacZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bosenberg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Soriano, 1999</xref>). TM was administered once per day for 5 days at 4 weeks of age. One week following the last dose of TM, half of the mice were euthanized to collect and stain tail epidermal sheets with X-gal to determine the average number of melanocytes (LacZ-positive cells) per scale. At this time point, <italic>R26-fs-GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup>/R26-fs-LacZ; Tyr-creERT<sup>2</sup></italic>/+ (hereafter referred to as ‘GNAQ-lacZ’) mice and <italic>+/R26-fs-LacZ; Tyr-creERT<sup>2</sup></italic>/+ (hereafter referred to as ‘WT-LacZ’) mice showed no significant difference in melanocyte numbers (p = 0.18, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). However, 8 weeks following the last dose of TM, GNAQ-LacZ mice had on average 50% fewer melanocytes per scale than WT-LacZ mice (p = 0.045, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). While scales in WT-LacZ mice were pigmented evenly, many scales in GNAQ-LacZ mice exhibited partial loss of melanin 8 weeks after TM (p = 0.048, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). These results demonstrate that GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> signaling inhibits melanocyte maintenance in the IFE.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Forced GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> signaling reduces the number of melanocytes in the interfollicular epidermis (IFE).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative example of LacZ-positive cells within scales of WT-LacZ and GNAQ -LacZ tails at 1 or 8 weeks post-tamoxifen (TM) treatment.

Sections of WT tail skin exhibited tdTomato-positive cells in the IFE, located as expected on the basal membrane, as well as some tdTomato-positive cells in the dermis. In contrast, sections of GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> tail skin contained fewer tdTomato-positive cells in the IFE while exhibiting an abnormally extensive tdTomato signal in the dermis.</p><p>Next, we isolated tdTomato-positive melanocytes from the IFE of WT and GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> mice by fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) to study the melanocytes in in vitro settings. To obtain a single-cell suspension for FACS, we first split the tail skin IFE from the underlying dermis. Then, we dissociated the scales within the IFE with trypsin to obtain melanocytes and keratinocytes as dispersed single cells (Pop S, Urtatiz O, Van Raamsdonk CD. 2022. Isolation of inter-follicular epidermal melanocytes and keratinocytes from mouse tail skin. [Manuscript under Review at Bio-Protocol]).

Previous studies have estimated that melanocytes account for ~1.5% of the total cells in the IFE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Glover et al., 2015</xref>).

Hence, the growth-inhibiting effects of GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> expression in IFE melanocytes are reversible. When removed from the epidermis and grown on fibronectin, IFE melanocyte survival was increased by GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> expression.</p><p>To compare the effects of GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> with another well-studied melanoma oncogene, we used the same methods to obtain BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> expressing melanocytes from the mouse tail IFE. In mice, the expression of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> leads to melanocytic over-growth in both the tail dermis and epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Urtatiz et al., 2018</xref>). We crossed the conditional <italic>Braf<sup>V600E</sup></italic> allele, which expresses <italic>Braf<sup>V600E</sup></italic> from the endogenous <italic>Braf</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dankort et al., 2007</xref>) to <italic>R26-fs-tdTomato</italic> and <italic>Mitf-cre</italic>. Then, we used FACS to isolate epidermal melanocytes from the tail IFE of 4-week-old mice (+/<italic>R26-fs-tdTomato; Mitf-cre/+; Braf<sup>CA</sup>/+,</italic> hereafter referred to as ‘BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>’). We found that BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> expression increased the survival of sorted IFE melanocytes plated on fibronectin, even more so than GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Melanocytes expressing BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> could be maintained in culture for at least 8 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).</p><p>We observed a striking difference in cell morphology of GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> melanocytes compared to WT melanocytes grown in vitro. GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> melanocytes exhibited a more dendritic morphology with several protrusions per cell, while WT melanocytes appeared mostly spindle-shaped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). To study the cellular dynamics of the melanocytes, we analyzed time lapse microscopy for 20 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). No migration, formation of new protrusions, or cell divisions were observed in the melanocytes of either the WT or GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> cultures plated on fibronectin alone. However, in WT cultures, some melanocytes were observed to adopt a round shape, after which the cells were immediately lost from view (presumed cell death, example shown in the circled cell in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p>As another test of GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> reversibility, we isolated MEFs and plated them onto fibronectin-coated plates. Then we added FACS sorted IFE melanocytes from either WT or GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> mouse tails. The growth of both WT and GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> expressing melanocytes was stimulated by MEF co-culture, as there was an increase in cell number above the original number plated, unlike on fibronectin alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). In this situation, we did not detect a difference in survival between WT and GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> melanocytes (p = 0.48, two-way ANOVA).

One case was from a cell line and in another case, the frequency of an odd <italic>GNAQ<sup>Q209H</sup></italic> mutation in the tumor was less than 5%.

Interestingly, three of the eight cases carried a mutation in either <italic>BRAF</italic> (V600E) or <italic>NRAS</italic> (Q61H or Q61R), suggesting that these oncogenes could offset or over-ride the growth inhibitory effects of constitutively active Gα<sub>q/11</sub> signaling.

Still, they are rare in anatomical locations with an epithelial component, such as the IFE or conjunctiva of the eye. One theoretical explanation for this skewed frequency is that some unknown mechanism mutates <italic>GNAQ</italic> and <italic>GNA11</italic> only in non-epithelial locations. We found that this is not the case. The forced expression of oncogenic GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> in mature melanocytes in mice did not result in cutaneous melanoma, but instead had the opposite effect: the gradual loss of melanocytes from the IFE. Others have hypothesized that subtle geographic variances in the embryonic origin of epithelial versus non-epithelial melanocytes could explain the restriction of certain driver mutations to specific melanoma subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bastian, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Whiteman et al., 2011</xref>). Alternatively, since epidermal melanocytes interact with keratinocytes, whereas non-epidermal melanocytes interact with the mesodermal stromas, it was possible that direct cell contact or paracrine signaling produced by the tissue-specific microenvironment might interfere with the oncogenic signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pandiani et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we have presented evidence that the IFE microenvironment drives the loss of melanocytes expressing the GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> oncogene, providing a new model for oncogene specificity.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Melanocytes taken from the IFE and cultured in vitro can switch phenotypes</title><p>Previous studies have shown that stable transfection of <italic>GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup></italic> induced anchorage-independent growth in soft agar of hTERT/CDK4<sup>R24C</sup>/p53<sup>DD</sup> mouse melanocytes in a TPA-independent manner, a feature associated with cellular transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Van Raamsdonk et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wilson et al., 1989</xref>). Our study complements these previous results to show that melanocytes directly taken from the mouse IFE and grown in primary culture without any other cues survive better if they express <italic>GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup></italic>. Interestingly, <italic>Braf<sup>V600E</sup></italic> had an even stronger effect than <italic>GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup></italic> in this same situation, although the promoters driving the expression of these two oncogenes were not the same, so perhaps a direct comparison should not be made. In addition, both WT and GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> expressing melanocytes survived better in culture when grown on MEFs. Therefore, the attrition of GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> expressing IFE melanocytes from the mouse tail epidermis is not due to an inherent characteristic in IFE melanocytes because the phenotype is reversible by changing the microenvironment.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The IFE microenvironment inhibits melanocytes expressing GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup></title><p>It is well known that keratinocytes, which make up the vast majority of the epidermis, secrete various growth factors and cytokines in a paracrine manner that regulates growth, survival, adhesion, migration, and differentiation of melanocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). In WT melanocytes, we found that the presence of dissociated IFE in co-cultures provided a significant boost. In contrast, co-culturing GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> expressing melanocytes with IFE reduced their survival capacity and inhibited cell division. Moreover, the effects of the IFE on melanocyte survival did not require direct cell-cell contact and could be replicated in a transwell culture system. Our studies of IFE melanocytes suggest that GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> expression causes increased cell adhesion, a disorganized actin cytoskeleton and the promotion of long dendrite extensions, which frequently break. We conclude that the microenvironment surrounding melanocytes is the main factor controlling whether GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> signaling is oncogenic or inhibits growth. IFE melanocytes have the innate capacity to be transformed by GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup>, but whether or not they are permitted to do so is dictated by the microenvironment in which they reside.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A cellular stress response signature in GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> IFE melanocytes related to vitiligo</title><p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are highly active radicals produced during multiple cellular processes that, upon accumulation, can damage most biological macromolecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bickers and Athar, 2006</xref>).

Interestingly, our RNAseq analysis of GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> IFE melanocytes revealed changes in gene expression that suggest the melanocytes are under stress.

Furthermore, oncogene activation in melanocytes generates oxidative stress and increased ROS and p16 expression has been implicated in oncogene-induced melanocyte senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leikam et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, up-regulation of Cdkn2a may reflect a systemic oxidative stress experienced by <italic>GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup></italic> melanocytes in an epithelial context.</p><p>In addition, among the top-ranked DE genes was <italic>Stanniocalcin</italic> (Stc1), a glycoprotein hormone involved in calcium/phosphate homeostasis.

Using FACS, we found that there are more melanocytes in early apoptosis in the GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> tail IFE than in wildtype (WT). This represents a novel and intriguing potential consequence of GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> signaling induced by the IFE microenvironment.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Cell morphology and endothelin signaling</title><p>GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> signaling produces an abnormal cell morphology with irregular contours.

However, GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> melanocytes co-cultured with IFE were also larger and abnormally shaped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and G</xref>). Our RNAseq results from GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> melanocytes taken directly from the IFE suggest that cell adhesion, focal adhesions, extracellular matrix-receptor interactions, and/or extracellular matrix structural constituents are impacted.

Confocal z-projections of individuals melanocytes processed using quantitative image analysis to measure cell fibrousness showed that the actin cytoskeleton of GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> melanocytes co-cultured with IFE is disorganized. Since cell size and shape were abnormal in GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> melanocytes in both the IFE and MEF co-cultures, it is possible that this GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> phenotype is less sensitive to microenvironmental control.</p><p>Some of the changes that we observed with GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> could reflect a normal role for G protein-coupled endothelin signaling in epidermal melanocytes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belote and Simon, 2020</xref>, used human keratinocyte-melanocyte co-cultures to show how endothelin and acetylcholine secreted by keratinocytes elicit local and compartmentalized Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in melanocyte dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belote and Simon, 2020</xref>).

We suggest that the outcome of Gα<sub>q/11</sub> signaling is not fixed, but is integrated with other information provided from the microenvironment in which the melanocyte resides. Cues from the IFE cause Gα<sub>q/11</sub> signaling to inhibit survival and proliferation, but this effect is reversible. In the absence of these external cues, Gα<sub>q/11</sub> signaling promotes melanocyte survival. Hence, gain-of-function mutations in <italic>GNAQ</italic>, <italic>GNA11</italic>, or <italic>PLCB4</italic> only drive melanoma in melanocytes surrounded by mesenchymal stromas, and not by keratinocytes. Our studies revealed evidence for multiple potential mechanisms by which the IFE inhibits melanocytes expressing GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup>, including oxidative stress, apoptosis, inhibition of cell division, changes to cell adhesion, and cell fragmentation. The critical paracrine signal(s) remain to be determined through further biochemical and cell culture studies. It is possible that a better understanding of the ability of GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> to switch from acting as an oncogene to an inhibitor of melanocyte growth could lead to new therapies for <italic>GNAQ</italic> and <italic>GNA11</italic> mutant melanomas, which lack effective treatment options for metastatic disease.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model for microenvironmental control of the Gα<sub>q</sub>-PLCB4 signaling outcome and how this leads to GNAQ oncogene specificity in melanoma.</title><p>G alpha q (GNAQ) and G alpha 11 (GNA11) are classic signaling components that transmit G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activation to phospholipase C-beta (PLC-B) inside the cell.

For Annexin-V staining, we used the Annexin-V Fluos staining kit according to the manufacturer’s directions (Sigma Aldrich, 11858777001).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Primary cell culture</title><p>Cells were plated into 96-well plates previously coated with 0.1 mg/ml fibronectin in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin (15140122 Thermo-Fisher), 2 mM L-glutamine, and 1 mM sodium pyruvate. For cultures of sorted melanocytes only, cells were plated at 6000–8000 cells per well. For co-culture with MEFs, 6000–8000 FACS sorted melanocytes were plated into 96-well plates previously seeded with MEFs that had formed a confluent monolayer. For direct co-culture experiments with IFE, the IFE was dissociated and plated at 100,000 cells per well (i.e. with no FACS for the melanocytes first). For transwell co-culture with IFE, 6000–8000 FACS sorted melanocytes were plated in the well suspended above 100,000 dissociated IFE cells plated below. All cultures were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Media was changed every third day by exchanging one-third of the existing volume. Images were taken at 5×, 10×, and 20× magnification. tdTomato-positive cells in the 5× field of view were counted as live melanocytes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Live-cell imaging</title><p>Sorted tdTomato-positive melanocytes or IFE cells containing tdTomato-positive melanocytes were plated on 0.1 mg/ml fibronectin-coated coverslips within a 35 mm cell culture dish.

Cell contours were obtained automatically by processing confocal z-projections of cells stained for F-actin (Phalloidin) in Matlab. Images were first blurred with a Gaussian filter, and then an edge detection algorithm was applied to identify cell borders. The resultant binary images were refined through successive dilations and erosions to yield the final cell contour. These contours were used to measure cell area, and circularity (4π*area/perimeter<sup>2</sup>), protrusions. The number and length of protrusions were quantified automatically in Matlab. First, cell contours were identified as outlined above. Next, we obtained the contour coordinates of the convex hull of the binary image representing the cell area. At each point along the cell contour, we computed the minimum distance between the convex hull and the actual cell contour. Based on these distances, minima corresponding to protrusions could be identified. To be counted as protrusions, minima had to be at least 10 pixels apart along the contour and of height greater than five pixels. Based on the coordinates of adjacent peaks, the width, height, and aspect ratio of protrusions could be computed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Actin fiber organization</title><p>First, we identified cell contours as described above. Next, the cell was subdivided into 32 × 32 pixel windows overlapping by 50%. We then computed the two-dimensional Fourier transform of each window. If a window contains no fibers, the Fourier transform will be a central, diffuse point of bright pixels. However, if a window contains aligned fibers, the Fourier transform will consist of an elongated accumulation of bright pixels at a 90-degree angle to the original fibers. Based on the aspect ratio and orientation of the Fourier transform, we determined fibrousness and fiber orientation in a given window. The data for individual windows could then be compared across the entire cell to estimate the cell fibrousness, defined here as the percentage of cell area (% of windows) with aspect ratio greater than a cut-off value.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>RNAseq data and bioinformatics analysis</title><p>Total RNA from sorted cells was extracted using Trizol (Life Technologies) following the manufacturer’s protocol.

Your revised article has been evaluated by Richard White (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there is one remaining issue that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>The reviewers and editors are not convinced that the mutational analysis of PLCB4 are robust and follow currently accepted guidelines for identifying somatic alterations in tumors with high numbers of somatic alterations, such as melanoma. The cited literature is not mainstream. Since this point is not necessary to support the conclusions presented, we ask that you remove this analysis from the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I compliment the authors for clarifying the issues pertaining to their experimental work. I also think the addition to the manuscript of the MAPK and Hippo pathway gene expression analyses was very interesting. Questions have been raised by other laboratories as to the relevance of the Hippo arm, and these results will be informative to that debate.</p><p>I am still not convinced that PLCB4 mutations are under selection, and I would strongly encourage the authors to abandon the claim in this manuscript, which I do not believe is necessary for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Aside from this claim, I really enjoyed this manuscript, and in the long run, I think the authors would regret this position without more supporting data. My colleagues and I have spent a great deal of time thinking about the best ways to identify genes under selection in melanoma (see https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/pcmr.12012), and I encourage the authors to reach out if they have any questions.</p><p>In this revision, the main reason why the authors were able to claim the dN/dS ratio of mutations affecting PLCB4 was statistically significant is because they did not include mutations in tumors with both nonsynonymous and synonymous mutations. I have never seen anyone apply this filter before. Given that nonsynonymous mutations are more common across the genome than synonymous mutations, removal of collision events will disproportionately impact the proportion of synonymous mutations, thus skewing the ensuing ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutations. It is not statistically defensible to apply a filter to the observed mutational data in a single gene of interest and then to compare it to an expected background mutation rate where the same correction was not applied. The authors attempt to justify this decision by speculating that synonymous mutations likely occurred after the nonsynonymous mutations – this does not seem to occur at a meaningful degree in well established tumor suppressor genes and is far too speculative to use as justification.</p><p>The authors also point out that there were some splice-site mutations and nonsense mutations, but again, the ratio of these mutations to missense mutations and synonymous mutations was not particularly impressive. Truncating mutations (nonsense, frameshift, and splice-site) are extremely common in well-established tumor suppressor genes, often exceeding 50% of the total mutation count. If anything, the low proportion of these mutations is further evidence that there is little selection to accumulate bona fide loss-of-function mutations in this gene, but rather the locus collects a high background of passenger mutations.</p><p>The authors cite a brief mention in the supplement of a manuscript, Chen et al. (Mol Biol Evol 2015) as support that PLCB4 has a statistically significant number of splice-site mutations. The methodologies in that manuscript are not robust, nor are their candidates convincing, likely explaining why this obscure manuscript has gained no traction in the genomics community.</p><p>The authors also cite a manuscript by Wei et al. (2012), who claimed PLCB4 mutations were statistically significant. This was one of the earliest exome sequencing studies in melanoma, and the field generally agrees that their approaches to identifying significantly mutated genes was flawed. More modern cancer gene discovery studies have not identified evidence of selection in PLCB4.</p><p>The authors additionally cite a mention from a manuscript by Hayward et al. (2017), who reported gene fusions affecting PLCB4. In that manuscript, Hayward and colleagues list 30,000 potential gene fusions, and a handful affect PLCB4. It is unclear if these fusions are real because they were not validated. While Hayward and colleagues specifically mention PLCB4 in their results, they imply that the fusions might be gain of function, whereas in this manuscript, the authors are attempting to claim melanomas select for loss of function somatic alterations.</p><p>The bottom line is that the mutational patterns in PLCB4 look unlike any well-established tumor suppressor gene in melanoma. This reviewer recognizes that the authors came across this candidate as a result of hypothesis driven research, but it would be more compelling if PLCB4 were a borderline candidate, overlooked in high-quality, genome-wide studies that were agnostic to biological knowledge, but this does not seem to be the case. In the melanoma cancer genome atlas project, the ratio of nonsynonmous to synonymous mutations affecting PLCB4 was 2.8, which is almost identical to the genome-wide ratio, thereby making the dN/dS ratio for this gene approximately 1. In the melanoma genome atlas study, PLCB4 ranked ~12,000 among significantly mutated genes. In a more recent study that includes over 1,000 melanomas (Alkallas, Nature Cancer, 2020), PLCB4 ranked 9,000 among significantly mutated genes.</p><p>The functional data pertaining to GNAQ in the first three quarters of the paper was compelling, but the authors overreached, unnecessarily, in pushing a mechanism by which there is selection to lose a downstream component of this signaling pathway in melanoma. The authors show that turning on the Gq signaling pathway, via a powerful gain-of-function mutation in GNAQ, does not permit melanocyte survival in the epidermis of mice. Basal levels of Gq signaling, in the absence of Gq mutations, is low, and there is no reason to assume that tumors would need to select for mutations to turn this pathway off by accumulating mutations downstream of Gq. As it stands, this is a major claim, weakly supported entirely by in silico data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this revised manuscript, the authors have appropriately responded to the concerns of the prior reviewers. As it stands, the manuscript is recommended for publication.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71825.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The bioinformatic analysis regarding PLCB4 is flawed.

As currently presented, this detracts from the conclusions rather than supporting the work.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the concerns of the reviewer. To explain, we were led to the question of whether the frequent non-synonymous mutations in PLCB4 could play a role in cutaneous melanoma from a logical deduction based on biological insight, which we found quite convincing:</p><p>1) We had found that oncogenic GNAQ inhibits melanocyte growth/survival when the cells are located in the epidermis.</p><p>2) PLC-Β is the immediate downstream effector of Gq and therefore is very likely to play a role in this inhibition.</p><p>3) PLC-B4 was already identified as a melanoma oncogene in uveal and leptomeningeal melanomas, but strikingly, only in cases where GNAQ and GNA11 were not activated by gain of function mutations.</p><p>We agree that more could have been done to describe the synonymous mutations and examine the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous mutations. Using the approach described in Van den Eynden and Larsson, which takes into account the mutational signature of melanoma, we found that the synonymous mutations were significantly less frequent than expected based on the expected ratio (p = 7.35 x 10<sup>-4</sup>; one-tailed binomial test). This indicates that there is positive selection for the non-synonymous mutations in PLCB4 in cutaneous melanoma.</p><p>In addition, not included in the above analysis were 13 more mutations having to do with splicing: 7 splice region, 3 splice donor site and 3 splice acceptor site mutations in the melanomas. While reviewing the literature, we noticed that PLCB4 was already identified in Chen et al as a gene subject to positive selection for splice-site mutations (p=7.86Ex10<sup>-4</sup>; q=5.77Ex10<sup>-2</sup>) in a genome wide analysis of melanoma.</p><p>As you know, due to a number of factors related to the process of mutagenesis, gene size and accessibility, different genes have different rates of mutation. PLCB4 might be a gene that is more likely to be mutated. It is the 99<sup>th</sup> most frequently mutated gene in the SKCM dataset. PLCB4 has more synonymous mutations (34 affected cases in total) than NF1 (14 cases), TP53 (0 cases) or PTEN (0 cases). Looking at the problem from our perspective, it seems that biological insight and hypothesis driven inquiry could help determine whether some of the genes with a higher inherent rate of mutation are playing a role in melanoma.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The Semaphorin mechanism is interesting but highly speculative.</p></disp-quote><p>We have reduced the emphasis on semaphorin signaling throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors should address some inconsistencies around the data presented in Figure 3A and 4D. It seems like the WT-melanocytes in co-culture with IFE are dividing quite rapidly, according to figure 4D, yet their numbers decline over time according to figure 3A.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. We think that the difference is due to the culture conditions in the survival curve experiments versus the time lapse imaging experiments. In the experiments in Figure 3A (survival curve with IFE), there was less media relative to cells than there was in the experiments in Figure 4D (time lapse cell imaging of cells with IFE). This was because cells in Figure 3A were cultured in a 96 well plate format, while the cells in Figure 4D were cultured in 35 mm dishes on coverslips (for microscopy). However, under both set-ups, WT melanocytes did better than GNAQ melanocytes. The different set-ups are interesting in that they showed that both proliferation and survival are impacted by GNAQ. We have added a paragraph about this in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The fluorescence images would be better with higher quality images.</p></disp-quote><p>Better images have been provided for Figure 1F, in which the tomato signal was over-exposed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors have utilized appropriate models and multiple experimental methods to support their findings.</p><p>The only weakness noted in the lengthy discussion of the TCGA-SKCM data set analysis and comparison of the frequency of expression of mutations in various genes.
