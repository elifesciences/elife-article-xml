Mutations that reduce BubR1 abundance cause aneuploidization and tumorigenesis in humans and mice, whereas BubR1 overexpression protects against these. However, how supranormal BubR1 expression exerts these beneficial physiological impacts is poorly understood. Here, we used <italic>Bub1b</italic> mutant transgenic mice to explore the role of the amino-terminal (BubR1<sup>N</sup>) and internal (BubR1<sup>I</sup>) Cdc20-binding domains of BubR1 in preventing aneuploidy and safeguarding against cancer. BubR1<sup>N</sup> was necessary, but not sufficient to protect against aneuploidy and cancer. In contrast, BubR1 lacking the internal Cdc20-binding domain provided protection against both, which coincided with improved microtubule-kinetochore attachment error correction and SAC activity. Maximal SAC reinforcement occurred when both the Phe- and D-box of BubR1<sup>I</sup> were disrupted. Thus, while under- or overexpression of most mitotic regulators impairs chromosome segregation fidelity, certain manipulations of BubR1 can positively impact this process and therefore be therapeutically exploited.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16620.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16620.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16620.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Human DNA is organized into 46 chromosomes, which must be duplicated before a cell divides and are then shared equally between the two new cells. When this process goes awry, the new cells either have too many or too few chromosomes. This situation – known as aneuploidy – frequently occurs in cancer cells, and is thought to cause cells to gain extra copies or lose copies of genes that promote or prevent cancer, respectively.</p><p>Cells have several ways to prevent aneuploidy. One of these safeguards, known as the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), involves a protein called BubR1, which acts at the stage when the duplicated chromosomes need to be equally divided into each daughter cell. Mouse models show that low levels of the BubR1 protein result in aneuploidy and increased predisposition to cancer. High levels of BubR1, on the other hand, allow the mice to stay healthier for longer and can stop tumors from forming. However, it was not known exactly how high amounts of BubR1 protect against cancer.</p><p>To address this question, Weaver et al. set out to determine which parts, or domains, of the BubR1 protein protect against cancer. Mice with high levels of the full-length BubR1 protein were compared with mice that made mutant versions of BubR1 lacking certain domains. These experiments revealed that a small portion of the beginning of the protein was necessary to protect against tumor formation, but removing a large region in the middle of BubR1 still protected mice against lung cancer and aneuploidy. Additional experiments performed on mouse cells grown in the laboratory revealed that whole BubR1 protein and the mutant protein lacking the middle region might prevent aneuploidy in multiple ways. For example, both systems had stronger SAC signaling, which could serve to make segregating the chromosomes more accurate.</p><p>In the future, it will be important to find out whether BubR1 acts in the same way in human cells and cancers. Lastly, since it is not possible to over-produce BubR1 in humans, other methods will need to be investigated to use this knowledge to treat cancer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16620.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16620.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>BubR1</kwd><kwd>aneuploidy</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA096985</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van Deursen</surname><given-names>Jan M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA189339</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Naylor</surname><given-names>Ryan M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA126828</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van Deursen</surname><given-names>Jan M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Strengthening of spindle assembly checkpoint activity and attachment error correction through BubR1 manipulation preserves genomic integrity and protects against tumor formation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chromosomal instability (CIN) describes a condition where cells frequently acquire cytogenetic alterations and do not accurately segregate their chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Giam and Rancati, 2015</xref>). Aneuploidy, defined as a state in which there are alterations to whole chromosome copy number, results from CIN and is a feature of almost all tumors, but whether aneuploidy is a cause or consequence of transformation is the subject of much debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ricke and van Deursen, 2013</xref>). CIN is thought to allow pre-neoplastic cells to acquire genes that promote tumor progression and lose those which suppress transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burrell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Loeb, 2011</xref>) and there are multiple lines of evidence which support aneuploidy having a causative role for cancer. For instance, several human aneuploidy syndromes are characterized by increased susceptibility to cancer, including trisomies 8, 18 (Edwards syndrome) and 21 (Down Syndrome) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ganmore et al., 2009</xref>), and mosaic variegated aneuploidy (MVA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hanks et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Snape et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, bidirectional deviations in protein levels of various mitotic regulators, including Mad2, Mad1 and Bub1, cause aneuploidy and tumor predisposition in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Iwanaga et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jeganathan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Michel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ricke et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ryan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sotillo et al., 2007</xref>). Additionally, modulations to a spectrum of other proteins that participate in diverse cellular functions, such as the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubch10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">van Ree et al., 2010</xref>), the centromere-linked microtubule protein CENP-E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Weaver et al., 2007</xref>), and the nuclear pore complex protein Nup88 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Naylor et al., 2016</xref>) result in aneuploidy and accelerated cancer progression. Finally, genome-wide screens of proteins that negatively (STOP) and positively (GO) regulate proliferation are recurrently and selectively lost and gained respectively in either focal regions or whole chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davoli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Solimini et al., 2012</xref>). This suggests a model where changes in gene copy number are under selection rather than simply accompanying transformation, supporting genomic instability as a driver of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davoli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Solimini et al., 2012</xref>). On the other hand, several other mouse models of CIN have revealed inconsistent results regarding the relationship between aneuploidy and cancer, where some mouse models with elevated levels of aneuploidy do not show increased susceptibility to cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Babu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kalitsis et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ricke et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, proteotoxic stress from increased gene expression in cells with extra chromosome copies has adverse effects on cell growth and may thus counteract cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Williams et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Aneuploidy results when cells fail to segregate chromosomes properly. To promote high-fidelity separation of duplicated chromosomes, cells have the machinery to safeguard against missegregation. One such mechanism is the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). This surveillance system prevents activation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) by its co-activator, Cdc20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Peters, 2006</xref>). This ensures chromosomal stability by preventing sister chromatid separation prior to bi-orientation of mitotic chromosomes at the metaphase plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Musacchio and Salmon, 2007</xref>). An additional measure to promote accurate chromosome segregation is allowing sufficient time to form proper and correct erroneous kinetochore-microtubule (MT-KT) attachments prior to anaphase onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Meraldi et al., 2004</xref>). Merotely, a type of improper attachment in which a single kinetochore is attached to microtubules emanating from both spindle poles, is undetected by the SAC and can result in lagging chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cimini et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rodriguez-Bravo et al., 2014</xref>). Mad1/2, Mps1, and BubR1 specify the minimum time in mitosis, and loss of these proteins reduces the duration of mitosis and increases the rates of missegregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maciejowski et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Meraldi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rodriguez-Bravo et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>BubR1, along with Mad2 and Bub3, is a component of the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC), which mediates the SAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kulukian et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Musacchio and Salmon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sudakin et al., 2001</xref>). Once each chromosome has properly and stably attached to the mitotic spindle and sufficient inter-kinetochore tension is generated, the MCC dissociates, allowing Cdc20 to activate the APC/C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Musacchio and Salmon, 2007</xref>). Co-activation of APC/C by Cdc20 in metaphase results in the polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of cyclin B1 and securin, thereby triggering sister chromatid separation and anaphase onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kapanidou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Musacchio and Salmon, 2007</xref>). BubR1, encoded by the gene <italic>Bub1b</italic> in mice or <italic>BUB1B</italic> in humans, is a modular protein, with several known functional domains that together ensure mitotic fidelity and genome stability. BubR1 localizes to the kinetochore by interacting through its GLEBs-like motif with Bub3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Elowe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lampson and Kapoor, 2005</xref>). In human cells, kinetochore-localized BubR1 was shown to be important for MT-KT stabilization through an internally located kinetochore attachment and regulatory domain (KARD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Suijkerbuijk et al., 2012</xref>). The KARD allows kinetochore localization of the phosphatase PP2A, which counteracts the MT-KT destabilizing activity of Aurora B kinase, a key mediator of error-correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ruchaud et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Suijkerbuijk et al., 2012</xref>). Additional BubR1 functional domains include a putative kinase/pseudokinase domain that has been reported to reinforce the SAC and stabilize MT-KT attachments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Elowe, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harris et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Suijkerbuijk et al., 2012</xref>) and two Cdc20-binding domains, of which the N-terminal domain (BubR1<sup>N</sup>) is a critical APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> inhibitor essential for cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Malureanu et al., 2009</xref>). BubR1<sup>N</sup> contains two KEN-boxes, spanning amino acids 19–21 (KEN1) and 298–300 (KEN2) in mice, that in conjunction with a destruction (D)-box (D1) just downstream of KEN2 permits BubR1 to behave as a pseudo-substrate inhibitor of APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burton and Solomon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Han et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Izawa and Pines, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Malureanu et al., 2009</xref>). Recent work has highlighted that BubR1 is capable of binding both soluble Cdc20 through KEN1 to prevent APC/C-Cdc20 association, and a second Cdc20 that has already bound to and activated the APC/C through a combination of KEN2 and D1 for even more dynamic APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Izawa and Pines, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The second Cdc20-binding domain of BubR1, BubR1<sup>I</sup>, is an internally located and functionally distinct region important for Cdc20 kinetochore recruitment, and has been proposed to serve a dual function in SAC activation and silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Di Fiore et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diaz-Martinez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Izawa and Pines, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lischetti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tang et al., 2001</xref>). Several conserved and somewhat redundant motifs within BubR1<sup>I</sup> were recently identified that are thought to promote the BubR1-Cdc20 interaction through complementary mechanisms: the ABBA motif, named for its conserved presence in <underline>A</underline>cm1, <underline>B</underline>ub1, <underline>B</underline>ubR1 and Cyclin <underline>A</underline> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Di Fiore et al., 2015</xref>); the Phe box, a phenylalanine-containing region which is encompassed within the ABBA motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diaz-Martinez et al., 2015</xref>); and a D-box just downstream of the Phe Box (D-box2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diaz-Martinez et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Whereas bidirectional changes to protein levels of Mad1, Bub1 and Mad2 cause aneuploidy and tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ricke and van Deursen, 2013</xref>), BubR1 is unique amongst mitotic regulators in that both under- and overexpression results in drastically different phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2004</xref>). Complete loss of BubR1 causes early embryonic death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2004</xref>), and while BubR1 hypomorphic (<italic>Bub1b</italic><sup>H/H</sup>) mice are viable, they develop a variety of premature aging phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hartman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kyuragi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Matsumoto et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">North et al., 2014</xref>), progressive aneuploidy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2004</xref>), and are predisposed to carcinogen-induced cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker et al., 2006</xref>). Additionally, in humans, mutations in <italic>BUB1B</italic> have been causally implicated in MVA, a rare clinical syndrome characterized by widespread aneuploidy, growth retardation, shortened lifespan, and cancer predisposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">García-Castillo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hanks et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Matsuura et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wijshake et al., 2012</xref>). Conversely, overexpression of BubR1 extends life- and healthspan of mice, decreases the tumor incidence, and provides protection against age-related phenotypes in tissues that are prone to increased aneuploidy rates with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Despite profound anti-tumor and anti-aneuploidization effects of BubR1 overexpression, the molecular mechanism(s) of how it prevents CIN and cancer remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we focus on the role of BubR1-Cdc20 binding, and explore how this interaction reinforces the SAC and error-correction machinery by using a series of transgenic mice overexpressing BubR1 mutants with disruptions in Cdc20-binding domains. We show that overexpression of a mutant BubR1 that includes disruptions of the internal Cdc20-binding domain (BubR1<sup>∆I</sup>) elicits a tumor-protective mechanism similar to that of full-length (FL)-BubR1 overexpression. Importantly, like in FL-<italic>Bub1b</italic>, overexpression of this mutant also safeguards against aneuploidization, likely by both strengthening SAC signaling and preventing improper KT-MT attachments. Thus, the internal Cdc20-binding domain is dispensable to mediate these protective effects, while the N-terminal Cdc20-binding domain is necessary, but not sufficient. BubR1<sup>∆I</sup> also provides distinct molecular properties unique to that of overexpression alone that also likely promote genetic stability and show no overt detrimental effects on cells or mice. This includes a more robust SAC that is more responsive to weak stimuli, and an increase in the normal length of mitosis. With further refined mutant <italic>Bub1b</italic> constructs, we demonstrate that a maximal SAC response can be achieved exclusively by the loss of the Phe box and D-box2, and that the mitotic timing may be dependent on previously uncharacterized regions of BubR1. Importantly, this work sheds light on the causal role of CIN in cancer by demonstrating that enhancing genomic stability fortifies the barriers of transformation, and may provide unique insights into the generation of new therapeutic strategies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of transgenic mice overexpressing BubR1 mutants</title><p>To determine the role of the N-terminal and internal Cdc20-binding domains in the protective effect of BubR1 overexpression on aneuploidy and cancer, we generated three distinct Flag-tagged mutant <italic>Bub1b</italic> transgenic mouse strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

First, we focused on BubR1-kinetochore localization, as this property has been shown to be important for its role in both error correction and SAC signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Malureanu et al., 2009</xref>). By immunostaining with antibodies directed against the BubR1 N-terminus, we found that both FL-<italic>Bub1b</italic> and <italic>Bub1b</italic><sup>ΔI</sup> prometaphases had markedly increased amounts of BubR1 compared to wild-type MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). Due to antibody limitations, we were unable to distinguish the ratio of kinetochore-localized endogenous to transgenic BubR1 within the mutant MEFs, with the exception of <italic>Bub1b</italic><sup>N</sup>, in which only endogenous protein can be detected. This illuminated that endogenous BubR1 was displaced from the kinetochore, but we cannot rule out that the other mutants also had lower endogenous levels at the kinetochore, which is likely due to increased abundance of mutant protein within the cell. By staining with a Flag antibody that recognizes only the transgenic BubR1 protein, we determined that the relative expression of BubR1<sup>ΔI</sup> was slightly higher than FL-BubR1, while BubR1<sup>N</sup> was equivalent to FL-BubR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). BubR1<sup>ΔN</sup>, which did not protect against cancer, failed to localize to kinetochores, consistent with a lack of the GLEBs motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lampson and Kapoor, 2005</xref>). Taken together, these data demonstrate a likely need for BubR1 to retain functionality, perhaps mediated through the N-terminal domain, at the kinetochore to prevent aneuploidy and tumorigenesis.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16620.013</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Increased BubR1 localization to kinetochore corresponds to phenotypic benefits.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) MEFs of indicated genotypes were stained for BubR1 (red), centromeres (cyan), and DNA (blue).

We found that while prometaphases of wild-type, FL-<italic>Bub1b</italic> and <italic>Bub1b</italic><sup>ΔI</sup> MEFs had many Mad2-positive kinetochores, there were very rare incidences of Mad2-positive kinetochores in metaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). This indicated that the increased time of the metaphase-to-anaphase transition was delayed independent of unattached chromosomes or otherwise persistent Mad2 signaling. The extension of mitotic timing is a feature that is not shared with FL-overexpression alone, indicating it likely has a minimal contribution to tumor protection in our Kras model. However, it is particularly intriguing as a mechanism to prevent aneuploidy, as KT-MT attachment errors that are not detected by the SAC, namely merotelic attachments, may perhaps be given extra time to allow for the error correction machinery to prevent missegregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cimini et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rodriguez-Bravo et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Next, we examined whether overexpression of BubR1 and its variants impacted SAC sustainability. To do this, we added 100 ng/ml of the microtubule depolymerizing agent nocodazole and monitored the amount of time individual cells stayed arrested in mitosis. FL-BubR1 overexpression caused a slight but significant increase in duration of arrest, with transgenic cells arresting on average for 3.7 hr compared to 3 hr for wild-type MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). <italic>Bub1b</italic><sup>N</sup> MEFs were unchanged from wild-type, while <italic>Bub1b</italic><sup>ΔN</sup> MEFs actually had a slight but significant reduction in arrest time. In contrast, <italic>Bub1b</italic><sup>ΔI</sup> MEFs showed a dramatic extension of checkpoint sustainability, with cells arresting for an average time of 6.2 hr. Thus, the two BubR1 alterations offering tumor protection, overexpression of FL-BubR1 and BubR1<sup>ΔI</sup>, improve checkpoint sustainability although the latter does so much more robustly. In complementary experiments, we challenged the SAC by inhibiting Mps1, a kinase necessary both for the establishment and maintenance of the SAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hewitt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu and Winey, 2012</xref>). Treatment of MEFs concomitantly with 100 ng/ml nocodazole and a high concentration of the Mps1 inhibitor AZ3146 (2 µM) completely abolished SAC activity irrespective of the <italic>Bub1b</italic> transgene expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). At a four-fold lower inhibitor concentration, wild-type, <italic>Bub1b</italic><sup>N</sup>, <italic>Bub1b</italic><sup>ΔN</sup> MEFs were all capable of mounting a modest mitotic arrest. The relative extension of mitotic arrest in FL-<italic>Bub1b</italic> and <italic>Bub1b</italic><sup>ΔI</sup> MEFs, however, was considerably higher, with <italic>Bub1b</italic><sup>ΔI</sup> MEFs reaching a similar level of SAC signaling in the presence of 0.5 µM AZ3146 as wild-type MEFs in the absence of inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Thus, under normal SAC conditions and conditions where the SAC signaling is weakened, both BubR1<sup>ΔI</sup> and FL-BubR1overexpression seem capable of prolonging mitotic arrest, albeit to different degrees.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>BubR1<sup>ΔI</sup> lowers the threshold for SAC activation</title><p>Because the internal Cdc20-binding domain of BubR1 has been implicated in both initiating and silencing the mitotic checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diaz-Martinez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lischetti et al., 2014</xref>), we hypothesized that FL-<italic>Bub1b</italic> and <italic>Bub1b</italic><sup>ΔI</sup> MEFs may have a lower threshold of checkpoint activation or a difficulty silencing the checkpoint, or both.

To test this we used a live-cell imaging-based approach in which we cultured MEFs in 100 ng/ml nocodazole for 1.5 hr to activate the SAC and then monitored mitotically-arrested cells for time to mitotic exit following treatment with either vehicle (DMSO) or 2 µm AZ3146 as a stimulus for dissolving MCCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In this assay, neither FL-BubR1 nor BubR1<sup>ΔI</sup> overexpression permitted an arrest longer than that observed in wild-type MEFs. Additionally, while BubR1-associated PP2A has been shown to be important for error correction in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Suijkerbuijk et al., 2012</xref>), it is also important for silencing the SAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Espert et al., 2014</xref>). As BubR1<sup>ΔI</sup> lacks the KARD region implicated in PP2A recruitment, its overexpression could potentially mislocalize PP2A and impede proper SAC silencing. We found PP2A localization to be normal in BubR1<sup>ΔI</sup> overexpressing cells, suggesting this branch of signaling is not impacted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), and further supporting that silencing of the SAC is not disrupted. Taken together, these results suggest that the threshold to engage the SAC is instead lowered by the <italic>Bub1b</italic><sup>ΔI</sup> transgene.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>The mitotic checkpoint complex composition is unique in <italic>Bub1b</italic><sup>ΔI</sup> MEFs</title><p>To explore the mechanism as to why <italic>Bub1b</italic><sup>ΔI</sup> and FL-<italic>Bub1b</italic> MEFs both had more robust checkpoint signaling when challenged with nocodazole, we determined whether the amount of Cdc20 bound to BubR1 was increased in these cells. To this end, we treated wild-type, <italic>Bub1b</italic><sup>ΔI</sup> and FL-<italic>Bub1b</italic> MEFs cells with nocodazole for 1 hr before harvesting them by mitotic shake-off. We found that overexpression of FL-BubR1 lead to increased interaction of BubR1 and Cdc20, as had been previously shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2013</xref>). This was confirmed by Cdc20 and Mad2 co-IPs and subsequent analysis of co-precipitating proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>) that indicated there were an increased amount of complexes consisting of BubR1-Cdc20-Mad2, a potent APC/C inhibitor. However, we found that while the total amount of BubR1 (wild-type and mutant) immunoprecipitated in <italic>Bub1b</italic><sup>ΔI</sup> MEFs is increased substantially over normal MEFs, BubR1 lacking the internal Cdc20-binding domain failed to pull-down excess Cdc20 and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,C</xref>). This suggests that while BubR1<sup>ΔI</sup> can likely bind to Cdc20, it is not a preferred partner. Surprisingly, the amount of Mad2 co-precipitated by Cdc20 was increased, indicating that a larger proportion of Cdc20 bound Mad2 than in wild-type MEFs, while retaining similar levels of BubR1-Cdc20-Mad2 complexes as wild-type. Immunoprecipitation of Mad2 and Cdc20 and analysis of co-precipitating MCC components confirmed this (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>). These unique MCC compositions did not result from changes to total levels of these proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, FL-BubR1 overexpression alone results in the ability for cells to form more mitotic checkpoint complexes compared to wild-type MEFs, which can likely fortify the SAC signaling potential. <italic>Bub1b</italic><sup>ΔI</sup>, however, exerts its impacts on the MCC through a different mechanism. The increased abundance of Mad2-Cdc20 complexes, albeit a weaker inhibitor of APC/C than a full complement of the MCC, in addition to wild-type levels of MCC could represent a state in which the cells are poised to quickly activate the SAC.

Although it will be impractical to overexpress BubR1 for therapeutic purposes, increased insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the positive effects of BubR1 overexpression might create entry points for development of novel anti-cancer treatments based on small molecules that complement current therapies. As a first step, we focused on the roles of BubR1’s Cdc20-binding domains. Here we show that overexpression of the BubR1 N-terminal region is necessary, but not sufficient to prevent Kras-mediated aneuploidy and tumorigenesis, implying that reinforcing pseudo-substrate inhibition of Cdc20-bound APC/C by BubR1 is a requirement but entirely ineffective in isolation. In contrast to the N-terminal Cdc20-binding domain, a region spanning residues 525–700 that includes the elements of the internal Cdc20-binding domain and KARD, is dispensable for the aneuploidy and tumor suppressing effects. Overexpression of BubR1 lacking this region reinforced genomic stability and cancer protection in mice, despite dramatically altering metaphase duration of regularly dividing, unchallenged, MEF cells. We find that key shared characteristics of overexpressed FL-BubR1 and BubR1<sup>ΔI</sup> include increased kinetochore localization, increased error correction ability and a more robust SAC, though at differing magnitudes. BubR1<sup>ΔI</sup> overexpression was most extreme in altering the SAC in that it appeared to lower the threshold for checkpoint activation and maintenance. By analyzing the mitotic phenotypes of more refined deletion mutants, we determined that the profound length of nocodazole-induced mitotic arrest in this mutant was likely provided by a combined loss of the Phe box and D-box2, which is in alignment to a previous report showing that this region normally serves to shorten mitotic arrest times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diaz-Martinez et al., 2015</xref>). However, whether the increased duration of mitotic arrest is actively participating in attenuation of Kras-mediated tumorigenesis in either FL-<italic>Bub1b</italic> or <italic>Bub1b</italic><sup>∆I</sup> <italic>Kras</italic><sup>La1</sup> mice is unclear, as oncogenic Kras alone did not negatively impact SAC signaling in MEFs.</p><p>Another unique attribute of BubR1<sup>∆I</sup> overexpression was its impact on normal mitotic timing. In pursuing this phenotype, we found that while overexpression of BubR1<sup>∆PheD</sup> recapitulated the robust nocodazole arrest seen in <italic>Bub1b </italic>MEFs, it did not reproduce the extension of the metaphase-to-anaphase transition. We further explored this with a mutant BubR1 lacking a combination of the Phe box, D-box2 and KARD (<italic>Bub1b</italic><sup>∆Phe∆KARD</sup>), but also did not see changes to mitotic timing. This suggests that the loss of a region within BubR1 between residues 525 and 700, either alone or in combination with the aforementioned domains, might be responsible for influencing the duration of mitosis. Further expansion of this notion could assign new functions related to timing to previously unmapped regions of BubR1.</p><p>Our studies in MEFs which had been infected with oncogenic Kras illuminated that while they had normal mitotic timing and SAC signaling, they had challenges with proper error correction machinery. Taken altogether, these data suggest that specific manipulations of BubR1 and subsequent protection against aneuploidy can occur through distinct complimentary mechanisms that result in tumor protection. In FL-<italic>Bub1b</italic> and <italic>Bub1b</italic><sup>ΔI</sup>, parameters that positively influence genomic stability such as a robust SAC and improved error correction correlate with loss of Kras-mediated aneuploidy and tumorigenesis. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that the strongest mechanism preventing aneuploidization in our Kras system might be a strengthening of the error correction machinery. Given the heterogeneous nature of lung tumors compared to MEFs, however, it is possible that distinct challenges and defects can arise in Kras lung tumors that are not overtly evident in MEFs.</p><p>Lung tissues with activated oncogenic Kras proceed through several morphological stages, including regions of mild hyperplasia/dysplasia that have increased aneuploidy relative to normal lung tissue, to small alveolar adenomas and finally culminating into overt carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Johnson et al., 2001</xref>). We proposed two distinct but non-mutually exclusive mechanisms of tumor protection. In the first mechanism, the impact of a hypersensitive SAC combined with an ability to promote proper attachments and prevent misalignments by FL-BubR1 and BubR1<sup>ΔI</sup> simply prevents genetic heterogeneity that facilitates cancer progression. Thus, while hyperplasia is still a feature of the lungs, there is a block to full neoplastic transformation because necessary losses of tumor suppressors and gains of cancer promoting genes are prevented.</p><p>The second scenario is that survival of pre-neoplastic cells within the hyperplastic tissue is impacted by BubR1 overexpression, such that unstable cells have an increased propensity to die. The competing-networks model proposes that two independent yet competing cell fates oppose each other during mitotic arrest: death by caspase-mediated apoptosis or mitotic slippage resulting from persistent cyclin B1 degradation due to incomplete SAC inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brito and Rieder, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gascoigne and Taylor, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Topham et al., 2015</xref>). Cells with prolonged mitotic arrest have a greater chance and more time to accumulate death signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gascoigne and Taylor, 2008</xref>). Both mutants have an impact on one arm of the competing network branches, as evidenced by their increase in arrest time in mitosis, though BubR1<sup>ΔI</sup> appears to have a more significant contribution. This could shift a given cell population towards death rather than survival. However, this hypothesis remains to be rigorously tested in our model especially since oncogenic Kras-infected MEF cells do not show evidence of a weakened mitotic checkpoint. We argue that taking advantage of an extended arrest independent of whether or not the machinery functions normally could still be used to promote cancer cell death, and that BubR1 overexpression would be an entry point to such therapies. Along these lines, microtubules have been targeted in anti-cancer chemotherapy with much success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dumontet and Jordan, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, the use of Wee/Chk1 inhibitors which cause cells to bypass the G2 checkpoint, force reliance on the SAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mc Gee, 2015</xref>). This could be exploited and we would predict an increased susceptibility to microtubule poisons and cytotoxicity, in particular with a system mimicking BubR1<sup>ΔI</sup> or BubR1<sup>ΔPheD</sup> overexpression.</p><p>Previously we reported a non-significant increase in the mitotic arrest time of MEFs overexpressing FL-BubR1 when challenged with nocodazole relative to wild-type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we conclude, based on more in depth and sophisticated studies to test this aspect of SAC signaling, that there is a modest but significant increase in SAC potency in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, overexpression of BubR1<sup>∆Phe</sup>, BubR1<sup>∆D</sup>, and BubR1<sup>∆KARD</sup> deletion constructs in wild-type MEFs also provided a slight but significant increase in mitotic arrest time compared to controls, indicating that they were analogous to FL-BubR1 overexpression alone. It is important to note that the data provided by the extensive analysis of <italic>Bub1b</italic><sup>∆I</sup> and <italic>Bub1b</italic><sup>∆KARD</sup> MEFs are in disagreement with previous work in human cells, where the KARD was proposed to provide the MT-KT attachment function of BubR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Suijkerbuijk et al., 2012</xref>). In these studies, introducing exogenous BubR1 with a mutated KARD into systems depleted of endogenous BubR1 have decreased PP2A kinetochore localization, and subsequent chromosome alignment defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Suijkerbuijk et al., 2012</xref>). In <italic>Bub1b</italic><sup>ΔI</sup> MEFs, however, we do not see increased alignment errors or decreased PP2A kinetochore localization (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) and both overexpressed BubR1<sup>∆I</sup> and BubR1<sup>∆KARD</sup> actually have increased error correction capabilities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). We emphasize that unlike the studies by Suijkerbuijk and colleagues, our transgene and deletion construct are on the background of a full complement of endogenous BubR1, which may still provide adequate kinetochore docking of PP2A. Furthermore, our data are also in alignment with our previous work in which BubR1<sup>∆I</sup> expressed on a BubR1<sup>–/–</sup> background does not show overt increases in misalignments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Malureanu et al., 2009</xref>). This could represent species-specific differences in the reliance of the KARD for attachment, or on the dependency of BubR1 to recruit PP2A to the kinetochore.</p><p>Overexpression of BubR1<sup>ΔN</sup> or its complimentary fragment BubR1<sup>N</sup> does not recapitulate benefits observed with FL-BubR1 and BubR1<sup>ΔI</sup> overexpression. Instead, BubR1<sup>ΔN</sup> may be imposing detrimental effects on the cells, as its overexpression results in a slight increase in aneuploidy and a decreased ability to sustain a checkpoint arrest in MEFs, though in vivo aneuploidy rates do not change. Interestingly, however, while the BubR1 N-terminus appears necessary for physiological benefits, it alone did not exert an anti-tumor effect. FL-<italic>Bub1b </italic>and <italic>Bub1b</italic><sup>ΔI</sup> MEFs have increased BubR1 expression at kinetochores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), corresponding to phenotypic benefits. BubR1<sup>N</sup> cannot localize to kinetochores, in addition to lacking several functional domains such as the putative kinase/pseudokinase domain, the internal Cdc20-binding domain, and KARD. As we have determined from the studies herein that the internal binding domain and KARD are dispensable, kinetochore localization and subsequent action of BubR1 there might be key to beneficial phenotypes, in particular, error attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lampson and Kapoor, 2005</xref>). This is in agreement with our previous study in which we found BubR1 that is unable to localize to kinetochores due to disruptions of the Bub3-binding domain cannot fully rescue spindle assembly checkpoint or mediate complete corrective effects on misalignment in cells depleted of endogenous BubR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Malureanu et al., 2009</xref>). The use of transgenic strains in which BubR1<sup>N</sup> is artificially tethered to kinetochores and evaluating the impact on SAC and error correction signaling could shed light on this in future studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Maldonado and Kapoor, 2011</xref>). Other transgenic models could parse out the specific contribution of kinetochore-localized overexpression to tumor prevention with a domain mutant that does not permit BubR1 to localize to the kinetochore, as well as overexpression of a kinase-dead BubR1.</p><p>Whether or not aneuploidy causes cancer or is simply a feature is a longstanding question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Giam and Rancati, 2015</xref>). Here, we offer a unique perspective by showing the reinforcement of genomic stability through several complimentary mechanisms, with an emphasis on error correction machinery, attenuates tumors in a Kras mouse model of lung cancer. Tumor cells often have compromised DNA repair pathways, and are therefore sensitized to chemotherapies such as topoisomerase inhibitors and alkylating agents that promote cellular damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Calderón-Montaño et al., 2014</xref>). There are few, if any, cancer treatments that revolve around promoting chromosomal stability and reinforcing known checkpoint pathways. Thus, by forcing reliance on the SAC and death in mitosis by damaging or bypassing other cell-cycle checkpoints, a more potent anti-tumor therapy could be designed.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse strains and husbandry</title><p>All protocols were reviewed and approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Primary antibodies used were mouse anti-BubR1 (BD Transduction, San Jose, CA; 612503, 1:1,000), rabbit anti-mouse BubR1 (aa382-420) ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2004</xref>]; 1:1000), rabbit anti-human BubR1 (aa1-350) ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2004</xref>]; 1:1000), rabbit anti-Flag (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO; F7425, 1:1000), rabbit anti-Flag (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA; 2368S, 1:1000), rabbit anti-Cdc20 (Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX; sc-8358, 1:1000), mouse anti-Kras (Santa Cruz; sc-30, 1:1000) and rabbit anti-pCdc20<sup>S92</sup> and rabbit anti-pCdc20<sup>S153</sup> (generous gifts from Hongtau Yu). All antibodies were detected with secondary HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA; 1:10,000). Ponceau S staining (1% glacial acetic acid, 1.1 g/ml Ponceau S [Sigma-Aldrich]) served as a loading control for blots. All western data are representative for two or three independent experiments. Co-IP was performed with mitotic MEFs that were immortalized by expression of SV40 large T antigen as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2013</xref>). Primary antibodies used were mouse anti-BubR1 (BD Transduction; as above), rabbit anti-mouse BubR1 (aa382-420) ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2004</xref>]; as above), rabbit anti-Cdc20 (Santa Cruz; as above), mouse anti-Mad2 (BD Transduction, 610679, 1:1000), rabbit anti-Mad2 ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ricke et al., 2011</xref>]; 1:1000). All antibodies were detected with secondary HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch; as above) except when Cdc20 immunoblot was performed from CDC20 IP, in which Rabbit TrueBlot Anti-Rabbit IgG HRP (Rockland, Limerick, PA; 18-8816-33 1:1000) was used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Karyotype analyses</title><p>MEF karyotype analyses were performed as previously described on at least <italic>n</italic> = 3 individual MEF lines per genotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Babu et al., 2003</xref>).

In mitotic timing experiments, the time interval between nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) and anaphase onset was measured in H2B-mRFP positive cells by monitoring unchallenged mitoses. Briefly, cells undergoing NEBD were marked and monitored at two minute intervals until anaphase onset. For SAC sensitivity experiments, cells were treated with nocodazole (Sigma-Aldrich) at a final concentration of either 20 or 10 ng/ml and then monitored from NEBD to anaphase onset. Nocodazole challenge experiments were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Malureanu et al., 2009</xref>). Briefly, nocodazole was added to a final concentration of 100 ng/ml. Cells undergoing NEBD were marked and monitored at 10 min intervals to determine when they decondensed their chromosomes. The duration of arrest in mitosis, which is defined as the interval between NEBD (onset of mitosis) and chromatin decondensation (exit from mitosis without cytokinesis), was then calculated and plotted. For checkpoint silencing and sensitivity experiments, 500 nM or 2 µM AZ3146 (Sigma-Aldrich) was added either concurrently or in sequence with nocodazole. All experiments were performed on at least three independently generated MEF lines unless stated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Monastrol washout</title><p>Monastrol washout was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ricke et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly 100 µM monastrol (Enzo Life Sciences, Famingdale, NY) was added to cells for 60 min, after which, 10 µM MG132 (Sigma-Aldrich) was added for 60 min. Cells were then released for 90 min into 10 µM MG132 alone before fixation (4% PFA for 10 min) and staining with Hoechst. Cells treated with Aurora B inhibitor were cultured in medium with 10 nM or 50 nM AZD1152-HQPA (ChemieTek, Indianapolis, IN), as specified for each experiment. Cells in which one or more chromosome was misaligned were considered misaligned.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Sean Morrison as the Senior editor and three reviewers, one of whom, Yukiko M Yamashita, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, van Deursen and colleagues show that the <italic>BubR1</italic> mutant lacking the middle region (ΔI) is fully functional in suppressing Kras-driven lung cancer formation and associated aneuploidy in mice, whereas either <italic>BubR1</italic><sup>ΔN</sup> or <italic>BubR1</italic><sup>N</sup> is not functional. Strikingly, <italic>BubR1</italic><sup>ΔI</sup> is more active that the wild type (WT) in establishing or supporting the checkpoint in cultured cells. These results definitively show that the middle region of BubR1 has a negative function in the spindle checkpoint, and are generally consistent with the findings of Diaz-Martinez et al. which showed that human BubR1 with the middle region deleted was more active than BubR1 WT in human cells.</p><p>The appeal of this paper is that the authors are conducting these experiments primarily in mice, compared to most of the previous work that was performed largely in tissue culture cells. Thus, the results presented in this manuscript were considered to be highly significant. However, at the same time, it was discussed that this work is a direct extension of their previous paper looking at a limited set of <italic>BubR1</italic> mutants for the phenotypes that they previous reported. In addition, this paper does not provide any molecular insights into the function of BubR1 in the spindle assembly checkpoint or chromosome segregation.</p><p>Taken together, the reviewers agreed that it will be important for the authors to provide at least some degree of mechanistic insights (described below). The reviewers have discussed a few options so as to avoid excessive revisions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> actually suggest that there is more Mad2-Cdc20 binary complex in <italic>BubR1</italic><sup>ΔI</sup> cells, relative to intact MCC. It is unclear why this would lead to a hyperactive checkpoint, as Mad2-Cdc20 is a weaker APC/C inhibitor compared to MCC. One possibility is that <italic>BubR1</italic><sup>ΔI</sup> overexpression affects Cdc20 phosphorylation by Bub1 and Plk1, thereby inhibiting APC/C-Cdc20 in an MCC-independent manner. The authors should examine the phosphorylation status of Cdc20. Site-specific Cdc20 antibodies are available for human Cdc20. These might work for mouse Cdc20. If not, phos-tag gels might reveal gel mobility shift of phospho-Cdc20.</p><p>2) Additionally, the reviewers felt that it will be much more informative if the authors examine the phenotypes of <italic>BubR1</italic> mutants with Phe, D2, and KARD individually deleted, which will add molecular mechanism to this manuscript beyond what has been shown by their own earlier work. These experiments should be performed in culture in MEFs.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16620.036</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Taken together, the reviewers agreed that it will be important for the authors to provide at least some degree of mechanistic insights (described below).

It is unclear why this would lead to a hyperactive checkpoint, as Mad2-Cdc20 is a weaker APC/C inhibitor compared to MCC. One possibility is that BubR1<sup>ΔI</sup> overexpression affects Cdc20 phosphorylation by Bub1 and Plk1, thereby inhibiting APC/C-Cdc20 in an MCC-independent manner.

We further validated this finding by performing an immunoprecipitation of Cdc20 and probing for Mad2, demonstrating that there is indeed increased binding between Cdc20 and Mad2 in <italic>BubR1</italic><sup>ΔI</sup> MEFs. This new result has been incorporated into revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> of the manuscript and have been described in the first paragraph of the subsection “The mitotic checkpoint complex composition is unique in <italic>BubR1</italic><sup>ΔI</sup> MEFs”.</p><p>Additionally, we performed the proposed reviewer experiments of evaluating the phosphorylation status of two key residues of Cdc20 in FL-<italic>BubR1</italic> and <italic>BubR1</italic><sup>ΔI</sup> MEFs (S153 and S92 by Bub1 kinase and Plk1 kinase respectively) to determine if MCC-independent mechanism were contributing to heightened SAC activity. We found the indicated antibodies were indeed able to detect murine Cdc20. However, we did not find an increase in phosphorylation of these residues, suggesting this signaling pathway is not hyperactivated in our mutants. These data can be found in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> of the manuscript and have been incorporated in the text in the last paragraph of the subsection “The mitotic checkpoint complex composition is unique in <italic>BubR1</italic><sup>ΔI</sup> MEFs”.</p><p>We also analyzed the phosphorylation status of Cdc20 by Phos-tag western blotting, which confirmed that phosphorylation-mediated inhibition of Cdc20 is unchanged in <italic>BubR1</italic><sup>ΔI</sup> MEFs.

Therefore, one potential explanation is that a decreased threshold for activation or sustainability of SAC signaling (or both) affords <italic>BubR1</italic><sup>ΔI</sup> MEFs a more robust SAC. We have now more clearly discussed this potential explanation in the revised manuscript. Please see the first paragraph of the subsection “The mitotic checkpoint complex composition is unique in <italic>BubR1</italic><sup>ΔI</sup> MEFs”.</p><p><italic>2) Additionally, the reviewers felt that it will be much more informative if the authors examine the phenotypes of BubR1 mutants with Phe, D2, and KARD individually deleted, which will add molecular mechanism to this manuscript beyond what has been shown by their own earlier work. These experiments should be performed in culture in MEFs.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that a fundamental limitation of our manuscript was a lack of refinement of the selected domains of BubR1 for deletion, and we have performed the experiments requested of the reviewers to gain additional mechanistic insight. To this end, we generated the following doxycycline-inducible lentiviral <italic>BubR1</italic> deletion constructs: FL-<italic>BubR1</italic> and <italic>BubR1</italic><sup>ΔI</sup> to serve as controls for the original transgenic MEFs; <italic>BubR1</italic><sup>ΔPhe</sup> (lacking the Phe box); <italic>BubR1</italic><sup>ΔD</sup> (lacking D-box2); <italic>BubR1</italic><sup>ΔPheD</sup> (lacking both the Phe box and D-box2); and <italic>BubR1</italic><sup>ΔKARD</sup> (lacking the KARD). We expressed these constructs in wild-type MEFs and upon induction with doxycycline, found them to be highly overexpressed relative to endogenous <italic>BubR1</italic>. With these MEFs, we performed experiments focused on the domains’ contribution to error correction, mitotic timing, and spindle assembly checkpoint sustainability.</p><p>We found that all of our mutant constructs were able to prevent misalignments resulting from Aurora B deficiency, suggesting that all regions within <italic>BubR1</italic><sup>ΔI</sup> are dispensable for error correction. On the other hand, the gain of function of a robust spindle assembly arrest caused by overexpression of <italic>BubR1</italic><sup>ΔI</sup> seemed dependent on the loss of both the Phe box and D-box2, as only <italic>BubR1</italic><sup>ΔPheD</sup> recapitulated this phenotype. This aligns with previous work from the laboratory of Dr. Hongtao Yu suggesting these regions serve to normally interfere with checkpoint signaling, especially in combination. We have incorporated this information into revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>,revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, and at various places in the text. Please see the last paragraph of the Introduction and the subsection “Refined <italic>BubR1</italic><sup>ΔI</sup> mutants are capable of reinforcing error correction and SAC signaling”.</p><p>Finally, we found that the increase in mitotic timing was exclusive to our <italic>BubR1</italic><sup>ΔI</sup> mutant, as no other mutants had this impact. We generated a compound mutant (<italic>BubR1</italic><sup>ΔPheDΔKARD</sup>) lacking the Phe box, D-box2 and KARD that also had no impact on timing when overexpressed (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). This offers the intriguing possibility that there may be a region within <italic>BubR1</italic> between the Phe/D-box2 and KARD contributing to timing that has yet to be mapped.</p><p>We have incorporated all these data in two new figures, revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>, and two supplementary figures, revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref> and revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>.
