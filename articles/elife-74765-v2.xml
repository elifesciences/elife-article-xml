its cellular location, signaling mechanisms, and physiological functions are poorly understood. Here, by studying tamoxifen-inducible, endothelial cell (EC)-specific <italic>Pkd1</italic> knockout (<italic>Pkd1</italic> ecKO) mice, we show that flow activates PC-1-mediated, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent cation currents in ECs. EC-specific PC-1 knockout attenuates flow-mediated arterial hyperpolarization and vasodilation. PC-1-dependent vasodilation occurs over the entire functional shear stress range and via the activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and intermediate (IK)- and small (SK)-conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels. EC-specific PC-1 knockout increases systemic blood pressure without altering kidney anatomy. PC-1 coimmunoprecipitates with polycystin-2 (PC-2, PKD2), a TRP polycystin channel, and clusters of both proteins locate in nanoscale proximity in the EC plasma membrane. Knockout of either PC-1 or PC-2 (<italic>Pkd2</italic> ecKO mice) abolishes surface clusters of both PC-1 and PC-2 in ECs. Single knockout of PC-1 or PC-2 or double knockout of PC-1 and PC-2 (<italic>Pkd1</italic>/<italic>Pkd2</italic> ecKO mice) similarly attenuates flow-mediated vasodilation. Flow stimulates nonselective cation currents in ECs that are similarly inhibited by either PC-1 or PC-2 knockout or by interference peptides corresponding to the C-terminus coiled-coil domains present in PC-1 or PC-2. In summary, we show that PC-1 regulates arterial contractility through the formation of an interdependent signaling complex with PC-2 in ECs. Flow stimulates PC-1/PC-2 clusters in the EC plasma membrane, leading to eNOS, IK channel, and SK channel activation, vasodilation, and a reduction in blood pressure.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>polycystin-1</kwd><kwd>polycystin-2</kwd><kwd>endothelial cell</kwd><kwd>vasodilation</kwd><kwd>blood pressure</kwd><kwd>flow</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL133256</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jaggar</surname><given-names>Jonathan H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL137745</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jaggar</surname><given-names>Jonathan H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL155180</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jaggar</surname><given-names>Jonathan H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Hl155186</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jaggar</surname><given-names>Jonathan H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL19134</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malik</surname><given-names>Kafait U</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20POST35210200</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>MacKay</surname><given-names>Charles E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>855946</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>MacKay</surname><given-names>Charles E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL149662</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leo</surname><given-names>M Dennis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Flow stimulates PC-1/PC-2 clusters in the plasma membrane of endothelial cells, leading to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, NOS, SK channel, and IK channel activation, vasodilation, and a reduction in blood pressure.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Blood vessels are lined by endothelial cells (ECs), which regulate several physiological functions, including contractility, to control regional organ flow and systemic pressure. ECs can release several diffusible factors, including nitric oxide (NO), which relaxes arterial smooth muscle cells, leading to vasodilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vane, 1993</xref>). ECs also electrically couple to smooth muscle cells and directly modulate their membrane potential to modify arterial contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Garland et al., 2011</xref>). Several receptor agonists, substances, and mechanical stimuli, such as intravascular flow, are known to act in an EC-dependent manner to regulate arterial functions. In many cases, the molecular mechanisms by which these physiological stimuli activate signaling in ECs to modulate vascular contractility are unclear.</p><p>Polycystin-1 (PC-1, PKD1) is a receptor-like transmembrane protein encoded by the <italic>Pkd1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hughes et al., 1995</xref>). PC-1 is expressed in various cell types, including ECs, and is predicted to form eleven transmembrane helices, an extracellular N-terminus, and an intracellular C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hughes et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boulter et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bulley et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">MacKay et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burn et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Qian et al., 2002</xref>). The PC-1 N-terminus is large (&gt;3000 amino acid residues) and contains multiple putative adhesion- and ligand-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hughes et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burn et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Qian et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hardy and Tsiokas, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhou, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nauli et al., 2003</xref>). As such, PC-1 is proposed to act as a mechanical sensor and ligand-receptor, although stimuli that activate PC-1 and its functional significance are unclear.</p><p>ECs also express polycystin-2 (PC-2, PKD2), a protein encoded by the <italic>Pkd2</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">MacKay et al., 2020</xref>). PC-2 is a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family and is also termed TRP polycystin 1 (TRPP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Earley and Brayden, 2015</xref>). PC-1 and PC-2 have been proposed to signal through independent and interdependent mechanisms, with much of this knowledge derived from experiments studying recombinant proteins and cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hardy and Tsiokas, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brill and Ehrlich, 2020</xref>). Supporting their independence, PC-1 and PC-2 exhibit distinct developmental and expression profiles in different kidney cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Foggensteiner et al., 2000</xref>). PC-2 channels do not require PC-1 to traffic to primary cilia and generate currents in primary-cultured kidney collecting duct cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arif Pavel et al., 2016</xref>). PC-1 is also proposed to act as an atypical G protein-coupled receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Parnell et al., 1998</xref>). In addition, C- and N-terminus-deficient PC-2 can alone form a homotetrameric ion channel with each subunit containing six transmembrane domains, when visualized using cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grieben et al., 2017</xref>). Evidence supporting PC-1 and PC-2 interdependency includes that mutations in either <italic>Pkd1</italic> or <italic>Pkd2</italic> result in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), the most prevalent monogenic disorder in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rossetti et al., 2007</xref>). ADPKD is typically characterized by the appearance of renal cysts, but patients can develop hypertension before any kidney dysfunction and cardiovascular disease is the leading (~50%) cause of death in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Valero et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martinez-Vea et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Torres et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gabow, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bergmann et al., 2018</xref>). Experiments studying recombinant proteins and cultured kidney cell lines have provided evidence that PC-1 and PC-2 can exist in a protein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nauli et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Su et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Qian et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Newby et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hanaoka et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Delmas et al., 2004</xref>). Several domains in PC-1 and PC-2 may physically interact, including their C-terminus coiled-coils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Su et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Qian et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tsiokas et al., 1997</xref>). The structure of a PC-1/PC-2 heterotetrameric complex, which forms in a 1:3 stoichiometry, has also been resolved using cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Su et al., 2018</xref>). Despite more than two decades of research, signaling mechanisms and physiological functions of PC-1 and PC-2 and their potential dependency or independence are poorly understood, particularly in extra-renal cell types, such as ECs.</p><p>Here, we generated inducible, cell-specific PC-1 knockout (<italic>Pkd1</italic> ecKO) mice to investigate signaling mechanisms and physiological functions of PC-1 in ECs of resistance-size arteries. We also studied EC-specific PC-2 knockout (<italic>Pkd2</italic> ecKO) mice and produced PC-1/PC-2 double knockout (<italic>Pkd1</italic>/<italic>Pkd2</italic> ecKO) mice to investigate whether PC-1 acts in an independent manner or is dependent on PC-2 to respond to physiological stimuli and elicit functional responses. Our data demonstrate that PC-1 and PC-2 protein clusters form an interdependent plasma membrane complex in ECs which is activated by flow to produce vasodilation and reduce blood pressure.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation and validation of tamoxifen-inducible, EC-specific <italic>Pkd1</italic> knockout mice</title><p>Mice with loxP sites flanking exons 2–4 of the <italic>Pkd1</italic> gene (<italic>Pkd1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>) were bred with tamoxifen-inducible EC-specific Cre mice (<italic>Cdh5(PAC)-CreERT2</italic>) to generate <italic>Pkd1<sup>fl/fl</sup>:Cdh5(PAC)-CreERT2</italic> (<italic>Pkd1</italic> ecKO) mice.

Next, we investigated the functional significance of the coiled-coil domains present in PC-1 and PC-2 to flow-mediated signaling. As PC-2 is a nonselective cation channel, we performed these experiments by isolating and measuring I<sub>Cat</sub> in ECs. I<sub>Cat</sub> was measured using solutions that inhibit K<sup>+</sup> channels and a bath solution that was Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free to prevent Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx-dependent activation of channels. At a steady-state holding potential of –60 mV, flow reversibly stimulated sustained inward I<sub>Cat</sub>s that were of similar amplitude in <italic>Pkd1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and <italic>Pkd2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–G</xref>).

These data indicate that PC-1 and PC-2 similarly contribute to flow-activated I<sub>Cat</sub> in ECs. These data also suggest that when using physiological ionic gradients, flow activates PC-1/PC-2 to induce a transient inward current which then stimulates K<sup>+</sup> channels to produce the sustained reduction in inward current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">MacKay et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Peptides were constructed that correspond to regions within the C-terminal coiled-coil domains in PC-1 (amino acids 4216–4233) and PC-2 (amino acids 874–883) that physically interact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Qian et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hanaoka et al., 2000</xref>).

Our data show that flow stimulates PC-1-dependent cation currents in ECs that induce arterial hyperpolarization, vasodilation, and a reduction in blood pressure. PC-1-dependent vasodilation occurs over the entire functional shear stress range due to eNOS, IK channel, and SK channel activation. PC-1 and PC-2 proteins coassemble and their surface clusters colocalize. Knockout of either PC-1 or PC-2 abolishes surface expression of both proteins. Flow activates a PC-1- and PC-2-dependent I<sub>Cat</sub> that is inhibited by peptides corresponding to the C-terminus coiled-coil domains on either polycystin protein. These data demonstrate that PC-1 regulates arterial contractility by forming an interdependent complex with PC-2 in ECs. Flow stimulates plasma membrane-localized PC-1/PC-2 clusters, leading to eNOS, IK channel, and SK channel activation, vasodilation, and a reduction in blood pressure.</p><p>Intraluminal flow stimulates ECs to induce vasodilation, but signaling mechanisms involved are poorly understood.

Specific results include that inducible, EC-specific knockout of either PC-1 or PC-2 similarly inhibits flow-mediated: (1) biphasic currents in ECs, (2) Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx-dependent cation currents in ECs, (3) arterial hyperpolarization, (4) vasodilation over a broad shear stress range, and (5) vasodilation that occurs via eNOS, IK channel, and SK channel activation. We also show that PC-1 knockout elevates blood pressure, consistent with results obtained in <italic>Pkd2</italic> ecKO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">MacKay et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, PC-1 and PC-2 do not contribute to ACh-induced vasodilation, indicating that these proteins are activated by specific stimuli and that their knockout does not cause generalized EC dysfunction. Myogenic tone, depolarization-induced constriction, and passive diameter are also similar in <italic>Pkd1</italic> ecKO, <italic>Pkd2</italic> ecKO, <italic>Pkd1</italic>/<italic>Pkd2</italic> ecKO, and control mouse arteries, illustrating that smooth muscle function is not altered in these knockout mice.</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that flow activates SK and inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> (K<sub>ir</sub>) channels to induce vasodilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brähler et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Taylor et al., 2003</xref>). K<sub>ir</sub>2.1 activation was shown to contribute to eNOS phosphorylation, but not to SK channel activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahn et al., 2017</xref>). The functional significance of PC-1 and PC-2 to the regulation of K<sub>ir</sub> channels remains to be determined. In arterial membrane potential measurements, we did not verify cell types from which impalements were obtained, but ECs and smooth muscle cells are electrically coupled, particularly in resistance-size arteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Garland et al., 2011</xref>). Our data support the following signaling mechanism. Flow-activated PC-1/PC-2-mediated stimulation of eNOS, IK channels, and SK channels produces arterial hyperpolarization, reducing the activity of voltage-dependent (Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2) channels in smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Garland et al., 2011</xref>). The subsequent reduction in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in smooth muscle cells produces vasodilation and a decrease in blood pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jaggar et al., 2000</xref>). These data suggest that PC-1/PC-2 in ECs of other resistance-size arteries may also function to induce vasodilation. Future studies should aim to investigate PC-1/PC-2 expression and function throughout the vasculature.</p><p>Virtually all vertebrate cells possess at least one primary cilia, a tiny (~0.2–0.5 µm width, 1–12 µm length) immotile organelle electrically distinct from the cell body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kleene and Van Houten, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Delling et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">DeCaen et al., 2013</xref>). Cilia generate compartmentalized signaling and maintain an intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration distinct from the cell soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kleene and Van Houten, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Delling et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">DeCaen et al., 2013</xref>). A great deal of debate has taken place over whether cells sense external fluid flow through proteins located in primary cilia or the plasma membrane. Primary cilia act as flow sensors in the embryonic node and in kidney collecting duct cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yoshiba et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Praetorius and Spring, 2003</xref>). In contrast, flow does not activate Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in primary cilia of cultured kidney epithelial cells, kidney thick ascending tubules, embryonic node crown cells, or in the kinocilia of inner ear hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Delling et al., 2016</xref>). Instead, flow stimulates a cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal in the cell body that propagates to cilia to elevate intraciliary Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Delling et al., 2016</xref>). Here, flow stimulated plasma membrane cation currents, indicating that flow-sensing takes place in the cell body of ECs.</p><p>Physiological functions of PC-1 and the potential involvement of PC-2 in PC-1-mediated signaling mechanisms in endothelial cells were unclear. Whether physical coupling of PC-1 and PC-2 is required for these proteins to traffic to the surface and to activate cellular signaling has also been a matter of debate. Studies that aimed to answer this question primarily used renal epithelial cells or recombinant proteins expressed in cultured cells or <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes. Ciliary localization of PC-2 is necessary for flow-sensing in perinodal crown cells and left-right symmetry in mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yoshiba et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, other studies demonstrated that a physical interaction between PC-1 and PC-2 is essential for these proteins to traffic to the cell surface and generate plasma membrane currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Su et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hanaoka et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Delmas et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chapin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gainullin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ha et al., 2020</xref>). It was essential to include an IgҠ-chain secretion sequence into recombinant PC-1 to induce its trafficking and that of associated PC-2 to the plasma membrane in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ha et al., 2020</xref>). We show that when PC-1 and PC-2 are both expressed, they readily traffic to the plasma membrane in ECs. PC-1 and PC-2 protein clusters are present in the EC plasma membrane with more than one-quarter exhibiting nanoscale overlap, supporting their coassembly. Knockout of either PC-1 or PC-2 does not alter the amount of the other polycystin protein, suggesting that the expression of each polycystin is not influenced by that of the other. In contrast, PC-1 or PC-2 knockout prevents surface localization of the other polycystin protein, leading to its intracellular retention, as can be seen in SMLM and immunofluorescence imaging experiments. Flow did not alter the properties of surface PC-1 or PC-2 clusters, or their intercluster distance or overlap, suggesting that flow activates a heteromeric PC-1/PC-2 complex in the plasma membrane. The cluster sizes we report reflect those of the proteins and the antibodies used to label them. Western blotting, immunofluorescence, immunoFRET and SMLM experiments on ECs and arteries of <italic>Pkd1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>, <italic>Pkd2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>, <italic>Pkd1</italic> ecKO, and <italic>Pkd2</italic> ecKO mice have validated the PC-1 and PC-2 antibodies (here and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">MacKay et al., 2020</xref>). A small amount of fluorescence was observed in <italic>Pkd1</italic> ecKO and <italic>Pkd2</italic> ecKO cells during SMLM experiments. We use the term ‘nonspecific labeling’ as an umbrella term to refer to secondary antibodies that may be free, bound to primary antibodies or both. It is for this reason that the comparison between ECs of <italic>Pkd1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>, <italic>Pkd2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>, <italic>Pkd1</italic> ecKO, and <italic>Pkd2</italic> ecKO mice is useful, particularly as the same labeling protocols were performed on ECs of these different mouse models. A previous study showed that PC-2 immunolabeling colocalized with α-tubulin, a ciliary marker, in ECs of embryonic (E15.5) conduit vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">AbouAlaiwi et al., 2009</xref>). We did not examine if PC-1 or PC-2 is present in cilia or if flow activates PC-1- or PC-2-dependent currents in the cilia of ECs. Future studies should investigate these possibilities.</p><p>PC-1 and PC-2 did not generate currents in the plasma membrane of renal collecting duct cells or following heterologous expression in cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arif Pavel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hanaoka et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Delmas et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">DeCaen et al., 2013</xref>). Knockout of either PC-1 or PC-2 also did not alter plasma membrane currents in inner medullary collecting duct (pIMCD) epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). Recently, it was demonstrated that plasma membrane PC-1/PC-2 channels are silent but can be measured when a gain-of-function mutation (F604P) is introduced into PC-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ha et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). We show that in the absence of flow, surface PC-1/PC-2 channels generate little current in ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">MacKay et al., 2020</xref>). Rather, flow-activates plasma membrane currents in ECs that are similarly attenuated by either PC-1 or PC-2 knockout or by the introduction of peptides that correspond to the C-terminus coiled-coil domains that interact on each protein (here and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">MacKay et al., 2020</xref>). Flow-mediated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations and NO production were attenuated in cultured embryonic aortic ECs from <italic>Pkd1</italic> and Tg737<sup>orpk/orpk</sup> global knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nauli et al., 2008</xref>). As Tg737<sup>orpk/orpk</sup> global knockout mice have shorter cilia or no cilia, the authors proposed that PC-1 located in cilia is a flow sensor in embryonic ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nauli et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, more recent studies have demonstrated that flow did not elicit Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in primary cilia and homomeric PC-2 channels did not require PC-1 in primary cilia of pIMCD epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). Our data support the conclusion that flow activates PC-1/PC-2-dependent cation currents in the plasma membrane of ECs.</p><p>Multiple different domains in PC-1 and PC-2 physically interact. Several groups have demonstrated that PC-1 and PC-2 couple via their C-terminal coiled-coils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Qian et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tsiokas et al., 1997</xref>). Recombinant PC-1 and PC-2 lacking coiled-coils can also interact via N-terminal loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Babich et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Feng et al., 2008</xref>). The structure of a PC-1/PC-2 heterotetramer resolved using cryo-EM indicated that a region between TM6 and TM11 of PC-1 interdigitates with PC-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Su et al., 2018</xref>). PC-1 is proposed to act both as a dominant-negative subunit in PC-1/PC-2 channels and to increase Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability over that in PC-2 homotetramers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Su et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Our data suggest that flow stimulates the physical coupling of the coiled-coil domains in PC-1/PC-2 to activate current. Alternatively, the interference peptides may uncouple constitutively bound coiled coils in PC-1/PC-2 heteromers, thereby preventing current activation by flow. It is unlikely that the interference peptides dissolve PC-1/PC-2 into individual subunits as several other domains can interact and the PC-1/PC-2 heteromeric structure was resolved in the absence of the coiled-coils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Su et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Feng et al., 2008</xref>). PC-1 has been proposed to act as an atypical G protein due to the presence of a G protein-binding domain located in the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Parnell et al., 1998</xref>). The PC-1 interference peptide we used does not overlap with this G protein-binding domain, which is located between amino acids 4125 and 4143. Thus, G protein signaling by PC-1 may not be involved in flow-mediated PC-1/PC-2-dependent current activation in ECs, although this remains to be determined.</p><p>Our data suggest that flow activates Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through PC-1/PC-2 channels. Although homomeric PC-2 is a K<sup>+</sup>- and Na<sup>+</sup>-permeant channel with low Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability, heteromeric assembly of PC-2 with PC-1 increases Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability and reduces block by external Ca<sup>2+</sup>, supporting this concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). We did not determine the ionic permeability of flow-activated PC-1/PC-2-dependent currents in ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). ECs express a wide variety of ion channels, including several other TRPs and K<sup>+</sup> channels, making the isolation of a pure PC-1/PC-2-dependent current challenging. PC-1/PC-2 may also interact with other TRP channels. For example, PC-2-containing channels have been suggested to require TRPM3 in primary cilia of cultured renal epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kleene et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, PC-1/PC-2 channels in ECs may contain other TRP subunits.</p><p>Flow may directly or indirectly activate PC-1/PC-2 in ECs. PC-1 is proposed to act as a mechanical sensor and ligand-receptor in cultured kidney epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hardy and Tsiokas, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhou, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nauli et al., 2003</xref>). The PC-1 extracellular N-terminus contains several putative adhesion- and ligand-binding sites that may confer mechanosensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hughes et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burn et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Qian et al., 2002</xref>). Recent evidence indicates that the C-type lectin domain located in the PC-1 N-terminus activates recombinant PC-1/PC-2 channels, providing one possible activation mechanism for flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ha et al., 2020</xref>). Other mechanosensitive proteins, such as Piezo1 and GPR68, may also stimulate PC-1/PC-2-dependent currents in ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Investigating the mechanisms by which flow activates PC-1/PC-2-dependent currents should be a focus of future studies.</p><p>ADPKD is typically characterized by the appearance of renal cysts, but patients can develop hypertension prior to any kidney dysfunction, with cardiovascular disease the leading (~50%) cause of death in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Valero et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martinez-Vea et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Torres et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gabow, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bergmann et al., 2018</xref>). Hypertension occurs prior to loss of kidney function in more than 60% of patients, with the average age of onset between 30 and 34 years of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chapman et al., 2010</xref>). Our study raises the possibility that hypertension and cardiovascular disease in ADPKD patients may involve altered PC-1/PC-2 function in ECs. Consistent with our data, human ADPKD patients exhibit loss of NO release and a reduction in endothelium-dependent dilation during increased blood flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">MacKay et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lorthioir et al., 2015</xref>). Hypertension in humans is also associated with endothelial dysfunction and attenuated flow-mediated dilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antony et al., 1995</xref>). Conceivably, hypertension may also be associated with dysfunctional PC-1/PC-2 signaling in ECs. Our demonstration that PC-1/PC-2 elicits vasodilation may lead to studies identifying potential dysfunction in patients with hypertension, ADPKD, and other cardiovascular diseases.</p><p>In summary, we show that PC-1 regulates arterial contractility through the formation of an interdependent plasma membrane signaling complex with PC-2 in ECs. Flow stimulates PC-1/PC-2-dependent currents in ECs, leading to eNOS, IK channel, and SK channel activation, vasodilation, and a reduction in blood pressure.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Pkd1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Baltimore PKD Core Center</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15579506/">15579506</ext-link>MGI: 3617325</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mice with <italic>Pkd1</italic> gene flanked by <italic>loxP</italic> regions.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Pkd2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Baltimore PKD Core Center</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20862291/">20862291</ext-link>MGI: 4843127</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mice with <italic>Pkd2</italic> gene flanked by <italic>loxP</italic> regions.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Pkd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> /Pkd2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mouse line created in-house by mating <italic>Pkd1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> with <italic>Pkd2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>.

Arteries were transferred to an Eppendorf tube containing RIPA Buffer (Sigma-Aldrich: R0278) and protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich: P8340, 1:100 dilution). For experiments measuring the effect of flow of eNOS phosphorylation, arteries were exposed to flow (15 /dyn) for 5 min at 37°C and then immediately transferred to an Eppendorf tube containing RIPA buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (1:100 dilution). Arteries were cut into small segments using micro scissors and mechanically broken down using a homogenizer (Argos Technologies: A0001). The lysate was centrifuged at 4°C, 10,000 rpm for 2 min. This process was repeated three times, after which the supernatant was collected. Proteins in lysate were separated on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% milk and incubated with one of the following primary antibodies: PC-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), PC-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Piezo1 (ProteinTech), GPR68 (NOVUS), SK3 (Sigma-Aldrich [P0608]), IK (Alomone), TRPV4 (MilliporeSigma), eNOS (Abcam), or actin (MilliporeSigma) overnight at 4°C.

For experiments using physiological ionic gradients, the bath solution contained (in mM): NaCl 134, KCl 6, HEPES 10, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 2, and glucose 10 (pH 7.4). The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free bath solution was the same composition as bath solution except Ca<sup>2+</sup> was omitted and 1 mM EGTA was included. The pipette solution contained (in mM): K aspartate 110, KCl 30, HEPES 10, glucose 10, EGTA 1, Mg-ATP 1, and Na-GTP 0.2, with total MgCl<sub>2</sub> and CaCl<sub>2</sub> adjusted to give free concentrations of 1 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> and 200 nM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, respectively (pH 7.2). For experiments measuring I<sub>Cat</sub>, the bath solution contained (in mM): Na aspartate 135, NaCl 5, HEPES 10, glucose 10, and MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1 (pH 7.4). A low Na<sup>+</sup> bath solution used when measuring I<sub>Cat</sub> was (in mM): NMDG-asp 135, NaCl 5, HEPES 10, glucose 10, and MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1 (pH 7.4).

Currents were filtered at 1 kHz and digitized at 5 kHz using an Axopatch 200B amplifier and Clampex 10.4 (Molecular Devices). Offline analysis was performed using (Clampfit 10.4). The flow-activated transient inward current was measured at its peak in each cell. The steady-state inward current was the average of at least 45 s of contiguous data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Pressurized artery membrane potential measurements</title><p>Membrane potential was measured by inserting sharp glass microelectrodes (50–90 MΩ) filled with 3 M KCl into the adventitial side of pressurized third- and fourth-order mesenteric arteries. Membrane potential was recorded using a WPI FD223a amplifier and digitized using a MiniDigi 1A USB interface, pClamp 9.2 software (Axon Instruments) and a personal computer. Criteria for successful intracellular impalements were a sharp negative deflection in potential on insertion, stable voltage for at least 1 min after entry, a sharp positive voltage deflection on exit from the recorded cell, and a &lt;10% change in tip resistance after impalement.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Pressurized artery myography</title><p>Experiments were performed using isolated third- and fourth-order mesenteric arteries using PSS gassed with 21% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>/74% N<sub>2</sub> (pH 7.4). Arterial segments 1–2 mm in length were cannulated at each end in a perfusion chamber (Living Systems Instrumentation) continuously perfused with PSS and maintained at 37°C. Intravascular pressure was altered using a Servo pump model PS-200-P (Living Systems) and monitored using pressure transducers. Following the development of stable myogenic tone, intraluminal flow was introduced using a P720 peristaltic pump (Instech). The intraluminal flow rate required to apply a specific amount of shear stress to each artery was calculated using internal diameter. Arterial diameter was measured at 1 Hz using a CCD camera attached to a Nikon TS100-F microscope and the automatic edge-detection function of IonWizard software (Ionoptix). Myogenic tone was calculated as: 100×(1−D<sub>active</sub>/D<sub>passive</sub>) where D<sub>active</sub> is active arterial diameter and D<sub>passive</sub> is the diameter determined in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free PSS supplemented with 5 mM EGTA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Telemetric blood pressure and locomotion measurements</title><p>Telemetric blood pressure recordings were performed at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. Briefly, transmitters (PA-C10, Data Sciences International) were implanted subcutaneously into anesthetized mice, with the sensing electrode placed in the aorta via the left carotid artery. Mice were allowed to recover for 7–10 days. Blood pressure was then recorded every 20 s for 5 days prior to tamoxifen injection and again for the entire time period between 7 and 22 days after the last tamoxifen injection (50 mg/kg per day for 5 consecutive days, i.p) using a PhysioTel Digital telemetry platform (Data Sciences International).

The glomerular size was measured by tracing the circumference of 25 random glomeruli and surface area was calculated using the polygonal area tool of Image-Pro 4.5 image analysis software calibrated to a stage micrometer. Tubular size was measured using the linear length tool of Image-Pro 4.5 imaging software. The tracing tool was applied at the diameter of cross-sectional profiles of 5 proximal tubules/image (total of 25/section).

Fluorescence was detected using TIRF mode with emission band-pass filters of 550–650 and 660–760 nm.</p><p>Localization precision was calculated using:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">q</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>12</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">N</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>8</mml:mn><mml:mi>π</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">b</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">q</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">N</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where σ<sub>x,y</sub> is the localization precision of a fluorescent probe in lateral dimensions, s is the standard deviation of the point-spread function, N is the total number of photons gathered, q is the pixel size in the image space, and b is the background noise per pixel. The precision of localization is proportional to DLR/√N, where DLR is the diffraction-limited resolution of a fluorophore and N is the average number of detected photons per switching event, assuming the point-spread functions are Gaussian. PC-1 and PC-2 localization were reconstructed from 35,000 to 40,000 images based on fitting signals to a Gaussian function and taking into account a point spread function calculated using a standardized 40 nm bead slide (ZEN Black software, Zeiss). The first 5000 frames were excluded from the reconstruction to account for time to stabilize photo-switching of the probes. Software drift correction was applied using a model-based cross-correlation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>OriginLab and GraphPad InStat software were used for statistical analyses. Values are expressed as mean ± SEM. Student’s t-test was used for comparing paired and unpaired data from two populations and ANOVA with Holm-Sidak post hoc test was used for multiple group comparisons. p&lt;0.05 was considered significant. Power analysis was performed to verify that the sample size gave a value &gt;0.8 if p was &gt;0.05. Kidney histology and blood pressure experiments were all done single-blind, wherein the person performing the experiments and analysis of the results was not aware of the mouse genotype.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Funding acquisition, Supervision, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kenton Swartz as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: William Jackson (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A key finding from the current study is the suggestion that interactions between PC-1 and PC-2 via coiled-coil domains are required for activation of inward current by flow. However, the authors did not show evidence, via fluorescence imaging or otherwise (e.g., coIP), that peptides generated to disrupt this interaction actually do so. Does treatment with the coiled-coil domain peptides cause a shift in the PC-1-to-PC-2 distance (using TIRF-SMLM as in Figure 5)? How do you know that the peptides you introduced reduced physical coupling of PC-1 and PC-2 rather than simply acting to block the ion channel? Please show appropriate controls using scrambled peptides. Further, negative controls for immunoFRET (e.g., use of cells from KO models, or FRET between PC-1 and another membrane protein) should be provided to demonstrate the specificity of this technique for PC-1/PC-2 interactions in endothelial cells. Are the currents shown in 6D and 6E for control and with CC peptides for different cells? Please clarify.</p><p>2) The conclusions of the manuscript state that endothelial PC-1/PC-2 complexes control arterial contractility through ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent activation of eNOS and SK channels. However, neither increases in intracellular ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations nor NO production were directly measured. Can PC-1/PC-2 mediated ca<sup>2+</sup> Sparklets be resolved? The authors argue that G-protein signaling is not involved – Can this be tested directly using Gq antagonists or other approaches?</p><p>3) What effect does apamin alone and TRAM-34 alone have on the dilation? Authors should provide experiments where for each inhibitor (Apamin and Tram34) are added to the prep first before adding the other two inhibitors. Further, is the hyperpolarization induced by flow blocked by apamin, Tram-34 or their combination? Were there any differences between freshly isolated cells and primary cultured cells? How did you verify that the cells you were using were indeed endothelial cells?</p><p>4) Why were different antibodies used for imaging than for Westerns? How do you know that they identified the same proteins? It is not clear what steps were taken to document the specificity of all PC-1 and PC-2 Abs. Especially, that the bulk of interactions studies rely on these Abs and that some staining remains in the KO conditions. In fact, the authors conclude that PC-1/PC-2 clusters in KO cells in SMLM experiments are likely due to non-specific antibody binding, which raises the question as to the meaning of cluster size data. Considering that the approach relies on fluorophore-tagged antibodies, which cannot be assumed to be in 1:1 stoichiometry with proteins of interest, how relevant is cluster size?</p><p>5) Based on data shown in Figure 1, the authors conclude that there is a reduction in inward current with flow. Since the applied technique measures total current, couldn't this result also reflect an increase in outward current (e.g., K<sup>+</sup>) due to flow that depends on the presence of ca<sup>2+</sup>? Related to these data, the magnitude of initial flow-induced transient current was quite variable (~8 – ~45 pA). Was this due to differences in cell size? The authors should express data from current recordings as current density (pA/pF). How does the patch clamp data in Fig6D relate to that in Figure 1D where one shows a transient inward current followed by a major reduction in current while the other shows a large monovalent current stimulated by flow? What is the rationale for the use of these two protocols? Can the authors run voltage steps to determine I/V relationships of PC-2?</p><p>6) In the section titled: &quot;Endothelial cell PC-1 contributes to flow-mediated arterial hyperpolarization&quot; – When you state arterial membrane potential is this the membrane potential of vascular smooth muscle cells? If so how did you verify which cell type you were recording from?

To clarify this issue, we have performed new experiments using scrambled PC-1 and PC-2 peptides. We now show that scrambled sequences of the coiled-coil domain peptides do not inhibit flow-activated non-selective cation currents in endothelial cells (new Figure 6E-G and Figure 6 —figure supplement 2). In contrast, peptides corresponding to the coiled-coil domains in either PC-1 or PC-2 similarly inhibit flow-activated cation currents. We consider it highly unlikely that the coiled-coil domain peptides physically separate PC-1 and PC-2 subunits, as we have now discussed in the manuscript. Multiple different domains in PC-1 and PC-2 physically interact to form PC-1/PC-2 heteromers. The C-terminal coiled-coils are only one region where PC-1 and PC-2 interact (Qian et al., Nat. Genet. 1997; Zhu et al., PNAS 2011; Yu et al., PNAS 2009; Tsiokas et al., PNAS 1997). PC-1 and PC-2 proteins that lack coiled-coils interact via N-terminal loops (Babich et al., JBC 2004; Feng et al., JBC 2008). The structure of an N- and C-terminus-deficient PC-1/PC-2 heterotetramer has also been resolved using cryo-EM. In this study, it was found that a region between TM6 and TM11 of PC-1 interdigitates with PC-2 (Su et al., Science 2018). Our data with the peptides suggest that coiled-coil domain coupling is required for flow to activate PC-1/PC-2.</p><p>As requested, we also provide new data performed using immunoFRET in <italic>Pkd1</italic> ecKO and <italic>Pkd2</italic> ecKO endothelial cells. These new data provide controls for the other immunoFRET results (Figure 4B, C; Figure 4 —figure supplement 1A, B).</p><p>Yes, the data obtained in figure 6E-G and Figure 6 —figure supplement 2 are collected from different endothelial cells, as we now state in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The conclusions of the manuscript state that endothelial PC-1/PC-2 complexes control arterial contractility through ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent activation of eNOS and SK channels. However, neither increases in intracellular ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations nor NO production were directly measured. Can PC-1/PC-2 mediated ca<sup>2+</sup> Sparklets be resolved? The authors argue that G-protein signaling is not involved – Can this be tested directly using Gq antagonists or other approaches?</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed new experiments and now show that flow stimulates eNOS phosphorylation in <italic>Pkd1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> arteries and that this effect is attenuated in arteries of <italic>Pkd1</italic> ecKO mice (new Figure 2I, J). These data are similar to those we have previously published for <italic>Pkd2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and <italic>Pkd2</italic> ecKO arteries, providing further support for our conclusion that PC-1 and PC-2 are interdependent for flow-mediated vasodilation. Whether PC-1/PC-2 activates eNOS, IK channels and SK channels through local or global ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is unclear. We consider answering this question to be beyond the scope of the current manuscript and suitable for a future study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) What effect does apamin alone and TRAM-34 alone have on the dilation? Authors should provide experiments where for each inhibitor (Apamin and Tram34) are added to the prep first before adding the other two inhibitors. Further, is the hyperpolarization induced by flow blocked by apamin, Tram-34 or their combination? Were there any differences between freshly isolated cells and primary cultured cells? How did you verify that the cells you were using were indeed endothelial cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that further investigation of the individual contributions of NOS, SK channels and IK channels to flow-mediated vasodilation caused by PC-1/PC-2 is appropriate. As such, we have performed new experiments. These new data show that L-NNA, Tram-34 and apamin each reduce flow-mediated vasodilation in <italic>Pkd1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> arteries and that these effects are attenuated in arteries of <italic>Pkd1</italic> ecKO mice (new Figure 2E-H). It is well established that NOS, IK channel and SK channel activation in endothelial cells produces arterial hyperpolarization, which leads to vasodilation. We show that flow-mediated arterial hyperpolarization is attenuated in arteries of <italic>Pkd1</italic> ecKO mice, consistent with other data in our manuscript demonstrating that PC-1 stimulates eNOS, IK channels and SK channels. We have now included statements in the manuscript to strengthen this point. Data obtained in primary cultured cells, fresh-isolated arteries and in vivo measurements all produced data consistent with our conclusions. Immunofluorescence, lattice-SIM and SMLM experiments were performed on cells which labeled for CD31, an endothelial cell-specific marker, as is stated in the manuscript. Cells used for patch-clamp experiments label with CD31 (Figure 4F), respond to flow and produce SK and IK currents (6), consistent with endothelial cells. This statement is now included in the Methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Why were different antibodies used for imaging than for Westerns? How do you know that they identified the same proteins? It is not clear what steps were taken to document the specificity of all PC-1 and PC-2 Abs.

Proteins on Western blots are denatured, whereas proteins in fixed cells are cross-linked. Often, antibodies are better at detecting either denatured or cross-linked proteins. It is for this reason that we used different antibodies for Westerns and immunofluorescence. Western blots of arteries from <italic>Pkd1</italic> ecKO and <italic>Pkd2</italic> ecKO mice validated PC-1 and PC-2 antibodies (here and Mackay et al. <italic>eLife</italic> 2020). Immunofluorescence, immunoFRET and SMLM experiments validated PC-1 and PC-2 antibodies in immunofluorescence experiments performed on <italic>Pkd1</italic> ecKO and <italic>Pkd2</italic> ecKO mice (here and Mackay et al. <italic>eLife</italic> 2020). This information is now stated in the manuscript. A small amount of secondary antibody fluorescence is present in <italic>Pkd1</italic> ecKO and <italic>Pkd2</italic> ecKO cells when performing SMLM, a highly sensitive imaging technique. We used “non-specific labeling” as an umbrella term to refer to secondary antibodies that may be either free or bound to primary antibodies. It is for this reason that the comparison between endothelial cells of <italic>Pkd1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>, <italic>Pkd2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>, <italic>Pkd1</italic> ecKO and <italic>Pkd2</italic> ecKO mice is useful. The same labeling procedures were used in endothelial cells of these different mouse models, making the comparison of cluster sizes relevant. We recognize your comment and now include text stating that the size of the PC-1 and PC-2 clusters we report is the size of both the proteins and the antibodies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Based on data shown in Figure 1, the authors conclude that there is a reduction in inward current with flow. Since the applied technique measures total current, couldn't this result also reflect an increase in outward current (e.g., K<sup>+</sup>) due to flow that depends on the presence of ca<sup>2+</sup>? Related to these data, the magnitude of initial flow-induced transient current was quite variable (~8 – ~45 pA). Was this due to differences in cell size? The authors should express data from current recordings as current density (pA/pF). How does the patch clamp data in Fig6D relate to that in Figure 1D where one shows a transient inward current followed by a major reduction in current while the other shows a large monovalent current stimulated by flow? What is the rationale for the use of these two protocols? Can the authors run voltage steps to determine I/V relationships of PC-2?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that presenting the mean data as current density is useful. As such, we now express all patch-clamp mean data as current density (pA/pF). This reanalysis did not change any of our conclusions. We also agree that in figure 1, the results reflect a flow-activated increase in K<sup>+</sup> current, as it is partially inhibited by apamin/tram-34 (Mackay et al. <italic>eLife</italic> 2020). We use the term “a reduction in inward current” because the entire current range in these experiments is negative of 0 pA and is therefore, inward. In figure 1, our rationale was to compare the contribution of PC-1 to flow-activated currents in physiological ionic gradients. We have performed similar experiments using <italic>Pkd2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and <italic>Pkd2</italic> ecKO mice, allowing comparison of these results in the different knockout mouse models (Mackay et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2020). In figure 6E-G and Figure 6 —figure supplement 2, as we aimed to test the hypothesis that coiled-coil domains in PC-1 and PC-2 may be physiologically relevant. As such, our rationale was to isolate non-selective cation currents to which PC-1 and PC-2 contribute. We have strengthened the rationale for these different experimental conditions by expanding discussion in the manuscript. We have also discussed that the flow-activated reduction in inward current observed when using physiological ionic gradients reflects the activation of K<sup>+</sup> current due to SK and IK channels, consistent with our previous study and those obtained here when using myography (Mackay et al. <italic>eLife</italic> 2020). Endothelial cells express several different non-selective cation channels, including multiple members of the TRP family. The experiment you suggest would record current from multiple different channel types and would be unlikely to record a pure PC-2 current.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In the section titled: &quot;Endothelial cell PC-1 contributes to flow-mediated arterial hyperpolarization&quot; – When you state arterial membrane potential is this the membrane potential of vascular smooth muscle cells? If so how did you verify which cell type you were recording from? How do you know that the short-term culture did not affect expression and distribution of PC-1 and PC-2 or other ion channels in your cells? Please also define what the flow rate was and what the estimated shear stress was in this section.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we now provide additional explanation of the microelectrode impalement experiments in the Discussion. Endothelial and smooth muscle cells are electrically coupled. We did not verify from which cell types the membrane potential measurements were obtained. Therefore, we use the term “arterial potential”. We did not determine whether short-term culture affects expression or distribution of channels in endothelial cells. There are both advantages and disadvantages to studying fresh-isolated and primary-cultured endothelial cells. Fresh-isolated cells have very recently been exposed to enzymes, which could reduce surface protein abundance and alter distribution, which will alter results obtained. Primary culture would allow recovery of protein expression and distribution. Our data obtained using primary-cultured endothelial cells, fresh-isolated arteries and in vivo telemetry are consistent with the conclusion that flow activates PC-1/PC-2 clusters in endothelial cells, leading to ca<sup>2+</sup> influx which activates SK, IK and eNOS, eliciting membrane hyperpolarization, vasodilation and a reduction in blood pressure. As requested, we have included the shear stress (15 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup>) applied to these arteries in the legend. During experimentation, the flow rate applied to induce a required amount of shear stress to an artery was calculated from its internal diameter. We have now included this information in the Methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other additional revisions:</p><p>1) Data by others suggest that KIR2.1 channels are involved in flow-mediated dilation – what effect does Ba2+ have in your hands?

The goal of our study was to investigate the regulation of arterial contractility by PC-1 in endothelial cells. We provide a mechanistic link to eNOS, IK and SK channels. It is beyond the scope of this manuscript to study all previously proposed mechanisms for flow in the context of PC-1 and PC-2. Future studies will be designed to address other mechanisms by which PC-1/PC-2 may signal to provide an integrated scheme.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Endothelium-specific deletion of PC-1 increased blood pressure, implying that the proposed role for PC-1 is generally applicable to the resistance arterial network; yet here, only small mesenteric vessels were studied.
