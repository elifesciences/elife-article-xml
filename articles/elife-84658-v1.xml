knowledge about phenotypes derived from molecular interactions between diverse groups of species, in such a way that is amenable to data-driven biology and research. To improve access to this knowledge, we have constructed a framework for the curation of the scientific literature studying interspecies interactions, using data curated for the Pathogen–Host Interactions database (PHI-base) as a case study. The framework provides a curation tool, phenotype ontology, and controlled vocabularies to curate pathogen–host interaction data, at the level of the host, pathogen, strain, gene, and genotype. The concept of a multispecies genotype, the ‘metagenotype,’ is introduced to facilitate capturing changes in the disease-causing abilities of pathogens, and host resistance or susceptibility, observed by gene alterations. We report on this framework and describe PHI-Canto, a community curation tool for use by publication authors.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The increasingly vast amount of data being produced in research communities can be difficult to manage, making it challenging for both humans and computers to organise and connect information from different sources. Currently, software tools that allow authors to curate peer-reviewed life science publications are designed solely for single species, or closely related species that do not interact.</p><p>Although most research communities are striving to make their data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable), it is particularly difficult to curate detailed information based on interactions between two or more species (interspecies), such as pathogen-host interactions. As a result, there was a lack of tools to support multi-species interaction databases, leading to a reliance on labour-intensive curation methods.</p><p>To address this problem, Cuzick et al. used the Pathogen-Host Interactions database (PHI-base), which curates knowledge from the text, tables and figures published in over 200 journals, as a case study. A framework was developed that could capture the many observable traits (phenotype annotations) for interactions and link them directly to the combination of genotypes involved in those interactions across multiple scales – ranging from microscopic to macroscopic. This demonstrated that it was possible to build a framework of software tools to enable curation of interactions between species in more detail than had been done before.</p><p>Cuzick et al. developed an online tool called PHI-Canto that allows any researcher to curate published pathogen-host interactions between almost any known species. An ontology – a collection of concepts and their relations – was created to describe the outcomes of pathogen-host interactions in a standardised way. Additionally, a new concept called the ‘metagenotype’ was developed which represents the combination of a pathogen and a host genotype and can be easily annotated with the phenotypes arising from each interaction.</p><p>The newly curated multi-species FAIR data on pathogen-host interactions will enable researchers in different disciplines to compare and contrast interactions across species and scales. Ultimately, this will assist the development of new approaches to reduce the impact of pathogens on humans, livestock, crops and ecosystems with the aim of decreasing disease while increasing food security and biodiversity. The framework is potentially adoptable by any research community investigating interactions between species and could be adapted to explore other harmful and beneficial interspecies interactions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pathogen-host interactions</kwd><kwd>phenotype database</kwd><kwd>PHI-base</kwd><kwd>curation</kwd><kwd>pathogen species</kwd><kwd>host species</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/S020020/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cuzick</surname><given-names>Alayne</given-names></name><name><surname>Urban</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name><name><surname>Hammond-Kosack</surname><given-names>Kim E</given-names></name><name><surname>Seager</surname><given-names>James</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/S020098/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cuzick</surname><given-names>Alayne</given-names></name><name><surname>Urban</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name><name><surname>Hammond-Kosack</surname><given-names>Kim E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/X011003/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cuzick</surname><given-names>Alayne</given-names></name><name><surname>Urban</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name><name><surname>Hammond-Kosack</surname><given-names>Kim E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/X010953/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cuzick</surname><given-names>Alayne</given-names></name><name><surname>Seager</surname><given-names>James</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/P016855/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Urban</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name><name><surname>Hammond-Kosack</surname><given-names>Kim E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A framework has been devised that enables global participation in the curation of publications on any topic involving two or more living organisms, ranging from microscopic to larger sizes, in their natural or artificial environments or ecosystems.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Recent technological advancements across the biological sciences have resulted in an increasing volume of peer-reviewed publications reporting experimental data and conclusions. To increase the value of this highly fragmented knowledge, biocurators manually extract the data from publications and represent it in a standardized and interconnected way following the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) Data Principles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">International Society for Biocuration, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wilkinson et al., 2016</xref>). Curated functional data is then made available in online databases, either organism- or clade-specific (e.g. model organism databases) or those supporting multiple kingdoms of life (e.g. PHI-base <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Urban et al., 2022</xref>), Alliance of Genomes Resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agapite et al., 2020</xref>), or UniProt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bateman et al., 2021</xref>). Due to the complexity of the biology and the specificity of the curation requirements, manual biocuration is currently the most reliable way to capture information about function and phenotype in databases and knowledge bases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wood et al., 2022</xref>). For pathogen–host interactions, the original publications do not provide details of specific strains, variants, and their associated genotypes and phenotypes, nor the relative impact on pathogenicity and virulence, in a standardized machine-readable format. The expert curator synergizes knowledge from different representations (text, graphs, images) into clearly defined machine-readable syntax. The development of curation tools with clear workflows supporting the use of biological ontologies and controlled vocabularies has standardized curation efforts, reduced ambiguity in annotation, and improved the maintenance of the curated corpus as biological knowledge evolves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">International Society for Biocuration, 2018</xref>).</p><p>The pathogen–host interaction research communities are an example of a domain of the biological sciences exhibiting a literature deluge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). PHI-base (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phi-base.org/">phi-base.org</ext-link>) is an open-access FAIR biological database containing data on bacterial, fungal, and protist genes proven to affect (or not to affect) the outcome of pathogen–host interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rodríguez-Iglesias et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Urban et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Urban et al., 2022</xref>). Since 2005, PHI-base has manually curated phenotype data associated with underlying genome-level changes from peer-reviewed pathogen–host interaction literature. Information is also provided on the target sites of some anti-infective chemistries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Urban et al., 2020</xref>). Knowledge related to pathogen–host interaction phenotypes is increasingly relevant, as infectious microbes continually threaten global food security, human health across the life course, farmed animal health and wellbeing, tree health, and ecosystem resilience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fisher et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fisher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fisher et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Smith et al., 2019</xref>). Rising resistance to antimicrobial compounds, increased globalization, and climate change indicate that infectious microbes will present ever-greater economic and societal threats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bebber et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chaloner et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cook et al., 2021</xref>). In order to curate relevant publications into PHI-base (version 4), professional curators have, since 2011, entered 81 different data types into a text file (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Urban et al., 2017</xref>). However, increasing publication numbers and data complexity required more robust curation procedures and greater involvement from publication authors.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Increase of molecular pathogen-host interaction publications and gene-phenotype information during the last 35 years curated in the Pathogen–Host Interactions database (PHI-base).</title><p>Gray bars show the number of publications in the Web of Science Core Collection database retrieved with search terms ‘(fung* or yeast) and (gene or factor) and (pathogenicity or virulen* or avirulence gene*).’ Black vertical bars show the number of articles retrieved from PubMed (searching on title and abstract). White and black triangles show the number of curated plant and animal pathogen genes, respectively.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-84658-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We were unable to locate any curation frameworks or tools capable of capturing the interspecies interactions required for PHI-base. PomBase, the fission yeast (<italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>) database developed Canto, a web-based tool supporting curation by both professional biocurators and publication authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rutherford et al., 2014</xref>). Canto already had support for annotating genes from multiple species in the same curation session, but it could not support annotation of the interactions between species, nor the annotation of genes from naturally occurring strains. We extended and customized Canto to support the annotation of multiple strains of multiple species, and the modeling and annotation of interspecies interactions between pathogens and hosts, to create a new tool: PHI-Canto (the Pathogen–Host Interaction Community Annotation Tool). Likewise, there were no existing biomedical ontologies that could accurately describe pathogen–host interaction phenotypes at the depth and breadth required for PHI-base. Infectious disease formation depends on a series of complex and dynamic interactions between pathogenic species and their potential hosts, and also requires the correct biotic and/or abiotic environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Scholthof, 2007</xref>), as illustrated by the concept of the ‘disease triangle’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). All these interrelated factors must be recorded in order to sufficiently describe a pathogen–host interaction.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of pathogen–host interactions.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The disease triangle illustrates the requirement for the correct abiotic and biotic environmental conditions to ensure disease when an adapted pathogen encounters a suitable host. (<bold>b</bold>) A non-gene-for-gene genetic relationship where compatible interactions result in disease on all host genotypes (depicted as genotypes 1–4), but the extent of disease formation is influenced to a greater or lesser extent by the presence or absence of a single pathogen virulence gene product X. In host genotypes 1 and 3, the pathogen gene product X is the least required for disease formation. The size of each black oval in each of the eight genetic interactions indicates the severity of the disease phenotype observed, with a larger oval indicating greater severity. (<bold>c</bold>) A gene-for-gene genetic relationship. In this genetic system, considerable specificity is observed, which is based on the direct or indirect interaction of a pathogen avirulence (<italic>Avr</italic>) effector gene product with a host resistance (<italic>R</italic>) gene product to determine specific recognition (an incompatible interaction), which is typically observed in biotrophic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jones and Dangl, 2006</xref>). In one scenario, the product of the <italic>Avr</italic> effector gene binds to the product of the <italic>R</italic> gene (a receptor) to activate host resistance mechanisms. In another scenario, the product of the <italic>Avr</italic> effector gene binds to an essential host target which is guarded by the product of the <italic>R</italic> gene (a receptor). Once <italic>Avr</italic> effector binding is detected, host resistance mechanisms are activated. The absence of the <italic>Avr</italic> effector product or the absence of the <italic>R</italic> gene product leads to susceptibility (a compatible interaction). The small black dot indicates no disease formation, and the large black oval indicates full disease formation. (<bold>d</bold>) An inverse gene-for-gene genetic relationship. Again, considerable specificity is observed based on the interaction of a pathogen necrotrophic effector (<italic>NE</italic>) with a host susceptibility (<italic>S</italic>) target to determine specific recognition.

Leading on from these advances, we discuss how the overall curation framework described herein, the concept of annotating metagenotypes, and ongoing generic ontology development, is a suitable approach for adoption and use by a wide range of research communities in the life sciences focused on different types of interspecies interactions occurring within or across kingdoms in different environments and at multiple (micro to macro) scales.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Enabling multispecies curation with UniProtKB accessions</title><p>In any curation context, stable identifiers are required for annotated entities. The UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bateman et al., 2021</xref>) is universally recognized, provides broad taxonomic protein coverage, and manually curates standard nomenclature across protein families. Protein sequences are both manually and computationally annotated in UniProtKB, providing a wealth of data on catalytic activities, protein structures, and protein–protein interactions, Gene Ontology (GO) annotations, and links to PHI-base phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashburner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carbon et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Urban et al., 2022</xref>). To improve interoperability with other resources, we used UniProtKB accession numbers for retrieving protein entities, gene names, and species information for display in PHI-Canto. PHI-Canto accesses the UniProtKB API to automatically retrieve the entities and their associated data.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Developing the metagenotype to capture interspecies interactions</title><p>To enable the annotation of interspecies interactions, we developed the concept of a ‘metagenotype,’ which represents the combination of a pathogen genotype and a host genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). A metagenotype is created after the individual genotypes from both species are created. Each metagenotype can be annotated with pathogen–host interaction phenotypes to capture changes in pathogenicity (caused by alterations to the pathogen) and changes in virulence (caused by alterations to the host and/or the pathogen). Pathogenicity is a property of the pathogen that describes the ability of the pathogen to cause an infectious disease in another organism. When a pathogenic organism causes disease, the severity of the disease that occurs is referred to as ‘virulence’ and this can also be dependent upon the host organism. Metagenotypes must always include at least one named pathogen gene with a genotype of interest, but need not include a host gene if none is referenced in a given experiment: instead, the wild-type host species and strain may be used for the host part of the metagenotype.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Conceptual model showing the relationship between metagenotypes, genotypes, and annotations.</title><p>The curator selects a pathogen genotype and a host genotype to combine into a metagenotype.

Each of these biological features has a corresponding set of annotation types. The relation between biological features, annotation types, and the values that can be used for annotation are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. To capture additional biologically relevant information associated with an annotation, curators use the concept of annotation extensions (which include Gene Ontology annotations described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huntley et al., 2014</xref>) to extend the primary annotation. For Canto and PHI-Canto, the meaning of ‘annotation extension’ was broadened to capture additional properties related to the annotation, such as the metagenotype used as an experimental control. The aforementioned additional properties are simply referred to as ‘annotation extensions (AEs)’ in this study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Descriptions of the new AEs for PHI-Canto and the core collection of AEs from Canto are available in the PHI-Canto user documentation (see the Code availability section).</p><table-wrap id="table1"

A metagenotype is created to connect the genotypes of both species and is annotated with a phenotype term. These experiments are curated following the ‘pathogen–host interaction phenotype’ workflow, including any relevant AEs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). This two-step curation process is illustrated by PMID:29020037 curation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, Appendix 1 and Appendix 2) where the <italic>GT2</italic> gene is deleted from the fungal plant pathogen <italic>Zymoseptoria tritici</italic> and inoculated onto wheat plants; the observed phenotype ‘absence of pathogen-associated host lesions’ (PHIPO:0000481) is annotated to the metagenotype; and the AE for ‘infective ability’ is annotated with ‘loss of pathogenicity’ compared to the unaltered pathogen.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Curating pathogen effector experiments</title><p>A pathogen effector is defined as an entity transferred between the pathogen and the host that is known or suspected to be responsible for either activating or suppressing a host process commonly involved in defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Houterman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jones and Dangl, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). To curate an effector experiment, a metagenotype is created and annotated with a phenotype term. To indicate that the pathogen gene functions as an effector, it is necessary to make a concurrent gene annotation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) with the GO biological process term ‘effector-mediated modulation of host process’ (GO:0140418) or an appropriate descendant term. This GO term (GO:0140418) and its descendant terms were created in collaboration with the Gene Ontology Consortium (GOC) and are used for pathogen effectors in PHI-base (version 5) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Reported activities of pathogen effectors can also be curated with GO molecular function terms. An example of curation of a pathogen effector experiment is illustrated using PMID:31804478 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> and Appendix 1) where the pathogen effector Pst_12806 from <italic>Puccinia striiformis</italic> suppresses pattern-triggered immunity in a tobacco leaf model. Here, the metagenotype is annotated with the phenotype ‘decreased level of host defense-induced callose deposition’ (PHIPO:0001015) and the effector is annotated with ‘effector-mediated suppression of host pattern-triggered immunity’ (GO:0052034). A further experiment demonstrated that the pathogen effector protein was able to bind to the natural host (wheat) protein PetC and inhibit its enzyme activity, resulting in a GO molecular function annotation ‘enzyme inhibitor activity’ (GO:0004857) for Pst_12806, with PetC captured as the target protein (see Appendix 1).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Curating experiments with a gene-for-gene relationship</title><p>For a gene-for-gene pathogen–host interaction type, the ‘gene-for-gene phenotype’ metagenotype workflow is followed (a gene-for-gene interaction is when a known genetic interaction is conferred by a specific pathogen avirulence gene product and its cognate host resistance gene product) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c and d</xref>, further described in the figure legend <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Flor, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jones and Dangl, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kanyuka et al., 2022</xref>). The metagenotypes and phenotype annotations are made in the same way as the standard ‘pathogen–host interaction phenotype’ workflow, but with different supporting data. A new AE was created to indicate the following three components of the interaction: (i) the compatibility of the interaction, (ii) the functional status of the pathogen gene, and (iii) the functional status of the host gene. An example of an annotation for a biotrophic pathogen gene-for-gene interaction has been illustrated with PMID:20601497 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> and Appendix 1). Inverse gene-for-gene relationships occur with necrotrophic pathogens, where the pathogen necrotrophic effector interacts with a gene product from the corresponding host susceptibility locus and activates a host response that benefits the pathogen (a compatible interaction). If the necrotrophic effector cannot interact with the host target, then no disease occurs (an incompatible interaction) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Breen et al., 2016</xref>). An example of an inverse gene-for-gene interaction using the appropriate AEs is illustrated with PMID:22241993 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> and Appendix 1).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Curating an experiment with a single species genotype in the presence or absence of a chemical</title><p>Single species genotypes (pathogen or host) can also be annotated with phenotypes following the ‘single species phenotype’ workflow (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

For example, the ‘infective ability’ AE can be used to annotate the following subset of high-level terms: ‘loss of pathogenicity,’ ‘unaffected pathogenicity,’ ‘reduced virulence,’ ‘increased virulence,’ and ‘loss of mutualism’ (formerly ‘enhanced antagonism’). The mapping between the nine high-level terms and the PHI-Canto curation process is further described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Resolving additional problems with curating complex pathogen–host interactions</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref> shows a selection of the problems encountered during the development of PHI-Canto and the solutions we identified: for example, recording the delivery mechanism used within the pathogen–host interaction experiment. New experimental condition terms were developed with a prefix of ‘delivery mechanism’: for example, ‘delivery mechanism: agrobacterium,’ ‘delivery mechanism: heterologous organism,’ and ‘delivery mechanism: pathogen inoculation.’ Another issue encountered was how to record a physical interaction between two proteins from different species, especially for the curation of pathogen effectors and their discovered first host targets. This was resolved by adapting the existing Canto module for curating physical interactions to support two different species.</p></sec><sec id="s2-11"><title>Development of the Pathogen–Host Interaction Phenotype Ontology and additional data lists</title><p>To support the annotation of phenotypes in PHI-Canto, PHIPO was developed. PHIPO is a species-neutral phenotype ontology that describes a broad range of pathogen–host interaction phenotypes. Terms in PHIPO were developed following a pre-compositional approach, where the term names and semantics were composed from existing terms from other ontologies, in order to make the curation process easier. For example, the curator annotates 'resistance to penicillin' (PHIPO:0000692) instead of annotating ‘increased resistance to chemical’ (PHIPO:0000022) and ‘penicillin’ (CHEBI:17334) separately. Terms in PHIPO have logical definitions that follow design patterns from the uPheno ontology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shefchek et al., 2020</xref>), and mapping PHIPO terms to the uPheno patterns is an ongoing effort. These logical definitions provide relations between phenotypes in PHIPO and terms in other ontologies, such as PATO, GO, and ChEBI. PHIPO is available in OWL and OBO formats from the OBO Foundry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jackson et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>PHI-Canto uses additional controlled vocabularies derived from data in PHI-base. To enable PHI-Canto to distinguish between pathogen and host organisms, we extracted a list of &gt;250 pathogen species and &gt;200 host species from PHI-base (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). A curated list of strain names and their synonyms for the species currently curated in PHI-base was also developed for use in PHI-Canto (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4 supp5">Supplementary files 4 and 5</xref>). PHI-base uses ‘strain’ as a grouping term for natural pathogen isolates, host cultivars, and landraces, all of which are included in the curated list. The curation of pathogen strain designations was motivated by the NCBI Taxonomy’s decision to discontinue the assignment of strain-level taxonomic identifiers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Federhen et al., 2014</xref>) and a lack of standardized nomenclature for natural isolates of non-model species. New strain designations can be requested by curators and are reviewed by an expert prior to inclusion to ensure that each describes a novel strain designation rather than a new synonym for an existing strain.</p><p>Annotations in PHI-Canto include experimental evidence, which is specified by a term from a subset of the Evidence &amp; Conclusion Ontology (ECO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Giglio et al., 2019</xref>). Experimental evidence codes specific to pathogen–host interaction experiments have been developed and submitted to ECO. Phenotype annotations also include experimental conditions that are relevant to the experiment being curated, which are sourced from the PHI-base Experimental Conditions Ontology (PHI-ECO).</p><p>PHI-Canto includes a ‘disease name’ annotation type (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) for annotating the name of the disease caused by an interaction between the pathogen and host specified in a wild-type metagenotype (this annotation type is described in the PHI-Canto user documentation and in Appendix 2). Diseases are specified by a controlled vocabulary of disease names (called PHIDO), which was derived from disease names curated in previous versions of PHI-base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Urban et al., 2022</xref>). PHIDO was developed as a placeholder to allow disease names to be annotated on a wide variety of pathogen interactions, including those on plant, human, animal, and invertebrate hosts, especially where such diseases were not described in any existing ontology.</p></sec><sec id="s2-12"><title>Summary of the PHI-Canto curation process</title><p>The PHI-Canto curation process is outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, the PHI-Canto user documentation, a detailed worked example provided in Appendix 2 and curation tutorials on the PHI-base YouTube channel (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.youtube.com/@PHI-base">https://www.youtube.com/@PHI-base</ext-link>), under the playlist ‘PHI-Canto tutorial videos.’ Each curation session is associated with one publication (using its PubMed identifier). One or more curators can collaborate on curating the same publication. An instructional email is sent by PHI-Canto to curators when they begin a new curation session, and PHI-base provides further guidelines on what information is needed to curate a publication in PHI-Canto (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) and how to identify UniProtKB accession numbers from reference proteomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Pathogen–Host Interaction Community Annotation Tool (PHI-Canto) curation workflow diagram.</title><p>This diagram shows the curation workflow from the start of a curation session to its submission. The PubMed ID of the publication to be curated is entered and the title is automatically retrieved. The curator enters their name, email address, and ORCID iD. On the species and genes page, the experimental pathogen and host genes are entered using UniProtKB accession numbers, and for experiments where a mutant pathogen genotype is assayed on a wild-type host with no specified genes, there is the option to select the host species from an autocomplete menu. Information on the specific experimental strains used for each species is entered. After entering this initial information, the curator follows one of three distinct workflows depending on the biological feature the user wants to annotate (metagenotype, genotype, or gene annotation type). Except for genes, biological features are created by composing less complex features: genotypes from alleles (generated in the pathogen or host genotype management pages), and metagenotypes from genotypes (generated in the metagenotype management page). Biological features are annotated with terms from a controlled vocabulary (usually an ontology), plus additional information that varies based on the annotation type. The curator has the option to generate further annotations after creating one, but this iterative process is not represented in the diagram for the sake of brevity. After all annotations have been made, the session is submitted into the Pathogen–Host Interactions database (PHI-base) version 5. * Note that the 'Ontology annotation' group covers multiple annotation types, all of which annotate biological features with terms from an ontology or controlled vocabulary.

Curators can use a term suggestion feature to suggest new terms for any controlled vocabulary used by PHI-Canto, and experimental conditions can be entered as free text if no suitable condition is found in PHI-ECO. Subsequently, new condition suggestions are reviewed and approved by expert curators. The curation session can be saved and paused at various stages during the curation process.

Data curated in PHI-Canto, following expert review, is then shared with ELIXIR data resources such as UniProtKB, Ensembl Genomes, FungiDB, and KnetMiner, and provided on request to other databases (FgMutantDB, GloBI).

PHI-base is an example of a freely available, manually curated database, which has been curating literature using professional curators since 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Winnenburg et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Here, we have described the development of PHI-Canto to allow the curation of the interspecies pathogen–host interaction literature by professional curators and publication authors. This curated data is then made available on the new gene-centric version 5 of PHI-base, where all information (i.e. new and existing) on a single gene from several publications is presented on a single page, with links to external resources providing information on interacting genes, proteins, and other entities.</p><p>Several adaptations to the original single-species community annotation tool, Canto (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rutherford et al., 2014</xref>), were required to convert this tool for interspecies use. Notably, the need to annotate an interaction involving two different organisms necessitated the development of a novel concept, the ‘metagenotype’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), in order to record a combined experimental genotype involving both a pathogen and a host. This is, to our knowledge, the first example of such an approach to interspecies interaction curation.</p><p>Curation of pathogen–host interactions in PHI-Canto also necessitated the development of a new phenotype ontology (PHIPO) to annotate pathogen–host interaction phenotypes in sufficient detail across the broad range of host species that were curated in PHI-base (<italic>n</italic>=234 in version 4.14 of PHI-base). The functional annotation of genes involved in interspecies interactions is a complex and challenging task, requiring ongoing modifications to the Gene Ontology and occasional major refactoring to deprecate legacy terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carbon et al., 2021</xref>). PHIPO development and maintenance will also be an ongoing task, with both authors and professional curators requesting new terms and edits to existing terms and the ontology structure. Maintenance will be made more sustainable by the incorporation of logical definitions that are aligned across phenotype ontologies in collaboration with the uPheno project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shefchek et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>To improve the efficiency of the curation process, we are suggesting that authors follow an author checklist during manuscript preparation (Appendix 3). This will improve the presentation of key information (e.g. species names, gene identifiers, etc.) in published manuscripts, thus enabling more efficient and comprehensive curation that is human- and machine-readable. The annotation procedures described here using PHI-Canto can be used to extract data buried in small-scale publications and increase the accessibility of the curated article to a wider range of potential users, for example, computational biologists, thereby improving the FAIR status of the data. The current data in PHI-base has been obtained from &gt;200 journals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) and, therefore, represents highly fragmented knowledge which is exceptionally difficult to use by professionals in other disciplines. The feasibility of scalable community curation with Canto is evidenced by PomBase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lock et al., 2020</xref>), where Canto <italic>S. pombe</italic> annotations from over 1000 publications are provided by publication authors, with the data made available within 24 hr of review (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://curation.pombase.org/pombe/stats/annotation">https://curation.pombase.org/pombe/stats/annotation</ext-link>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Top 25 Journals in the Pathogen–Host Interactions database (PHI-base).</title><p>Bar chart showing the top 25 journals by number of publications curated in PHI-base, as of version 4.13 (published May 9, 2022). Publication counts were generated by extracting every unique PubMed identifier (PMID) from PHI-base, then using the Entrez Programming Utilities (E-Utilities) to retrieve the journal name for each PMID, and finally summing the count of journal names. The total number of journals in version 4.13 of PHI-base was 291.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-84658-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>With regard to our focus on manual curation, we recognize that great progress has been made with machine learning (ML) approaches in recent times. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wood et al., 2022</xref> note that the data being curated from publications are ‘categorical, highly complex, and with hundreds of thousands of heterogeneous classes, often not explicitly labeled.’ There are no published examples of ML approaches outperforming an expert curator in accuracy, which is paramount in the medical field. However, curation by experts could provide a highly reliable corpus that could be used for training ML systems. Our aspiration is that ML and expert curators can collaborate in a virtuous cycle whereby expert curators continually review and refine the ML models, while the manual work of finding publications and entity recognition is handled by the ML system.</p><p>Our future intentions are twofold: first, a graph-based representation of the data will be enabled by integration with knowledge network generation tools, such as Knetminer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hassani-Pak et al., 2021</xref>), where subgraphs of the knowledge graph could be embedded into each gene-centric page on the PHI-base 5 website. Second, within PHI-Canto, we intend to address the issues associated with maximizing the inherent value of the natural sequence variation between species strains, and the associated altered phenotypic outcomes observed at multiple scales, in different types of interactions and/or environments. PHI-base already contains information on numerous species with multiple experimental strains, and natural sequence variation between strains can result in alterations at the genome level that affect the subsequently observed phenotypes. Strain-specific sequence variation is not captured in the reference proteomes stored by UniProt, even though accession numbers from these proteomes are often used in PHI-Canto. Currently, when a curator enters a gene with a taxonomic identifier below the species rank, PHI-Canto maps the identifier to the corresponding identifier at the species rank (thus removing any strain details from the organism name), and the curator specifies a strain to differentiate gene variants in naturally occurring strains. However, this does not change the taxonomic identifier linked to the UniProtKB accession number (nor its sequence), so the potential for inaccuracy remains. To mitigate this, the future plan is to record the strain-specific sequence of the gene using an accession number from a database from the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arita et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The release of PHI-Canto to the community will occur gradually through various routes. Community curation will be promoted by working with journals to capture the publication data at the source, at the point of manuscript acceptance. We will also target specific research communities (e.g. those working on a particular pathogen and/or research topic) by inviting authors to curate their own publications. Authors may contact us directly to request support while curating their publications in PHI-Canto.</p><p>PHI-Canto, PHI-base, and PHIPO were devised and built over the past seven years to serve the research needs of a specific international research community interested in exploring the wide diversity of common and species-specific mechanisms underlying pathogen attack and host defense in plants, animals, humans, and other host organisms caused by fungi, protists and bacteria. However, it should be noted that the underlying developments to Canto’s data model – especially the concept of annotating metagenotypes – could be of use to communities focused on different types of interspecies interactions. Possible future uses of the PHI-Canto schema could include insect–plant interactions (both beneficial and detrimental), endosymbiotic relationships such as mycorrhiza–plant rhizosphere interactions, nodulating bacteria–plant rhizosphere interactions, fungi–fungi interactions, plant–plant interactions or bacteria–insect interactions, and non-pathogenic relationships in natural environments such as bulk soil, rhizosphere, phyllosphere, air, freshwater, estuarine water or seawater, and human–animal, animal–bird, human–insect, animal–insect, bird–insect interactions in various anatomical locations (e.g. gut, lung, and skin). The schema could also be extended to situations where phenotype–genotype relations have been established for predator–prey relationships or where there is competition in herbivore–herbivore, predator–predator or prey–prey relationships in the air, on land, or in the water. Finally, the schema could be used to explore strain-to-strain interactions within a species when different biological properties have been noted. Customizing Canto to use other ontologies and controlled vocabularies is as simple as editing a configuration file, as shown in Source code 1.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Changes to the Canto data model and configuration</title><p>PHI-Canto stores its data in a series of relational databases using the SQLite database engine. A primary database stores data shared across all curation sessions, and each curation session also has its own database to store data related to a single publication (such as genes, genotypes, metagenotypes, etc.). PHI-Canto can export its data as a JSON file or in more specialized formats, for example, the GO Annotation File (GAF) format.</p><p>To implement PHI-Canto several new entities were added to the Canto data model in order to support pathogen–host curation, as well as new configuration options (the new entities are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). These entities were ‘strain,’ ‘metagenotype,’ and ‘metagenotype annotation.’ The complete data model for PHI-Canto is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">3</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Pathogen and host roles</title><p>Genotype entities in PHI-Canto’s data model were extended with an attribute indicating their status as a pathogen genotype or a host genotype. Genotypes inherit their status (as pathogen or host) from the organism, which in turn is classified as a pathogen or host based on a configuration file that contains the NCBI Taxonomy ID (taxid) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schoch et al., 2020</xref>) of each host species in PHI-base. Only host taxids need to be specified since PHI-Canto defaults to classifying a species as a pathogen if its taxid is not found in the configuration file.</p><p>PHI-Canto also loads lists of pathogen and host species that specify the scientific name, taxid, and common name (if any) of each species. These species lists are used to specify which host species can be added as a component of the metagenotype in the absence of a specific studied gene, and to override the scientific name provided by UniProtKB in favor of the name used by a scientific community studying the species (for example, to control whether the anamorph or teleomorph name of a fungal species is displayed in PHI-Canto’s user interface).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Metagenotype implementation</title><p>Metagenotypes were implemented by adding a ‘metagenotype’ entity to PHI-Canto’s data model. The metagenotype is the composition of two genotype entities. We also changed the data model to allow annotations to be related to metagenotypes (previously, only genes and genotypes could be related to annotations).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Strain implementation</title><p>Support for strain curation was implemented by adding a ‘strain’ entity to PHI-Canto’s data model. Strains are related to an organism entity and its related genotype entities. In the user interface, PHI-Canto uses the taxid of the organism to filter an autocomplete system, such that only the strains of the specified organism are suggested. The autocomplete system can also use synonyms in the strain list to suggest a strain based on its synonymous names. Unknown strains are represented by a preset value of ‘Unknown strain.’</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Ontologies</title><p>PHIPO was developed using the Protégé ontology editor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Musen and Team, 2015</xref>). PHIPO uses OBO namespaces to allow PHI-Canto to filter the terms in the ontology by annotation type, ensuring that genotypes are annotated with single-species phenotypes and metagenotypes with pathogen–host interaction phenotypes.</p><p>PHI-ECO was also developed using Protégé, starting from a list of experimental conditions originally developed by PomBase. PHIDO was initially derived from a list of diseases already curated in PHI-base and is now maintained as a flat file that is converted into an OBO file using ROBOT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jackson et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Data availability</title><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>Pathogen–Host Interaction Phenotype Ontology: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/phipo.owl">http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/phipo.owl</ext-link>.</p></list-item><list-item><p>PHI-base: Experimental Conditions Ontology: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cuzick and Seager, 2022a</xref>) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/PHI-base/phi-eco">https://github.com/PHI-base/phi-eco</ext-link>.</p></list-item><list-item><p>PHIDO: the controlled vocabulary of disease names: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cuzick and Seager, 2022b</xref>) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/PHI-base/phido">https://github.com/PHI-base/phido</ext-link>.</p></list-item><list-item><p>PHIPO Extension Ontology for gene-for-gene phenotypes: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cuzick and Seager, 2022c</xref>) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/PHI-base/phipo_ext">https://github.com/PHI-base/phipo_ext</ext-link>.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Location of species and strain lists used by PHI-Canto: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cuzick et al., 2022d</xref>) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/PHI-base/data">https://github.com/PHI-base/data</ext-link>.</p></list-item><list-item><p>PHI-Canto approved curation sessions (December 2022): <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7428788">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7428788</ext-link>.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Code availability</title><p>PHI-Canto’s source code is available on GitHub, at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/PHI-base/canto">https://github.com/PHI-base/canto</ext-link>, (copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:a196ff9bb0ef8b411b04983179ec29289b28d3ca;origin=https://github.com/PHI-base/canto;visit=swh:1:snp:7a5738f152a6029f6b8e6103500d65b0b30594e8;anchor=swh:1:rev:dd310334974d9471c1916c0ac080550bfd153707">swh:1:rev:dd310334974d9471c1916c0ac080550bfd153707</ext-link>).

Chris Stephens and Ana Machado-Wood (both formerly of Rothamsted Research) for completing the trial curation of articles into beta versions of PHI-Canto and providing invaluable feedback and suggestions for further improvements. We thank Dr. Melina Velasquez (based at Rothamsted Research) for preparing the PHI-Canto tutorial videos. The Molecular Connections team based in Bangalore India while developing the PHI-base 5 website, provided useful feedback on data interoperability between PHI-Canto and the new gene-centric version of PHI-base. PHI-base is funded by the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) Grants BB/S020020/1 and BB/S020098/1 and previously by the BBSRC National Capability Grant (2012–2017). Rothamsted authors MU and KHK receive additional BBSRC grant-aided support as part of the Institute Strategic Programme (ISP) Designing Future Wheat Grant (BB/P016855/1) and Delivering Sustainable Wheat (DSW) (BB/X011003/1). In addition, author AC receives BBSRC ISP DSW (BB/X011003/1) support and authors AC and JS receive BBSRC ISP Growing Health (BB/X010953/1) support. This work was conducted using the Protégé resource, which is supported by grant GM10331601 from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the United States National Institutes of Health.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Meredith Schuman as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Lorena Etcheverry (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Specify where the contributions go, how curation is done, and how they are made available.</p><p>2. Describe or reference the complete data model behind annotations, namely: concepts, methods, eventual algorithms, as well as formats for information storage and retrieval.</p><p>3. Expand on how data display and interoperability are implemented, for example, to link related information from new and existing publications. Address the possible use of graph representation to link complex information. (See more detailed comments from Reviewers 2 and 3.)</p><p>4. Explain why PHIDO has been generated rather than using existing disease terminologies (such as Mondo or DO).</p><p>5. The authors should briefly comment on the possible extension of this approach beyond pathogen-host interactions, which could increase the broader relevance of the study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Many readers may wrongly think they will find tones of centralized information about, e.g. their present-day favorite gene. This does not seem to be the case, leading to a related question: where do the contributed curations go and how are they made available? Is there a final control from within the resource team to filter wrong curations due to bad procedures, or even directly fraudulent data treatments?</p><p>On the model extension side, feeding on new interactions proposed by users: it is not clear what kind of follow-up would be made in order to encompass the usage with appropriate growth and amelioration. Are there plans for this? Also, given that most authors are in the industry, a short statement about conflicts of interest would be desirable. Related to this, it is not clear to the reader if new, useful added curations obtained by a user, will be added to the resource and made publicly available. In an ideal world, the ten examples forming the basis of the resource should grow to thousands. I might be missing something, though.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Given my area of expertise, I am not in a position to assess the relevance of the work from a biological point of view. However, I feel that some points relating to data management and problem modeling deserve some comment.</p><p>In particular, there is no mention of the complete data model of each annotation or the formats in which this information is stored. This omission is probably because this is part of the Canto project. Still, to make this publication self-contained, it would be desirable to include this information or at least a reference to it, especially to measure the changes required.</p><p>Something that would also improve the work is more detail on how to use or visualize the data generated. Although there are a few brief lines in the section on &quot;Display and interoperability of data&quot;, Figure 4 raises the question of how the system will behave in cases where there are already curated publications that refer to the pathogens and hosts of the new publication to be curated. It would be desirable that they are not treated in isolation but that the system allows them to be linked and then navigated in the network resulting from curating a set of publications.</p><p>Finally, in the introduction to the paper, the authors make the reckless assertion that manual biocuration is the only way to reliably represent information about functions and phenotypes. I would question this assertion given the current state of the art in LNP tools. While it is likely that, in many cases, automated annotation or curation using these techniques will not yield such accurate results, I believe it would be desirable to explore these techniques. It is also possible to think of hybrid human-in-the-loop systems where automatic techniques assist experts and simplify repetitive tasks. I believe that the paper should at least include a discussion of these issues.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Here are some specific points of confusion, questions, or suggestions for improvement:</p><p>Page 5 of the manuscript (page 6 of the full pdf):</p><p>– Lines 103-105 talk about changes in pathogenicity and virulence. It would be useful to readers to have a brief explanation of how these differ from each other and why one only applies to the pathogen while the other can apply to either the host or the pathogen.</p><p>– bottom of the page talks about &quot;annotation types&quot;. The term &quot;annotation type&quot; seems to be used in a way that allows confusion with the entity being annotated. I believe that the authors intend to say that gene, genotype, and metagenotype are types of biological features (to use their term) that are annotated within PHI-Canto, each with its own set of accompanying annotation types as outlined in Table 1. If that is the correct interpretation, then I suggest modifying the text to make this more explicit with a particular focus on the sentence on lines 111-113.</p><p>Page 6 of the manuscript</p><p>Line 114 – &quot;curators use annotation extensions&quot; is referenced to a GOA paper. Perhaps then the sentence should specify that GO annotation curators use annotation extensions or indicate the reference is an example of this practice, using &quot;e.g.&quot; perhaps.</p><p>Page 11 of the manuscript</p><p>Last paragraph – the text mentions that ECO terms are used to capture evidence. However, the annotation examples in Appendix 1 appear to use a combination of GO evidence codes and terms/phrases that are related to ECO term names. If ECO is being used, why not use the ECO term ids and/or term names across the board?</p><p>Page 12 of the manuscript</p><p>Top of page – what is the relationship between PHIDO and other existing disease ontologies such as Mondo or DO?</p><p>Figure 5</p><p>The NCBI taxonomy is listed in the databases section, however, it is more of a cv – it's certainly not a database like UniProtKB or PHI-base are. The Evidence and Conclusion Ontology is mentioned in the text but is not in the list of OBO Ontologies. The curated list of strains (line 247, page 11) is not shown as a PHI-base CV, although perhaps the list of strains is stored in the form of the mapping file that is shown in the figure. Is that the case? If so, then perhaps rename that box to make that more clear.</p><p>Table 1</p><p>– In the gene section, GO annotation type – are the host species and symbiont species extensions meant to indicate the interacting species? Or the species from which the gene comes? I'm assuming it means the interacting species, but this could be made more explicit.</p><p>– In the genotype section under &quot;single species phenotype&quot; should it not say &quot;(Pathogen phenotype or Host phenotype)&quot; rather than &quot;and&quot;?</p><p>Appendix 1</p><p>– In general, I find the header/spacing organization made it difficult to follow where one part ended and the next began. Perhaps giving letters to the sections starting &quot;If you have…&quot; such that there would be Section 1A, 1B, etc. might help. Also perhaps the use of some indentation so that separate sections referring to each publication will be easier to see.</p><p>– Section 1, the section on &quot;If you have a metagenotype phenotype recording &quot;a pathogen effector' (corresponds to footnote 5 in table 2)&quot; – annotations for PMID:31804478: I'm confused why in the gene level GO process annotations that the gene is annotated to the specific child GO:0052034 'effector-mediated suppression of host pattern-triggered immunity', however, when the 'protein binding' and 'enzyme inhibitor activity' GO function annotations are made, the part_of annotation extension is to a grandparent of GO:0052034 that is GO:0140590 'effector-mediated suppression of host defenses. I would have thought that the part_of annotations would have been to GO:0052034. Why is this not the case?</p><p>Table 1 and Appendix 1 – both refer to the example paper involving mutualism. By definition, in a mutualist relationship, neither partner is a pathogen as disease is not caused. I realize this issue is likely beyond the scope of this paper to discuss, but I wonder about the inclusion of this annotation in the PHI resource since it does not involve a pathogen. Is it because the species has been seen to be a pathogen in other cases? Or is it that PHI includes some non-pathogenic interactions as well? If the first case, it brings to bear how to define something as a pathogen when (as is true for almost all organisms that cause disease in another organism) it only causes disease in some situations and not others (which is of course relevant to the host-pathogen-environment disease triangle mentioned in the text and Figure 1). If it is the second case, might it make sense to think about the scope of the resource as related to its name? Since mechanisms of colonization are often shared between pathogens and beneficial commensals alike, including annotations for symbionts beyond known pathogens would be useful. However, if these are regularly included, more prominent statements to that effect made on the PHI website and in publications would inform users.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84658.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

(2022; doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkab1037), which includes a detailed explanation and screenshots of the new gene-centric web display.</p><p>Point – How curation is done.</p><p>The approach taken to article curation is fully described in Appendix 2, where the reader is guided through a step-by-step worked example for PHI-Canto for the fully curated article by King et al. (2017), ‘A conserved fungal glycosyltransferase facilitates pathogenesis of plants by enabling hyphal growth on solid surfaces (PMID:29020037)’. In addition, we have published ten tutorial videos on YouTube that cover different aspects of the PHI-Canto curation process, plus three introductory videos on what PHI-base is, the criteria for selecting curatable publications into PHI-base, and the value of curating your publications into PHI-base. These videos are available at https://www.youtube.com/@PHI-base.</p><p>In addition to the above, the following detailed author response highlights the areas in the manuscript already covering the requested information and the newly added link to the YouTube channel videos on PHI-Canto and PHI-base.</p><p>In the section “Display and interoperability of data” the following original text explains where the contributions go:</p><p>“All data curated in PHI-Canto will be displayed in PHI-base version 5, introduced in (Urban et al., 2022).”</p><p>This text has now been modified for further clarification.</p><p>“All data curated in PHI-Canto will be displayed in the new gene-centric version 5 of PHI-base, introduced in Urban et al., 2022.”</p><p>This point is further reinforced in the Figure 4 legend with original text:</p><p>“After all annotations have been made, the session is submitted to PHI-base.”</p><p>Which has now been amended to:</p><p>“After all annotations have been made, the session is submitted into PHI-base version 5.”</p><p>In the worked curation example in Appendix 2 there are already instructions on how to view the example annotations on our new PHI-base gene-centric display pages:</p><p>“The information curated from this publication is available on the new gene centric PHI-base 5 website (http://phi5.phi-base.org, search for PHIG:308 and PHIG:307).”</p><p>In the Introduction we introduce PHI-base, its URL and state how the curated data is freely available for use (note: we have since added the additional reference for Urban et al., 2020):</p><p>“The pathogen–host interaction research communities are an example of a domain of the biological sciences exhibiting a literature deluge (Figure 1). The Pathogen–Host Interactions Database, PHI-base (phi-base.org), is an open-access FAIR biological database containing data on bacterial, fungal and protist genes proven to affect (or not to affect) the outcome of pathogen–host interactions (Rodriguez-Iglesias et al., 2016; Urban et al., 2020; Urban et al., 2022).”</p><p>Regarding how curation is done, we have a section titled “Summary of the PHI-Canto curation process” which thoroughly explains how to do curation as stated in the opening sentence of the original text:</p><p>“The PHI-Canto curation process is outlined in Figure 4, Figure 4 —figure supplement 1, the PHI-Canto user documentation and a detailed worked example is provided in Appendix 2.”</p><p>This text has further been updated in the revised manuscript to include information on the location of PHI-Canto video training tutorials:</p><p>“The PHI-Canto curation process is outlined in Figure 4, Figure 4 —figure supplement 1, the PHI-Canto user documentation, a detailed worked example provided in Appendix 2 and curation tutorials on the PHI-base YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/@PHI-base), under the playlist ‘PHI-Canto tutorial videos’.<italic>”</italic></p><p>The text at the end of this section states:</p><p>“Once the curation process is complete, the curator submits the session for review by a nominated species expert.”</p><p>This step will enable quality control of curated data before it is publicly available in PHI-base (which we also noted in Urban et al. 2022).</p><p>A link to our comprehensive PHI-Canto user documentation is also provided in the “Code availability” section:</p><p>“The source code for PHI-Canto’s user documentation is available on GitHub, at https://github.com/PHI-base/canto-docs.

This data is freely available for searches, for use and/or for downloading into other applications. Prior to display in PHI-base the curated data is checked by species experts. Extensive PHI-Canto training materials are available.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Describe or reference the complete data model behind annotations, namely: concepts, methods, eventual algorithms, as well as formats for information storage and retrieval.</p></disp-quote><p>We requested feedback from the editor regarding the above revision, as we felt some of the information requested (e.g. ‘eventual algorithms’) was not requested in the written communication by the reviewers and was not relevant. The editor clarified that we should “clearly explain the data models and what is behind them including any algorithms”, but that we should inform them if “any of the examples we listed under data model clarification are not relevant”. We have further described our data model and its related topics below.</p><p>Point – entity-relationship models.</p><p>We have included a basic entity–relationship model in Figure 3 – supplement 1 illustrating the new entities that were created for PHI-Canto. We have now also included two further Figure 3 supplements that expand on this information, referenced in the ‘Changes to the Canto data model and configuration’ section of the manuscript.</p><p>“To implement PHI-Canto several new entities were added to the Canto data model in order to support pathogen–host curation, as well as new configuration options (the new entities are illustrated in Figure 3 —figure supplement 1). These entities were ‘strain’, ‘metagenotype’ and ‘metagenotype annotation’. The complete data model for PHI-Canto is illustrated in Figure 3 ­­­—figure supplements 2 and 3.”</p><p>These new supplements are Figure 3 – supplement 2, which illustrates the entity–relationship model for the main Canto database, and Figure 3 – supplement 3, which illustrates the entity–relationship model for a curation session database in Canto.</p><p>Point – concepts.</p><p>We understand the reviewer’s use of the word ‘concepts’ to be equivalent to our use of the word ‘entities’. The entities that are used in PHI-Canto are included in the Figure 3 supplements as described in ‘Point – entity-relationship models’.</p><p>Point – methods.</p><p>We note that the annotation process is described at a conceptual level in Figure 4. With regards to the implementation of the process in code, PHI-Canto’s complete source code can be viewed at the Canto repository on GitHub (see the ‘Code Availability section’), where it is made available under the GNU General Public License, version 3 (GPLv3).</p><p>Point – eventual algorithms.</p><p>With regards to 'eventual algorithms', there is no particular algorithm of note that underlies PHI-Canto's data model, so we did not believe that describing the code that supports PHI-Canto's data model would be relevant. Much of PHI-Canto's code exists simply to validate the data entered by the curator and to store said data in the correct location in the database. The code supporting PHI-Canto's data model is not amenable to description as pseudocode, since it involves multiple source code modules (many from externally developed software libraries) and totals thousands of lines of code.</p><p>Point – Information storage and retrieval methods.</p><p>Text has been added to the Methods section ‘Changes to the Canto data model and configuration’ providing a general description of how PHI-Canto stores its data.</p><p>“PHI-Canto stores its data in a series of relational databases using the SQLite database engine. A primary database stores data shared across all curation sessions, and each curation session also has its own database to store data related to a single publication (such as genes, genotypes, metagenotypes, etc.). PHI-Canto can export its data as a JSON file or more specialized formats, for example the GO Annotation File (GAF) format.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Expand on how data display and interoperability are implemented, for example, to link related information from new and existing publications. Address the possible use of graph representation to link complex information. (See more detailed comments from Reviewers 2 and 3.)</p></disp-quote><p>Point – How data display and interoperability are implemented.</p><p>The PHI-base version 5 gene centric pages will display all curated information for a gene from multiple publications – both from new and existing publications.</p><p>For example</p><p>The curated data is made available within the new gene centric version 5 of PHI-base, where on a single gene page all published information from multiple publications, i.e. both new and existing are presented. For interoperability within PHI-base version 5, if the first host target is known for a pathogen gene/protein/other entities, there is a direct link-out to this related gene centric PHI-base page. Similarly, if there is already or will occur in the future a double gene and/or multi-gene functional analysis for either the pathogen or the host or both, then there is/will be a direct link-out(s) to this/these related gene centric PHI-base page(s).</p><p>We have amended the text in the Discussion to describe this further</p><p>“Here, we have described the development of PHI-Canto to allow the curation of the interspecies pathogen–host interaction literature by professional curators and publication authors. This curated data is then made available on the new gene-centric version 5 of PHI-base, where all information (i.e. new and existing) on a single gene from several publications is presented on a single page, with links to external resources providing information on interacting genes, proteins and other entities.”</p><p>Point – Addressing the use of graph representation.</p><p>With regards to a graph representation of the data, we are aware of the examples the reviewer described, and we agree that this type of representation could be preferable. However, our data model is currently constrained by the developers of Canto (Rutherford et al., 2014; doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/btu103), who use a relational data model and currently have no plans to implement a graph data model or a graph representation. We acknowledge that query languages like GraphQL can provide a graph-based interface to an existing relational data model, but we believe this would require a significant technological investment. For PHI-base, we plan to enable a graph representation of the data by integrating with existing knowledge graph tools, such as KnetMiner (www.knetminer.com; doi.org/10.1111/pbi.13583), which will provide graph-based queries on PHI-base (albeit only on select species for which knowledge graphs will be provided, i.e. <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, rice, wheat, eight plant and human infecting fungal ascomycete pathogens, and two non-pathogenic yeast species). We will also use KnetMiner integration to embed subgraphs of the complete knowledge graph into the gene-centric pages on the PHI-base 5 website.</p><p>We have amended the text in our discussion to include a reference to graph-based representation.</p><p>“Our future intentions are two-fold: firstly, a graph-based representation of the data will be enabled by integration with knowledge network generation tools, such as Knetminer (Hassani-Pak et al., 2021), where subgraphs of the knowledge graph could be embedded into each gene-centric page on the PHI-base 5 website.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Explain why PHIDO has been generated rather than using existing disease terminologies (such as Mondo or DO).</p></disp-quote><p>Point – Why we have developed PHIDO.</p><p>We would like to clarify that PHIDO is not intended to compete with existing disease ontologies: it is instead being used as a placeholder, until the time when its terms can be replaced with terms from existing disease ontologies. PHIDO was an expedient solution, in the sense that it provided the fastest way for us to test the process of curating diseases with PHI-Canto. This is because we only had to convert the existing list of disease names already in PHI-base into a controlled vocabulary, thus removing the need to wait for maintainers of other ontologies to add terms for us (as reported in Urban et al., 2022).</p><p>Additionally, we were required to use terms from PHIDO due to the lack of representation for plant and animal diseases in existing ontologies or vocabularies. Plant disease, in particular, is very underrepresented, with the ontologies we surveyed having either inappropriate semantics (e.g. the Plant Trait Ontology focusing on traits related to disease, rather than the diseases themselves) or still being in development (e.g. the Plant Stress Ontology). The majority of source ontologies used by MONDO are human-centric, and DO is exclusively for human disease, yet human disease represents only part of the focus of PHI-base (~35%). Furthermore, our choice of vocabularies is limited by the fact that Canto currently only supports ontologies in OBO format (for historical reasons).</p><p>We have begun the process of harmonizing disease names in PHI-base with terms from existing disease ontologies – such as MONDO, DO, and the National Cancer Institute Thesaurus – with the ultimate aim of using terms from those ontologies in curation, instead of terms from PHIDO. As general vocabularies for animal and plant disease emerge or are identified, we will extend this procedure to those diseases.</p><p>We have also added additional text to the manuscript to make this clearer as recorded below in our detailed response to Reviewer #3 recommendations for the authors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The authors should briefly comment on the possible extension of this approach beyond pathogen-host interactions, which could increase the broader relevance of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>Point – Extending PHI-Canto beyond pathogen-host interactions.</p><p>We acknowledge the lack of discussion about extending the tool for broader interspecies interactions. These examples may have been omitted from a previous draft due to word count restrictions. We have included additional text in the discussion to suggest some possible extended use cases.</p><p>“PHI-Canto, PHI-base and PHIPO were devised and built over the past seven years to serve the research needs of a specific international research community interested in exploring the wide diversity of common and species-specific mechanisms underlying pathogen attack and host defense in plant, animals, humans and other host organisms caused by fungi, protists and bacteria. However, it should be noted that the underlying developments to Canto’s data model – especially the concept of annotating metagenotypes – could be of use to communities focused on different types of interspecies interactions. Possible future uses of the PHI-Canto schema could include insect–plant interactions (both beneficial and detrimental), endosymbiotic relationships such as mycorrhiza–plant rhizosphere interactions, nodulating bacteria–plant rhizosphere interactions, fungi–fungi interactions, plant–plant interactions or bacteria–insect interactions, and non-pathogenic relationships in natural environments such as bulk soil, rhizosphere, phyllosphere, air, freshwater, estuarine water or seawater, and human–animal, animal–bird, human–insect, animal–insect, bird–insect interactions in various anatomical locations (e.g. gut, lung, and skin). The schema could also be extended to situations where phenotype–genotype relations have been established for predator–prey relationships or where there is competition in herbivore–herbivore, predator–predator or prey–prey relationships in the air, on land or in the water. Finally, the schema could be used to explore strain to strain interactions within a species when different biological properties have been noted. Customizing Canto to use other ontologies and controlled vocabularies is as simple as editing a configuration file, as shown in Source code 1.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Many readers may wrongly think they will find tones of centralized information about, e.g. their present-day favorite gene. This does not seem to be the case, leading to a related question: where do the contributed curations go and how are they made available? Is there a final control from within the resource team to filter wrong curations due to bad procedures, or even directly fraudulent data treatments?</p><p>On the model extension side, feeding on new interactions proposed by users: it is not clear what kind of follow-up would be made in order to encompass the usage with appropriate growth and amelioration. Are there plans for this? Also, given that most authors are in the industry, a short statement about conflicts of interest would be desirable. Related to this, it is not clear to the reader if new, useful added curations obtained by a user, will be added to the resource and made publicly available. In an ideal world, the ten examples forming the basis of the resource should grow to thousands. I might be missing something, though.</p></disp-quote><p>Points – centralized information, where contributed curations go, how they are made available and how curation is checked.</p><p>We believe that the Reviewer #1 has overlooked several key pieces of information regarding the display of curated data within a gene-centric web page in PHI-base version 5, that PHI-Canto curated display is displayed in the freely accessible PHI-base, and that PHI-Canto curated data is checked by a species expert prior to display in PHI-base. More detailed responses to reviewer #1 first point recommendations to authors have already been addressed in the author response to the Essential revisions point 1.</p><p>Point – extension of the model beyond pathogen-host interactions.</p><p>Regarding the model extensions a section of text has now been added containing some example communities as noted in point 6 of the essential revisions.

If an author has more data on an interaction, this will only be added to PHI-base once this data has been through the peer review process.</p><p>Additionally the reviewer states “In an ideal world, the ten examples forming the basis of the resource should grow to thousands. I might be missing something, though.” It appears that the reviewer has overlooked the text that the ten publications were selected for ‘<italic>trial</italic>’ curation and that we expect many thousands to be curated in the future.</p><p>“Ten publications covering a wide range of typical plant, human, and animal pathogen-host interactions were selected for trial curation in PHI-Canto (Table 2).”</p><p>To clarify this points in the manuscripts for future readers we have added ‘Trial’ to the section heading of the manuscript which now reads:</p><p>“Trial curation of interspecies interaction publications”</p><p>and some additional text to describe that we expect curation to expand beyond the initial ten trial publications with publication authors curating their own data.</p><p>“Ten publications covering a wide range of typical plant, human, and animal pathogen–host interactions were selected for trial curation in PHI-Canto before the tool was made available to publication authors and communities to add further publications (Table 2).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Given my area of expertise, I am not in a position to assess the relevance of the work from a biological point of view. However, I feel that some points relating to data management and problem modeling deserve some comment.</p><p>In particular, there is no mention of the complete data model of each annotation or the formats in which this information is stored. This omission is probably because this is part of the Canto project. Still, to make this publication self-contained, it would be desirable to include this information or at least a reference to it, especially to measure the changes required.</p><p>Something that would also improve the work is more detail on how to use or visualize the data generated. Although there are a few brief lines in the section on &quot;Display and interoperability of data&quot;, Figure 4 raises the question of how the system will behave in cases where there are already curated publications that refer to the pathogens and hosts of the new publication to be curated. It would be desirable that they are not treated in isolation but that the system allows them to be linked and then navigated in the network resulting from curating a set of publications.</p><p>Finally, in the introduction to the paper, the authors make the reckless assertion that manual biocuration is the only way to reliably represent information about functions and phenotypes. I would question this assertion given the current state of the art in LNP tools. While it is likely that, in many cases, automated annotation or curation using these techniques will not yield such accurate results, I believe it would be desirable to explore these techniques. It is also possible to think of hybrid human-in-the-loop systems where automatic techniques assist experts and simplify repetitive tasks. I believe that the paper should at least include a discussion of these issues.</p></disp-quote><p>Point – data models.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for identifying the lack of a mention of a complete data model of each annotation and for the formats in which it is stored. The reviewer assumes correctly that this was omitted due to being part of the Canto project. However, to make this information clearer to our readers we have amended the manuscript and addressed these points in more detail in Essential revision point 3.</p><p>Point – data visualization.</p><p>The reviewer has queried how data will be visualized and what happens when older and newer publications looking at the same gene interactions are curated. The data will be visualized on gene-centric pages within the new version of PHI-base 5. These gene-centric pages will collate all the information i.e. new and existing from multiple publications into one gene page. Again more detail is provided in response to the Essential revision point 3.</p><p>Point – manual techniques compared to automated techniques for curation.</p><p>The reviewer has identified our lack of discussion regarding manual techniques compared to automated techniques for curation. We acknowledge that our initial statement in favor of manual curation may have been too bold and have amended the following text in the Introduction section:</p><p>“Due to the complexity of the biology, manual biocuration is currently the only way to reliably represent information about function and phenotype in databases and knowledge bases (Wood, Sternberg, &amp; Lipshitz, 2022).”</p><p>To the updated text:</p><p>“Due to the complexity of the biology and the specificity of the curation requirements, manual biocuration is currently the most reliable way to capture information about function and phenotype in databases and knowledge bases (Wood, Sternberg, &amp; Lipshitz, 2022). For pathogen–host interactions, the original publications do not provide details of specific strains, variants, and their associated genotypes and phenotypes, nor the relative impact on pathogenicity and virulence, in a standardized machine-readable format. The expert curator synergizes knowledge from different representations (text, graphs, images) into clearly defined machine-readable syntax.”</p><p>We have also updated the Discussion section with a discussion comparing manual curation to automated curation with regards to PHI-Canto.</p><p>“With regards to our focus on manual curation, we recognize that great progress has been made with machine learning (ML) approaches in recent times. However, Wood, Sternberg &amp; Lipshitz (2022) note that the data being curated from publications are “categorical, highly complex, and with hundreds of thousands of heterogeneous classes, often not explicitly labeled”. There are no published examples of ML approaches outperforming an expert curator in accuracy, which is paramount in the medical field. However, curation by experts could provide a highly reliable corpus that could be used for training ML systems. Our aspiration is that ML and expert curators can collaborate in a virtuous cycle whereby expert curators continually review and refine the ML models, while the manual work of finding publications and entity recognition is handled by the ML system.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Here are some specific points of confusion, questions, or suggestions for improvement:</p><p>Page 5 of the manuscript (page 6 of the full pdf):</p><p>– Lines 103-105 talk about changes in pathogenicity and virulence.

In fact, this information was included in an earlier version of the manuscript, but later omitted to keep the word count down. New text has been added to clarify how pathogenicity and virulence differ from each other.</p><p>“Each metagenotype can be annotated with pathogen–host interaction phenotypes to capture changes in pathogenicity (caused by alterations to the pathogen) and changes in virulence (caused by alterations to the host and/or the pathogen). Pathogenicity is a property of the pathogen that describes the ability of the pathogen to cause an infectious disease in another organism. When a pathogenic organism causes disease, the severity of the disease that occurs is referred to as ‘virulence’ and this can also be dependent upon the host organism.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Bottom of the page talks about &quot;annotation types&quot;. The term &quot;annotation type&quot; seems to be used in a way that allows confusion with the entity being annotated.

We use ECO (Experiment and Conclusion Ontology) terms to curate the experimental evidence used in making a phenotype annotation and PHI-ECO (PHI-Experimental Conditions Ontology) terms to curate experimental conditions. As we understand it, GO does not permit any evidence codes to be used on its annotations except the GO evidence codes, so terms from ECO would not be applicable for GO annotations.

In light of this, we have been working to ensure that any new evidence codes added to PHI-Canto also have a corresponding ontology term added to ECO.

By definition, in a mutualist relationship, neither partner is a pathogen as disease is not caused. I realize this issue is likely beyond the scope of this paper to discuss, but I wonder about the inclusion of this annotation in the PHI resource since it does not involve a pathogen. Is it because the species has been seen to be a pathogen in other cases? Or is it that PHI includes some non-pathogenic interactions as well? If the first case, it brings to bear how to define something as a pathogen when (as is true for almost all organisms that cause disease in another organism) it only causes disease in some situations and not others (which is of course relevant to the host-pathogen-environment disease triangle mentioned in the text and Figure 1). If it is the second case, might it make sense to think about the scope of the resource as related to its name? Since mechanisms of colonization are often shared between pathogens and beneficial commensals alike, including annotations for symbionts beyond known pathogens would be useful. However, if these are regularly included, more prominent statements to that effect made on the PHI website and in publications would inform users.</p></disp-quote><p>Point – Inclusion of a mutualistic interaction to illustrate the extension potential of PHI-Canto to curate alternative interactions.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for this observation. We decided to include this publication within the ten trial papers to illustrate that PHI-Canto could be used to curate mutualism relationships. The PHI-base release 4.14 contains curated data for 4847 publications and only two of these publications are for a mutualism interaction. In these two examples there is an interaction shift from mutualism to enhanced antagonism/loss of mutualism (PHI:576 and PHI:578). We were able to successfully curate this shift within PHI-base 4 as a proof of concept idea. Whilst developing PHI-Canto one of these mutualist interaction publications was also included to confirm that curation of this type of interaction was also possible with the new tool. One of the reasons we wish to publish in <italic>eLife</italic> is so that knowledge of the curation tool can be shared and extended to additional communities (see author response to Essential revisions point 6). We have added the following additional text to the footnote <sup>**</sup> of Table 2 which links out to the example of curating 'mutualism' that is available in Appendix 1.</p><p><sup>“**</sup>Example of curating 'mutualism' available in Appendix 1.
