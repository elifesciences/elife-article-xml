This composite material exhibits extraordinary properties, from stretchable and pliable cell boundaries to solid protective shells. Cellulose, a linear glucose polymer, is synthesized and secreted across the plasma membrane by cellulose synthase (CesA), of which plants express multiple isoforms. Different subsets of CesA isoforms are necessary for primary and secondary cell wall biogenesis. Here, we structurally and functionally characterize the <italic>Glycine max</italic> (soybean) primary cell wall CesAs CesA1, CesA3, and CesA6. The CesA isoforms exhibit robust in vitro catalytic activity. Cryo-electron microscopy analyses reveal their assembly into homotrimeric complexes in vitro in which each CesA protomer forms a cellulose-conducting transmembrane channel with a large lateral opening. Biochemical and co-purification analyses demonstrate that different CesA isoforms interact in vitro, leading to synergistic cellulose biosynthesis. Interactions between CesA trimers are only observed between different CesA isoforms and require the class-specific region (CSR). The CSR forms a hook-shaped extension of CesA’s catalytic domain at the cytosolic water-lipid interface. Negative stain and cryo-electron microscopy analyses of mixtures of different CesA isoform trimers reveal their side-by-side arrangement into loose clusters. Our data suggest a model by which CesA homotrimers of different isoforms assemble into cellulose synthase complexes to synthesize and secrete multiple cellulose chains for microfibril formation. Inter-trimer interactions are mediated by fuzzy interactions between their CSR extensions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cellulose</kwd><kwd>microfibril</kwd><kwd>rosette</kwd><kwd>electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>intrinsically disordered domain</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM144130</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ho</surname><given-names>Ruoya</given-names></name><name><surname>Zimmer</surname><given-names>Jochen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zimmer</surname><given-names>Jochen</given-names></name><name><surname>Wilson</surname><given-names>Louis FL</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structural and biochemical analyses suggest the association of homotrimeric CesAs of different isoforms into cellulose biosynthesis complexes via their class-specific regions.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cellulose is a versatile biopolymer and a fundamental building block of plant cell walls. It is an amphipathic linear β–1,4 linked glucose polymer that can be assembled into fibrillar structures. As the load-bearing wall component of vascular plants, cellulose microfibrils are spun around the cell and integrated with a variety of other biopolymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Turner and Kumar, 2018</xref>). Cellulose is synthesized by cellulose synthase (CesA), a membrane-integrated processive family-2 glycosyltransferase (GT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lombard et al., 2014</xref>). The enzyme synthesizes cellulose from UDP-activated glucose (UDP-Glc) and translocates the polymer across the plasma membrane through a channel formed by its own membrane-spanning segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McNamara et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Morgan et al., 2013</xref>). While bacterial CesAs primarily function as monomeric enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abidi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acheson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Du et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Morgan et al., 2013</xref>), structural analyses of plant CesAs revealed their assembly into triangular-shaped trimeric complexes of three catalytically active subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Massenburg et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Purushotham et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2021a</xref>).</p><p>The overall CesA architecture and the mechanism of cellulose biosynthesis is evolutionarily conserved from bacteria to land plants. However, plant CesAs contain specific domains absent in most bacterial homologs. These include an extended cytosolic N-terminus beginning with a RING-like region, a plant conserved region (PCR), as well as a class-specific region (CSR; ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Purushotham et al., 2020</xref>). The CSR and PCR are inserted into the cytosolic catalytic domain. While the PCR is a trimerization domain that connects three CesA promoters in a trimeric complex, the function and structure of the CSR remains unknown. Further, plants express different CesA isoforms at different developmental stages, of which certain subsets are necessary for primary and secondary cell wall formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Persson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Taylor et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Turner and Somerville, 1997</xref>). Based on the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> nomenclature, isoforms associated with primary cell wall formation include CesA1, CesA3, and CesA6, whereas secondary cell wall CesAs are CesA4, CesA7, and CesA8. The isoenzymes vary the most within the CSR and the N-terminal domain.</p><p>Genetic analyses demonstrated the importance of different CesA isoforms for primary and secondary cell wall formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fagard et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Turner and Somerville, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Persson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sampathkumar et al., 2019</xref>). Further, co-immunoprecipitation analyses indicated direct interactions between primary or secondary cell wall CesA isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gonneau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Taylor et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Timmers et al., 2009</xref>). However, the specific functions of the different CesA isoforms during in vivo cellulose biosynthesis remain unknown.</p><p>Plants organize cellulose into micro and macro-fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kubicki et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Turner and Kumar, 2018</xref>). Cellulose microfibrils likely originate from supramolecular CesA complexes (CSCs) observed in various species. In land plants, CSCs appear primarily as pseudo sixfold symmetric membrane-integrated clusters by freeze fracture electron microscopy analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Herth and Weber, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kimura et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nixon et al., 2016</xref>). The CesA trimer likely represents the CSC repeat unit, thereby accounting for 18 CesAs per CSC and, accordingly, 18 cellulose polymers in a CSC-synthesized microfibril (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cosgrove et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nixon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Turner and Kumar, 2018</xref>).</p><p>To analyze the oligomerization and function of primary cell wall CesAs, we recombinantly expressed and purified <italic>Glycine max</italic> (soybean, Gm) CesA1, CesA3, and CesA6. Cryo-EM analyses of all three CesA isoforms reveal the formation of homotrimeric complexes, similar to the secondary cell wall CesAs. The CSR is resolved at the corners of the CesA trimer as a disordered but hook-shaped domain that runs at the cytosolic water-lipid interface. In vitro co-purification and electron microscopy studies demonstrate that homotrimers of different CesA isoforms interact. This interaction requires the CSR and leads to synergistic cellulose biosynthesis. Our results support a model by which CSCs are formed from homotrimers of different CesA isoforms.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Primary cell wall CesAs purify as high and low molecular weight species</title><p>We selected a set of <italic>G. max</italic> (<italic>Gm</italic>) CesA isoforms that phylogenetically cluster with <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> CesA1, CesA3 and CesA6, respectively, and that are widely and strongly expressed in unlignified soybean tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).

This failure does not exclude the formation of a small fraction of hetero-oligomeric <italic>Gm</italic>CesA complexes; however, it indicates the preferred formation of homo-oligomeric <italic>Gm</italic>CesA complexes. Therefore, we characterized the <italic>Gm</italic>CesA isoforms individually. All three isoforms can be purified as catalytically active homotrimeric species. Trimerization is mediated by the cytosolic PCR, as observed in the secondary cell wall <italic>Ptt</italic>CesA8 and <italic>Gh</italic>CesA7 isoforms. Because the PCR is highly conserved across the three <italic>Gm</italic>CesA isoforms, the apparent failure (or low efficiency) of heterotrimer formation may be due to subtle differences in sequence and shape complementarity between the isoforms.</p><p>The different arrangement of TM helix 7 in the <italic>Gm</italic>CesAs compared to <italic>Ptt</italic>CesA8 and <italic>Gh</italic>CesA7 creates a large lateral window in the cellulose secretion channel. The window opens towards the trimer’s threefold symmetry axis.

The robust interaction of trimers of different CesA isoforms supports their physiological significance. In a detergent solubilized state, the individual CesA trimers are not confined to the same plane, as is the case in a biological membrane. Thus, the in vitro observed interactions lead to clustering of the trimers, instead of their ordered close packing into symmetric particles.</p><p>Our data further demonstrate that the CSR, a region predicted to be intrinsically disordered, is the primary mediator of trimer-trimer interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>), in agreement with earlier suggestions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sethaphong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Singh et al., 2020</xref>). The observation that CesA trimers can assemble in a non-physiological upside-down orientation suggests that the CSRs in a complex remain flexible, similar to previously described fuzzy complexes of intrinsically disordered proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fuxreiter, 2012</xref>). A fuzzy CSR-CSR interface may function like a magnet to associate CesA trimers into a CSC, thereby bestowing flexibility on the CSC during microfibril formation.

This model can be modified by assuming multiple binding sites for the same ‘non-like’ isoform or even a ‘like’ isoform to account for possible CSC configurations of two or one isoforms, respectively. Because trimers of the same isoform do not interact in vitro, CSC models relying on interactions between the same CesA isoforms across the repeat units are unlikely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>Due to its disordered nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Scavuzzo-Duggan et al., 2018</xref>), the CSR likely occupies a large volume at the periphery of the catalytic domain. It is thus possible that the domain affects nucleotide binding to or exchange at the active site. The CSR could be repositioned upon complex formation with another isoform, which in turn could increase the catalytic activity, explaining the synergistic effects observed in vitro.</p><p>Lastly, the biological functions of the different CesA isoforms are currently unknown. Requiring different isoforms to form a functional CSC could provide regulatory control over the cellulosic material deposited in the cell wall. It is conceivable that CesA trimers function alongside fully assembled CSCs in the plasma membrane, thereby producing proto- and microfibrils (from CesA trimers and CSCs, respectively) that may interact. Accordingly, controlling the ability of the CesAs to assemble into CSCs by regulating the isoform composition in the plasma membrane may allow tailoring the fibril-to-protofibril ratio and thereby wall properties. Addressing these questions will require detailed in vivo studies of the oligomerization and distribution of cellulose depositing CesA complexes in the plasma membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Molecular phylogeny</title><p>A pre-computed cluster of loose CesA homologues (HOM05D000074) was downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/plaza/versions/plaza_v5_dicots/">Dicots PLAZA 5.0</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Van Bel et al., 2022</xref>), from which soy (<italic>Glycine max</italic>), <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, cotton (<italic>Gossypium hirsutum</italic>), poplar (<italic>Populus trichocarpa</italic>), tomato (<italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic>), Physcomitrium, and Amborella protein sequences were isolated.

Afterwards, the reaction mixture was mixed with an equal amount of UDP-Glo reagent (Promega) in a 96-well Nunclon Delta-Treated flat-bottom microplate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature before measuring luminescence using a GloMax Explorer plate reader (Promega). A standard curve was used for quantification of the UDP produced. Kinetic values were obtained using the nonlinear regression function in GraphPad Prism.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title><italic>Gm</italic>CesA UDP inhibition assays</title><p>UDP inhibition was analyzed using radiometric quantification of in vitro synthesized cellulose, as described above by titrating 0.01–7.5 mM UDP in the reaction. Substrate concentrations for the individual reactions were 1.4 mM, 0.5 mM, and 2.3 mM for <italic>Gm</italic>CesA1, <italic>Gm</italic>CesA3, and <italic>Gm</italic>CesA6, respectively. Inhibition constants (IC<sub>50</sub>) for each <italic>Gm</italic>CesA were obtained by data analysis in GraphPad Prism.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Synergistic cellulose biosynthesis</title><p>Activity synergism between different <italic>Gm</italic>CesA isoform trimers were studied by mixing two <italic>Gm</italic>CesA isoforms, one at a constant concentration of 20 μM and one at increasing concentrations from 1 to 20 μM. The activities of the individual isoforms at the respective concentrations were also measured. In vitro synthesized cellulose was quantified by scintillation counting, as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>EM grid preparation and data collection</title><p>After size exclusion chromatography, the freshly purified protein fractions were pooled. The protein quality was monitored by negative stain EM. The proteins were diluted to 0.01 mg/mL and 4 μL was applied to a glow discharged Formvar/Carbon grid (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 30 s, followed by 2 x washes with 4 μL H<sub>2</sub>O. The grid was negatively stained with 4 μL 0.75% Uranyl Formate (UF) in H<sub>2</sub>O for 30 s. Excess UF was removed by blotting with filter paper and the grid was air dried. Images were taken on a Tecnai F20 at the Macromolecular Electron Microscopy Core (MEMC) facility at the University of Virginia.</p><p>For cryo grid preparation, the protein samples were concentrated until NanoDrop readings reached 3 mg/ml (1.8 mg/mL using an extinction coefficient of ~200,000/ (M cm)). 2.5 µL were applied to a C-flat 300 mesh 1.2/1.3 copper grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences), glow-discharged in the presence of amylamine at 25 mA for 45 s, and blotted with a Vitrobot Mark IV (FEI, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with force 4 for 6 s at 4 °C, 100% humidity, and frozen in liquid ethane.</p><p>Cryo-EM data were collected at the MEMC at the University of Virginia on a Titan Krios microscope operated at 300 keV and equipped with a Gatan K3 direct electron detector positioned post a Gatan Quantum energy filter. On average, a total of ~6000 movies were collected from one or two grids in counting mode at a magnification of 81 K, pixel size of 1.08 Å, and defocus range from –2.2 to –1.2 µm with step size of 0.2 µm. The total dose was 50 e<sup>-</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>. Movies with 40 frames were collected at 5.17 s/movie rate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Cryo-EM data processing</title><p>Cryo-EM data processing was done in cryoSPARC v4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Punjani et al., 2017</xref>). The general workflow is described as supplemental information, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>. Based on improved map qualities, all volumes were generated imposing threefold symmetry (C3). Maps generated without symmetry assignment (C1) were used to visualize the unidentified ligand coordinated by the PCR domains at the particle’s symmetry axis. Initial protein models were generated in AlphaFold and manually adjusted in Chimera and Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>). Models were refined in Phenix.refine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Afonine et al., 2012</xref>). The following regions were omitted from the constructs due to weak or missing map density: <italic>Gm</italic>CesA1:1–260 (NTD), 654–717 (CSR), 954–978 (gating loop), 1064–1078 (C term); <italic>Gm</italic>CesA3: 1–251 (NTD), 648–712 (CSR), 948–974 (gating loop), 1029–1079 (C term and TM 7); and <italic>Gm</italic>CesA6: 1–248 (NTD), 646–712 (CSR), 952–971 (gating loop), 1060–1078 (C term). Cellobiose was modeled at the acceptor positions of <italic>Gm</italic>CesA3 and <italic>Gm</italic>CesA6.

It is made at the cell surface by a large membrane-bound complex known as the cellular synthase complex. It is the structure of the cellulose synthase complex that determines the structure of the cellulose microfibril, the unit of cellulose found in nature. Consequently, while understanding the molecular structure of individual catalytic subunits that synthesise individual beta 1-4 glucose chains is important, to really understand cellulose synthesis it is necessary to understand the structure of the entire complex.</p><p>In higher plants cellulose is synthesised by a large membrane-bound complex composed of three different CESA proteins. During cellulose synthesis in the primary cell wall this is composed of members of groups CESA1, CESA3 and CESA6. While the authors have previously presented structural data on CESA8, required for cellulose synthesis in the secondary cell wall, here they provide structural and enzymatic analysis of CESA1, CESA3 and CESA6 from soybean.</p><p>The authors have utilised their established protocol to purify trimers for all three classes of CESA proteins and obtain structural information using electron microscopy. The structures reveal some subtle, but interesting differences between the structures obtained in this study and that previously obtained for CESA8. In particular, they identify a change in the position of transmembrane helices 7 that in previous structures formed part of the transmembrane channel. In the structure of CESA1 TM7 is shifted laterally to a position more towards the periphery of the protomer where is stabilised by inter protomer interactions. This creates a large lipid exposed channel opening that is likely encountered by the growing cellulose chain. In the discussion the authors speculate this channel might facilitate lateral movement of cellulose chains in the membrane what would allow them to associate to form the microfibril. There is, however, no explanation for why this might be different for CESA proteins involved in primary and secondary cell wall CESA proteins.</p><p>Interactions within the trimer as stabilised by the plant conserved regions (PCR), while in common with previous studies that class-specific regions (CSR) is not resolved, likely of it being highly disordered as has been suggested in previous studies. As the name suggests these regions are likely to be important for determining how different CESA proteins interact, but it remains to be seen how they achieve this. Similarly, the N-terminal domain (NTD) remains rather intriguing. In the CESA3 structure, the NTD forms a stalk that protrudes into the cytoplasm that was previously observed for CESA8, while it remains unresolved in CESA1 and CESA6. The authors suggest the inability to resolve this region is likely the result of the NTD being able to form multiple conformations. Loss of the NTD does not prevent the formation of trimers and CESA1 and CESA3 are still able to interact. Previous bioinformatic studies suggest that the CSR part of the NTD is also highly class-specific (Carrol et al. 2011 Frontiers in Plant Science 2, 5-5) suggesting it is also likely to participate in interactions between different CESA proteins. This analysis provides little new information on the structure of the NTD or how it functions as part of the cellulose synthase complex.</p><p>The other important point regarding cellulose synthesis is how the different CESA trimers function during cellulose synthesis and complex assembly. The authors provide biochemical evidence that mixed complexes of two different CESA proteins are able to synergistically increase the rate of cellulose synthesis. This increase is not dramatic, around 2-fold as it is unclear what brings about this increase and whether it results from the ability to form larger complexes favouring greater rates of cellulose synthesis.</p><p>It is clear however from electron microscopy that mixing of CESA proteins can lead to the formation of large aggregates not seen with single CESA proteins. The aggregates observed do not form rosette type shapes but appear to be much more random aggregates of different CESA trimers. The authors suggest that this is likely a result of the fact that the complexes are not constrained in two dimensions by the membrane, however if these are biologically relevant interactions that form aggregates is somewhat surprising that they do not form hexameric structures, particularly since that are essentially forming as a single layer.</p><p>Overall the study provides some important data and raises a number of important questions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.96704.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Cellulose is a major component of the primary cell wall of growing cells and it is made by cellulose synthases (CESAs) organized into multi-subunit complexes in the plasma membrane. Previous results have resolved the structure of secondary cell wall CESAs, which are only active in a subset of cells. Here, the authors evaluate the structure of CESAs from soybean (Glycine max, Gm) via cryo-EM and compare these structures to secondary cell wall CESAs. First, they express a select member of the GmCESA1, GmCESA3, or GmCESA6 families in insect cells, purified these proteins as both monomers and homotrimers, and demonstrated their capacity to incorporate 3H-labelled glucose into cellulase-sensitive product in a pH and divalent cation (e.g., Mg2+) -dependant fashion (Figure 2). Although CESA1, CESA3, and a CESA6-like isoforms are essential for cellulose synthesis in Arabidopsis, in this study, monomers and homotrimers both showed catalytic activity, and there was more variation between individual isoforms than between their oligomerization states (i.e., CESA3 monomers and trimers showed similar activities, which were substantially different from CESA1 monomers or trimers).</p><p>They next use cryo-EM to solve the structure of each homotrimer to ~3.0 to 3.3 A (Figure 3). They compare this with PttCESA8 and find important similarities, such as the unidentified density at a positively-charged region near Arg449, Lys452, and Arg453; and differences, such as the position and relatively low resolution (suggesting higher flexibility) of TM7, which presumably creates a large lateral lipid-exposed channel opening, rather than the transmembrane pore in PttCESA8. Like PttCESA8, an oligosaccharide in the translocation channel was co-resolved with the protein structure. Neither the N-terminal domains nor the CSRs (a plant-specific insert into the cytosolic loop between TM2 and TM3) are resolved well.</p><p>Several previous models have proposed that the cellulose synthase complexes may be composed of multiple heterotrimers, but since the authors were able to isolate beta-glucan-synthesizing homotrimers, their results challenge this model. Using the purified trimers, the authors investigated how the CESA homotrimers might assemble into higher order complexes. They detected interactions between each pair of CESA homotrimers via pull down assays (Figure 4), although these same interactions were also detected among monomers (Supplemental Figure 4). Neither catalytic activity nor these inter-homotrimer interactions required the N-terminal domain (Figure 5). When populations of homotrimers were mixed, they formed larger aggregations in vitro (Figure 6) and displayed increased activity, compared to the predicted additive activity of each enzyme alone (Figure 7). Intriguingly, this synergistic behavior is observed even when one trimer is chemically inactivated before mixing (supplemental figure 7), suggesting that the synergistic effects are due to structural interactions.</p><p>The main strength of this manuscript is its detailed characterization of the structure of multiple CESAs implicated in primary cell wall synthesis, which complements previous studies of secondary cell wall CESAs. They provide a comprehensive comparison of these new structures with previously resolved CESA structures and discuss several intriguing similarities and differences. The synergistic activity observed when different homotrimers are mixed is a particularly interesting result. These results provide fundamental in vitro support for a cellulose synthase complex comprised of a hexamer of CESA homotrimers.</p><p>The main weakness of the manuscript is that the authors' evidence that these proteins make cellulose in vitro is limited to beta-glucanase-sensitive digestion of the product. Previous reports characterizing CESA structures have used multiple independent methods: sensitivity and resistance of the product to various enzymes, linkage analysis, and importantly, TEM of the product to ensure that it makes genuine cellulose microfibrils, rather than amorphous beta-glucan.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.96704.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Pallinti</surname><given-names>Purushotham</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Charlottesville</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ho</surname><given-names>Ruoya</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Charlottesville</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zimmer</surname><given-names>Jochen</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0153tk833</institution-id><institution>University of Virginia</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Charlottesville</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wan</surname><given-names>Yueping</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0153tk833</institution-id><institution>University of Virginia</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Charlottesville</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wilson</surname><given-names>Louis FL</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Virginia, Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Charlottesville</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>I can find no problems with the experiments performed in this study, but there are several results that are not easily explained. I would like to see more consideration of possible explanations. For example, one of the major differences between the the CESA structure from primary and secondary cell walls is the displacement of TM7 in the primary cell wall CESAs that leads to the formation of lipid exposed channel. Why does this vary between primary and secondary cell wall CESA proteins? Could it explain differences in the properties, such as crystallinity between primary and secondary cell wall cellulose?</p></disp-quote><p>At this time, the different position of TM helix 7 observed in our GmCesA structures is just an observation. We have some emerging evidence that this helix is also flexible in POCesA8 under certain conditions; however, we do not know whether this affects catalytic activity or cellulose coalescence. We have revised the text to avoid the interpretation that TM 7 repositioning is a characteristic feature of primary cell wall CesAs only.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, regarding the formation of the larger structures from mixtures of different CESA trimers. Why do they not form roseOes? Par;cularly as these appear to be forming 2-dimensional structures.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included additional data on the interaction between different CesA isoform trimers (Figure 6). To answer the reviewer’s ques;on, the most likely reasons for not observing closely packed roseOe-like structures are (a) steric interferences between the micelles harboring the individual CesA trimers, and (b) the lack of a stabilizing cellulose fiber. This interpretation is supported by 2D class averages of dimers of CesA1 and CesA3 trimers (now shown in Fig. 6). The class averages show an ‘upside-down and side-by-side’ orientation of the two trimers, consistent with interferences between the solubilizing detergent micelles. The implica;ons of this non-physiological arrangement are discussed in the revised manuscript. In a biological membrane, the CesA trimers are confined to the same plane in the same orientation, which is likely necessary to form ordered arrangements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What role does the NTD play in trimer formation given its apparent very high class specificity?</p></disp-quote><p>We have no data suggesting any contribution of the NTD to trimer formation. Recent work on moss CesA5 and similar AlphaFold predic;ons suggest that, for some CesAs, an extreme Nterminal region can interact with the beta sheet of the catalytic domain via beta-strand augmentation. Whether this interaction can contribute to CesA-CesA interactions remains unknown.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The authors provide PDB codes but not EMDB codes for the EM maps, also I would encourage the authors to upload the raw micrographs to the EMPIAR database.</p></disp-quote><p>The EMDB codes are shown in Table 1 and data transfer to EMPIAR is ongoing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 6 line 144, the statement &quot;All CesA isoforms show greatest catalytic activity at neutral pH&quot; seems to contradict the data in Figure 1e and the subsequent statements.

Is this the affinities or the Michaelis constants? Is it known whether CesAs are rapid equilibrium enzymes? This should be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>The text now states that we performed Michaelis Menten kine;cs using the ‘UDP-Glo’ glycosyltransferase assay kit. We are uncertain about whether CesAs can be classified as rapid equilibrium enzymes. The rate-limiting step of cellulose biosynthesis has been proposed to be glycosyl transfer, rather than cellulose transloca;on.

This argument would be strengthened by equivalent truncation experiments in which the CSR region is removed.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed the suggested experiment. We replaced the CSR in N-terminally truncated GmCesA1 and GmCesA3 with a 20-residue long linker. The resulting constructs assemble into homotrimeric complexes as observed for the wild type and only N-terminally truncated versions. However, the CSR-truncated constructs of the different isoforms do not interact with each other in vitro. Further, CSR-deleted GmCesA3 also does not interact with full-length CesA1, suggesting that two CSR domains of different isoforms are necessary for homotrimer interaction. This data is now shown as Fig. 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Major Points</p><p>(1) The authors state on Line 354 that they were unable to isolate heterotrimers, but they need to provide the data to support this claim; for example, it is important for readers to understand whether co-expression of all three CESAs leads to only homotrimers or only monomers. This information is essential to exclude model C in Figure 6.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the corresponding discussion and toned down the statement that heterotrimeric complexes did not form in our recombinant expression system. Co-expression of differently tagged secondary or primary cell wall CesAs in Sf9 cells has consistently resulted in negligible amounts of material that can be purified sequentially over different affinity matrices (corresponding to the tags on the recombinantly expressed CesAs – His, Strep, Flag). While this does not exclude the formation of a small fraction of hetero-oligomeric complexes (which could be trimers as observed in the structures or monomers interacting via their CSR regions), it demonstrates that CesAs favor the same isoform for trimer formation, rather than partnering with other isoforms. An example of such a purification is now shown as Supplemental Figure 8.</p><p>Determining whether heterotrimers are formed upon co-expression of different CesA isoforms requires high resolution structural analysis because co-purification of different isoforms can also be due to interactions between different homo-trimeric complexes, as demonstrated in this study.</p><p>While we cannot exclude that factors exist in planta that may prevent the formation of homotrimers and favor the formation of hetero-trimers, it is important to keep in mind that currently no experimental data supports the formation of hetero-trimeric complexes. Instead, our work demonstrates that existing data on CesA isoform interactions can be explained by the interaction of homotrimers of different isoforms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The evidence that the products of GmCEA1, GmCESA3, and GmCESA6 homotrimers are cellulose is that they consume UDP-glucose and produce a beta-glucanase-sensitive product. Other beta-glucans synthesized by similar GT2 family proteins (e.g. CSLDs, Yang et al., 2020 Plant Cell or CSLCs, Kim et al., 2020 PNAS) would be sensitive to this enzyme, and the product cannot truly be called cellulose unless it forms microfibrils. Previous reports of CESA activity in vitro have demonstrated that the products form genuine cellulose microfibrils rather than amorphous beta-glucan (via electron microscopy); extensively documented that the product is sensitive to beta-glucanase, but not other enzymes (e.g., callose or MLG degrading enzymes); provided linkage analysis of the product to conclusively demonstrate that it is a beta1,4-linked glucan; and documented a loss of activity when key catalytic residues were mutated (Purushotham et al., 2016 PNAS; Cho et al., 2017 Plant Phys; Purushotham et al., 2020 Science).</p><p>Other GT2 characterization efforts have documented activity to similar standards (e.g. CSLDs, Yang et al., 2020 Plant Cell or CSLFs, Purushotham et al., 2022 Science Advances). At least one independent method should be provided, and the TEM of the product is necessary for readers to appreciate whether the product forms true cellulose microfibrils.</p></disp-quote><p>There may be some confusion regarding the nomenclature. Therefore, we revised the second sentence of the Introduction to define ‘cellulose’ as a beta-1,4 linked glucose polymer, in accordance with the ‘Essentials of Glycobiology’. This is also consistent with enzyme nomenclature as the primary product of cellulose synthase is a single glucose polymer, and not a fibril. For example, most bacterial cellulose synthases only produce amorphous (single chain) cellulose.</p><p>We show that the GmCesA products can be degraded with a beta-1,4 specific glucanase (cellulase), which demonstrates the formation of authentic cellulose. This study does not focus on the formation of fibrillar cellulose apart from suggesting a revised model for a microfibrilforming CSC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The position of isoxaben-resistant mutations implies that primary cell wall CESAs form heterotrimers (Shim et al., 2018 Frontiers in Plant Biology). Indeed, in their previous description of the POCESA8 structure (Purushotham et al., 2020 Science), the authors discussed the position of isoxaben-resistant mutations as a way to justify the way that TM7 of one CESA can contribute to forming the cellulose translocation pore in the neighbouring CESA within a heterotrimer. However, in this manuscript, the authors document a different location for TM7 in the GmCEA1, GmCESA3, and GmCESA6 homotrimers, which would change the position of these resistance mutations. Please discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated in the manuscript, we do not know what the functional implication of the TM7 flexibility may be, but we speculate that it could affect the alignment of the synthesized cellulose polymers. Regarding the previously reported POCesA8 structure, the mapping of one of the reported isoxaben resistance mutants to the C-terminus of TM7 was not used to justify the structure; the structure with its position of TM7 stands on its own. Considering recent observations suggesting that isoxaben may affect cellulose biosynthesis via secondary effects, we prefer not to speculate on the mechanism by which these mutations cause the apparent resistance to isoxaben (PMID: 37823413).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors present no evidence that GmCESA1/3/6 are involved in primary cell wall synthesis. Please include gene expression information (documenting widespread expression consistent with primary CESAs) and rigorous molecular phylogenetic analysis (or references to these published data) to clarify that these are indeed primary cell wall CESAs.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been addressed.

We did not insert the second modification as requested since CesA trimers are stabilized by the PCR.

Could this difference in activity or pH preference have also affected their capacity to resolve TM7 of CESA1?</p></disp-quote><p>We consistently observe higher in vitro catalytic activity of CesA1, compared to CesA3 and CesA6. Activity assays are performed at a pH of 7.5, roughly halfway between the activity maxima of CesA3 and CesA1/6. At this pH, we expect activity differences to arise from factors other than the buffer pH. As detailed above, we do not know whether the conformational flexibility of TM helix 7 affects catalytic activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Line 55: The authors should cite additional papers that also provide insight into CESA structure (e.g. Qiao et al 2021 PNAS).</p></disp-quote><p>A recent publication on moss CesA5 has been included.

The purple columns represent activities obtained for only CesA3 at the indicated concentrations. Numerical addition of the activities of CesA1 alone at 20 µM (blue column) and CesA 3 alone (purple columns) gives rise to the gray columns, now indicated by a capital ‘sigma’ sign.
