Studies of congenital CMV infection (cCMVi) pathogenesis are complicated by the presence of multiple infecting maternal CMV strains, especially in HIV-positive women, and the large, recombinant CMV genome. Using newly developed tools to reconstruct CMV haplotypes, we demonstrate anatomic CMV compartmentalization in five HIV-infected mothers and identify the possibility of congenitally transmitted genotypes in three of their infants. A single CMV strain was transmitted in each congenitally infected case, and all were closely related to those that predominate in the cognate maternal cervix. Compared to non-transmitted strains, these congenitally transmitted CMV strains showed statistically significant similarities in 19 genes associated with tissue tropism and immunomodulation. In all infants, incident superinfections with distinct strains from breast milk were captured during follow-up. The results represent potentially important new insights into the virologic determinants of early CMV infection.</p></abstract><kwd-group

2006</xref>). Between 0.2% and 2% of all live births have congenital CMV infection (cCMVi), and of these, an estimated 15–20% develop permanent sequelae ranging from sensorineural hearing loss to severe neurocognitive impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boppana et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dollard et al., 2007</xref>). Maternal coinfection with HIV, even when mitigated by antiretroviral treatment, is associated with higher CMV viral loads in plasma, saliva, cervix, and breast milk, and a greater risk of both congenital and postnatal CMV transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gantt et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gantt et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Slyker et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Richardson et al., 2016</xref>). Numerous studies have highlighted the negative health impacts of CMV on both HIV-infected and HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU) infants and children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Garcia-Knight et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gompels et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hsiao et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Primary maternal CMV infection during pregnancy confers a 30–40% risk of transmission to the foetus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kenneson and Cannon, 2007</xref>). Pre-existing maternal CMV immunity appears to reduce the risk of cCMVi, though it is clearly imperfect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Britt, 2017</xref>). Over two-thirds of infants with cCMVi are born to seropositive women, which constitute 88.4% of women in the Kenyan community from whom these study participants were drawn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maingi and Nyamache, 2014</xref>). Moreover, the overall risk of cCMVi is directly proportional to the maternal seroprevalence in a population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Vries et al., 2013</xref>). Increasing evidence points to the importance of maternal CMV reinfection with new antigenic strains during pregnancy as a major risk factor for non-primary cCMVi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Britt, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boppana et al., 1999</xref>). Evidence that household children may be a source of maternal reinfection provides additional support for this hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boucoiran et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barbosa et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The CMV genome is the largest of the human herpesviruses. Regions of extensive sequence variability, together with high levels of recombination between different strains, result in high diversity for a DNA virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lassalle et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pokalyuk et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sackman et al., 2018</xref>). Individuals are often infected with multiple CMV strains. We have recently demonstrated that separate CMV haplotypes can be resolved from high-throughput sequencing data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cudini et al., 2019</xref>). This advance, by enabling tracking of individual genomes within mixed CMV infections, has already revealed the impact of mutation, recombination, and selection in shaping the course of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cudini et al., 2019</xref>). Here we apply these methods to CMV genomes sequenced from samples from five HIV-infected Kenyan women and their infants that were collected between 1993 and 1998 originally for studies of maternal–infant HIV transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Richardson et al., 2016</xref>). By reconstructing genome-wide haplotypes from these longitudinal samples, we are able to examine the diversity of CMV shed by HIV-infected women and the specific genotypes that are transmitted in congenital and postnatal infections, and to reconstruct the likely chronology with which specific CMV variants were transmitted from mothers to infants.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Participant characteristics, sampling, and depth of sequencing</title><p>Details of the study cohort, follow-up, sample collection, and HIV and CMV infection status and transmission have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Drake et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Roxby et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Slyker et al., 2014</xref>). Sufficient residual sample was available from the five families analysed here. To maximize the chance of recovering near full genomes, we selected samples reported in the original publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Roxby et al., 2014</xref>) to have &gt;10<sup>3</sup> copies/ml, as this is the limit at which we generally can generate whole genomes from blood.

While breast milk samples had greater than 70% coverage at depths of 10× or more, the cervical and infant samples were generally of lower depth, likely due to degradation of DNA due to the age and handling of the samples; genome coverage and mean de-duplicated read depth were directly related to actual CMV genome copy number present in the input material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). For all subsequent analysis, we removed samples with genome coverage of less than 20%.

Breast milk CMV showed high nucleotide diversity and, as has been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Suárez et al., 2019</xref>), contained a mixture of viral genotypes, some of which were as genetically distant from each other as unrelated GenBank sequences and can therefore be considered distinct viral strains. Cervical samples were of low nucleotide diversity and dominated by a single viral genotype that was, with one exception, present in lower abundance in breast milk. Our data fit with most but not all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Puchhammer-Stöckl et al., 2006</xref>) previous reports of CMV within-host compartmentalization based on genotyping of subgenomic fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hage et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kadambari et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ross et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Renzette et al., 2013</xref>). We found little evidence for widespread new superinfecting or reactivating viruses in these mothers. In line with the findings from the immunosuppressed RhCMV monkey model of congenital infection, cCMVi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vera Cruz et al., 2020</xref>) genotypes (strains) comprised families of closely related haplotypes. However, unlike the finding for congenitally transmitted gB and gL RhCMV variants, even where we found transmission of one genotype, maternal and infant haplotypes were not completely identical either in early, potentially congenital CMV infections or in postnatally transmitted viruses from breast milk. Neither were haplotypes sampled at different times from maternal breast milk conserved, suggesting a measure of de novo mutation in this patient group, in line with the previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sackman et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Our method of reconstructing viral haplotypes in serial samples provides insights into the natural history of CMV infection. While all mothers had mixtures of genotypes in breast milk, the proportions changed over time for some (families 22 and 41) and remained more stable in others. Whether expanding genotypes in mothers 22 and 41 had been recently acquired is not known but would be consistent with incident reinfection. In contrast, all infants were initially infected with a single genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), supporting a bottleneck to CMV transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cudini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vera Cruz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stanton et al., 2010</xref>). Apparent reinfection by viruses present in breast milk occurred in all four infants with multiple samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We posit that the appearance of a new strain in an infant sampled from birth can confidently be interpreted as a newly acquired exogenous virus rather than reactivation of a previously undetected one. In all cases, the reinfecting strains were genetically distant from and replaced the previously dominant strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Taken together with the rise and fall of infant CMV viral loads over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), this pattern is consistent with immunity against the infants’ first CMV strain not being protective against reinfection with antigenically distinct strains, a concept that can be further tested. Of note, reinfection with the closely related strains also appears to occur readily with both human CMV and animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boucoiran et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hansen et al., 2010</xref>). Repeated reinfection with distinct strains may explain the high genetic variability observed between sequential samples in early sequencing studies of CMV genomes from congenitally infected infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pokalyuk et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Renzette et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Those infants who tested positive at &lt;3 weeks from birth were congenitally infected by definition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boppana et al., 1999</xref>). In contrast, we cannot formally rule out cCMVi in the two others who were classified as having postnatal infection, since sensitivity of PCR detection of CMV DNA in newborn blood spots is only approximately 84% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), and newborn saliva or urine were not available. However, this is unlikely given that only a small minority of infants have cCMVi, even among those born to HIV-infected women. Furthermore, it is striking that genotypes in babies with proven cCMVi were highly similar to maternal cervical genotypes, while those with negative tests for the first 6 weeks of life were not, and the strains detected later in the blood of these two infants were most similar to those in their mothers’ breast milk.</p><p>While it has previously been noted that a severe genetic bottleneck occurs during CMV transmission from mother to foetus or infant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sackman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Renzette et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mayer et al., 2017</xref>), it remains unknown whether CMV transmitted/founder virus populations share genotypic features that confer a fitness advantage for establishing an initial infection, such as seen in HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Joseph et al., 2015</xref>). Notwithstanding the apparent dominance of one genotype in each of the cervical samples, our analysis did not show evidence for inter-patient convergence of cervical genotypes per se. Rather the three cervical genotypes that were detected in babies 12, 22, and 123, who were infected at birth showed a higher level of genetic similarity than over 99.6% of other subset comparisons and much greater than would be expected by chance (black line) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Nineteen genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) had particularly high (p&lt;0.01) similarity scores. Twelve of the 19 genes with the highest similarity scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) are part of the highly diverse RL11 gene family. Uniquely, RL11 genes form an island of linkage within the otherwise highly recombinant CMV genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lassalle et al., 2016</xref>). Phylogeny of primate CMV RL11 complexes recapitulates the evolutionary history of the cognate host, suggesting it to be a potential driver of CMV co-evolution and speciation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lassalle et al., 2016</xref>). It is intriguing that RL11 family proteins influence tissue tropism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stanton et al., 2010</xref>) or are immunomodulatory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stanton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cortese et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Van Damme and Van Loock, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pérez-Carmona et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bruno et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gabaev et al., 2014</xref>). Together with its functional properties (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) and extreme diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lassalle et al., 2016</xref>), the possibility that within-species CMV RL11 gene-family variation may also influence within-host viral adaption to different compartments and/or transplacental transmission presents a tractable hypothesis that can now be tested. cCMVi is thought to occur primarily through maternal viremia followed by replication in placental cytotrophoblasts resulting in spread to the foetus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pereira et al., 2017</xref>). The three mothers who transmitted their viruses congenitally had higher cervical viral loads than mothers whose babies become infected postpartum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Analysis of data from the whole cohort of mothers confirmed that women who transmitted CMV in utero had mean cervical CMV vial loads at 38 weeks that were 0.83 log<sub>10</sub> copies/ml (SD = 1.0, p=0.02) higher than women who did not transmit CMV in utero (data not shown) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Roxby et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore speculate that virus sampled in the cervix is representative of CMV populations that infect and cross the placenta and that a possible explanation for our findings is that the properties that promote replication to higher titres in genital tissue may also predispose to transplacental infection.</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Open reading frames (ORFs) identified by fixation index (<italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub>) as being significantly more similar in strains transmitted prenatally.</title><p>LD: Found to contain one of 33 hotspots of genetic linkage disequilibrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lassalle et al., 2016</xref>).</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">ORF</th><th valign="top">LD</th><th valign="top">Function</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">UL10</td><td valign="top">Y</td><td valign="top">Putative membrane glycoprotein.

Of interest, gB and gL, which showed considerable diversity in the congenital RhCMV model, were, as might be expected, not represented among the genes sharing significant genetic similarity in our analysis. One possibility that would unite our findings and those of the congenital RhCMV model is that CMV transmission bottlenecks are agnostic of variation in genes not implicated in transmission.</p><p>Being born to HIV-infected women is a major risk factor for cCMVi as well as long-term CMV-related complications, whether or not the child acquires HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Garcia-Knight et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gompels et al., 2012</xref>). We show here that, irrespective of the route of first infection, HEU children frequently acquire repeated infections with different CMV viruses within the first year of life. Preliminary evidence suggests that breast milk of HIV-uninfected women may have lower CMV viral loads and carry fewer strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arcangeletti et al., 2015</xref>). If this is true, the possibility that HEU, as well as HIV-infected, infants are exposed to greater numbers of CMV strains during infancy when compared with HIV-uninfected infants may provide an explanation for their worse clinical outcomes, a hypothesis that can now be tested in prospective studies. Similarly, these methods promise to be invaluable for studying the role of maternal CMV reinfection during pregnancy, a question of central importance in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Britt, 2017</xref>).</p><p>This study potentially provides several new insights into the pathogenesis of CMV infection. However, the study is limited by the small number of subjects, the fact that all women were HIV-1 infected and the lack of samples and data to absolutely confirm the route of CMV acquisition by these infants. Because we were only able to analyse maternal breast milk, cervical samples, and infant blood, and only intermittently, it is possible that some transmitted viral variants were not captured. Some, particularly cervical and blood spot samples, had low CMV viral loads and, as a result, suboptimal genome coverage. Mapping data confirmed that in these cases, sequence loss was random, excluding the possibility of systematic bias. To further address this potential bias, we subsampled samples with good coverage to identify read-depth thresholds above which the diversity estimation is robust and haplotype frequency to 5% and above is preserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Analysis of only those samples with read depths above the identified thresholds supported our overall conclusions. The quality of the sequence and the numbers of samples allowed for conclusions to be drawn at gene level only and precluded robust identification of putative motifs or single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with biological differences.</p><p>In summary, by reconstructing the individual CMV haplotypes, we found evidence for mixed CMV infection in HIV-infected women, and compartmentalization of viral strains between cervical and breast milk. Infants appeared usually to acquire one virus genotype initially, indicating a transmission bottleneck, though subsequent reinfection with a second virus from maternal breast milk was common. We also found that viruses transmitted congenitally resembled the virus genotypes that were present at highest abundance in cervix, and shared genetic features that distinguished them from CMV strains predominating in breast milk and in the cervices of women whose infants were apparently first infected post-partum. These data provide new testable insights into the pathogenesis of CMV transmission from mothers to their infants, as well as tools to unravel the importance of viral diversity for reinfection and congenital transmission, questions that are central to the development of a vaccine to prevent the global burden of disease due to CMV.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Samples were approved for research by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Washington and the Ethics and Research Committee of Kenyatta National Hospital IRB NCT00530777 and sequenced under the ULCP Biobank REC approval.

Details of this procedure are described in the associated publications. In brief, HaROLD employs a two-step process. The first step is based on the assumption that there are a limited number of haplotypes that are the same for all of the samples from a given mother/child data set, so that the differences in the frequencies of polymorphisms represent different mixtures of these haplotypes. HaROLD creates a set of haplotypes from each data set by selecting the set of haplotypes whose linear combinations optimally accounts for the observed variant frequencies. The number of haplotypes is chosen to maximize the log likelihood of the observed frequencies. The second step involves relaxing the assumption of constant haplotypes, with each sample treated individually. For each sample, reads are assigned probabilistically to the various haplotypes generated by the first step. These haplotype sequences and frequencies are then adjusted based on the assigned reads. The reads are then re-assigned to these adjusted haplotypes, and the procedure is repeated until convergence. During this process, haplotypes can be merged if that decreases the Akaike information criterion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akaike, 1973</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>, the observed distribution of such pairwise distances fits the sum of a gamma distribution (69.3%, alpha = 19.5, beta = 0.0015) and an exponential distribution (30.7%, mean = 0.01), indicative of two classes of relationships – pairs of sequences that are highly similar, modelled by the exponential, representing small accumulated variations, and pairs that are more distinct, represented by the gamma distribution. We chose the crossing point of these two distributions, at a cut-off distance of 0.017, as differentiating small variations from larger differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). We then grouped the haplotypes into clusters so that all members of a cluster have a pairwise evolutionary distance with all other members less than 0.017, resulting in 26 clusters that we refer to as genotypes. We used these groups to assign colours to the different haplotype clusters (genotypes) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p>We used <italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub> to identify sequence characteristics associated with sets of genotypes. Consensus sequences were constructed for each genotype. <italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub> values, representing the genetic difference between a subset of genotypes and the other genotypes, were calculated for each gene. p-Values and corresponding FDRs were estimated by non-parametric bootstrapping, through scrambling the bases at each position amongst the clusters. The results are shown for the 26 genotypes obtained with a cut-off distance of 0.017; changing this cut-off resulted in increased or decreased numbers of genotypes, but yielded similar results, especially for the more confident identifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Evaluating the similarity between subsets of genotypes</title><p>We use <italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub> values to identify similarities between individual genes from subsets of genotypes compared with the other genotypes. In order to compare the magnitude of the similarities of different subsets, we would like to take the sum of the <italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub> values for all genes where the similarities are real and not the result of random associations. As we cannot definitively identify these genes, we instead consider the sum of the <italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub> values for all genes weighted by our confidence that the <italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub> value is significant, represented as one minus the FDR.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Data availability</title><p>Sequence reads have been deposited in NCBI Sequence Read Archive under BioProject ID PRJNA605798.</p><p>All software used are available for download at GitHub Repository, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ucl-pathgenomics/NucleotideDiversity">https://github.com/ucl-pathgenomics/NucleotideDiversity</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ucl-pathgenomics/HAROLD">https://github.com/ucl-pathgenomics/HAROLD</ext-link>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We acknowledge the support of the MRC/NIHR UCLH/UCL Biomedical Research Centre funded Pathogen Genomics Unit.

genome sequencing and computational tools that allow haplotype reconstruction to follow individual cytomegalovirus genomes (CMV) within mixed infections in transmission by HIV-positive mothers to their infants. The report shows how novel genomic approaches and computational tools can be used to gain insights into the biology of congenital and postnatal CMV transmission. The reported observations have major implications for the understanding of the viral genetic correlates of tissue tropism and other biological properties, as well as for the development of vaccines to prevent congenital infection.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Mixed CMV genotypes in HIV positive mothers show compartmentalization and distinct patterns of transmission to infants&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Nanda Ramchandar (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting study that investigates the role of CMV (cytomegalvirus) genotype in congenital and post-natal transmission of CMV to infants born to HIV-positive mothers. The authors describe in a small group of subjects evidence of infection involving multiple strains that cluster by sample type and by family. By sampling at least 3 different sites (Cervix, Breast milk and infant blood) they trace the course of congenital CMV transmission and infection. Advances in high throughput sequencing (HTS) and HTS analysis allow the resolution of CMV haplotypes and therefore the subsequent tracking of CMV genomes from mixed CMV populations. The data presented build upon and add to the literature on this important issue and contribute to our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of CMV transmission from infected mothers to their infants.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1:</italic></p><p>1) The authors state that cervical samples were of low nucleotide diversity and dominated by a single viral genotype.

How can the authors be sure that this is not due to the clearly lower viral load in these specimens?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this important point. We also identified that samples with lower viral load generally have sequences with lower read depth (Figure 1—figure supplement 1) and that this could potentially interfere with identification of mixed infections. To address this we carried out several analyses. First, we confirmed that lower input viral loads result in low read depths (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). To determine the degree to which estimated nucleotide diversity was affected by lower read depth (i.e. viral load), we created samples with lower read depths by subsampling reads from samples with high read depths, allowing us to see how reducing the read depth affected the estimated diversity. As shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 2, sample diversity calculations are robust at average read depths of ≥5. Moreover, eight of the 18 blood spots and four of seven cervical samples had mean read depth ≥10, while family 12: cervix, baby delivery, family 22: baby 14 weeks family 14, baby 14 weeks and family 123: cervix 34 weeks, baby 10 weeks, and baby 12 months had read depths &gt;30 (Table 1). All except family 12: cervix were of low diversity (Figure 2—figure supplement 1).</p><p>Finally, to determine whether low read depths (viral loads) interfere with identification of haplotypes, we subsampled reads from the 12-month breastmilk sample from mother 12, which had a mean read depth of 779.72 and five haplotypes (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). All of the haplotypes in this sample were present at a mean read depth of 22 or more, with loss of one haplotype, present at around 5% at read depths below 22 and loss of a second haplotype present at around 8% below read depths of 11 (Figure 4—figure supplement 1).</p><p>Thus we are confident that the low nucleotide diversity we observed is not due to the lower viral load and read depth of these samples. Moreover, although there is some fall off of low level haplotypes (~5% abundance) below read depths of around 20, the method is still able to identify higher abundance haplotypes even at very low read depths.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Has the coverage of all CMV genes been sufficient and at a degree, which does justify conclusions withdrawn from Figure 5?</p></disp-quote><p>We used haplotype sequences for the FST analysis shown in Figure 5. As shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 1, the program we used for haplotype reconstruction (HaROLD) performs well even at low read depth. Moreover, HaROLD’s approach is to consider all reads at each position, integrating data from every sample in which the haplotype is found and give a confidence level on how likely the base is genuine at that position. If the read coverage is not sufficient, the position will be indicated as a gap (missing data) and this position is excluded in all downstream analyses. In the FST test, lack of data simply gives no statistical support to that gene, meaning that genes with low coverage would not result in false positives. Undoubtedly there might be a small number of genes that we have missed (false negatives); however, by reconstructing haplotypes using longitudinally taken samples and creating a consensus, the numbers of gaps are minimised and thus the number of missing significant genetic associations reduced.</p><p>3) In the Materials and methods it is stated that 5 non-HIV infected children were selected, while according to the results obviously one HIV-infected child was included.</p><p>We apologise for the confusion.

They need to explain much more clearly what is meant by this as it seems critical.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rewritten this section to clarify this point. We are interested in understanding whether there are genetic similarities between the genotypes from different mother-baby pairs found in similar compartments. In our analysis, we observed such similarities between genotypes that underwent congenital transmission. Assuming that the distribution in genotypes occurred after infection of the mother, this indicates that similar genetic changes occurred in multiple mothers and that the viruses with these genetic changes were more likely to transmit congenitally. This is what we mean by “viral convergence”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) I didn't understand Figure 5 (nor were the x-axis labels legible) or Figure 5—figure supplement 2.</p><p>Nor did I understand the paragraph:</p><p>“The FST analysis identified 19 genes as likely to be contributing to the genetic similarity between congenitally transmitted genotypes from mothers 12, 22, 123 (FDR &lt; 0.05) (Figure 5).

Needs further explanation.</p></disp-quote><p>FST is a statistical way of identifying genetic similarity between a set of sequences relative to sequences not in that set. The FST test first identified that the genotypes present in the cervices of mothers who transmitted congenitally, and their congenitally infected infants were more similar than could be explained by chance (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). The genes responsible for this high level of genetic similarity were identified in Figure 5. These findings together with demonstration in Figure 4, that only a single genotype is transmitted from mother to baby at any one time, provides evidence that there is generally a bottleneck to maternal-fetal transmission of CMV, whether from breast milk or congenitally, and that certain genotypes may be preferentially transmitted in congenital infection</p><p>The y-axis of Figure 5 shows the FST values calculated from this analysis. The higher the FST value, the more significant it is. Each bar represents a gene. We have now increased the font size on the x-axis to make it more legible. The colour of the bars indicates the corresponding p values, with red being the most significant genes.</p><p>We know from studies of primary cCMV that maternal viral load is a key factor for transmission. The three mothers transmitting their virus congenitally had higher cervical viral loads than mothers whose babies become infected post-partum (Figure 1). Analysis of data from the whole cohort of mothers confirmed that women who transmitted CMV in utero had mean cervical CMV vial loads at 38 weeks that were 0.83 log<sub>10</sub> copies/ml (SD=1.0, p=0.02) higher than women who did not transmit CMV in utero (data not shown). We therefore speculate that virus sampled in the cervix is representative of CMV populations that infect and cross the placenta, and that a possible explanation for our findings is that the properties that promote replication to higher titers in genital tissue may also predispose to transplacental infection. Such properties may include increased tropism for and replication in the urogenital tissues and it is possible that the genes identified by FST are contributary.</p><p>Alternatively, a number of genes identified in the FST analysis are known to control cell entry and NK cell recognition (the placenta is rich in NK cells) (Table 2). Thus the genotypes that were transmitted congenitally might have beneficial characteristics that allow them to better engage with the placental tissues and hence transmit to the infants.</p><p>We have added this to the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
