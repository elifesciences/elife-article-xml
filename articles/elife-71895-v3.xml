so rapid and economically feasible methods should be used to quantify diversity and distribution patterns. We have attempted to overcome current impediments to the gathering of biodiversity data by using integrative phylogenomic and three mtDNA fragment analyses. As a model, we sequenced the Metriorrhynchini beetle fauna, sampled from ~700 localities in three continents. The species-rich dataset included ~6500 terminals, ~ 1850 putative species delimited at 5% uncorrected pairwise threshold, possibly ~1000 of them unknown to science. Neither type of data could alone answer our questions on biodiversity and phylogeny. The phylogenomic backbone enabled the integrative delimitation of robustly defined natural genus-group units that will inform future research. Using constrained mtDNA analysis, we identified the spatial structure of species diversity, very high species-level endemism, and a biodiversity hotspot in New Guinea. We suggest that focused field research and subsequent laboratory and bioinformatic workflow steps would substantially accelerate the inventorying of any hyperdiverse tropical group with several thousand species. The outcome would be a scaffold for the incorporation of further data from environmental sequencing and ecological studies. The database of sequences could set a benchmark for the spatiotemporal evaluation of biodiversity, would support evidence-based conservation planning, and would provide a robust framework for systematic, biogeographic, and evolutionary studies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>phylogenomics</kwd><kwd>biodiversity</kwd><kwd>conservation</kwd><kwd>mtDNA</kwd><kwd>net-winged beetles</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001824</institution-id><institution>Grantová Agentura České Republiky</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18-14942S</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bocak</surname><given-names>Ladislav</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Integrated phylogenomics and mitochondrial DNA inventory of net-winged beetles across three continents suggest ~1000 undescribed species, biodiversity hot spots, and phylogeny-based classification that sets up the basis for further research.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The number of known insects surpasses that of all other terrestrial groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Mora et al., 2011</xref>), and we need much more detailed information to fully understand their diversity. Currently, the available biodiversity data are far from complete, and the majority of insect species remain undescribed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Novotny et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Srivathsan et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, robust phylogenetic hypotheses are lacking for most lineages, and the genera and tribes are often artificial assemblages which are not relevant to evolutionary and biodiversity research. Therefore, we need to gather new information in order to advance our understanding of evolutionary and genetic relationships, and to build a phylogenetic scaffold for comprehensive taxonomic, biogeographic, and evolutionary studies that would be indispensable for biodiversity management.</p><p>Descriptive, morphology-based insect systematics is not keeping pace with the rapid loss and degradation of natural habitats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Theng et al., 2020</xref>), and with the ongoing decline in insect abundance as a result of human activities and climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">van Klink et al., 2020</xref>). The largest taxonomic journal, <italic>Zootaxa</italic>, published almost 30,000 studies describing &gt;60,000 new species and these represent over a quarter of all new animal species reported in 2001–2020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Zhang, 2021</xref>). Although these numbers are impressive, they also show how labor-intensive is taxonomic research if, in average, only two new species are reported in a publication. To accelerate the cataloguing of biodiversity, it is vital to gather new material suitable for molecular analyses and to combine available molecular methods with traditional approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Riedel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Srivathsan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Yeo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Sharkey et al., 2021</xref>). DNA data are indisputably a valuable source for modern biodiversity research, and they can address both shallow and deep relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Tautz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hajibabaei et al., 2007</xref>). There are two principal sources of short-fragment data: voucher-based DNA sequences typically produced by systematists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Riedel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Yeo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Sharkey et al., 2021</xref>), and DNA sequences produced by an ecosystem-based sequencing that does not associate individual samples with Linnean names (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andújar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Srivathsan et al., 2019</xref>). It is the responsibility of systematic biologists to assemble the natural system, that is, we need to reliably delimit genus- and tribe-level taxa, to make their ecological and distribution attributes informative. But the short fragments are often unsuitable for the building of deep phylogenies and large genomic datasets need to be used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">McKenna et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baca et al., 2021</xref>). These include transcriptomes, whole genome sequences and anchored hybrid capture datasets. Using all information, a robust and stable natural classification will significantly facilitate detailed research into the spatial and temporal distribution of biodiversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Morrison et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Thomson et al., 2018</xref>). As an ultimate goal, we should attempt to construct a complete tree of life, or at least its backbone, which is invaluable in aiding the selection of groups for more detailed analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Chesters, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">McKenna et al., 2019</xref>). With a well-defined high-level classification, it is paramount to exploit all accessible data. We assume that voucher-based molecular phylogenies provide much-needed tools to researchers working on site-based biodiversity assessments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andújar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Srivathsan et al., 2019</xref>) and that, in turn, the data produced by environmental and ecosystem-focused sequencing contribute to building the tree-of-life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arribas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bocak et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We have used hyperdiverse tropical metriorrhynchine beetles (Coleoptera, Lycidae, Metriorrhynchini) as our model. This net-winged beetle tribe contains &gt;1500 recognised species, mostly found in the Old-World tropics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), and their classification is complicated by the complex taxonomic history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bocak et al., 2020</xref>; see Appendix introductory information). The phenetic plasticity of Metriorrhynchini is relatively high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>), but many distant species resemble each other due to convergent selection in Mullerian rings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Bocek et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Motyka et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Motyka et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, unrelated taxa were often assumed to be closely related due to misleading morphological similarities. Although there are over 40 genera in the tribe, three-quarters of the species have been described in five ambiguously defined genera (<italic>Xylobanus</italic>, <italic>Cautires</italic>, <italic>Trichalus</italic>, <italic>Metriorrhynchus</italic>, and <italic>Cladophorus</italic>). Sometimes a single genus contains species from different subtribes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bocak et al., 2020</xref>). In this respect, the Metriorrhynchini is a typical species-rich tropical insect group without well-founded classification and the paucity and inaccuracy of available data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Letsch et al., 2020</xref>). As a result, unlike vertebrates, these poorly known insect groups have not been considered for use in large-scale, integrative projects and data metanalyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Myers et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Holt et al., 2013</xref>) and have contributed little to our understanding of global biodiversity patterns.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Distribution and appearance of metriorrhynchine net-winged beetles.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Distribution of Metriorrhynchini with major sampled localities designated by red dots.

Our investigation comprised four distinct steps. First, we assembled material from several hundred localities on three continents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Second, as hyperdiverse groups are difficult to tackle and the current classification is unreliable, we attempted to compartmentalise diversity using phylogenomics. We then produced a tree, using all available data, to estimate species limits, intraspecific genetic variability, and species ranges. Finally, the tree was pruned and used to estimate shallow phylogenetic relationships, total and regional species diversity, and endemicity, and to define generic ranges and continental-scale range shifts. The applied methods of transcriptome and mtDNA analyses are widely used. The genomic datasets dominate among works focusing on deep relationships (transcriptomes and anchored hybrid capture; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Misof et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Kusy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">McKenna et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baca et al., 2021</xref>). The mitochondrial markers have been used mainly to study the phylogeny of restricted clades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Toussaint et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Sharkey et al., 2021</xref>). Until now, the genomic and mitochondrial data have seldom been combined to get simultaneously the phylogenetic backbone for the mid-rank classification (subtribes, groups of genera, generic limits) and the estimations of species diversity (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Talavera et al., 2021</xref>). Our information and phylogenetic hypotheses can be a resource for higher level phylogenetics, population genetics, phylogeographic studies, and biodiversity estimation. At the same time, we want to show how limited our taxonomical knowledge is and how this lack is hindering biodiversity research and management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Thomson et al., 2018</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>The numbers of sampled localities per region.</title><p>Details in <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Area</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Localities</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Area</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Localities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Australian region</bold></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom"><bold>298</bold></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Sino-Jap. region</bold></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom"><bold>79</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Australia</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">118</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">China</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">51</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">New Guinea &amp; Solomons</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">179</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Japan</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">28</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">New Zealand</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Wallacea</bold></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom"><bold>49</bold></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Moluccas</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">15</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Oriental region</bold></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom"><bold>206</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sulawesi</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">34</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">S.India &amp; Ceylon</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">E.India &amp; Burma</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">12</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Afrotropical Region</bold></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom"><bold>64</bold></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">E.Indo-Burma</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">44</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">West Africa</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Malay Peninsula</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">57</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Guinean Gulf</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">11</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sumatra</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">23</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ethiopia</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">6</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Java &amp; Bali</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">15</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">East Africa</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">10</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Philippines</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">33</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">South Africa</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">25</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Madagascar</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">11</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Total</bold></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom"><bold>696</bold></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sampling of the Metriorrhynchini range</title><p>In total, we monitored almost 800 localities, 696 of them with occurrences of the Metriorrhynchini (Tabs. 1, <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>).

Molecular data cannot replace morphology-based taxonomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Thomson et al., 2018</xref>), but the analyses of our dataset complement and facilitate traditional biodiversity research in several directions. Our first step is to compartmentalize hyperdiverse Metriorrhynchini into manageable natural units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The densely sampled phylogeny identifies tribal and generic limits. It provides a useful foundation for detailed taxonomic research through the identification of weak areas in earlier classifications and points out the clades with undescribed diversity and non-monophyletic genera (e.g. several hundred species of <italic>Ditua</italic> and paraphyletic <italic>Metriorrhynchus</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig15">Appendix 1—figure 15</xref>). Furthermore, the analyses of species-rich datasets identify the areas with high species diversity as one of the critical conservation value parameters (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baselga, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Srivathsan et al., 2019</xref>). Traditional taxonomic research costs time and money, and the number of newly described species is relatively low if we consider the enormous diversity of tropical insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Novotny et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Sangster and Luksenburg, 2015</xref>). Therefore, we use DNA-based units as a provisional descriptor of species diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hebert et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Monaghan et al., 2009</xref>), and subsequently as a source for integrative taxonomy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1 sdata2 sdata3">Source data 1–3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Srivathsan et al., 2019</xref>).

Using phylogenomics and voucher-based sequencing, we show that taxonomic literature has provided insufficient and sometimes erroneous information, even after the formal consolidation of scattered descriptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bocak et al., 2020</xref>). We show that a taxon-focused continental scale project can effectively assemble comprehensive data for diversity of tropical insects.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Continent-wide taxon-specific monitoring of biodiversity: feasibility and impediments</title><p>Tissue and DNA archives have become critical in the assessment of biodiversity status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hajibabaei et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Blom, 2021</xref>). Although museomics is a potentially valuable source of data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gauthier et al., 2020</xref>), in our case, museum collections are insufficient for filling data gaps due to the scarcity of material. For example, the Metriorrhynchini collection deposited in the Natural History Museum in London contains &lt;3000 specimens, whereas there are ~6500 terminals in our dataset. At the beginning of our study, we faced critical absence of primary data. Therefore, we conducted intensive field research to obtain samples for a realistic assessment of the extant Metriorrhynchini diversity. We processed samples from our expeditions (most of which were focused on a range of topics over two decades between 2001 and 2019) and samples obtained through extensive collaboration with other researchers, both local and visiting, and with local naturalists whose contribution has increased with the growing number of citizen science projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jaskula et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">MacPhail and Colla, 2020</xref>). In such a way, we assembled a Metriorrhynchini tissue collection from almost 700 localities in three continents (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). For several reasons our sampling is partly biased. We noted the serious loss of natural habitat in many regions. Previously described species were often collected in vicinity of seaports, but the lowland ecosystems are rapidly disappearing due to human exploitation. Therefore, type localities of many described species could not be sampled during recent expeditions and species known from museum collections are missing in our DNA dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jiruskova et al., 2019</xref>). The habitat loss in South East Asia also affects other animal groups, and lowland primary forests are seriously endangered in the whole region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Sodhi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Theng et al., 2020</xref>). Further sampling bias is a consequence of the unsafe conditions and logistic problems in large areas of West Africa, Sahel, and the Congo Basin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), where net-winged beetles have not been systematically studied since the 1930s. Additional data gaps are caused by strict biodiversity research restrictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Prathapan, 2018</xref>). Regardless of these limitations, we believe that the assembled dataset is a foundation for a robust classification framework and a soundly based assessment of biodiversity. Our results show the importance of field research for biodiversity studies and systematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Basset and Lamarre, 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Phylogenetic relationships: a scaffold for targeted research</title><p>Unresolved taxonomy is a common reason for the exclusion of specific groups from biodiversity research projects and this omission has an effect on conservation policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gutiérrez and Helgen, 2013</xref>). The current phylogenomic and mitogenomic phylogenetic hypotheses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1 sdata2 sdata3">Source data 1–3</xref>) supersede the morphology-based topologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bocak, 2002</xref>). The phylogenomic analysis incorporates a large amount of information, and we favor this method over morphological traits and short DNA sequences, both of which contain uncertainties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">McKenna et al., 2019</xref>). Phylogenomics has resolved subtribe relationships and their internal structures. The analyzed 35 transcriptomes and low-coverage genomes were sufficient to identify five major Metriorrhynchina clades with several hundred putative species each and also to identify the limits of genera, which can be tested using traditional taxonomic methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1 sdata2 sdata3">Source data 1–3</xref>).</p><p>The sampling strategy is critical for building a phylogenomic backbone. Our goal was to cover as many deep lineages as possible and simultaneously to limit the number of sequenced RNA samples to avoid high costs. Therefore, we sequenced RNAlater preserved tissues and conspecific vouchers prior to assigning tissue samples for transcriptomic analyses. In this way, two rounds of sequencing provided us with critical information based on evenly distributed anchor taxa. In the next step, we re-analyzed the short-fragment dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) using constrained positions for taxa whose relationships had already been recovered through phylogenomics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). A stabilized phylogenomic backbone is critical for inferring a robust topology because the large-scale analyses of short mtDNA fragments are sensitive, even to the application of starting seeds, and they often produce topologies incongruent with morphological traits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Sklenarova et al., 2014</xref>). Only several small lineages have remained unanchored by genomic data, owing to a lack of properly fixed samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata2 sdata3">Source data 2 and 3</xref>). For example, four small clades are much more deeply rooted than their morphology suggests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata2">Source data 2</xref>) and additional data are needed to place them in a phylogenetic context. Despite some contentious relationships that need further investigation, 35 genomic samples, that is under 2% of species, sufficiently supported relationships among most terminal clades that approximately represent genera, groups of genera and subtribes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Talavera et al., 2021</xref> have shown that only six nuclear markers for 5%–10% of terminals can similarly stabilize the phylogeny of a species rich model group. We assume, that the combination of genomic and short DNA data can be valuable for building of the species-level trees of life.</p><p>We identified a substantial conflict between phylogenomic analyses, morphology-based classifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bocak, 2002</xref> and earlier studies cited therein), and the analyses of a few short DNA fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Sklenarova et al., 2014</xref>, Appendix introductory information). Our analyses confirm the monophyly of the recently described Cautirina and Metanoeina and redefined Metriorrhynchina except several unanchored lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Sklenarova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Sklenarova et al., 2014</xref>), but, for the first time, we can robustly recover subtribal relationships (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). We reject most internal splits suggested by morphological and mtDNA analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bocak, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Sklenarova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Sklenarova et al., 2014</xref> and earlier studies cited therein). The present delimitation of five monophyla within Metriorrhynchina resolves the backbone of the subtribe that was contentious due to high levels of homoplasy in Sanger and morphology-based datasets. Similarly, some generic concepts are questioned as they have been mostly based on highly homoplastic traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Sklenarova et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Kusy et al., 2019</xref>). The taxonomic studies must consider the morphology along with molecular hypotheses. As morphology is not described in this study, we do not discuss the limits of individual genera and report only short information on newly defined subclades (Appendix results).</p><p>Our approach yielded a constrained phylogeny with 6429 terminals and almost 2000 mOTUs using 5% mtDNA distance threshold, and this provides the basis for the approximation of species diversity for constituent subclades and geographic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata2 sdata3">Source data 2 and 3</xref>). Concerning the extent of diversity, phylogenomic and mitochondrial data must be simultaneously analysed to provide a strong foundation for subsequent investigations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Talavera et al., 2021</xref>). Phylogenomics cannot deal with thousands of species, and mitogenomic data are insufficient for the construction of robust deep relationships. The final steps are morphological validation of the proposed generic groups and genera (see Appendix results) and, in the future, formal descriptions of biodiversity using the Linnean classification. In such a way, the results of phylogenomic and mitogenomic inventory should be incorporated in the formal classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Godfray and Knapp, 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Species diversity: literature data and reality</title><p>Here, we deal with a species rich tropical beetle tribe (&gt; 1500 described species), and therefore we use the uncorrected pairwise distance thresholds for our diversity estimation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig14">Appendix 1—figure 14</xref>). The application of any threshold is a compromise between estimation accuracy, speed, and sequencing costs, taking into account the feasibility of inventorying a hyperdiverse group within a limited time frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hebert et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dupuis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Eberle et al., 2020</xref>). Several taxonomical works on Metriorrhynchini have simultaneously analysed mtDNA fragments, nuclear genes, morphology, and ecology (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bocak and Yagi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kalousova and Bocak, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Bocek et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jiruskova et al., 2019</xref>), but their results cannot robustly defend an application of a distance threshold for the whole tribe. To avoid a possibility of diversity overestimation, we base further discussion on the 5% distance. We assume that such a threshold might be sufficiently cautious. Future taxonomic revisions are surely needed for the validation of here presented data on species diversity.</p><p>When analysing the <italic>cox1</italic> mtDNA fragment, we identified 1,848 mOTUs at 5% threshold and the numbers of delimited mOTUs indicate that, the substantial part of species diversity remains undescribed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig14">Appendix 1—figure 14</xref>). Additionally, the slope representing the relationship between the number of mOTUs and distance thresholds was gradual (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig14">Appendix 1—figure 14</xref>) due to a high number of genetically distant, indisputably distinct lineages in the dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig14">Appendix 1—figure 14</xref>).</p><p>Our approach provides information about the diversity of the internal lineages. Metriorrhynchina is by far the most diverse group, within which the cladophorines comprise the largest clade (490 mOTUs, e.g, <italic>Ditua</italic> historically has included 2 spp., now ~250 spp.). The porrostomine clade is the next diverse group (373 mOTUs) and contains the speciose <italic>Porrostoma</italic> (126 mOTUs) and a paraphyletic series of lineages whose species have conventionally been placed in <italic>Metriorrhynchus</italic>. The differences between previously published data and our results are substantial and they question any reanalyses of literature data without prior verification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bocak, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bocak et al., 2020</xref> references therein; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata2 sdata3">Source data 2 and 3</xref>).</p><p>The numbers of mOTUs must be interpreted in the context of the sampling activity in each region. We did not use standardized protocols due to the long-term character of our research, the incorporation of some samples provided by other researchers, and the necessity to apply appropriate collecting methods to maximize the number of recorded species in various ecosystems and under different weather conditions. We identified only 94 mOTUs from the Afrotropical region, mainly due to the limited number of collecting trips by authors (64 localities) and the inaccessibility of some areas. Despite intensive field research (33 localities), we collected from the Philippines less than one third of the species described (33 mOTUs). Our collection activities in the Philippines were hindered by substantial loss of natural habitats, and this is soon expected to be the case in other regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Sodhi et al., 2004</xref>). The number of species known from the Sundaland (114 localities) was approximately equal to the number of sequenced mOTUs despite disproportionately intensive collecting effort by the authors. Even after numerous expeditions to the Sundaland, many regions remain unsampled. As metriorrhynchine species ranges are small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jiruskova et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Motyka et al., 2020</xref>), the number of species will probably increase in the future. The proportion of new species was regionally ~70% if DNA data and morphology were considered in detailed taxonomic studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jiruskova et al., 2019</xref>). While these regions house numerous unknown species, we found New Guinea to be exceptionally diverse, with almost three times the number of species reported in the literature (1,105 mOTUs at 5% threshold; 175 localities, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Despite the relatively large number of sampled localities, many areas of New Guinea remain unexplored and many places were only superficially sampled by colleagues and never visited by the authors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Additional species were added to the dataset with each batch of sequenced samples from New Guinea and the area possibly houses much higher diversity than documented by the present study.</p><p>We observed a high turnover between regions, and few species had ranges which included landmasses separated by shallow seas (seven spp. Queensland / New Guinea, 9 spp. in Southeast Asia; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>). Poorly dispersing lycids generally have very small ranges, except for the few genera that visit flowers and fly in open areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Motyka et al., 2021</xref>). A similar small-scale turnover has recently been reported along altitudinal gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Bocek et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Motyka et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Motyka et al., 2021</xref>). A high turnover indicates a large proportion of hidden diversity, especially in tropical mountains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Merckx et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mastretta-Yanes et al., 2018</xref>). Mountain fauna is especially vulnerable to climate change and its inventorying is urgently needed.</p><p>The Metriorrhynchini has recently received considerable attention in taxonomic studies, and 302 species have been described by several authors over the past three decades, making a total of 1574 formally described species (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kazantsev, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bocak et al., 2020</xref>; Appendix introductory information). Although the recent 24% increase in described diversity appears substantial, the distance-based analysis indicates the presence of almost 2000 mOTUs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig14">Appendix 1—figure 14</xref>). An additional ~50 putative species (494 terminals) were identified, but this identification was only based on divergent morphology because of the absence of <italic>cox1</italic>. We assume that our sampling represents only a subset of all known species (&lt; 50%). It means that the dataset contains ~1000 undescribed species. At the current rate, formal morphological descriptions of an additional 1000 species would take decades or hundreds of years. This is a very long time in the context of the ongoing deforestation and fragmentation of natural habitats, and currently undocumented diversity might be lost long before it can be catalogued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Brooks et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Sodhi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ceballos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Theng et al., 2020</xref>). The rapid DNA-based inventory is an effective shortcut for obtaining basic information on the true diversity of tropical beetles and for setting a benchmark for future biodiversity re-evaluations.</p><p>The results reveal major biodiversity hotspots in New Guinea and the Sundaland. Tropical rainforests currently cover most of New Guinea, a tectonically young island that has not been considered a biodiversity hotspot for vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Myers et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hall, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Toussaint et al., 2014</xref>). In the case of net-winged beetles, we show that the New Guinean fauna is phylogenetically diverse, spatially heterogeneous, and extremely rich as regards both the number of species and the endemic genera (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Additionally, the large clades of New Guinean species indicate that the diversification of major lineages preceded the uplift of the islands, and possibly started on the northern margin of the Australian craton and adjacent islands. Southeast Asia is a centre of phylogenetic diversity at the tribal level; its fauna contains all principal lineages and the highest diversity of Cautirina but is smaller than those of New Guinea. The Afrotropical and Palearctic regions represent only recently populated low-diversity outposts.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Impact of biodiversity inventorying on biogeographical and evolutionary research</title><p>Detailed data on Metriorrhynchini diversity indicate low dispersal propensity and this makes Metriorrhynchini a promising model for biogeographic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ikeda et al., 2012</xref>).

If a putative neotenic species is discovered, a comprehensive reference database of the group may identify its closest relatives. We used our data to place the East African <italic>Cautires apterus</italic> in a phylogenetic context, and the results indicated that it may be the youngest neotenic taxon of all net-winged beetles (36.1 my, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Our extensive DNA database of metriorrhynchine diversity may also play an important role in the study of the evolution of mimicry.

The placement of sexually dimorphic species in the phylogeny suggests that the shift to dimorphism was very recent (3.0 mya at the earliest) and began when both sexes were small-bodied. Mimetic sexual polymorphism is well understood in butterflies with non-mimetic males and mimetic females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kunte, 2008</xref>), but the advergence of males and females to different aposematic models has only recently been reported in two subfamilies of net-winged beetles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Motyka et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Motyka et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Motyka et al., 2021</xref>).

We assume that different patterns of biodiversity distribution can be revealed if other animal groups are studied. Reliable information on additional groups can focus our conservation efforts on valuable regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Morrison et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Thomson et al., 2018</xref>). Our model, beetles, is the most speciose group of animals but is much less known than vertebrates. Therefore, new data must be generated, and our research workflow must use innovations to economically produce the large-scale phylogenetic hypothesis for a high number of species. We conducted a worldwide sampling in ~700 localities, analysed transcriptomes, genomes, and mitochondrial markers, and validated our results with morphology. We show that the constrained position of less than 2% terminals increases the stability of tree topology and the congruence of molecular hypotheses with morphological traits (Appendix results). By the simultaneous consideration of genomic and mitochondrial phylogenetic signal, we achieved substantial progress with respect to the development of a Metriorrhynchini tree of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Chesters, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Linard et al., 2016</xref>).

Despite limited time and funding, we identified almost 2000 mOTUs which indicate that there are at least twice more species than the number reported in the literature. This means that, at a conservative estimate, ~ 1000 species in the dataset were previously unknown to science. Furthermore, we identified New Guinea as a biodiversity hotspot, which is in clear contrast with studies identifying the biodiversity patterns of vertebrates. Our large-scale inventory shows that the literature records of tropical beetles cannot be used for biodiversity conservation and metanalyses without critical revision. We suggest that if focused field research is conducted even by a small research group and subsequent workflow steps are applied to any hyperdiverse tropical group, the results can set a benchmark for future evaluation of spatiotemporal changes in biodiversity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Field research</title><p>The analyzed individuals had been accumulated by numerous expeditions to various regions of the Metriorrhynchini range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>).

Local posterior probabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Sayyari and Mirarab, 2016</xref>) and quartet frequencies of the internal branches in every species tree were calculated using the parameter ‘-t = 2’. Pie charts representing quartet scores for the given topology and two alternatives were plotted to the resulting species trees in R using plot_Astral_trees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bellot, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, we studied the effect of potentially confounding signals, like non-random distribution of data coverage and violations of SRH conditions, on our phylogenetic reconstructions with the Four-cluster likelihood mapping (FcLM) approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Strimmer and Haeseler, 1997</xref>) implemented in IQ-TREE2. Based on the results of our tree reconstructions, we tested the hypotheses about the alternative placement of leptotrichaline and procautirine clades.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Mitochondrial DNA sequencing and data analysis</title><p>Total DNA was extracted from the metathorax with a Wizard SV96 kit (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). The yield was measured using a NanoDrop-1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, Waltham, MA). The PCR settings and cycle sequencing conditions were the same as those used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bocak et al., 2008</xref>. Three fragments of mitochondrial genome were sequenced: <italic>cox1</italic>+ tRNA <italic>Leu+ cox2</italic> (~1100 bp), <italic>rrnL</italic>+ tRNA <italic>Leu+ nad1</italic> (~800 bp), and ~1210 bp of <italic>nad5</italic> and adjacent tRNA-<italic>Phe</italic>, tRNA-<italic>Glu</italic>, and tRNA-<italic>Ser</italic> mtDNA (the mtDNA fragments are further mentioned as <italic>rrnL</italic>, <italic>cox1</italic>, and <italic>nad5</italic>). The PCR products were purified using PCRu96 Plates (Merck Millipore Inc, Burlington, MA) and sequenced by an ABI 3130 (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA) sequencer using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit 1.1 (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA). Sequences were edited using Sequencher v.4.9 software (Gene Codes Corp., Ann Arbor, MI). Altogether 6476 individuals were analyzed including some previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Sklenarova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Bocek and Bocak, 2019</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>cox1</italic> gene fragment was used to OTUs delimitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blaxter et al., 2005</xref>) using CD-hit-est (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Fu et al., 2012</xref>) and different thresholds (from similarity 0.99–0.90 by 0.05 steps). Therefore, we assembled two datasets: (A) the dataset containing all sequenced individuals and (B) all OTUs delineated by 0.98 similarity of the <italic>cox1</italic> gene. The <italic>rrnL</italic> and <italic>tRNAs</italic> were aligned using MAFFT 7.2 with Q-INS-I algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Katoh and Standley, 2013</xref>), protein-coding genes were eye-checked for stop codons and aligned using Trans-Align (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bininda-Emonds, 2005</xref>). All fragments were concatenated using FasConCat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kück and Longo, 2014</xref>) and analyzed under maximum-likelihood criterium in IQ-TREE v.2.1.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Minh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table5">Appendix 1—table 5</xref>). To assess the branch supports values, we used SH-aLRT test with 1000 iterations. ModelFinder tool implemented in IQ-TREE was used to identify the best fit models using the Bayesian Information Criterion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Chernomor et al., 2016</xref>). The results of the TSA/WGS analyses were used to constrain basal topology among major clades of Metriorrhynchini in both analyses of datasets A and B. Further, we ran unconstrained analyses of the above-mentioned datasets with identical settings except -g option to compare results. We replicated constrained tree search nineteen-times and compared resulting trees using Robinson–Foulds distances in R package phangorn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Schliep, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table2">Appendix 1—table 2</xref>).

tropical family of Elateroidea and Metriorrhynchini is the largest lycid tribe with almost 1600 species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Masek et al., 2018</xref>). The history of their classification started with Kleine’s proposals of tribes and/or subfamilies Metriorrhynchini/inae, Trichalini/inae, Cladophorini/inae, and Dilolycini/inae (see an overview by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kleine, 1933</xref>). The supergeneric classification of net-winged beetles was later revised. Conderini were merged with Metriorrhynchini and Trichalini in the widely defined Metriorrhynchinae and Cladophorini and Dilolycini were synonymized to Metriorrhynchini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bocak, 2002</xref> and references therein). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Calder, 1998</xref> considered Metriorhynchinae Kleine, 1926 (based on <italic>Metriorhynchus</italic> Guérin-Méneville, 1838) to be a homonym of the crocodilian subfamily Metriorhynchinae Meyer, 1832 and used Dilolycinae Kleine, 1926 as a replacement name. Trichalinae were placed as a tribe Trichalini in Metriorrhynchinae or a subtribe Trichalina in Metriorrhynchini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bocak, 2002</xref>). Additionally, Hemiconderina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bocak et al., 2008</xref> were erected for <italic>Hemiconderis</italic> and related genera. Detailed information on the metriorrhynchine classification history was published in the latest revision of the subtribal classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Sklenarova et al., 2014</xref>) and the genera were assigned to subtribes by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kubecek et al., 2015</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bocak et al., 2020</xref>.</p><p>The alpha-taxonomy is mostly based on the original, often uninformative descriptions (catalogued by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kleine, 1933</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bocak et al., 2020</xref>).

They are similarly common in New Guinea (423 spp.) and the Wallacea (176 spp.). Although highly diversified (261 spp. and 231 spp., respectively), they represent only about 30% of described net-winged beetle species in the Oriental and Afrotropical regions where similar numbers of species belong to Platerodini, Calochromini and Lycini, or several small tribes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Masek et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The tribe Metriorrhynchini has a Gondwanan distribution, and the range reaches to the Palearctic East Asia (Russian Far East, Cautirina and Metanoeina). Additionally, the tribe is well represented in the Sino-Japanese realm sensu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Holt et al., 2013</xref> (China, Japan, Cautirina and Metanoeina in the whole area, Metriorrhynchina in southernmost China only) and in the Oriental realm (most of India, Sri Lanka, the lower elevations of the Himalayas, Indo-Burma, Malaya, the Great and Lesser Sundas, the Philippines). Further, the tribe is widespread in the Oceanian realm, especially in its western part (the Moluccas, New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and a few islands further east) and in the Australian realm (Australia, Tasmania, and one introduced species in New Zealand). The Afrotropical realm houses relatively diversified fauna in forest and savannah habitats, but all species belong to Cautirina and represent only two clades which correspond with putative independent colonization events from drifting India to Madagascar and continental Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Sklenarova et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The subtribes differ in their distribution. Metriorrhynchina is mostly Oceanian and Australian, relatively rich Metriorrhynchina fauna is known from the Sulawesi, much less species occur in the Philippines and only a few species of <italic>Diatrichalus</italic>, <italic>Leptotrichalus</italic>, <italic>Trichalus</italic>, <italic>Microtrichalus</italic>, and <italic>Metriorrhynchus</italic> in the eastern part of the Oriental realm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bocak and Yagi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Bocek and Bocak, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Bocek et al., 2019</xref>) and southern Yunnan in the Sino-Japanese realm.

In the taxonomy of this group, we face the burden of uninformative descriptions (e.g. the studies by the French entomologist M. Pic in the first half of the 20th century). The careless classification of newly described species, inaccessibility of type-holding collections or their poor organization, and legal regulations limit taxonomic research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Prathapan, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bocak et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s8-3"><title>Biology</title><p>The adults are volatile, but they are poor dispersers due to their soft-bodiedness and many species remain in shaded situations under the canopy, usually sitting on leaves.

Relationships among subtribes have been based on the similarity of larvae and ambiguously supported by Sanger data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Sklenarova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Sklenarova et al., 2014</xref>). Our results imply that bipartite larval terga can be inferred either as a synapomorphy of Metriorrhynchini with reversal to entire tergites in Cautirina or we must alternatively consider their independent origin in Metanoeina and Metriorrhynchina. The mapping of the character on the phylogenomic tree needs two instead of a single step as earlier supposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Sklenarova et al., 2014</xref>). When most larvae are unknown and their morphology variable, the phylogenetic hypotheses based on incomplete morphological data and uncertain polarity urgently need validation from independent sources of information.</p><p>Due to quite high morphological disparity and ambiguous interpretation of some morphological characters, there were proposed subfamilies, tribes, and/or subtribes for various subsets of genera now placed in the Metriorrhynchina (Metriorrhynchinae/ini, Cladophorinae/ini, Trichalinae/ini, Dilolycinae/ini, Hemiconderina, and possibly Melanerotini, now in Lycidae <italic>incertae sedis</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bocak, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kazantsev, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Kusy et al., 2019</xref>). Phylogenomics reject the possibility to assign a high rank to Trichalini and Hemiconderina as numerous coordinated taxa would have to be erected to make all groups reciprocally monophyletic and keep the earlier proposed names valid.</p><p>The phylogenomic analyses reinforce the previously identified monophyly of the trichaline clade (=earlier Trichalini part; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Bocek and Bocak, 2017</xref>), but simultaneously suggest their delayed origin as a terminal clade and the presence of some ‘non-trichaline’ lineages as serial sister-groups to the trichalines in the earlier sense. The cladophorine clade contains numerous taxa which had been placed until recently into <italic>Cautires</italic> (Cautirina), a distant lineage in respect to cladophorines.

You demonstrate how biodiversity information analyses done in the Metriorrhynchini, a hyperdiverse tropical insect group, can be rapidly expanded via targeted field research and large-scale sequencing. The study sets a benchmark for the spatiotemporal evaluation of tropical biodiversity, supports evidence-based conservation planning, and provides a robust framework for systematic, biogeographic, and evolutionary studies.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71895.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Donoso</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01gb99w41</institution-id><institution>Escuela Politécnica Nacional</institution></institution-wrap><country>Ecuador</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Bai</surname><given-names>Ming</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/034t30j35</institution-id><institution>Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap><country>China</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.07.15.452170">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.15.452170v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Ming Bai (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers agree that the authors did a nice sampling and produce an interesting inventory, but that the authors need to be cautious in their claims (as noted in their results or this &quot;new&quot; methodology). One major concern is with the validity of the premise that this paper helps to accelerate, or provides a framework that accelerates tropical insect inventories. For example, it will be very important if the authors develop the 4-step procedure (Lines 90-97) they use to justify the importance of the work. What is unique (or new) in their methodology, that can accelerate inventory assembly? Despite Figure 5, which establish differences between their methods and basic Sanger sequencing, the reviewers are not yet convinced that this paper really moves the field forward. Alternatively, the authors can temper the <italic>acceleration biodiscovery</italic> framework, and provide a more robust background on how Illumina data may be essential for obtaining a backbone where to put the Sanger data, and how this is not frequently used yet.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, I like the manuscript and I think it can be published after some modifications. The most important point is the claims about mOTUs/putative species.

The principal objective of this study is to demonstrate how biodiversity information for a hyperdiverse tropical group can be rapidly expanded via targeted field research and large-scale sequencing. The authors have attempted to overcome current impediments to the gathering of biodiversity data by using integrative phylogenomic and three mtDNA fragment analyses. As a model, they sequenced the Metriorrhynchini beetle fauna, sampled from ~700 localities in three continents.

One major concern is with the validity of the premise that this paper helps to accelerate, or provides a framework that accelerates tropical insect inventories. For example, it will be very important if the authors develop the 4-step procedure (Lines 90-97) they use to justify the importance of the work. What is unique (or new) in their methodology, that can accelerate inventory assembly? Despite Figure 5, which establish differences between their methods and basic Sanger sequencing, the reviewers are not yet convinced that this paper really moves the field forward. Alternatively, the authors can temper the acceleration biodiscovery framework, and provide a more robust background on how Illumina data may be essential for obtaining a backbone where to put the Sanger data, and how this is not frequently used yet.</p></disp-quote><p>Many thanks for your comments. We agree with your suggestions and tried to address them.</p><p>We have added further information on our approach. Principally, we combine phylogenomics (both transcriptomes and WGS data) that has been used for deep phylogenies like insect order relationships or the beetle classification with short DNA fragments that resolve only shallow relationships. We tried to limit the number of transcriptomes to avoid high costs. Further, we elaborated each dataset contributes to results. Separately, neither phylogenomics nor short fragment analyses provide necessary information. We are aware that even our approach is labour intensive, but we argue that reporting the presence of ~1,000 undescribed species by a single group for a tribe of beetles is in the clear contrast with the slow pace of traditional morphology based taxonomy (the journal Zootaxa published 30,000 articles with 60,000 new species in 20 years; Zhang, 2021). Additionally, as we work with preserved vouchers, our research can be used for further studies integrating morphology and molecular phylogenetics.</p><p>Below, we answer how specific comments by reviewers were addressed. We tried to follow the suggestions as closely as possible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Overall, I like the manuscript and I think it can be published after some modifications. The most important point is the claims about mOTUs/putative species. As a scientist, we should be cautious when interpreting our data and especially when selecting different parameters (like the threshold). Authors should not provide just their most optimistic (or most striking) estimates and should include different estimates and consider all of them over the manuscript (from abstract to conclusions).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comment. We modified the text accordingly, but we also discussed the lower threshold. We pointed more clearly to the Figure 17 where are shown numbers of putative species for 20 thresholds (1-10%, increased by 0.5%). Our preference for lower threshold has been based on the earlier published studies on Metriorrhynchini that have shown conspicuous morphological differentiation between New Guinean putative species which shared similar mtDNA (Kalousova and Bocak, 2017; Bocek et al., 2019). We studied the congruence of mtDNA/morphology species delimitation with nextRAD data in the later study. We proposed that morphological differentiation was driven by selection in different mimetic communities and by ecological shift (exemplified by possible shift to nocturnal activity in species that lost bright colouration and have much larger eyes than their closest relative – mtDNA distance around 1%). Analogically, we showed similar low mtDNA differentiation in Scarelus and Cautires in Malaysia (Bray and Bocak 2016, Jiruskova et al. 2019) and in Synchonnus in Australia (Kusy et al. 2018). To sum up, our claims are downgraded, alternative estimates included, and reference to further evidence added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, It is surprising the amount of text used for the phylogenomic analyses, it is a very appropriate methodological part but barely mentioned in the results.

We tried to improve these sections. We limited our discussion on the position of individual taxa as we wrote the manuscript for wide audience without specific knowledge on our group. As we noted in the manuscript, morphology must be inevitably studied, but it is not included in the present study. We already work on the next step of biodiversity research: the generic classification of the group with integrative definitions of named taxa. We have already prepared several hundreds of illustrations and the analysis of the congruence of relationships based on morphological traits, phylogenomics, and mitochondrial markers. But the taxon-specific information is interesting for taxonomists, not for wide audience.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the use of &quot;person-months of focused field research&quot; should be considered to be removed, as it did not provide any results or comparison with other study groups (which won't be possible).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestion that we fully follow in the revised manuscript.

We added several sentences that summarize the relationships between nextRAD, mtDNA and morphology based species in Metriorrhynchini as we have studied them in previous works (Bocak and Yagi 2010, Kalousova and Bocak 2017, Bocek et al. 2019, Jiruskova et al. 2019). While trying to avoid selfcitations in the earlier version, we underestimated the need to support our conclusions by earlier studies. Our earlier discussion on the delimitation of species in Metriorrhynchini (especially the nextRAD,mtDNA study in Frontiers of Zoology) have shown that the net-winged beetle are often well morphologically differentiated even when species and have recently split. The studies discussed also the factors contribution to observed patterns: (the mosaic structure of mimetic communities, altitudinal differences, timing of activity etc.). The performance of delimitation must be evaluated with morphology and nuclear genes and can be solved only in restricted taxonomic studies. We consider our species numbers as estimates and do not intend to describe species without morphological evaluation. The text was modified accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. P8L199: The constituent clades should be point out based on which tree.

To sum up, we used constrained mtDNA topology which contains all genomic samples in fixed position and we listed in the Supplements also genera for which transcriptomes or whole genomes have not been sequenced. The genera for which no molecular data are available are assigned to subclades using the morphology. The senior author have studied all type species of Metriorrhynchini genera and about 70 percent of all types of Metriorrhynchini.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.
