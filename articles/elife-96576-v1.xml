biological effects on physiology including the stimulation of alertness and cognition. However, the subcortical circuitry underlying the stimulating impact of light is not established in humans. We used 7 Tesla functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess the impact of variations in light illuminance on the regional activity of the hypothalamus while healthy young adults (N=26; 16 women; 24.3±2.9 y) were completing two auditory cognitive tasks. We find that, during both the executive and emotional tasks, higher illuminance triggered an activity increase over the posterior part of the hypothalamus, which includes part of the tuberomamillary nucleus and the posterior part of the lateral hypothalamus. In contrast, increasing illuminance evoked a decrease in activity over the anterior and ventral parts of the hypothalamus, encompassing notably the suprachiasmatic nucleus and another part of the tuberomammillary nucleus. Critically, the performance of the executive task was improved under higher illuminance and was negatively correlated with the activity of the posterior hypothalamus area. These findings reveal the distinct local dynamics of different hypothalamus regions that underlie the impact of light on cognition.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hypothalamus</kwd><kwd>7T fMRI</kwd><kwd>light</kwd><kwd>melanopsin</kwd><kwd>circadian rhythm</kwd><kwd>cognition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002661</institution-id><institution>Fonds De La Recherche Scientifique - FNRS Belgium</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>J.0222.20</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vandewalle</surname><given-names>Gilles</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100018694</institution-id><institution>Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.3030/860613</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sharifpour</surname><given-names>Roya</given-names></name><name><surname>Balda</surname><given-names>Jose</given-names><suffix>Aizpurua</suffix></name><name><surname>Vandewalle</surname><given-names>Gilles</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fondation Léon Frédéricq</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Campbell</surname><given-names>Islay</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>ULiège - U.

The biological effects of light primarily rely on a subclass of retinal ganglion cells that are intrinsically photosensitive (ipRGCs) because they express the photopigment melanopsin, which is maximally sensitive to photons with wavelength ~480 nm. IpRGCs combine the light signalling of rods and cones to their intrinsic photosensitivity and, collectively, the biological effects of light present a maximal sensitivity to the shorter blue wavelength of visible light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Do, 2019</xref>). IpRGCs project to multiple subcortical brain areas and their denser projections are found within the hypothalamus, particularly in nuclei involved in sleep and wakefulness regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Scammell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Do, 2019</xref>). The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which is the site of the principal circadian clock, receives the strongest inputs from ipRGC inputs, over the anterior part of the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hattar et al., 2006</xref>). Other nuclei also receive ipRGC projections: the subparaventricular zone, one of the main output routes of the SCN, the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO) and the preoptic nucleus (PON) involved in sleep initiation and also found in the anterior part of the hypothalamus; the lateral hypothalamus (LH), site of the orexinergic wake-promoting neurons and melanin-concentrating hormone sleep-promoting neurons, found in contrast over the lateral and posterior parts of the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Scammell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Do, 2019</xref>).</p><p>The brain circuitry underlying the biological effects of light has mostly been uncovered in nocturnal rodent models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Campbell et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Do, 2019</xref>). Translation to diurnal human beings, where the later maturation of the cortex allows for complex cognitive processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Braak and Del Tredici, 2015</xref>), remains scarce. In particular, whether hypothalamus nuclei contribute to the stimulating impact of light on cognition in humans is not established.</p><p>We addressed this question using ultra-high-field (UHF) 7 Tesla (7T) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in healthy young adults exposed to light of various illuminance while engaged in two different auditory cognitive tasks. We find that higher illuminance increased the activity of the posterior part of the hypothalamus encompassing the mamillary bodies (MB) and parts of the LH and tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN). In contrast, higher illuminance decreased the activity over the anterior and ventral parts of the hypothalamus encapsulating notably the SCN and another part of the TMN. Critically, the pattern of modulation was consistent across the two cognitive tasks. Importantly, the performance of the complex cognitive task was improved under higher illuminance while the activity of the posterior part of the hypothalamus was correlated to task performance. The findings reveal the distinct local dynamics of different hypothalamus areas in response to changing illuminance that may contribute to light’s impact on cognition.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Twenty-six healthy young adults (16 women; 24.3±2.9 y; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>) completed two auditory cognitive tasks encompassing, respectively, the executive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Collette et al., 2005</xref>) and emotional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grandjean et al., 2005</xref>) domains, while alternatively maintained in darkness or exposed to short periods (&lt;1 min) of light of four different illuminances (0.16, 37, 92, 190 melanopic equivalent daylight illuminance - mel EDI- lux; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

For each subpart, we extracted an index of the illuminance impact as their average regression coefficients between their responses to the tasks and the illuminance levels. These analyses showed significant differences between the hypothalamus subparts for the executive (generalized linear mixed models [GLMM]; main effect of the subparts; p=0.002) and emotional (GLMM; main effect of the subparts; p&lt;0.0001) tasks, revealing that, during both tasks, the variations in illuminance affected the activity of the 5 hypothalamus subparts differently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). A nominal main effect of the task was detected for the emotional task (p=0.049; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) but not for the n-back task. For both tasks, there was no significant main effect for any of the other covariates and post hoc analyses showed that the index of the illuminance impact was consistently different in the posterior hypothalamus subpart compared to the other subparts (p<sub>corrected</sub> ≤0.05, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Importantly, whole-brain analyses confirmed that increasing illuminance resulted in a local increase and decrease of activity that could be detected, respectively, over the posterior and inferior subparts of the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–G</xref>). This shows that our results do not come from a relatively unspecific and widespread increase in BOLD signal surrounding the hypothalamus subparts and that the effect of light was most prominent over the posterior and inferior-anterior subparts.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Differences between hypothalamus subparts in the collective impact of

How these findings translate to human beings is not established. Here, we took advantage of the relatively high resolution and signal-to-noise ratio of UHF 7T fMRI to determine how illuminance affects the activity of the hypothalamus as, based on animal research, it receives the densest projections from ipRGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hattar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Do, 2019</xref>).

The pattern of light-induced changes was consistent across an executive and an emotional task which consisted of a block and an event-related fMRI design, respectively. This suggests that a robust anterior-posterior gradient of activity modulation by illuminance is present in the hypothalamus across cognitive domains. Importantly, performance to the complex cognitive task was improved under higher illuminance and was correlated to the activity of the posterior part of the hypothalamus under the different illuminance, though negatively. The results demonstrate that the human hypothalamus does not respond uniformly to variations in illuminance while engaged in a cognitive challenge and suggest that the posterior part of the hypothalamus may be key in mediating the stimulating impact of light on cognition.</p><p>The different nuclei of the hypothalamus do not have clear contrast boundaries based on MRI signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Billot et al., 2020</xref>). As a result, achieving nucleus resolution over the human hypothalamus even using UFH MRI remains out of reach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sharifpour et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, we cannot assign the effects we report to a specific nucleus. We can only speculate and present a selection of plausible scenarios that would need to be tested. The posterior part of the hypothalamus – delineated in each participant based on an automatic reproducible procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Billot et al., 2020</xref>) – encompasses the MB as well as parts of the LH and the TMN. All these nuclei could participate to the increased BOLD signal we detect under higher illuminance. The LH and TMN, respectively, produce orexin and histamine, which are both known to promote wakefulness, while animal histology reports direct projection of the ipRGCs to the LH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hattar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Scammell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Do, 2019</xref>). Orexin is a good candidate to constitute the circadian signal that promotes wakefulness and to counter the progressive increase in sleep needs with prolonged wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zeitzer, 2013</xref>). Our data may therefore be compatible with an increase in orexin release by the LH with increasing illuminance. In line with this assumption, chemoactivation of ipRGCs lead to increase c-fos production, a marker of cellular activation, over several nuclei of the hypothalamus, including the lateral hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Milosavljevic et al., 2016</xref>). If the initial effect of light we observe over the posterior part of the hypothalamus was maintained over a longer period of exposure, this would stimulate cognition and maintain or increase alertness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Campbell et al., 2023</xref>) and may also be part of the mechanisms through which daytime light increases the amplitude in circadian variations of several physiological features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bano-Otalora et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dijk et al., 2012</xref>). It could then also be part of the mechanisms through which evening light may disturb subsequent sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chellappa et al., 2013</xref>) when illuminance is higher than the recommended maximum of 10 mel EDI lux for evening light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brown et al., 2022</xref>). If the TMN was the hypothalamus nucleus underlying the regional increase in the BOLD signal we report, it could confer a role to histamine in mediating the stimulating impact of light. Of interest, the TMN receives orexin signal from the LH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Scammell et al., 2019</xref>). Alternatively, our findings may suggest a role for the MBs in mediating the impact of light on ongoing cognition, potentially influenced through its innervation by the TMN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vann, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Previous research indicated that increasing illuminance reduced the activity of the anterior part of the hypothalamus encompassing the SCN, either following the exposure to light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Perrin et al., 2004</xref>) or during the exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schoonderwoerd et al., 2022</xref>). We extend this finding by showing that the significant decrease in activity extends beyond the inferior anterior hypothalamus and therefore much beyond the SCN. Chemoactivation of ipRGCs in rodents led to an increase activity of the SCN, over the inferior anterior hypothalamus, but had no impact on the activity of the VLPO, over the superior anterior hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Milosavljevic et al., 2016</xref>). How our findings fit with these fine-grained observations and whether there are species-specific differences in the responses to light over the different part of the hypothalamus remains to be established. The inferior-tubular and inferior-anterior subparts of the hypothalamus – that we isolated also based on an automatic reproducible procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Billot et al., 2020</xref>) – encompass several nuclei such as notably the SCN, SON, ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus, arcuate nucleus and part of the TMN. Again, all these nuclei may be involved in the reduction in BOLD signal we observe at higher illuminance. In terms of chemical communication, these changes in activity could be the results of an inhibitory signal from a subclass of ipRGCs, potentially through the release aminobutyric acid (GABA), as a rodent study found that a subset of ipRGCs release GABA at brain targets including the SCN (and intergeniculate leaflet and ventral lateral geniculate nucleus), leading to a reduction in the ability of light to affect pupil size and circadian photoentrainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sonoda et al., 2020</xref>). Whatever the signalling of ipRGC, our finding over the anterior hypothalamus could correspond to a modification of GABA signalling of the SCN which has been reported to have excitatory properties, such that the BOLD signal changes we report may correspond to a reduction in excitation arising in part from the SCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albers et al., 2017</xref>). Likewise, the SCN is also producing other neuropeptides that could affect its downstream targets. As the inferior-tubular subpart of the hypothalamus also includes part of the TMN it may be the TMN and its GABA production that is decreased by higher illuminance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Scammell et al., 2019</xref>). The decrease in BOLD signal with increasing illuminance we report could therefore arguably reflect a decreased inhibitory signal arising from the anterior and inferior nuclei of the hypothalamus.</p><p>Importantly, none of the scenarios we elaborated on are mutually exclusive and we may have overlooked the potential implication of several nuclei as well as the cellular diversity of the nuclei of the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamantidis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Scammell et al., 2017</xref>). We further note that the anterior-superior hypothalamus subpart of the hypothalamus encompassing the VLPO and PON sees its activity decreasing under higher illuminance during the emotional task, similarly to the anterior-inferior and inferior-tubular areas. Likewise, similar to the posterior subpart, the activity of the superior-tubular hypothalamus subpart may be increased under higher illuminance during the emotional task. Whether this represents a task-specific effect arising, for instance, from differences in the salience of the auditory stimulus, remains to be determined.</p><p>Subcortical structures, and particularly those receiving direct retinal projections, including those of the hypothalamus, are likely to receive light illuminance signal first, before passing on the light modulation to the cortical regions involved in the ongoing cognitive process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Campbell et al., 2023</xref>). A critical aspect of our results is that the performance to the 2-back (executive) subtask was significantly increased when exposed to higher illuminance light. The extent of this increase was limited, likely because performance was overall high at all illuminances, but was not detected for the simpler detection letter subtask (0-back). The result contrasts with many previous 3T MRI investigations on the biological effects of light on human brain function which did not report behavioural changes induced by repeated short exposures to light (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vandewalle et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vandewalle et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vandewalle et al., 2011a</xref> but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Daneault et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vandewalle et al., 2006</xref>). Our 7T MRI study, which includes a sample size larger than many of these previous studies, supports that BOLD fMRI is sensitive in detecting subtle impacts of light on the brain and that these detected changes can arguably contribute to the behavioural changes others reported using longer light exposure and other approaches (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cajochen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lockley et al., 2006</xref> but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Smolders et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, we find that activity of the posterior hypothalamus subpart is negatively related to the performance to the executive task, making it unlikely that it mediates directly the positive impact of light on performance. The activity of the posterior hypothalamus was, however, associated with an increased behavioural response to emotional stimuli. The association between behaviour and the posterior hypothalamus is therefore likely to be complex and may depend on the context, with for instance different nuclei or neuronal populations contributing in some instances but not in others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamantidis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Scammell et al., 2019</xref>). It is likely also to work jointly with the decreased activity of the anterior/inferior hypothalamus we detected as well as with other non-hypothalamus subcortical structures regulating wakefulness to influence behaviour, which intrinsically primarily depends on cortical activity.</p><p>Future research may consider data-driven analyses of hypothalamus voxels time series as an alternative to the parcellation approach we adopted here. This may refine the delineation of the subparts of the hypothalamus undergoing decreased or increased activity with increasing illuminance. Future research should also assess the impact of light on other subcortical structures and on the entire subcortical network to determine how illuminance modifies their crosstalk as well as their interaction with the cortex, to eventually lead to behavioural impacts. These analyses could for instance address whether the regional changes in activity of the hypothalamus we find are upstream of the repeatedly reported impact of light illuminance on the activity of the pulvinar in the thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Paparella et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vandewalle et al., 2006</xref>). Although it does not receive direct dense input from ipRGCs, it is likely to indirectly mediate the biological impact of light on ongoing cognitive activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Paparella et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>We based our rationale and part of our interpretations on ipRGC projections, which have been demonstrated in rodents to channel the NIF biological impact of light and incorporate the inputs from rods and cones with their intrinsic photosensitivity into a light signal that can impact the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Güler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Do, 2019</xref>). Given the polychromatic nature of the light we used, classical photoreceptors and their projections to visual brain areas are, however, very likely to have directly or indirectly contributed to the modulation by light of the regional activity of the hypothalamus. Furthermore, we cannot exclude that colour and/or spectral differences between the orange and three blue-enriched light conditions may have contributed to our findings. Research in rodent models demonstrated that variation in the spectral composition of light was perceived by the suprachiasmatic nucleus to set circadian timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Walmsley et al., 2015</xref>). No such demonstration has, however, been reported yet for the acute impact of light on alertness, attention, cognition or affective state. Future human studies could isolate the contribution of each photoreceptor class to the impact of light on cognitive brain functions by manipulating prior light history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chellappa et al., 2014</xref>) or through the use of silent substitutions between metameric light exposures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Viénot et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>All these knowledge gaps are important to address because acting on light stands as a promising means to reduce high sleepiness and improve cognitive deficits during wakefulness as well as to facilitate sleep in the few hours preceding bedtime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brown et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Didikoglu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gooley et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Münch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Riemersma-van der Lek et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Scheuermaier et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wirz-Justice et al., 2021</xref>). Light therapy is also a validated means to improve mood and treat mood disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Glickman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lam et al., 2016</xref>). Light administration can also be considered a simple means to disturb the brain circuitry regulating sleep and wakefulness such that it can provide insights about novel means to improve their quality. For instance, if orexin and histamine were part of the mechanism through which natural light affects brain functions, their administration may be the most ecological and/or natural means to affect alertness and cognition. Likewise, as both orexin and histamine are targets for the treatment of brain disorders, our findings could suggest that light may constitute a non-pharmacological complementary intervention to compounds that are being developed to treat arousal, sleep, or cognitive dysfunction in brain disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ma et al., 2018</xref>). It remains, however, premature in our view to base recommendations on the therapeutic use of light based on the MRI findings gathered to date. Targeted lighting for interventions or for precise interference of subcortical circuits will require a full understanding of how light affects the brain, particularly at the subcortical level. Our findings represent an important step towards this goal, at the level of the hypothalamus.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The data used in this paper arise from a large study that is leading to several publications and part of the methods have been published previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beckers et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Campbell et al., 2024a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Paparella et al., 2023</xref>).

The executive task was always completed first, as it was the most demanding task. The order of the following two tasks was counterbalanced.

The dual branches illuminated the inner walls of the head coil to ensure relatively uniform and indirect illumination of participants’ eyes. A filter wheel (Spectral Products, AB300, NM, USA) and optical fibre filters (monochromatic narrowband orange filter - 589mn; full width at half maximum: 10 nm - or a UV highpass filter - 433–1650 nm) were used to create the light conditions needed for the experiment (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref> for in-detail light characteristics).</p><p>Illuminance and spectra could not be directly measured within the MRI scanner due to the ferromagnetic nature of measurement systems.

The procedure was repeated four times for illuminance and twice for spectra and measurements were averaged. This procedure does not take into account inter-individual variation in head size and orbit shape such that the reported illuminance levels may have varied slightly across subjects.

Following the fMRI acquisition a 2D GRE field mapping sequence to assess B0 magnetic field inhomogeneity with the following parameters: TR = 5.2ms, TEs = 2.26ms and 3.28ms, FA = 15°, bandwidth = 737 Hz/pixel, matrix size = 96 × 128, 96 axial slices, voxel size = (2x2 × 2) mm<sup>3</sup>, acquisition time = 1:38 min, was applied.</p><p>For the anatomical image, a high-resolution T1-weighted image was acquired using a Magnetization-Prepared with 2 RApid Gradient Echoes (MP2RAGE) sequence: TR = 4300ms, TE = 1.98ms, FA = 5°/6°, TI = 940ms/2830ms, bandwidth = 240 Hz, matrix size = 256 × 256, 224 axial slices, acceleration factor = 3, voxel size = (0.75x0.75 × 0.75) mm<sup>3</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Data processing</title><p>For the MP2RAGE images, the background noise was removed using an extension (extension: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/benoitberanger/mp2rage">https://github.com/benoitberanger/mp2rage</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Béranger and Papadopoulos Orfanos, 2019</xref>) of Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 (SPM12; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/">https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/</ext-link>) under Matlab R2019 (MathWorks, Natick, Massachusetts) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">O’Brien et al., 2014</xref>). Then the images were reoriented using the ‘spm_auto_reorient’ function (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/CyclotronResearchCentre/spm_auto_reorient">https://github.com/CyclotronResearchCentre/spm_auto_reorient</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cyclotron Research Centre, 2015</xref>) and corrected for intensity non-uniformity using the bias correction method implemented in the SPM12 ‘unified segmentation’ tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashburner and Friston, 2005</xref>). To ensure optimal co-registration, brain extraction was done using SynthStrip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hoopes et al., 2022</xref>) in Freesurfer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/">http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/</ext-link>). The brain-extracted T1-images were used to create a T1-weighted group template using Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://stnava.github.io/ANTs/">http://stnava.github.io/ANTs/</ext-link>) prior to normalisation to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space using ANTs (1 mm³ voxel; MNI 152 template). The hypothalamus of each participant was segmented within 1 mm³ MNI 152 template into five subparts - inferior anterior, superior anterior, inferior tubular, superior tubular, posterior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) using an automatic computational approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Billot et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>For the EPI images, auto reorientation was applied on the images first. Then, voxel-displacement maps were computed from the phase and magnitude images associated with B0 map acquisition (taken right after the task), using the SPM fieldmap toolbox. To correct for head motion and static and dynamic susceptibility-induced variance, the ‘Realign and Unwarp’ of SPM12 was then applied to the EPI images. The realigned and distortion-corrected EPI images then underwent brain extraction using the SynthStrip and then the final images were smoothed with a Gaussian kernel characterised by a FWHM = 3 mm. The first level analyses were performed in the native space to prevent any possible error that may be caused by co-registration.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The whole-brain univariate analyses consisted of a general linear model (GLM) computed with SPM12. For the executive task, task blocks and light blocks were modelled as block functions. For the emotional task, the auditory stimuli were modelled as stick functions. For both tasks, a high-pass filter with a 256 s cut-off was applied to remove low-frequency drifts. For both tasks, stick or block functions were convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function. Movement and physiological parameters (cardiac and respiration), which were computed with the PhysIO Toolbox (Translational Neuromodeling Unit, ETH Zurich, Switzerland), were included as covariates of no interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kasper et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Two separate analyses were completed. In the main analyses, we sought to test whether brain responses during the tasks were modulated by overall changes in illuminance level. The regressors of task blocks or events were accompanied by a single parametric modulation regressor corresponding to the light melanopic illuminance level (0.16, 37, 92, 190 mel EDI). The contrasts of interest consisted of the main effects of the parametric modulation. In the subsequent post hoc analysis, we estimated the responses to the stimuli under each light condition. Separate regressors modelled each task’s block or event type under each light condition (0, 0.16, 37, 92, 190 mel EDI). The contrasts of interest consisted of the main effects of each regressor.</p><p>The output masks of the segmentation procedure we used to extract regression betas associated with each of the hypothalamus subparts using the REX Toolbox (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.mit.edu/swg/software.htm">https://web.mit.edu/swg/software.htm</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Duff et al., 2007</xref>). Betas were averaged (mean) within each subpart and then across the homologous subparts of each hemisphere. In the main analyses this yielded 1 activity estimate per stimulus type and per hypothalamus subpart (i.e. 10 per individual), while in the subsequent analyses, we obtained 5 activity estimates per stimulus type and per subpart (50 per individual).</p><p>For visualisation of whole-brain results over the entire sample, all statistical maps obtained from the first level analysis were first transferred to the group template space and then the MNI space (1x1 × 1 mm<sup>3</sup> image resolution). All the registration steps were performed with ANTs. The visualisation was focused on the hypothalamus regions to assess whether increasing illuminance resulted in a local increase and/ or decrease of beta estimates within the hypothalamus or whether beta estimates were mainly influenced by a relatively unspecific and widespread increase in BOLD signal surrounding the hypothalamus.</p><p>Statistical analyses of the activity of the hypothalamus subparts were performed in SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, NC, USA). Analyses consisted of Generalised Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) with the subject as a random factor (intercept and slope) and were adjusted for the dependent variable distribution. As the main statistical analysis was completed for each task, the significance threshold was corrected for multiple comparisons and was set at p&lt;0.025. Direct post hoc of the main analyses were corrected for multiple comparisons using a Tukey adjustment. The subsequent more detailed analyses were considered as post hoc that were not corrected for multiple comparisons (p&lt;0.05). To detect outlier values within the data sets, Cook’s distance &gt;1 was used for exclusion. No outliers were detected for activity estimates of both tasks, while four outlier values were removed from the analyses of the 2-back and 0-back performance.</p><p>The main analyses included the activity estimates modulated by light illuminance as a dependent variable and the hypothalamus subpart and stimulus type (2-back/0-back - neutral/emotional) as repeated measures (autoregressive (1) correlation), together with age, sex and BMI as covariates. The second set of post hoc GLMM analyses included the activity estimates of the hypothalamus subparts as the dependent variable and hypothalamus subpart, stimulus type and illuminance (0, 0.16, 37, 92, 190 mel EDI lux) as the repeated measures (autoregressive (1) correlation), together with age, sex, and BMI as covariates and interaction term between illuminance and hypothalamus subpart. The final set of analyses included performance metrics as dependent variables (accuracy to the 2-back or 0-back task - as percentage of correct responses; reaction time – ms - to emotional or neutral stimuli during the emotional task) and included the same repeated measures and covariates ads in the preceding set as well as activity of the relevant hypothalamus subpart.</p><p>Optimal sensitivity and power analyses in GLMMs remain under investigation (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kain et al., 2015</xref>). We nevertheless computed a prior sensitivity analysis to get an indication of the minimum detectable effect size in our main analyses given our sample size.

The hypothalamus, a brain region integral to regulating circadian rhythms, sleep, and alertness, has been posited to mediate the effects of light exposure on cognitive functions. Previous studies have highlighted the role of the hypothalamus in orchestrating bodily responses to light, implicating specific neural pathways such as the orexin and histamine systems, which are crucial for maintaining wakefulness and processing environmental cues. Despite advancements in our understanding, the specific mechanisms through which varying levels of light exposure influence hypothalamic activity and, in turn, cognitive performance, remain inadequately explored. This gap in knowledge underscores the need for high-resolution investigations that can dissect the nuanced impacts of illuminance on different hypothalamic regions. Utilizing state-of-the-art 7 Tesla functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the present study aims to elucidate the differential effects of light on hypothalamic dynamics and establish a link between regional hypothalamic activity and cognitive outcomes in healthy young adults. By shedding light on these complex interactions, this research endeavours to contribute to the foundational knowledge necessary for developing innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at enhancing cognitive function through environmental modulation.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) Considerable Sample Size and Detailed Analysis: The study leverages a robust sample size and conducts a thorough analysis of hypothalamic dynamics, which enhances the reliability and depth of the findings.</p><p>(2) Use of High-Resolution Imaging: Utilizing 7 Tesla fMRI to analyze brain activity during cognitive tasks offers high-resolution insights into the differential effects of illuminance on hypothalamic activity, showcasing the methodological rigour of the study.</p><p>(3) Novel Insights into Illuminance Effects: The manuscript reveals new understandings of how different regions of the hypothalamus respond to varying illuminance levels, contributing valuable knowledge to the field.</p><p>(4) Exploration of Potential Therapeutic Applications: Discussing the potential therapeutic applications of light modulation based on the findings suggests practical implications and future research directions.</p><p>The current version of the manuscript addresses previous weaknesses, including details about the illuminance levels, light spectral characteristics used in the MRI study, and light patterns during behavioural tasks. The authors effectively tackle open questions in the field and provide solid evidence that enhances our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the effects of light on cognition.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.96576.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>Campbell and colleagues use a combination of high-resolution fMRI, cognitive tasks and different intensities of light illumination to test the hypothesis that the intensity of illumination differentially impacts hypothalamic substructures that, in turn, promote alterations in arousal that affect cognitive and affective performance. The authors find evidence in support of a posterior-to-anterior gradient of increased blood flow in the hypothalamus during task performance that they later relate to performance on two different tasks. The results provide an enticing link between light levels, hypothalamic activity and cognitive/affective function, however clarification of some methodological choices will help to improve confidence in the findings.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>* The authors' focus on the hypothalamus and its relationship to light intensity is an important and understudied question in neuroscience.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>* I found it challenging to relate the authors hypotheses, which I found to be quite compelling, to the apparatus used to test the hypotheses - namely, the use of orange light vs. different light intensities; and the specific choice of the executive and emotional tasks, which differed in key features (e.g., block-related vs. event-related designs) that were orthogonal to the psychological constructs being challenged in each task.</p><p>* Given the small size of the hypothalamus and the irregular size of the hypothalamic parcels, I wondered whether a more data-driven examination of the hypothalamic time series would have provided a more parsimonious test of their hypothesis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment"

The orange light was introduced as a control visual stimulation for potential secondary whole-brain analyses.

In line with this assumption, chemoactivation of ipRGCs lead to increase c-fos production, a marker of cellular activation, over several nuclei of the hypothalamus, including the lateral hypothalamus (Milosavljevic et al., 2016). If this initial effect of light we observe over the posterior part of the hypothalamus was maintained over a longer period of exposure, this would stimulate cognition and maintain or increase alertness (Campbell et al., 2023) and may also be part of the mechanisms through which daytime light increases the amplitude in circadian variations of several physiological features (BanoOtalora et al., 2021; Dijk et al., 2012).”</p><p>PAGE 10: “Chemoactivation of ipRGCs in rodents led to an increase activity of the SCN, over the inferior anterior hypothalamus, but had no impact on the activity of the VLPO, over the superior anterior hypothalamus (Milosavljevic et al., 2016). How our findings fit with these fine-grained observations and whether there are species-specific differences in the responses to light over the different part of the hypothalamus remains to be established.”</p><p>PAGE 10: “In terms of chemical communication, these changes in activity could be the results of an inhibitory signal from a subclass of ipRGCs, potentially through the release aminobutyric acid (GABA), as a rodent study found that a subset of ipRGCs release GABA at brain targets including the SCN (and intergeniculate leaflet and ventral lateral geniculate nucleus), leading to a reduction in the ability of light to affect pupil size and circadian photoentrainment (Sonoda et al., 2020). Whatever the signalling of ipRGC, our finding over the anterior hypothalamus could correspond to a modification of GABA signalling of the SCN which has been reported to have excitatory properties, such that the BOLD signal changes we report may correspond to a reduction in excitation arising in part from the SCN (Albers et al., 2017).”</p><p>(3) Figures 1 and 2 were modified.

The hypothalamus, a brain region integral to regulating circadian rhythms, sleep, and alertness, has been posited to mediate the effects of light exposure on cognitive functions. Previous studies have illuminated the role of the hypothalamus in orchestrating bodily responses to light, implicating specific neural pathways such as the orexin and histamine systems, which are crucial for maintaining wakefulness and processing environmental cues. Despite advancements in our understanding, the specific mechanisms through which varying levels of light exposure influence hypothalamic activity and, in turn, cognitive performance, remain inadequately explored. This gap in knowledge underscores the need for high-resolution investigations that can dissect the nuanced impacts of illuminance on different hypothalamic regions. Utilizing state-of-the-art 7 Tesla functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the present study aims to elucidate the differential effects of light on the hypothalamic dynamics and establish a link between regional hypothalamic activity and cognitive outcomes in healthy young adults. By shedding light on these complex interactions, this research endeavours to contribute to the foundational knowledge necessary for developing innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at enhancing cognitive function through environmental modulation.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) Considerable Sample Size and Detailed Analysis: The study leverages a robust sample size and conducts a thorough analysis of hypothalamic dynamics, which enhances the reliability and depth of the findings.</p><p>(2) Use of High-Resolution Imaging: Utilizing 7 Tesla fMRI to analyze brain activity during cognitive tasks offers high-resolution insights into the differential effects of illuminance on hypothalamic activity, showcasing the methodological rigor of the study.</p><p>(3) Novel Insights into Illuminance Effects: The manuscript reveals new understandings of how different regions of the hypothalamus respond to varying illuminance levels, contributing valuable knowledge to the field.</p><p>(4) Exploration of Potential Therapeutic Applications: Discussing the potential therapeutic applications of light modulation based on the findings suggests practical implications and future research directions.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) Foundation for Claims about Orexin and Histamine Systems: The manuscript needs to provide a clearer theoretical or empirical foundation for claims regarding the impact of light on the orexin and histamine systems in the abstract.</p><p>(2) Inclusion of Cortical Correlates: While focused on the hypothalamus, the manuscript may benefit from discussing the role of cortical activation in cognitive performance, suggesting an opportunity to expand the scope of the manuscript.</p><p>(3) Details of Light Exposure Control: More detailed information about how light exposure was controlled and standardized is needed to ensure the replicability and validity of the experimental conditions.</p><p>(4) Rationale Behind Different Exposure Protocols: To clarify methodological choices, the manuscript should include more in-depth reasoning behind using different protocols of light exposure for executive and emotional tasks.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Attention to English language precision and correction of typographical errors, such as &quot;hypothalamic nuclei&quot; instead of &quot;hypothalamus nuclei,&quot; is necessary for enhancing the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for recognising the interest and strength of our study.</p><p>(1) As detailed in the discussion, we do believe orexin and histamine are excellent candidates for mediating the results we report. As also pointing out, however, we are in no position to know which neurons, nuclei, neurotransmitter and neuromodulator underlie the results. The last sentence of the abstract (PAGE 2) was therefore removed as we agree the statement was too strong. We carefully reconsider the discussion and believe that no such overstatement was present.</p><p>(2) Hypothalamus nuclei are connected to multiple cortical (and subcortical) structures. The relevance of these projections will vary with the cognitive task considered. In addition, we have not yet considered the cortex in our analyses such that truly integrating cortical structures appears premature.</p><p>We nevertheless added the following short statement (PAGE 11): “Subcortical structures, and particularly those receiving direct retinal projections, including those of the hypothalamus, are likely to receive light illuminance signal first before passing on the light modulation to the cortical regions involved in the ongoing cognitive process (Campbell et al., 2023).”</p><p>(3) We now include the following as part of the method section (PAGES 16-17): “Illuminance and spectra could not be directly measured within the MRI scanner due to the ferromagnetic nature of measurement systems. The coil of the MRI and the light stand, together with the lighting system were therefore placed outside of the MR room to reproduce the experimental conditions of the in a completely dark room. A sensor was placed 2 cm away from the mirror of the coil that is mounted at eye level, i.e. where the eye of the first author of the paper would be positioned, to measure illuminance and spectra. The procedure was repeated 4 times for illuminance and twice for spectra and measurements were averaged. This procedure does not take into account interindividual variation in head size and orbit shape such that the reported illuminance levels may have varied slightly across subjects. The relative differences between illuminance are, however, very unlikely to vary substantially across participants such that statistics consisting of tests for the impact of relative differences in illuminance were not affected. The detailed values reported in Supplementary Table 2 were computed combining spectra and illuminance using the excel calculator associated with a published work (Lucas et al., 2014).”</p><p>(4) The explanation regarding the choice of the illuminance is now included in the revised manuscript (PAGE 17): “Blue-enriched light illuminances were set according to the technical characteristics of the light source and to keep the overall photon flux similar to prior 3T MRI studies of our team (between ~1012 and 1014 ph/cm²/s) (Vandewalle et al., 2010, 2011). The orange light was introduced as a control visual stimulation for potential secondary whole-brain analyses. For the present region of interest analyses, we discarded colour differences between the light conditions and only considered illuminance as indexed by mel EDI lux. This constitutes a limitation of our study as it does not allow attributing the findings to a particular photoreceptor class.”</p><p>(5) The manuscript was thoroughly rechecked, and we hope to have spotted all typos and language errors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Campbell and colleagues use a combination of high-resolution fMRI, cognitive tasks, and different intensities of light illumination to test the hypothesis that the intensity of illumination differentially impacts hypothalamic substructures that, in turn, promote alterations in arousal that affect cognitive and affective performance. The authors find evidence in support of a posterior-to-anterior gradient of increased blood flow in the hypothalamus during task performance that they later relate to performance on two different tasks. The results provide an enticing link between light levels, hypothalamic activity, and cognitive/affective function, however, clarification of some methodological choices will help to improve confidence in the findings.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>* The authors' focus on the hypothalamus and its relationship to light intensity is an important and understudied question in neuroscience.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) I found it challenging to relate the authors' hypotheses, which I found to be quite compelling, to the apparatus used to test the hypotheses - namely, the use of orange light vs. different light intensities; and the specific choice of the executive and emotional tasks, which differed in key features (e.g., block-related vs. event-related designs) that were orthogonal to the psychological constructs being challenged in each task.</p><p>(4) Given the small size of the hypothalamus and the irregular size of the hypothalamic parcels, I wondered whether a more data-driven examination of the hypothalamic time series would have provided a more parsimonious test of their hypothesis.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) The authors may wish to explain the importance of the orange light condition in the early section of the results -- i.e., when they first present the task structure. As it stands, I don't have a good appreciation of why the orange light was included -- was it a control condition? And if the differences between the light conditions (e.g., the narrow- vs. wide-band of light) were indeed ignored by focussing on the illuminance levels, are there any potential issues that the authors could then mitigate against with further experiments/analyses?</p><p>(2) Are there other explanations for why illuminance levels might improve cognitive performance? For instance, the capacity to more easily perceive the stimuli in an experiment could plausibly make it easier to complete a given task. If this is the case, can the authors conceptualise a way to rule out this hypothesis?</p><p>(3) Did the authors control for the differences in the number of voxels in each hypothalamic subregion? Or perhaps consider estimating the variance across voxels within the larger parcels, to determine whether the mean time series was comparable to the time series of the smaller parcels?</p><p>(4) An alternative strategy that would mitigate against the differences in the size of hypothalamic parcels would be to conduct analyses on the hypothalamus without parcellation, but instead using dimensionality reduction techniques to observe the natural spread of responses across the hypothalamus. From the authors' results, my intuition is that these analyses will lead to similar conclusions, albeit without any of the potential issues with respect to differently-sized parcels.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for acknowledging the originality and interest of our study. We agree that some methodological choices needed more explanation. We will address the weaknesses they pointed out as follows:</p><p>(1) The explanation regarding the choice of the illuminance is now included in the revised manuscript (PAGE 17): “Blue-enriched light illuminances were set according to the technical characteristics of the light source and to keep the overall photon flux similar to prior 3T MRI studies of our team (between ~1012 and 1014 ph/cm²/s) (Vandewalle et al., 2010, 2011). The orange light was introduced as a control visual stimulation for potential secondary whole-brain analyses. For the present region of interest analyses, we discarded colour differences between the light conditions and only considered illuminance as indexed by mel EDI lux. This constitutes a limitation of our study as it does not allow attributing the findings to a particular photoreceptor class.”</p><p>The revised discussion makes clear that these choices limit the interpretation about the photoreceptors involved (PAGE 12-13): “We based our rationale and part of our interpretations on ipRGC projections, which have been demonstrated in rodents to channel the NIF biological impact of light and incorporate the inputs from rods and cones with their intrinsic photosensitivity into a light signal that can impact the brain (Güler et al., 2008; Tri &amp; Do, 2019). Given the polychromatic nature of the light we used, classical photoreceptors and their projections to visual brain areas are, however, very likely to have directly or indirectly contributed to the modulation by light of the regional activity of the hypothalamus.”</p><p>We further mention that (PAGE 13): “Furthermore, we cannot exclude that colour and/or spectral differences between the orange and 3 blue-enriched light conditions may have contributed to our findings. Research in rodent model demonstrated that variation in the spectral composition of light was perceived by the suprachiasmatic nucleus to set circadian timing (Walmsley et al., 2015). No such demonstration has, however, been reported yet for the acute impact of light on alertness, attention, cognition or affective state.”</p><p>Regarding the choice of tasks, we added the following the method section (PAGE 18): “Prior work of our team showed that the n-back task and emotional task included in the present protocol were successful probes to demonstrate that light illuminance modulates cognitive activity, including within subcortical structures (though resolution did not allow precise isolation of nuclei or subparts) (e.g. (Vandewalle et al., 2007, 2010)). When taking the step of ultra-high-field imaging, we therefore opted for these tasks as our goal was to show that illuminance affects brain activity across cognitive domains while not testing for task-specific aspects of these domains.”</p><p>We further added to the discussion (PAGE 8): “The pattern of light-induced changes was consistent across an executive and an emotional task which consisted of block and an event-related fMRI design, respectively. This suggests that a robust anterior-posterior gradient of activity modulation by illuminance is present in hypothalamus across cognitive domains.”</p><p>(2) We are unsure what the reviewer refers to when he states that the experiment could make it easier to perceive a stimulus. Aside from the fact that illuminance can increase alertness and attention such that a stimulus may be better or more easily perceived/processed, we do not see how blocks of ambient light, i.e. a long-lasting visual stimulus, may render auditory stimulation (letters or pseudo-words in the present) easier to perceive. To our knowledge multimodal or cross-modal integration has been robustly demonstrated for short visual/auditory cues that would precede or accompany auditory/visual stimulation.</p><p>We are willing to clarify this issue in the text if we receive additional explanation from the reviewer.</p><p>(3) We added subpart size as covariate in the analyses (instead of subpart number) and it did not affect the output of the statistical analyses (Author response table 1).</p><p>For completeness, we further computed standard deviation of the activity estimates of the voxels within each parcel for the main analysis of the n-back tasks and found a main effect of subpart (Author response table 2) indicating that the variability of the estimates varied across subparts. Post hoc contrast and the display included in Author response image1 show however that the difference were not related to subpart size per see. It is in fact the largest subpart (subpart 4) that shows the largest variability while one of the smallest subpart (subpart 2) shows the lowest variability. Though it may have contributed, it is therefore unlikely to explain our findings. We consider the analyses reported in (<xref ref-type="table" rid="sa4table1 sa4table2">Author response table 1 and 2</xref>) and (Author response image 1) as very technical and did not include it in the supplementary material for conciseness. If the reviewer judges it essential, we can reconsider our decision.</p><p>While computing these analyses, we realized that there were errors in the table 1 reporting the statistical outcomes of the main analyses of the emotional task. The main statistical outputs remain the same except for a nominal main effect of the task (emotional vs. neutral) and the fact that post hoc show a consistent difference between the posterior subpart (subpart 3) and all the other subparts, rather than all the other subparts except for the difference with superior tubular hypothalamus subpart: p-corrected = 0.09. We apologise for this slight error and were unable to isolate its origin. It does not modify the rest of the analyses (which were also rechecked) and the interpretations.</p><table-wrap id="sa4table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><caption><title>Recomputations of the main GLMMs using subpart sizes rather than subpart numbers as covariate of interest.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom">Executive task</th><th valign="bottom"/><th valign="bottom"/><th valign="bottom"/></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Main GLMM</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Effect</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">F value<break/>(df)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">P value*</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Partial R ^(2)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Subpart size</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">4.36,(4,200)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.0021</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.08</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Task</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.74,(1,25)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.4</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Subpart size x<break/>task type</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.68,(4,200)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.61</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Age</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.33,(1,22)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.57</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">BMI</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.59,(1,22)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.45</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sex</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.01,(1,22)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.91</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Emotional task</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Main GLMM</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Effect</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">F Value</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">P value*</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Partial R ^(2)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Subpart size</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">9.64,(4,193)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">&lt;

We opted for an approach that we mastered best, while still allowing to conclusively test for regional differences in activity across the hypothalamus. Examination of time series of the very same data we used will mainly confirm the results of our analyses – an anterior-posterior gradient in the impact of illuminance - while it may yield slight differences in the boarders of the subparts of the hypothalamus undergoing decreased or increased activity with increasing illuminance. While the suggested approach may have been envisaged if we had been facing negative results (i.e. no differences between subparts, potentially because subparts would not reflect functional differences in response to illuminance change), it would constitute a circular confirmation of our main findings (i.e. using the same data). While we truly appreciate the suggestion, we do not consider that it would constitute a more parsimonious test of our hypothesis, now that we successfully applied GLM/parcellation and GLMM approaches.</p><p>We added the following statement to the discussion to take this comment into account (PAGE 12): “Future research may consider data-driven analyses of hypothalamus voxels time series as an alternative to the parcellation approach we adopted here.
