Cancer cells are constantly challenged by mechanical stresses not only in the primary tumour but also during metastasis. However, this latter has seldom been studied with regards to mechanobiology, in particular resistance to anoikis, a cell death programme triggered by loss of cell adhesion. Here, we show in vitro that migrating breast cancer cells develop resistance to anoikis following their passage through microporous membranes mimicking confined migration (CM), a mechanical constriction that cancer cells encounter during metastasis. This CM-induced resistance was mediated by Inhibitory of Apoptosis Proteins, and sensitivity to anoikis could be restored after their inhibition using second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (SMAC) mimetics. Anoikis-resistant mechanically stressed cancer cells displayed enhanced cell motility and evasion from natural killer cell-mediated immune surveillance, as well as a marked advantage to form lung metastatic lesions in mice. Our findings reveal that CM increases the metastatic potential of breast cancer cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mechanobiology</kwd><kwd>confinement</kwd><kwd>anoikis</kwd><kwd>caspases</kwd><kwd>IAP</kwd><kwd>metastasis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LabEX DEVweCAN</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ichim</surname><given-names>Gabriel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-18-CE13-0005-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ichim</surname><given-names>Gabriel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ichim</surname><given-names>Gabriel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004431</institution-id><institution>Fondation de France</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berthenet</surname><given-names>Kevin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006364</institution-id><institution>French National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PLBIO21-003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ichim</surname><given-names>Gabriel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006364</institution-id><institution>French National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PNP2019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hennino</surname><given-names>Ana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004431</institution-id><institution>Fondation de France</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hennino</surname><given-names>Ana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100020549</institution-id><institution>Centre Léon Bérard</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C442</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hennino</surname><given-names>Ana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004543</institution-id><institution>China Scholarship Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Zhichong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A biomechanical approach inducing confined cell migration reveals that mechanical stress has a profound effect on cancer cell survival.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The majority of cancer-related deaths arise following metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dillekås et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chaffer and Weinberg, 2011</xref>). Metastatic cancer cells acquire de novo phenotypic traits allowing them to efficiently leave the primary tumour, enter blood circulation, and survive harsh conditions, then exit the bloodstream and establish metastasis at a distant site. Though the mechanisms driving cancer cell migration and invasion are well documented, with a clear understanding of epithelial–mesenchymal transition and the metastatic niche, no efficient therapeutic strategies currently prevent metastasis formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lambert et al., 2017</xref>). Metastasis is thus largely incurable, yet this lengthy process can take years and the therapeutic window is therefore large enough to envisage its targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mehlen and Puisieux, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Multiple mechanical forces occur at each step of cancer development, from the primary tumour to metastasis. During early tumour development, excessive cell proliferation, massive extracellular matrix deposition, or cancer-associated fibroblasts exert compressive forces on cancer cells that can reach up to 10kPa in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nia et al., 2016</xref>). As they engage in their metastatic journey, cancer cells migrate through barriers including desmoplastic tumour stroma, basal membranes, endothelial layers, and when entering low-diameter capillaries. In healthy tissues or tumours, the extracellular matrix creates pores or tunnel-shaped tracks that are often smaller than the diameter of a cell and migrating cells adjust their shape and size according to these constrictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Butcher et al., 2009</xref>). These events, known as confined migration (CM), have dramatic consequences on cancer cells and might even break the nuclear envelope and trigger DNA damage and mutagenesis if the breaks are not efficiently repaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Raab et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Denais et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>CM can alter the phenotypic traits of cancer cells rendering them even more aggressive. More precisely, repeated nuclear deformations and loss of nuclear envelope integrity can activate an invasive programme, and engage the pro-oncogenic Ras/MAPK signalling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nader et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rudzka et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rudzka et al., 2019</xref>). Once inside the blood or the lymphatic vessels, circulating tumour cells (CTCs) are confronted with deadly fluid shear stress until they extravasate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fan et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, most CTCs are eliminated by apoptosis in a process called anoikis, occurring when cells detach from the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shen and Kang, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Paoli et al., 2013</xref>). By rapidly engaging either the death receptors or the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis, anoikis has evolved as an efficient physiological barrier for preventing the formation of metastatic colonies by CTCs reaching target organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shen and Kang, 2020</xref>). Nonetheless, cancer cells developed strategies to evade anoikis such as overly activated Ras/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways, engaging the tyrosine kinase receptor TrkB, inactivation of E-cadherin and p53 or enhanced autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Sousa Mesquita et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Douma et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Derksen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fung et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chavez-Dominguez et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Mechanical stress has emerged as a key factor in shaping the pro-metastatic features of cancer cells. We thus hypothesized that CM may also contribute to the metastatic potential by impacting anoikis and cancer invasiveness. We show here that breast cancer cells having undergone CM, but not compression, become resistant to anoikis, through a mechanism involving lowering apoptotic caspase activation through an upregulation of Inhibitory of Apoptosis Proteins (IAPs). We also report that treatment with SMAC mimetics to lower IAPs expression restores the sensitivity to anoikis. Ultimately, a single round of CM is sufficient to enhance emerging aggressiveness, the most obvious effects observed being for single-cell migration and escape from natural killer (NK) cell-mediated immune surveillance. In addition, these observations are endorsed in vivo by higher lung metastatic burden when mice are engrafted with breast cancer cells challenged by CM. Taken together, our results support that CM triggers a particular signalling signature that might favour certain metastatic hallmarks such as resistance to anoikis and increased invasiveness.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CM confers breast cancer cells with resistance to anoikis</title><p>The human breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 are highly invasive and aggressive in vitro and in vivo, and represent an ideal cellular model to study metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cailleau et al., 1974</xref>). To investigate the effects of constriction on these cells, we subjected them to a forced passage through a membrane with 3 µm in diameter pores, via a serum gradient, mimicking the CM encountered during cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rudzka et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Porporato et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xia et al., 2019</xref>). MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded onto a matrigel-coated tissue culture insert, prior to applying the serum gradient, and thus initially invaded the matrigel plug before following the serum through the microporous membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We ascertained that CM did not affect cell viability, by verifying the incorporation of Calcein AM (viability dye), and by showing that apoptosis-triggering cytochrome <italic>c</italic> was not released by the mitochondria of CM cells, as it co-localized with COX IV (mitochondrial marker) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref>). Since caspases are the main apoptotic executioners, we next tested if they were activated in CM-challenged cancer cells. For this experiment, MDA-MB-231 cells expressing a bimolecular fluorescence complementation-based caspase-3 reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>), which is functional in actinomycin D-treated and not in CRISPR<sup>BAX/BAK</sup> cells, were subjected to CM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Recovered cells were viable and had not activated apoptotic effector caspases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), substantiating our previous result. In a complementary approach, we determined cell cycle distribution and found that CM cells have a negligible proportion of cells in subG1 (apoptotic cells) right after constriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>) and while they have a slight arrest in G1 phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>), this does not affect the overall cellular proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In line with this, CM cells displayed an unaltered mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP production and did not generate excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F–I</xref>). Hence, the CM model used here did not alter cell viability and was deemed suitable for studying phenotypic changes occurring in these mechanically challenged cancer cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Confined migration (CM) confers breast cancer cells with resistance to anoikis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic illustration of the 3-µm transwell-based CM model.

Importantly, CM-challenged MDA-MB-231 cells survived, grew, and formed clonogenic structures in low attachment conditions, as evidenced by the spheres generated, more efficiently than control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The effect was not restricted to MDA-MB-231 cells since CM-challenged Hs578T breast cancer cells also developed more colonies than control counterparts, indicating that CM-challenged cells had overcome anoikis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1J</xref>). This is also the case when cells are grown in soft agar, in an anchorage-independent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). In addition, resistance to anoikis was assessed by IncuCyte Imager-based real-time imaging, using SYTOX Green dye exclusion, and again breast cancer cells undergoing CM had a survival advantage when grown in low attachment conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H, I</xref>). Next, we investigated whether the survival advantage acquired following a single round of CM was transient. MDA-MB-231 cells were challenged by CM once and anoikis resistance was quantified at 3, 5, and 7 days post-CM, revealing that resistance to anoikis was transient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Since anoikis is a variant of apoptosis, we wondered whether the activation of pro-apoptotic effector caspases was affected by CM. This was assessed by immunoblotting for cleaved caspase-3 and PARP-1, a proxy for efficient caspase activation. Strikingly, CM-challenged cancer cells had lower caspase-3 processing into the active p17 and p19 fragments, whereas PARP-1 cleavage followed the same pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K, L</xref>). Lower effector caspase activation was also confirmed using a fluorometric caspase-3/7 assay, demonstrating that inhibition was particularly important for cells grown in ultra-low attachment and soft agar conditions (further designated as anoikis-favouring conditions) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>).</p><p>To verify whether this resistance to anoikis was specific to cells having undergone CM and could not arise following the compressive stress experienced within primary tumours upon uncontrolled proliferation or increased extracellular matrix deposition, we tested the effects of compression on resistance to anoikis. We exposed MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro to a defined compression by pressing them against a permeable membrane with a weighted piston. The different weights translated into different pressures (200, 400, or 600 Pa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1K</xref>). As shown by the increased nuclear size in compressed cells, this device was suitable to evaluate the effects of compression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1L</xref>). Resistance to anoikis, as assessed by growing these cells in anoikis-favouring conditions, was not modified under compression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N, O</xref>), suggesting that acquisition of resistance to anoikis may be specific to CM. In addition, cancer cell migration through 8 µm in diameter microporous transwells, which does not impose cellular constriction, did not confer cancer cells with resistance to anoikis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1M, N</xref>) and had no impact on caspase activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1O</xref>). Of note, the expression of several anti-apoptotic proteins such as BCL-xL, BCL2, and MCL1 was unchanged in CM cells, suggesting another resistance mechanism to anoikis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1P</xref>). In conclusion, these results show that CM has a profound impact on cancer cells resistance to cell death through inhibition of pro-apoptotic caspases.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>CM-driven resistance to anoikis relies on the anti-apoptotic IAP proteins</title><p>Previous studies reported that IAPs such as cIAP1, cIAP2, and XIAP promote resistance to anoikis in several cancers, through caspase inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Toruner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berezovskaya et al., 2005</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that under CM challenge, IAPs expression may underlie resistance to anoikis. This was tested by immunoblotting for cIAP1, cIAP2, and XIAP protein expression in CM MDA-MB-231 cells grown in anoikis-favouring conditions, which revealed an upregulation of all three IAPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, left panel for densitometry analysis). Conversely, MDA-MB-231 cells subjected to compression or migration through 8 µm in diameter microporous transwells had unaltered levels of IAPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). To further investigate this correlation, we transiently overexpressed all three IAPs in MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Enforced expression of cIAP1 and XIAP significantly enhanced resistance to anoikis in cells grown under anoikis-favouring conditions, while cIAP2 overexpression was dispensable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref>). In a complementary approach, we deleted all three IAPs in MDA-MB-231 cells through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Following CM and growth in anoikis-favouring conditions, control cells (EV) displayed the expected resistance to anoikis, whereas IAP-depleted cells lost their survival advantage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In addition, the use of a SMAC mimetic, one of several developed to specifically induce IAP degradation, namely BV6, successfully depleted both cIAP1 and XIAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Varfolomeev et al., 2007</xref>).

We initially performed qRT-PCR analysis to assess IAPs mRNA expression in CM cells and uncovered that their transcript expression was not increased compared to control cells, with a significant inhibition observed for cIAP2 and XIAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). IAPs contain a RING domain with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity which mediates their own K48 polyubiquitination and that of other protein targets and thus it is crucial for the role of IAPs in suppressing apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Estornes and Bertrand, 2015</xref>). To identify a possible post-transcriptional regulation of IAPs, we first compared the total amount of K48-ubiquitin-linked proteins in control and CM cells. Constricted cells displayed an accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, indicating a possible bottleneck for protein degradation in CM-stressed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). In addition, we performed a chase assay with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, in order to assess protein half-life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>), using MCL-1 as a positive control as it is rapidly degraded by the proteasome. When focusing on XIAP, which was the most differentially expressed IAP in CM-challenged cells, we observed a slower decrease in XIAP protein in CM cells compared to control cells, suggesting a lower proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). XIAP may thus be more stable in CM cells, which might explain its higher expression following CM. CM-triggered resistance to anoikis therefore involves the pro-survival IAP proteins, which can be efficiently targeted by pre-clinically validated SMAC mimetics.</p><p>IAPs are commonly described to modulate NF-κB pathway, while in a positive feedback loop NF-κB regulates IAPs expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diessenbacher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gyrd-Hansen and Meier, 2010</xref>). To test whether CM activates NF-κB, we first assessed p65 translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus upon CM, and showed an increase in cells displaying nuclear p65 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Using two luciferase-based NF-κB reporter constructs, CM was also found to increase NF-κB transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H, I</xref>). To test whether NF-κB activation was required for CM-driven resistance to anoikis, we expressed in MDA-MB-231 cells the IκB super repressor (IκB<sup>SR</sup>), which is a non-degradable IκBα that blocks the nuclear shuttling of p65 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Van Antwerp et al., 1996</xref>). Accordingly, the stable expression of IκB<sup>SR</sup> blocked p65 nuclear shuttling following TNFα treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1J</xref>). However, in these settings, blocking the NF-κB pathway in CM cells did not prevent their resistance to anoikis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1K,L</xref> ). In addition, the artificial activation of NF-κB pathway using TNFα treatment, can upregulate cIAP2 as previously described, yet it had no effect on both cIAP1 and XIAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1M, N</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diessenbacher et al., 2008</xref>). These data suggest that CM-driven mechanical stress is characterized by NF-κB activation, which is not involved in the survival advantage observed in CM-challenged cancer cells.</p><p>An important issue is whether CM selects for a cellular population exhibiting higher IAPs expression and/or anoikis resistance or it specifically induces de novo these changes. If the observed phenotypes were the effect of a selection mechanism, this would imply that cells with higher IAPs expression or being more resistant to anoikis (these cells being pre-existent in a heterogeneous cell population) would have a migration advantage when undergoing CM. To test this, first we used the CRISPR/Cas9 cells described previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), with CRISPR EV considered as high cIAP1 and XIAP-expressing cells. We stained the EV and the CRISPR cIAP1/XIAP with the lipophilic cyanide dyes DiO (green) and DiI (red), respectively, and then mixed them a known ratio of 50:50. The cellular mix was then subjected to CM and at the end the green-to-red ratio was reassessed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>, the score was similar to the initial 50:50 ratio, with IAPs high expressing cells (the EV cells) showing the same CM capacity as IAPs KO cells. In a complementary approach, to determine whether CM selects cancer cells initially displaying an increased resistance to anoikis, we enriched in anoikis-resistant cells by continuously culturing MDA-MB-231 cells in ultra-low attachment plates for 7 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref>). As described above, control adherent and anoikis-resistant cells were stained with DiO and DiI, respectively, mixed in a 50:50 ratio and tested in CM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref>). This time as well we did not observe any CM advantage driven by resistance to anoikis, as the green-to-red ratio of cells undergoing CM is identical to the initial one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N</xref>). These results imply that CM is not selecting for cells having a different expression of IAPs or displaying resistance to anoikis.</p><p>To conclude, resistance to anoikis driven by CM mechanical stress relies on the pro-survival function of IAPs, regulated at the post-transcriptional level following mechanical stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>CM enhances the aggressiveness of breast cancer cells and promotes evasion from immune surveillance</title><p>To gain mechanistic insights into the relationship between cellular constriction and resistance to anoikis, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA seq) analysis on MDA-MB-231 cells undergoing CM, compared to control cells. Remarkably, CM cells displayed an almost global inhibition of transcription, making their transcriptional profile distinct from control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). To investigate this effect further, we performed a Western blot analysis for histone H3 epigenetic modifications, associated with transcriptional activation (H3K27 acetylation) or heterochromatin (H3K9 tri-methylation). Consistently with their overall transcriptional inhibition, CM cells had a lower histone H3 acetylation and a reduction in heterochromatin (lower H3K9 me3), which may indicate a decrease in nuclear stiffness, which is needed when cells navigate through narrow spaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Given that metastatic cells acquire an aggressive phenotype, we thus hypothesized that CM may impact cancer cell motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lambert et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Since external mechanical forces are responsible for rapid cytoskeleton rearrangement, we first stained F-actin in control and CM-stressed MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Torrino et al., 2021</xref>). This revealed an increased number of stress fibres following CM, in addition to more abundant filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). By using Nanolive imager-based cellular tomography, we uncovered that cancer cells subjected to CM had a higher variation in cell area over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). To test whether these phenotypic changes were accompanied by increased cell motility, single-cell migration was first tracked in control and CM cells over a 24-hr period. CM-challenged cancer cells displayed a significantly higher velocity and travelled further than control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref>). Proliferating cancer cells adhere to their substrate via focal adhesions that are equally important during migration, especially metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Devreotes and Horwitz, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Roussos et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we used immunofluorescence for two key components of focal adhesions, namely paxillin and vinculin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>), to assess the number of focal adhesions following CM. The increased single-cell migration observed was not correlated with the number of focal adhesions. In contrast to single-cell migration, breast cancer cells subjected to a single round of CM did not outperform control cells when assessed by collective cell migration and invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–K</xref>). As cells encounter several mechanical challenges during metastasis, we then imposed three consecutive CM passages on MDA-MB-231 cells, and found that challenged cells had a significant gain in chemotaxis and collective cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L–N</xref>, experimental setup in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>). In an effort to determine other features that might facilitate CM, we focused on nuclear lamins, which are important regulators of nuclear stiffness and shape during CM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harada et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Leeuw et al., 2018</xref>). To establish whether lamins have a role during MDA-MB-231 CM, we stably overexpressed lamin A GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1H</xref>) and set up a competition-like scenario between lamin A GFP overexpressing and control cells stained in red with DiI, similar to the experiments performed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K, M</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1I</xref>). Confirming previous studies, we also found that MDA-MB-231 cells with higher levels of lamin A have a lower capacity to perform CM, most probably due to increased nuclear stiffness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1J</xref>). Yet, when the expression of lamin A/C was tested in cancer cells right after CM, it was similar to that found in control cells, implying once more that CM does not select for cells with certain characteristics, such as lower expression of lamins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1K</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Confined migration (CM) confers breast cancer cells with a discrete aggressive behaviour.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative immunofluorescence images of MDA-MB-231 cells after CM with phalloidin-stained actin filaments.

The immune system plays a crucial role in preventing metastatic dissemination through a process called immune surveillance. The innate immune NK cells and the adaptive ones, T cells αβ (CD4+ and CD8+), as well as γδ T lymphocytes are the unique actors of this phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pagès et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barrow et al., 2018</xref>). The advantage of NK-mediated immune surveillance is that it is very effective on cancer cells that are in the blood circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garrido and Aptsiauri, 2019</xref>). We therefore reasoned that CM might also influence NK-mediated immune surveillance. To test this, we co-cultured control and CM-challenged cells stained with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) with primary NK cells, obtained from healthy donor blood. Interestingly, breast cancer cells were partially protected from the NK-mediated cytotoxicity following CM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3O</xref>, CFSE<sup>low</sup> population represents apoptotic cells), consistent with lower levels of toxic granzyme B incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3P</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these data demonstrate that a single event of CM has a profound effect on single-cell migration, while several rounds of CM enhance cancer cell chemotaxis and collective migration.

Overall, these events contribute to enhancing breast cancer cell aggressiveness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The role of cell death in cancer has been extensively investigated and its inhibition by cell-autonomous mechanisms such as overexpressing IAPs or anti-apoptotic BCL2 family proteins is a stepping stone for oncogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gyrd-Hansen and Meier, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Strasser and Vaux, 2020</xref>). However, very little is known on how the mechanically challenging tumour microenvironment impacts efficient lethal caspase activation and cancer cell death, and how this might favour cancer aggressiveness. This is a timely issue since the causal link between tumour stiffening, mechanical stress, and cancer progression is well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Paszek et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acerbi et al., 2015</xref>). As the tumour stiffness and the inherent mechanical stress recently gained notoriety in favouring cancer progression, one could wonder whether this pro-oncogenic effect may be partly attributed to an underappreciated inhibitory effect on efficient induction of tumour cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shen and Kang, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gensbittel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nia et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Here, we characterized the impact of mechanical stress, mimicking that encountered either within the primary tumour (compression) or during metastasis (CM), on the acquisition of tumourigenic properties, in particular resistance to cell death. Our experimental setup, based on commercially available transwell membranes with pores of 3 µm in diameter, forced breast cancer cells to undergo severe CM towards a chemotactic cue. Although it was previously reported that CM caused nuclear lamina breaks and widespread DNA damage, the MDA-MB-231 cells subjected to CM used herein recovered well from the forced passage, lacked obvious apoptotic caspase activation, and displayed no major differences in cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Raab et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Denais et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harada et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pfeifer et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the CM that cells undergo to exit the primary tumour, CTCs also need to survive the complete loss of cell attachment, which normally triggers anoikis. Since resistance to anoikis was previously described to protect CTCs and favour their metastatic seeding, we tested this in breast cancer cells challenged by CM and unveiled a significant resistance to anoikis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Paoli et al., 2013</xref>). As anoikis is a variation of apoptosis that relies on lethal caspase activation, we found that CM-driven resistance to anoikis was also mirrored by an inhibition of caspase activation. Although it has been reported that resistance to anoikis could be promoted by shear stress, we report here for the first time that CM, a mechanical stress in the metastatic cascade happening before the fluid shear stress, can also induce resistance to anoikis in breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Conversely, cancer cells migrating through larger 8 µm in diameter microporous transwells, which do not induce CM, did not acquire resistance to anoikis. Aside from CM, cancer cells are subjected in situ to an important compressive stress within a rapidly growing tumour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nia et al., 2020</xref>). Regarding cell death sensitivity, however, compression did not impact the resistance to anoikis, thus discriminating both types of mechanical stress. Interestingly, resistance to anoikis was transient since it remained significant up to 3 days following the mechanical challenge. This reversibility suggests that a temporary epigenetic, transcriptional, and/or translational programme is induced following acute constriction.</p><p>We then sought to uncover the cell-autonomous pro-survival pathways engaged in CM-challenged breast cancer cells and we narrowed them down to the pro-survival IAPs. Interestingly, these proteins were described to promote resistance to anoikis in several cancers. Nevertheless this is the first study showing that mechanical stress increases IAPs expression, especially cIAP1 and XIAP, likely by modifying their protein turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Toruner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berezovskaya et al., 2005</xref>). In an effort to revert resistance to anoikis and restore caspase-dependent cell death, we used SMAC mimetics developed to efficiently deplete IAPs. Currently, several SMAC mimetics such as birinapant and LCL161 are in phase two clinical trials for ovarian cancer and myeloma (source: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">https://clinicaltrials.gov/</ext-link>). Importantly, we found that BV6 treatment re-sensitized cancer cells subjected to CM to anoikis, reinforcing the relevance of SMAC mimetics for clinical use. Moreover, we found that breast cancer cells experiencing CM activate the NF-κB pathway, which is likely due to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pfeifer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hadian and Krappmann, 2011</xref>). However, our results indicate that NF-κB activation is dispensable for the acquired resistance to anoikis, yet we cannot exclude additional pro-survival effects.</p><p>In this study, we also made an attempt to establish whether CM is actively inducing changes in IAPs protein levels and resistance to anoikis or simply it selects and enriches in a pre-existing cellular population displaying these characteristics. The experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K–N</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1I–K</xref> do not support the scenario of a selection process, yet we cannot completely exclude that CM selects for cells having other characteristics indirectly influencing IAPs expression or anoikis resistance.</p><p>To gain a clearer insight into CM-associated gene regulation, control and cancer cells experiencing CM were analysed by RNA sequencing. CM had a dramatic effect of overall transcriptional inhibition, which is most probably the immediate effect of DNA damage and altered chromatin organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shah, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hsia et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Heine et al., 2008</xref>). Indeed, this was mirrored by the marked reduction of acetylated histone H3, illustrating global transcriptional inhibition. However, the duration of transcriptional inhibition following acute cell constriction remains to be investigated. In addition, it would be relevant to test by ChIP-Seq the exact gene regulatory networks impacted by loss of histone acetylation at promoter regions.</p><p>Since several gene expression signatures in CM cells were focused on cell adhesion and extracellular matrix disassembly, we next established whether breast cancer cells acquired migratory and invasive properties after recovering from a single round of CM. In line with published data, these cells displayed modifications of their cellular motility, with most obvious differences observed for F-actin filament remodelling and single-cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rudzka et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tse et al., 2012</xref>). When CM was applied three consecutive times, the recovered cells were very aggressive<italic>,</italic> possibly due to the acquisition of a more stable aggressive transcriptional and/or epigenetic programme. This illustrates that multiple CM events encountered by a cancer cell during its dissemination to distant organs can have dramatic effects on its aggressive phenotype. These data support the existing relationship between mechanical stress and increased aggressiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nader et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tse et al., 2012</xref>). A recent study from Nader et al. elegantly showed that invasive foci in breast cancer are enriched in constricted cells characterized by deformed nuclei and frequent TREX1-dependant DNA lesions. Relevant to our study, these cells were in a partial EMT state that enhanced their invasion potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nader et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Aside from the capacity to overcome anoikis and discrete modifications in motility, cancer cells experiencing a single CM event were also protected from NK-mediated immune surveillance. Despite these promising results, further research should be undertaken to evaluate NK function and analyse NK cytokine secretion in the presence of mechanically stressed cells. Since NK immune surveillance is conditioned by the expression on the cancer cell surface of MHC/HLA class I molecules and activation ligands, their expression should also be profiled following a mechanical stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garrido and Aptsiauri, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we tested whether CM-triggered resistance to anoikis, increased single-cell motility and evasion from NK-mediated immune surveillance were reflected in vivo by increasing the metastatic potential of invading cells. This was indeed the case since MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells subjected to a single round of CM had a significant advantage to form metastatic lesions in the lungs of nude mice. This was also evidenced for cancer cells experiencing several rounds of CM.</p><p>In summary, this study refines our understanding of the pathophysiological relationship between mechanical stress and cancer aggressiveness. Our model of mechanical stress mimicking CM had an unexpected effect on resistance to anoikis, which was then mirrored by an enhanced metastatic seeding. In addition, our findings unveiled a previously unknown reliance of mechanically challenged breast cancer cells on IAPs for survival that could be targeted by treatment with SMAC mimetics.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines</title><p>Human breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 and Hs 578T (both a gift from P.

review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the paper &quot;Confined migration promotes cancer metastasis through resistance to anoikis and increased invasiveness&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor.</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The study proposes that confined migration renders breast cancer cells resistant to apoptosis via NFkappaB-dependent mechanisms. The consensus among the reviewers was that while the technical aspect of the study is impressive and experiments were very well performed, demonstrating the value of mimetic bioengineering approaches, the presented data did not include the necessary rigor to support the postulated central premise.</p><p>Specifically, while reviewers agreed that the team conducted a technically impressive study and that the bioengineering aspect of the system is exciting and merits broad use by investigators, there was also consensus regarding the numerous shortcomings of the study. The main concern was that the authors did not address whether the observed effects were &quot;selected&quot; by the provided conditions, or &quot;induced&quot; by the experimental settings. Two of the reviewers noted, and all agreed during the discussion period, that the lack of demonstration to whether confined migration is a causative or a selection process constitutes a major shortcoming. Further, added issues had to do with the incorrect use of statistical approaches, which often rendered biologically similar results as &quot;statistically significant&quot;, while other times results that seemed rather biologically distinct were referred to statistically similar or unchanged. It was also noted that the discussion should address recent/similar reported observations made by another group (in Cell). There were some additional points where more data was required to support conclusions, such as whether expression levels of anti-apoptotic proteins are evident prior to or following confined migration (please note detailed provided points by each reviewer). It was hence the consensus that results, statistics, and conclusions need significant clarifications, and it was agreed that the scope of the needed revisions is substantial.</p><p>We wish you good luck with this work and we hope you will consider <italic>eLife</italic> for future submissions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript by Fanfone et al., describes the use an in vitro model of confined migration through transwells via a serum gradient, to study how mechanically challenged breast cancer cells acquire IAP-mediated resistance against anoikis. They demonstrate that these mechanically challenged breast cancer cells survive low-attachment culture to form spheroids. Additionally, the authors demonstrate that after confined migration NFkB is activated but potentially dispensable, as when it is blocked, it does not impact anoikis or spheroid formation. Also, mechanically challenged breast cancer cells demonstrate enhanced motility. Finally, the authors also demonstrate in vivo how mechanically challenged breast cancer cells were more metastatic competent to successfully colonize the lungs. This is an impressive manuscript that reveals how developing an in vitro model of confined migration provides much needed insight as to how microenvironmental constriction can in fact aid cancer cells in acquiring a pro-survival and enhanced migratory phenotype to successfully metastasize.</p><p>This is very interesting paper and the authors should be commended on all the work that was put into it. The conclusions were mostly supported by the data, and if some areas could be clarified would be strengthened.</p><p>P6 line 194: do you mean cIAP2 over expression was dispensable?</p><p>Figure 2g: is there a legend missing?</p><p>Suppl Figb is confusing, could you clarify in the legend?</p><p>P7 line 223: Change &quot;This&quot; to &quot;To&quot;</p><p>P7 line 224: please fix extra paragraph spacing.</p><p>P8 line 259: delete &quot;on&quot;.</p><p>Figure 3i and in the corresponding text: how thick is this Matrigel plug? Was there any cell invasion/migration in the z-plane that could be affecting some of them</p><p>P8 line 280 or Figure 3m,n: could you clarify the following: When mechanically challenged multiple times, these cells appear to gain additional migratory capabilities though it was not clear if these serially mechanically challenged cells were migrating on a scratch wound or invading through a Matrigel plug. Also, in the text the authors write that serially mechanically challenged cells gain directionality but there were no data on directionality ratios. Could you extract that from your existing data?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors present a detailed account of the anti-apoptotic characteristics of breast cancer cells that have undergone confined migration, specifically demonstrating an upregulation of cIAP1, cIAP2 and <italic>XIAP</italic> that promotes anoikis resistance. These cells were also more migratory and potentially displayed a resistance to immune surveillance.</p><p>On the whole the paper is technically well performed, although the conclusion that confined migration causes these effects needs further work to be validated. A key question is whether confined migration has caused these changes to occur within individual cells, or whether the assay design results in selection of cells with these characteristics.</p><p>For example, it may not be a surprise that selecting cells on the basis of their ability to migrate through a membrane would result in cells with an increased random migratory capacity? Therefore it may also be possible that these innately migratory cells have different expression patterns that include an upregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins? Therefore, there is a need to determine whether these cells were present in the population prior to confined migration, or whether these characteristics were acquired during the process.</p><p>On the whole, this manuscript is very well presented and well written. The results and clearly presented, although there is scope for a closer investigation of some of the claims of significance, as well as a need to address the causative vs selective nature of confined migration.</p><p>The main thing I would suggest is an experiment that is capable of determining whether the cells with upregulated cIAP1/cIAP2/<italic>XIAP</italic> (or decreased H3K27ac) are present within the population prior to the process of confined migration. If these cells are already present then it doesn't change the validity of the paper, but it completely changes the interpretation. If the cells are not present, and there is a change following confined migration, then the conclusions of the paper stand.</p><p>This could be done by endogenously tagging cIAP1/2/X, or by correlative, antibody based single-cell imaging of the two populations using some of the high content approaches already presented in this paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Mechanical stress has been emerging as the key factor for activating pro-metastatic features, and authors hypothesize confined migration results in anoikis (death in suspension) and increased invasiveness.</p><p>By clever repurposing of transwell membranes, authors have generated a confined migration assay (CM), in which cells that have crossed the 3 micron-pore membrane are collected, cultured and further analyzed. The intensity of the CM-related response was shown to increase with number of CM rounds, and the response decays and reverts back 5 days after the CM event.</p><p>The resistance to anoikis achieved by CM was not conferred by compressive stress, or migration without constriction through 8-micron pores, and it was further demonstrated to rely on NFkB activation and IAP regulation at post-transcriptional level.</p><p>Using RNASeq, authors next show that while transcription is globally inhibited, resulting in lower nuclear stiffness, components of cell adhesion and regulation of NK-cell cytotoxicity were upregulated. Both of these functions were elegantly and succinctly confirmed by time-lapse measurements of cell velocities and immunofluorescence.</p><p>Finally, in vivo experiments confirmed metastasis was increased in tail-vein injected cells post-CM.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1. It would be important to demonstrate that, prior to confined migration, cells have similar features, and that CM is not selecting for subpopulation of cells (e.g. low lamin expression).</p><p>2. A recent study by Nader et al., published in Cell 2021, notes that breast cancer cells exposed to confinement go through nuclear envelope breakage and TREX1-dependent DNA damage which causes increase in invasiveness. It would be important to describe this study in Discussion, and, if possible, link it to here presented results.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73150.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: The authors appealed the original decision.

Of note, this a major concern also raised by Reviewer 3.</p><p>Now we have performed several experiments that argue in the favor of a causative effect of confined migration. To summarize our reasoning, we found that post-CM there is an upregulation of IAPs when breast cancer cells are grown in anoikis-promoting conditions and that these cells are also more resistant to anoikis.</p><p>If these were the effect of a selection mechanism, this would imply that cells with higher levels of IAPs or being more resistant to anoikis (pre-existent in cell population) would have a migration advantage when undergoing CM.</p><p>To formally test this, we have done the following experiments:</p><p>1. First, we used CRISPR Ctl, cIAP1 and <italic>XIAP</italic> cells (with Ctl considered as cIAP1/<italic>XIAP</italic> high and the CRISPR as low-expressing cells). We then stained the CTL and the CRISPR cells with the lipophilic cyanine dyes DiO (green) and DiI (red), respectively. These cells were mixed at a known ratio (50:50) and subjected to confined migration. At the end, the proportion of Ctl:CRISPR cIAP1 and Ctl:CRISPR <italic>XIAP</italic> was re-assessed and scored, revealing a similar 50:50 ratio.</p><p>This implies that cells expressing higher levels of cIAP1 or <italic>XIAP</italic> (the Ctl cells) have no CM advantage and that CM is not selecting for a specific cell population. This is now shown in Figure 2K-L.</p><p>2. In a similar manner, we derived single-cell clones from the parental MDA-MB-231 cells and tested the expression of both cIAP1 and <italic>XIAP</italic>. We then selected two clones that have either low (clone 8) or higher (clone 9) expression of both cIAP1 and <italic>XIAP</italic>. We marked these and tested them in CM as described above (clone 8 stained in green with DiO and 9 in red using DiI). The conclusion was similar: a higher expression level of cIAP1 and <italic>XIAP</italic> does not impart an advantage for CM. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-73150-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>3. To test whether CM selects cancer cells initially displaying an increased resistance to anoikis, we designed the following experiment: we enriched in MDA-MB-231 cells that are resistant to anoikis by growing them in ultra-low attachment conditions for 7 days. As above, these cells were then marked in red with DiI while parental cells were stained in green with DiO, mixed at 50:50 ratio and then subjected to CM, exactly as described for (1) and (2). Since after CM we found the same 50:50 ratio, this suggests that CM is not selecting for cells displaying resistance to anoikis. This is included in Figure 2M, N.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1. It would be important to demonstrate that, prior to confined migration, cells have similar features, and that CM is not selecting for subpopulation of cells (e.g. low lamin expression).</p></disp-quote><p>We now address the issue of causative versus selective process of CM that was rightly raised by the second reviewer as well. With the experiments presented above (reviewers 2, main comment), we hope to convince R3 that CM is inducing the observed phenotype (increased IAPs and resistance to anoikis). In addition, as shown bellow the breast cancer cells undergoing confined migration have the same expression of lamin A/C as control cell, arguing against a selective pressure to allow low lamin-expressing cells to navigate more efficiently through narrow obstacles (see Figure 3 —figure supplement 1K). We also argue that lamin expression sets a threshold of CM competence. To establish whether lamins have a role during MDA-MB-231 CM, we stably overexpressed lamin A GFP (see Figure 3 —figure supplement 1H) and set up a competition-like scenario between lamin A-GFP overexpressing and control cells stained in red with DiI, similar to the experiments performed in Figure 2K, M (see Figure 3 —figure supplement 1I). Confirming previous studies, we also found that MDA-MB-231 cells with higher levels of lamin A have a lower capacity to perform CM, most probably due to increased nuclear stiffness (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1J).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.
