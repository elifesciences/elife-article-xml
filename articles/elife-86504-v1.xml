inherent heterogeneous information can be maintained in adults. However, highly resolvable cellular specialization is less well characterized in different anatomical regions of the skin. Pig is regarded as an excellent model animal for human skin research in view of its similar physiology to human. In this study, single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on pig skin tissues from six different anatomical regions of Chenghua (CH) pigs, with a superior skin thickness trait, and the back site of large white (LW) pigs. We obtained 233,715 cells, representing seven cell types, among which we primarily characterized the heterogeneity of the top three cell types, including smooth muscle cells (SMCs), endothelial cells (ECs), and fibroblasts (FBs). Then, we further identified several subtypes of SMCs, ECs, and FBs, and discovered the expression patterns of site-specific genes involved in some important pathways such as the immune response and extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis in different anatomical regions. By comparing differentially expressed genes of skin FBs among different anatomical regions, we considered TNN, COL11A1, and INHBA as candidate genes for facilitating ECM accumulation. These findings of heterogeneity in the main skin cell types from different anatomical sites will contribute to a better understanding of inherent skin information and place the potential focus on skin generation, transmission, and transplantation, paving the foundation for human skin priming.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pig</kwd><kwd>skin</kwd><kwd>cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Chengdu Livestock and Poultry Genetic Resources Protection Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Yanzhi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Sichuan Science and Technology Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021ZDZX0008</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Yanzhi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The heterogeneity in molecule and function of three main cell types of smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts from both different anatomical sites of pig skin was comprehensively exposited.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The issue of how inherent information contributes to anatomical site-specific differences has inspired extensive exploration, and the pattern formation of spatial arrangement depends on the expression control of specific genes with a cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rinn et al., 2006</xref>). The cellular specialization of anatomical site-specific pattern is determined in the embryo, and the inherent information could also be maintained throughout adulthood along with continual self-renewal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rinn et al., 2006</xref>). Some cellular special information of anatomical site-specific patterns in other tissues has been discovered, such as in the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Litviňuková et al., 2020</xref>) and muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Micheli et al., 2020</xref>), but the inherent information of cellular specialization is less well understood in physiologically different anatomical skin regions.</p><p>Skin is the largest organ, providing a physical, chemical, and biological barrier for the body. It consists of the upper epidermis and the lower dermis layers separated by the basement membrane, with unambiguous spatial patterns of morphological and functional specialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Simpson et al., 2011</xref>). Embryological studies have shown that anatomical positional-specific pattern is provided by the stroma, which is composed of extracellular matrix (ECM) and mesenchymal or dermal cells during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rinn et al., 2006</xref>). Pioneering studies discovered that the different anatomical regions of the body skin dermis arose from different origins. The dorsum dermis originates from the dermato-myotome, while the ventral and face dermis derive from the lateral plate mesoderm and the neural crest, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jinno et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ohtola et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wong et al., 2006</xref>). In adults, dermal cells confer the positional identity and memory for skin patterning and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Driskell and Watt, 2015</xref>), raising the issue of what regional discrepancy could be maintained against plentiful cellular turnover in skin.</p><p>The dermis is mainly composed of resident fibroblasts (FBs), smooth muscle cells (SMCs), endothelial cells (ECs), and immune cells, and these skin cells provide structure, strength, flexibility, and defense to the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Driskell and Watt, 2015</xref>). FBs, the main cell type in the dermis, are responsible for the collagen deposits and elastic fiber formation of the ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parsonage et al., 2005</xref>), participating in skin morphogenesis, homeostasis, and various physiological and pathological mechanisms, including skin development, aging, healing, and fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Auxenfans et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Driskell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Driskell and Watt, 2015</xref>). SMCs, which form blood vessels and arrector pili muscle (APM), play a critical role in controlling blood distribution as well as maintaining the structural integrity of the blood vessels and APM in skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Driskell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu and Gomez, 2019</xref>). ECs organize the vascular plexus, which plays a predominant role in vascular remodeling, metabolism, and the immune response in the dermis, and EC metabolism is tightly connected to barrier integrity, immune and cellular crosstalk with SMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cantelmo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Miyagawa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tombor et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, during formation and development of the skin, the dermal reaction is realized by cell–cell communication, and dynamic interactions between cells and ECM, as well as regulatory factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Driskell and Watt, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The pig is used as a model animal to research human skin biology because of its similar pathological and physiological skin attributes to those of human skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Khiao In et al., 2019</xref>). The Chenghua (CH) pig, a novel Chinese indigenous population with superior skin thickness and strong FBs activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zou et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zou et al., 2023</xref>), is considered as a potential model animal for researching mammalian skin biology. Here, to reveal the anatomical positional heterogeneity of the skin, single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on pig skin tissues from six anatomical regions of CH pigs and the back site of large white (LW) pigs. We obtained a well-resolved single-cell transcriptome atlas of 233,715 cells and identified seven cell types with unique gene expression signatures. In our datasets, we focused on the top three cell types, including SMCs, ECs, and FBs. SMCs revealed the signature of contractile SMCs, mesenchymal-like phenotype, and macrophage-like phenotype and presented the expression patterns of site-specific genes related to ECM-integrins and immune response in different skin anatomical sites. ECs were classified into four EC phenotypes, and the gene expression patterns, which are related to integrins, immunity, and metabolism, were explored across different skin anatomical sites. Moreover, based on these comparative differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of FBs, we identified three subtypes among different regions and found that TNN, COL11A1, and INHBA might be candidate genes for ECM accumulation. Taken together, the present data offer a comprehensive understanding of the single-cell atlas that displays the cellular inherent information of anatomical site-specific patterns in skin, supporting future exploration as a baseline for healthy and morbid human skin.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single-cell transcriptome profiling identified different skin anatomical sites in CH pig</title><p>To characterize an overview of single-cell transcriptomic atlas of pig skin tissues from different anatomical sites, we sampled CH pig skin tissues on the head, ear, shoulder, back, abdomen, and leg from three female 180-day-old individuals, then applied scRNA-seq of 18 isolated skin cell samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Meanwhile, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways were prominently attributed to FBs such as protein digestion and absorption or ECM–receptor interaction, ECs involved in cell adhesion molecules or the Rap1 signaling pathway, and SMCs including the NF-kappa B signaling pathway or the TNF signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, given the potential cross-species comparisons, we implemented overlapping skin cell atlases among pig, human, and mouse using a t-SNE plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>).

When discounting the unique skin thickness of CH pig resulting in this ratio discrepancy of the cell types such as excessive cell number of SMCs and ECs, dominantly originated from the vessel bed, we suggested that the pig skin tissue could be considered as the human skin model at single-cell levels for research purposes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Heterogeneity of skin SMCs in different anatomical sites</title><p>SMCs play critical roles in forming blood vessels and APM in skin tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Driskell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu and Gomez, 2019</xref>); however, no study has uncharacterized skin SMCs at single-cell resolution. Here, we interrogated the heterogeneity and function of cutaneous SMCs. The t-SNE analysis divided SMCs into five subpopulations (clusters 0, 2, 5, 6, and 13) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), in which the MYH11 and ACTA2 marker genes were used for the immunohistochemistry staining of skin sections to validate the SMCs’ microanatomical sight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Meanwhile, GO functional analysis was performed on the highly expressed genes for each cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Clusters 0 and 13 predominantly took part in structural constituent of muscle, acting filament binding, and acting binding. The engagement of main inflammatory response and chemokine activity belonged to clusters 2, 5, and 6, of which cluster 2 was also involved in collagen binding and metallopeptidase activity. These results implied that SMCs play important roles in blood vessel homeostasis and function, partial collagen binding, and immune responses in skin tissue.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Heterogeneity of skin smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in different anatomical sites.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The t-SNE plot visualization of SMCs including clusters 0, 2, 5, 6, and 13.

This evidence, combined with GO function analysis and the expression levels of conventional marker genes, such as MYH11 and ACTA2 for SMCs, GUCY1A2, CCL19, FGF7, and ASPN for mesenchymal cells (MECs), and LPL, CCL2, IL6, and CXCL2 for macrophages (MACs), presumed that cluster 2 might be mesenchymal-like phenotype while clusters 5 and 6 might represent macrophage phenotype. To further validate the topography of SMCs phenotypes, the analysis of pseudotime trajectory was performed by Monocle algorithm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The trajectory demonstrated that SMCs experienced a dynamic transition from SMCs to mesenchymal-like phenotype and mesenchymal-like phenotype to macrophage-like phenotype. The sequential dynamics of gene expression with all branches were visualized and showed five gene sets along with expression patterns, which primarily deciphered three cell states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). These results discovered that gene sets 1 and 3 showed high expression levels of CTGF, LGR4, FABP4, CCL2, CCL19, and FGF7, and enriched GO terms associated with negative regulation of cell death, intestinal stem cell homeostasis, long-chain fatty acid transport, and immune response, which conformed well to the mesenchymal-like cells. Meanwhile, gene sets 2 and 5 showed high expression levels of MYH11, MYOM1, TPM1, TPM2, SQLE, BTG2, ADIRF, and TGFB3, and enriched GO terms involved in muscle contraction, actin filament organization, and ‘de novo’ action filament nucleation, which was greatly similar to contractile SMCs. In addition, gene set 4 showed high expression levels of CXCL10, CXCL2, ICAM1, LPL, and IL6, which were mainly gathered in GO terms of cellular response to lipopolysaccharide, cell chemotaxis, and defense response that may represent macrophage-like cells. Additionally, the expression levels of some cell type-specific marker genes in five SMCs clusters were presented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). The results showed the high expression levels of MECs-specific genes (GUCY1A2, FGF7, and CCL19) in cluster 2, MACs-specific LPL gene in clusters 5 and 6, and SMCs-specific MYH11 gene in clusters 0 and 13. These results proved our hypothesis that cluster 2 was mesenchymal-like phenotype while clusters 5 and 6 were macrophage-like phenotype.</p><p>The cell number of skin SMCs showed a significant difference in different anatomical sites, while the distribution ratio of SMC subpopulations displayed a similar trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). To decode the transcriptomic changes of skin SMCs in different anatomical sites, the DEGs were presented among 15 compared groups by pairwise comparison method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). GO analysis showed that the significant enriched terms for upregulated genes between compared groups primarily referred to extracellular region, collagen-containing ECM, and long-chain fatty acid transport, while these downregulated genes between compared groups took part in cytokine activity, CXCR chemokine receptor binding, and positive regulation of T cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The majority of upregulated genes subsisted in back skin compared to other locations, so we implemented KEGG analysis, which was involved in PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, immune response, and integration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Then, we chose some genes of related ECM-integrins and immune response to present their expression levels in different skin anatomical sites, which showed that immune response correlated closely with shoulder skin region or ECM-integrins tightly linked to skin locations on the head, back, and shoulder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Moreover, to gain insights into gene expression regulation, we investigated the key transcription factors (TFs), which regulated the DEGs among various compared groups, using single-cell regulatory network inference and clustering (SCENIC). The SCENIC algorithm demonstrated a series of main regulons such as EGR1, ATF3, NFKB1, PRDM1, and REL, and their related target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). TFs, especially ATF3 and EGR1, primarily regulated their target genes at back skin.

The pseudotime trajectory analysis of EC phenotypes showed an organized axis of blood ECs starting from arteriole and ending at venule, and it also formed an arteriovenous anastomosis tendency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Due to exhibiting diverse molecules and functions on EC phenotypes, we further explored the expression levels of these EC phenotype-related genes, which were involved in integrins (focal adhesion), immune (cell adhesion molecules, chemokine signaling pathway, antigen processing and presentation, leukocyte transendothelial migration, and Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation), and metabolism (inositol phosphate, mucin type o-glycan biosynthesis, ether lipid, sphingolipid, and glycerolipid). ECs-related metabolism in our dataset was considerably active in arteriole ECs, especially cluster 10 involving ACER3, which controlled the homeostasis of ceramides, and LCLAT1, a lysocardiolipin acyltransferase-regulating activation of mitophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). The focal adhesion genes were more significantly upregulated in arteriole ECs and lymphatic ECs compared to other phenotypes, including ACTG1, BIRC3, and THBS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In cell adhesion molecules, PTPRM and CDH5, mainly responsible for intercellular adhesion between ECs, were highly enriched in arteriole ECs; meanwhile, PECAM1, SELE, and SELP were enriched in venule ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Other immune pathways showed that different EC phenotypes significantly highly expressed diverse genes, such as CXCL14 (involved in monocyte and recruitment) in capillary ECs, CCL26, CXCL19, and CCL26 in venule ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The observed functional diversity of EC phenotypes proved the degree of ECs heterogeneity.</p><p>Here, we found that the cell number of EC phenotypes was different among different anatomical sites, with the back skin holding the most arteriole ECs and minimal lymphatic ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>). To further confirm the heterogeneity of EC phenotypes in the six different anatomical sites, we compared the expression levels of these gene-related integrins, immune, and metabolism pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). For example, for the metabolism pathway, compared to other sites, the activity of capillary ECs, venule ECs, and arteriole ECs (cluster 7 not including cluster 10) was depressed in shoulder skin, while high activity in capillary ECs, venule ECs, and arteriole ECs was shown in leg skin, including ACER3 and PIK3C2A, which enhanced cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gulluni et al., 2021</xref>), and high activity in lymphatic ECs, arteriole ECs (cluster 10 not including cluster 7), and venule ECs was presented in ear skin, including ACER3, GALNT10, and PIK3C2B, a member of class II PI3Ks controlling cellular proliferation, survival, and migration. The obtained abundant results on the gene expressions for EC phenotype-related pathways in different sites showed the heterogeneity of skin ECs for different anatomical sites.</p><p>To uncover the underlying molecular mechanisms driving the differential skin sites of ECs, we compared the DEGs with differentially compared groups among different anatomical sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) and GO terms were implemented for upregulated and downregulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Enriched terms, which were related to long-chain fatty acid transport, lipoprotein particle binding, and ECM, were shown in upregulated differential genes, while downregulated differential genes mainly existed in terms involving regulation of catalytic activity, acting binding, and molecular adaptor activity. Of note, the CD36, a multifunctional fatty acid transporter, was related to the metabolic state of fibroblasts for ECM regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we found that CD36 was upregulated in the back compared with others, except head, which was enriched in metabolic terms such as long-chain fatty acid transport and regulation of nitric oxide. FABP4, fatty acid-binding protein 4, was significantly differentially expressed in nine pairs compared groups. A pioneering study showed that FABP4 was strongly expressed in subcutaneous adipocytes and adipose ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). Combining data indicated that skin thickness might have a positive correlation with subcutaneous fat deposits. Additionally, we constructed single-cell transcription-factor regulatory networks with all DEGs of ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). The analysis predicted the following main transcriptional factors: ATF3, EGR1, ERG, FLI1, PRDM1, and NFKB1. The expression levels of ATF3, EGR1, and ERG were predominantly regulated in back and leg sites. With these findings, we presented the heterogeneity of skin ECs in different anatomical sites.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Heterogeneity of skin FBs in different anatomical sites</title><p>The dermal FBs synthesize the ECM that forms the connective tissue of skin dermis to maintain the skin morphology such as thickness and homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>).

In terms of overall skin section, the skin histomorphology of different anatomical sites exhibited some difference in sparsity of collagen fibers or the number of appendages, and dermal thickness descended from the back, head, shoulder, leg, abdomen, to the ear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Curiously, we inquired whether the discrepancy in ECM accumulation in different skin sites was caused by FBs heterogeneity. Next, the FBs single-cell maps were presented from six different skin anatomical sites using the t-SNE plot, which was established by four clusters (clusters 1, 8, 9, and 12) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), and the cell number of clusters was estimated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

Interestingly, these typical overlapping genes were tightly connected with ECM production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>).

Hierarchical clustering of four clusters for FBs was presented by the expression levels of these DEGs at six different skin anatomical sites. Hierarchical clustering of cluster 1 and 12 demonstrated that the gene expression patterns of FBs in thick sites (head, shoulder, and back) and thin sites (ear, abdomen, and leg) were partly defined by position with each structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Meanwhile, FBs-related gene expression patterns of clusters 7 and 8 in the upper half body sites (head, ear, and shoulder) and the lower half sites (back, abdomen, and leg) were partly defined by their anatomical position of origin. The site-sepecific genes were primarily involved in ECM synthesis, cell signaling guidance, metabolism, and human diseases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). For example, in terms of ECM synthesis, ear FBs included COL6A2 and COL6A5, abdomen FBs were involved in GREM1 and MMP3, and back FBs covered COL11A1, INHBA, and TNN. In cell signaling guidance, ear FBs included IGFBP2 and SEMA3C, abdomen FBs were involved in SERPINE1, head FBs covered ICAM1 and IGF2, and shoulder FBs referred to DKK2. In addition, The SCENIC algorithm demonstrated NF-kB1, TBX3, and ZNF366 regulons regulated some DEGs in FBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>).

The t-SEN analysis revealed the 18 cell clusters composed of six cell types, including SMCs (clusters 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 14), ECs (clusters 0, 3, 4, 12, and 15), FBs (clusters 7, 8, 11, and 13), T cells (TCs) (cluster 16), MDCs (cluster 17), and ESCs (cluster 18) between CH and LW pigs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), and the marker genes of each cluster are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>.

Understanding cell–cell communication in skin tissue requires accurate signaling crosstalk via ligands, receptors, and their cofactors, and effective overview analysis of these signaling links. To investigate the signaling crosstalk among seven identified cell types in skin tissue, we established intercellular communication by the R package CellChat. The seven cell types were deemed as communication ‘hub,’ which detected 547 ligand–receptor pairs and were further categorized into 36 signaling pathways, including the COLLAGEN, LAMININ, FN1, PDGF, CCL, CXCL, MIF, and ITGB2 pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Specifically, the COLLAGEN and LAMININ pathways exhibited highly abundant signaling interactions among seven cell types. Network centrality analysis of the COLLAGEN/LAMININ pathways revealed that FBs were the main source of the COLLAGEN/LAMININ ligands targeting SMCs and ESCs, which showed the COLLAGEN/LAMININ interactions were primarily paracrine way (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Outgoing FBs signaling was identified by pattern #2, which represented multiple pathways such as COLLAGEN, LAMININ, FN1, PTN, ANGPTL, and THBS. Outgoing SMCs and ESCs signaling was characterized by pattern #4, which was included in CDH, ANGPT, and PDGF pathways. Outgoing ECs signaling was characterized by pattern #1, which was involved in PECAM1, MK, and NOTCH pathways. The pattern #3 presented CD45, IL1, and VEGF pathways for outgoing MDC and TCs signaling. For the incoming communication patterns of target cells, incoming FBs signaling was characterized by pattern #3, representing NCAM, CADM, and MPZ pathways. The incoming SMCs, KEs, and ESCs signaling was characterized by pattern #4, and that of ECs was characterized by pattern #2.</p><p>Furthermore, the signaling pathways were grouped according to their similarity in function or structure. The functional similarity grouping was classified into four groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Group #1 and #4, which dominantly included COLLAGEN, LAMININ, and PTN pathways, largely showed signaling from FBs to SMCs and ESCs. Group #3 dominantly drove PECAM1, CXCL, and CCL pathways, which represented the acquisition signaling pathway of ECs. The structural similarity grouping also was identified in four groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>). To further elaborately explore the communication among FB, SMC, and EC subpopulations, we analyzed the COLLAGEN/LAMININ pathway in the 14 clusters from the three cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G and H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>).

Moreover, the SCENIC algorithm demonstrated NFKB1 as the common regulon among DEGs of three cell types, and the EGR1 and ATF3 regulons regulated the target genes in SMCs and ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>). These results manifested the intercellular communication of skin cells, especially three main cell types of SMCs, ECs, and FBs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>With the development of high-resolution single-cell sequencing, this is applied to delineate the atlas of diverse cell types and determine the molecular basis underlying the cell heterogeneity in many complicated biological processes associated with physiology and pathology among species, especially humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Han et al., 2020</xref>), mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kalucka et al., 2020</xref>), monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Han et al., 2022b</xref>), or pigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). The origin of tissue, its development state, or anatomical position are conducive to heterogeneity of cells. Using scRNA-seq, previous studies uncovered the heterogeneity of skin cells and their gene expression changes during embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ge et al., 2020</xref>), age stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zou et al., 2021</xref>), and wound-healing stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guerrero-Juarez et al., 2019</xref>) in humans or mice. However, the single-cell transcriptional diversity of different anatomical skin regions has not been understood. The CH pig, a novel Chinese indigenous breed with superior skin thickness, is considered as a potential model animal for researching mammalian skin biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zou et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zou et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Some studies have identified various cell types in the physiological skin tissue in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Solé-Boldo et al., 2020</xref>) and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guerrero-Juarez et al., 2019</xref>), and the top three main cell types were FBs, KEs, and ESCs for humans, and FBs, myeloid cells, and ECs for mice. In this study, we identified seven skin cell types from six different anatomical sites and six skin cell types from different two populations in adult pigs, and the top three main cell types were SMCs, ECs, and FBs. Compared with reported skin cell types of young pigs with the top three cell types being FBs, ESCs, and KEs, the distribution ratio of cell types was significantly different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Han et al., 2022a</xref>). Similarly, melanocytes, Schwann cells, mast cells, and neural cells were not identified in our datasets, while they were identified in human or mouse skin samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guerrero-Juarez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zou et al., 2021</xref>). By the way, SMCs and pericytes, called mural cells in vessels, were unable to precisely discriminate between the two cell types because of confusable hallmarks and functions in skin tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Muhl et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Han et al., 2022b</xref>), so we only identified SMCs in our data. The discrepancy in captured cell types and cell-type proportions might come from the heterogeneity of species, development process, skin state, and different scRNA-seq platform captures.</p><p>SMCs constitute blood vessels and APM in skin tissue, with a greater proportion in blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Driskell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Muhl et al., 2020</xref>). Here, five SMC subpopulations are verified and then separated into three SMC phenotypes in pig skin tissue. Sophisticated studies have shown SMC phenotypic switching under pathological processes or injured conditions, a way in which SMC shift between contractile phenotype and other type cell phenotypes such as mesenchymal-like, fibroblast-like, macrophage-like, adipocyte-like, and osteogenic-like (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yap et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yu et al., 2022</xref>). In addition, several studies found multiple SMC phenotypes, including Scal-positive vascular SMC-lineage, also existed in healthy vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dobnikar et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, we found that SMC phenotypic switching also occurred in pig skin tissue, varying from contractile SMCs to mesenchymal-like, mesenchymal-like to macrophage-like, with the expression levels of marker genes for cell types and function analysis. During physiological and pathological angiogenesis, macrophages are regarded as a facilitator of vascular integrity and derivatives by way of cytokine secretion and ECM remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barnett et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Debels et al., 2013</xref>), which implies SMCs are deemed immune system’s line of defense and positively participate in the immune response in skin tissue. Besides, in regard to different anatomical skin regions, we found that the cell number of the macrophage-like phenotype is highest at back site, followed by the abdomen, but immune-related genes primarily existed in shoulder, back, and ear, which indicates that the activity of the macrophage-like phenotype might depend on intrinsic factors as well as environmental factors.</p><p>Depending on the properties of diverse molecular and function, such as immune responses and metabolic process in ECs, ECs’ heterogeneous characteristics have been investigated in some organs of human skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2021</xref>), the mouse brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kalucka et al., 2020</xref>), and pig adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2022</xref>), of which ECs’ diversity remain largely unrevealed in skin tissue from different anatomical locations. In our cutaneous datasets, five subpopulations are identified with ECs and divide into four EC phenotypes, which are placed in order at the pseudotime trajectory indicating the distributed paths of blood vessel, such as arteriovenous anastomosis with vein. Here, an additional level of heterogeneity was explored when analyzing the expression levels of pathway genes involved in integrins, immune, and metabolism in EC subtypes from different anatomical regions. In integrins, ITGA6 is highly expressed in pig dermis ECs, in accordance with human dermis ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2021</xref>), and the expression of ITGA6 is significantly added in venule ECs and arteriole ECs (cluster 10 not cluster 7) of the pig ear skin site and in capillary ECs of humans. Cell adhesion molecules are compared to find capillary ECs and arteriole ECs (cluster 7 not cluster 10) of the pig back and shoulder skin mainly enriched MHC class II genes such as SLA-DQB1 and SLA-DRB1, which were highly expressed in lung organ of humans/mice, indicating a role in immune surveillance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goveia et al., 2020</xref>). A funny question regarding the high expression of MHC class II genes in terms of slight tissue rejection by blocking MHC class II on human endothelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrahimi et al., 2016</xref>) is whether there is a preference for skin graft from specific skin regions to transplant pig skin into humans.</p><p>SELE, SELP, and ICAM1 mainly mediate the communication between leukocyte and ECs and are highly expressed in venule ECs and arteriole ECs of head, ear, and back skin of pig, while the three genes are primarily existed in post-capillary venule ECs of human dermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2021</xref>). CDH5, an intercellular tight junction protein in ECs, is highly expressed in arteriole ECs of the ear skin of pig, in keeping with human dermal EC phenotype. Other immune response representative genes such as cytokines (CXCL14, CCL26, CCL24, CXCL12, and CXCL19) that participate in immunocyte recruitment (e.g., neutrophils) or are responsible for the host defense against viral infection, enhancing immune progression and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fajgenbaum and June, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu et al., 2020</xref>), of which are CCL24/CCL26, the role of eotaxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Provost et al., 2013</xref>), are enriched in venule ECs and majorly distributed in the head/abdomen skin regions, respectively. For the ECs metabolism pathway, most metabolic genes are significantly expressed in arteriole ECs and exhibited overlapping and were specific among different skin sites. Interestingly, ENPP2 of lipid metabolism gene was reported to enhance the cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grzes et al., 2021</xref>) and was overexpressed during chronic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Argaud et al., 2019</xref>), and it was enriched in the abdomen skin, while LPCAT2 of the other lipid metabolism gene under study was positively correlated with lipid droplet content in colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cotte et al., 2018</xref>), which was mainly highly expressed in back and shoulder skin. These findings demonstrated the extensive phenotypic plasticity and gene expression signatures of all kinds of pathways in different skin sites.</p><p>FBs are mesenchymal cells that synthesize ECM of connective tissues, which are responsible for structural integrity, wound repair, and fibrosis in skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Driskell and Watt, 2015</xref>). Providing plentiful proofs showed that FBs heterogeneity is involved in diverse subpopulations such as papillary FBs, reticular FBs, mesenchymal FBs, and pro-inflammatory FBs, and its functions in humans and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guerrero-Juarez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zou et al., 2021</xref>). In this study, we identified three subpopulations not including pro-inflammatory in different anatomical sites and populations, guessing the immune function of SMCs or ECs might replace pro-inflammation FBs due to the enormous cell number of SMCs or ECs. A previous study showed that FBs from distinct anatomical locations exhibited detectable differences in metabolic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Castor et al., 1962</xref>) and genome-wide gene expression changes in 43 skin sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rinn et al., 2006</xref>). The fact is that three FB subpopulations focused on ECM organization and collagen fibril organization, resulting in the discrepancy in ECM deposition in different anatomical skin sites and populations.</p><p>Therefore, the overlapping remarkable upregulate genes were found among multiple compared groups, especially the back when compared with other areas, and they might be regarded as key genes in ECM deposition. The ECM protein TNN is highly expressed in dense connective tissue such as cartilage, adult skeleton, and bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chiquet-Ehrismann and Tucker, 2011</xref>). TNN, distinctly located with collagen 3 fibers, plays a crucial role in periodontal remodeling; an example of a dense scar-like connective tissue enriched the nerve fibers replacing alveolar bone around the incisor by deficient TNN in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Imhof et al., 2020</xref>). Here, TNN took part in these pathways that were closely related to skin dermis such as ECM–receptor interaction and PIK-Akt signaling pathway and were significantly upregulated in multiple compared groups uniformly, surmising that TNN might be a key candidate gene for ECM deposition. Collagen I is the most abundant structural macromolecule in skin tissue, and collagen mechanism is determined by a minor component as a regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hansen and Bruckner, 2003</xref>). Collagens I and XI can package into composite fibrils by nucleation and propagation, in which the collagen XI content is closely connected with collagen I, determining its organization and function properties. Collagen XI is the main factor in collagen I-containing tissue, including tendons and cartilage, but not skin tissue, and the absence of COL11A1 expression results in the disruption of fibril phenotype for mature tendons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blaschke et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sun et al., 2020</xref>). INHBA plays an important role in the TGF-beta signaling pathway, stimulating the activity of SMAD2/3 and encouraging cell proliferation and ECM production. INHBA expression was significantly upregulated in keloid FBs compared to normal dermal FBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ham et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, overlapping genes, including TNN, COL11A1, SFRP1, and INHBA, were pronouncedly expressed in mesenchymal FBs. With the paradigm of human skin case presented, a series of genes were significantly increased in keloid mesenchymal FBs in contrast to normal scar, such as COL11A1, SFRP1, TNC, INHBA, FN1, IGF1, THBS4, and POSTN, suggesting that these genes might promote ECM production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deng et al., 2021</xref>). Likewise, these TNN, POSTN, COL11A1, IGF1, and INHBA genes were significantly upregulated in the back skin of CH pig compared with the back skin of LW pig. Although the mechanisms of physiological skin thickness, fibrosis, or scarring (pathological chronic inflammatory) are not all the same, excess ECM accumulation occurs, indicating individual and mutual genes. Therefore, in our study, we speculate that TNN, COL11A1, and INHBA expression might play a critical role in the morphology and quantity of collagen fibril-stimulated ECM deposition in skin tissue.</p><p>A previous study discovered that the Hox genes are a family of TF-encoding genes that are crucial for regulating embryonic development and tissue morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rinn et al., 2006</xref>). However, in our study, we did not identify any Hox gene among these differentially expressed genes in skin fibroblasts from both different anatomical sites and different pig populations. The differences of Hox code expression patterns might come from the heterogeneity of different species. Coincidently, some signaling pathways, which are related to regional- or populations-specific genes of fibroblasts, were identified in our study, which partially match what Rinn et al. published on human skin. For example, COL11A1 and MMP3 facilitate ECM accumulation, while DDK2 and GREM are involved in cell signaling guidance, etc. These findings provided important insights into the positional identity in skin tissue.</p><p>Skin physiological and pathological (wound healing or fibrosis) conditions not only determine the complex and diverse cellular composition but also establish the central signaling pathways between interacting cell groups, offering good insights into cellular crosstalk. For mouse skin wound tissue, network analysis was categorized into 25 signaling pathways involving in TGFβ, non-canonical WNT, TNF, SPP1, and CXCL and identified the inferred TGFβ signaling as the most prominent pathway between myeloid cells and FBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guerrero-Juarez et al., 2019</xref>). Twenty-two signaling pathways of embryonic mouse skin were identified, such as WNT, ncWNT, TGFβ, PDGF, NGF, FGF, and SEMA3, predicting the WNT signaling pathway played an important role between epidermal to dermal cells to form skin morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gupta et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, the major highly active pathways in diseased human skin included MIF, CXCL, GALECTIN, FGF, and CCL, which showed that MIF signaling pathway was the main pathway from inflammatory FBs to inflammatory TCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">He et al., 2020</xref>). In our datasets, 36 signaling pathways were shown to be involved in COLLAGEN, LAMININ, FN1, PDGF, CCL, CXCL, and MIF, of which the COLLAGEN and LAMININ signaling were the most enriched among different skin regions of pig. These results indicate the key signaling pathways depended on skin morphogenesis.</p><p>In summary, in our study, the heterogeneity of main cell types from both different anatomical skin sites and different pig populations was comprehensively detailed, giving clear evidence of the use of pig as an excellent skin model focused on generation, transmission, positional information, and transplant, paving the foundation for skin priming.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Skin samples dissociation and cell collection</title><p>Skin samples were obtained from three female 180-day-old CH pigs at six different anatomical body areas (head, ear, shoulder, back, abdomen, and leg) and three female 180-day-old LW pigs with one region (back).

The skin samples (size approximately 2 cm × 2 cm) were fully dissected into small pieces in 4 mL tube and then transferred into 50 mL centrifuge tube with 15 mL mix digestion medium containing 1 mg/mL collagenase type I, II, IV, and V (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis), 1 mg/mL elastase (Coolaber, Beijing, China), and 2 U/mL DNase I (Coolaber) in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMED). The skin samples were digested at 37°C for 120–180 min and simultaneously gently shaken once every 10 min. The digestion reaction was interrupted by DMEM including 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, New York). Then, the tissue suspension was filtered with 70 μm and 40 μm cell strainer and transfected into a 15 mL centrifuge tube to obtain cell sediment by centrifugation at 350 × <italic>g</italic> for 5 min at 4°C until there was no undissociated tissue debris. The cell sediment was added to 2 mL Red Blood Cells Lysis Solution (QIAGEN, Duesseldorf, Germany) at room temperature for 5 min to remove red blood cells. The cell sediment was added to 2 mL TrypLE (Gibco) at 37°C for 45 min to dissolve cell clot. The dissociated cells were washed twice and resuspended in cold DMED supplemented with 10% FBS. Finally, cells staining with 0.4% Trypan Blue Solution was used to estimate cell activity rate and concentration by Countess Cell Counting Chamber Slides.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Single-cell library construction and sequencing</title><p>Approximately 20,000 cells were captured in droplet emulsions, and the mRNA of single-cell libraries were constructed according to the DNBelab C Series Single-Cell Library Prep Set (MGI, Shenzhen, China) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Han et al., 2022a</xref>). In brief, single-cell suspensions were subjected to a series of progress, including droplet encapsulation, emulsion breakage, mRNA captured bead collection, reverse transcription, and cDNA amplification and purification, to generate barcoded libraries. Indexed sequencing libraries were established based on the instruction’s protocol. The quality supervision of libraries was implemented with a Qubit ssDNA Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham). Libraries were further sequenced by the DNBSEQ sequencing platform at the China National GeneBank.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Single-cell RNA sequencing data processing</title><p>The raw single-cell sequencing data were processed by DNBelab C Series scRNA analysis software. Reads were aligned to the reference genome (Ensemble assembly: Sus scrofa11.1) to generate a digital gene expression matrix by STAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). The quality control parameters involved in gene counts per cell, UMI count per cell, and % mitochondrial genes were stipulated. Cells genes were expressed in less than three cells, and cells were removed on the basis of detected genes number with a minimum of 200. Mitochondrial gene expression was set at a threshold of 5% per cell. For each library, the doublet was removed using DoubleFinder with the default parameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). Then, the aligned reads were filtered to obtain cell barcodes and UMI for gene-cell matrices, which were used for downstream analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Identification of cell clustering and cell type</title><p>After the initial DNBelab C Series scRNA analysis software processing, the cells were preprocessed and filtered. The data were normalized per sample using NormalizaData with default options, and highly variable genes were calculated by FindVariableFeatures and then elected based on their average expression and dispersion. The cell cluster was presented with the standard integration process of p-value&lt;0.01 through the ‘FindClusters’ function described in Seurat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). The cell types in each cell cluster were identified with enriched expression using ‘FindAllMarkers’ function in SCSA with default parameters, together with canonical cell-type markers from extensive reported literature on pig and human skin. Genes with |log2FC| &gt; 0.25 and adjusted p-value &lt;0.05 were considered marker genes.
