In amputated zebrafish fins, mature osteoblasts dedifferentiate, migrate towards the injury, and form proliferative osteogenic blastema cells. We show that osteoblast migration is preceded by cell elongation and alignment along the proximodistal axis, which require actomyosin, but not microtubule (MT) turnover. Surprisingly, osteoblast dedifferentiation and migration can be uncoupled. Using pharmacological and genetic interventions, we found that NF-ĸB and retinoic acid signalling regulate dedifferentiation without affecting migration, while the complement system and actomyosin dynamics affect migration but not dedifferentiation. Furthermore, by removing bone at two locations within a fin ray, we established an injury model containing two injury sites. We found that osteoblasts dedifferentiate at and migrate towards both sites, while accumulation of osteogenic progenitor cells and regenerative bone formation only occur at the distal-facing injury. Together, these data indicate that osteoblast dedifferentiation and migration represent generic injury responses that are differentially regulated and can occur independently of each other and of regenerative growth. We conclude that successful fin bone regeneration appears to involve the coordinated execution of generic and regeneration-specific responses of osteoblasts to injury.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>bone regeneration</kwd><kwd>complement system</kwd><kwd>osteoblast</kwd><kwd>dedifferentiation</kwd><kwd>cell migration</kwd><kwd>actomyosin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Project-ID 251293561 - SFB 1149</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weidinger</surname><given-names>Gilbert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>project ID 316249678 - SFB 1279</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weidinger</surname><given-names>Gilbert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>project ID 450627322 - SFB 1506</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weidinger</surname><given-names>Gilbert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Medical Faculty, Ulm University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Hertha-Nathorff-Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sehring</surname><given-names>Ivonne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Osteoblast dedifferentiation and migration are injury responses that are differentially regulated and independent of regenerative bone formation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>For humans and other mammals, the traumatic loss of a limb represents an irreversible and permanent defect, as lost appendages cannot be restored. In contrast, teleost fish and urodele amphibians are able to fully regenerate limbs/fins. Thus, the zebrafish caudal fin has become a popular model to study the restoration of bone tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gemberling et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pfefferli and Jaźwińska, 2015</xref>). The fin skeleton consists of dermal (directly ossifying) skeletal elements, the fin rays or lepidotrichia, which make up the largest part of the fin, and endochondral parts close to the body. Rays are segmented with flexible joints, and each segment consists of two concave hemirays which are lined by a single layer of osteoblasts on the inner and outer surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Within 1 day after fin amputation, a wound epidermis covers the injured tissue. Next, a blastema forms atop of each ray, which contains the proliferative source cells for regeneration of the ray skeleton. Within hours after amputation, osteoblasts close to the amputation plane dedifferentiate, that is, they downregulate the expression of the mature osteoblast marker <italic>bglap,</italic> upregulate preosteoblast markers like <italic>runx2,</italic> and become proliferative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Knopf et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sousa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stewart and Stankunas, 2012</xref>). Furthermore, osteoblasts relocate towards the amputation plane and beyond to contribute to the blastema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Knopf et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Geurtzen et al., 2014</xref>). In the regenerate, these dedifferentiated osteoblasts remain lineage-restricted and redifferentiate to osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Knopf et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stewart and Stankunas, 2012</xref>). While both osteoblast dedifferentiation and migration occur in response to fin amputation and bone fractures in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Knopf et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Geurtzen et al., 2014</xref>), the interrelation of these processes is not understood; specifically, whether dedifferentiation is a requirement for migration is not known.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Osteoblasts dedifferentiate and migrate in response to fin amputation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic presentation of one fin ray with mature osteoblasts expressing <italic>bglap</italic> and <italic>entpd5</italic> lining the hemirays.

Bone tissue is permanently turned over by bone remodelling, a process of alternating bone resorption and bone formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kular et al., 2012</xref>). For bone formation, osteoblast precursors migrate to the resorbed sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dirckx et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, during mammalian fracture healing, osteoblasts are recruited to the site of injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Thiel et al., 2018</xref>). Several factors have been shown to act as chemoattractants for osteoblasts in vitro, but few have been confirmed to play a role in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dirckx et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Thiel et al., 2018</xref>). One candidate osteoblast guidance cue is the complement system, which represents the major fluid phase part of innate immunity and is activated immediately after injury. It consists of more than 50 proteins, including serial proteases, whose activation leads to the formation of the peptides C3a and C5a, generated from the precursors C3 and C5, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thorgersen et al., 2019</xref>). While the majority of C3 and C5 precursors are expressed in the liver and distributed to the periphery via the circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Merle et al., 2015</xref>), C3 and C5 mRNA are also expressed by human osteoblasts, which in addition can cleave native C5 into C5a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ignatius et al., 2011b</xref>). During bone fracture healing in mammals, the receptor for C5a (C5aR) is expressed by osteoblasts, and C5a can act as chemoattractant for osteoblasts in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ignatius et al., 2011b</xref>). In C5-deficient mice, bone repair after fracture is severely impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ehrnthaller et al., 2013</xref>); however, whether this is due to defects in osteoblast migration is not yet known.</p><p>In this study, we analysed injury-induced osteoblast migration in vivo in the regenerating zebrafish fin. We show that osteoblast cell shape changes and migration depend on a dynamic actomyosin cytoskeleton, but not on microtubuli turnover. Pharmacological interference with C3a and C5a suggests that the complement system regulates osteoblast migration in vivo. Using genetic and pharmacological manipulation of NF-κB, retinoic acid (RA), and complement signalling, we found that dedifferentiation and migration can be uncoupled and are independently regulated, suggesting that dedifferentiation is not a prerequisite for migration. Furthermore, we established a novel injury model in which an internal bone defect within fin rays allows us to study osteoblast behaviours at proximally and distally facing injuries. Intriguingly, osteoblast migration and dedifferentiation occur at both injury sites, yet only at the distal injury a preosteoblast population forms and only here regenerative growth commences. We conclude that osteoblast migration and dedifferentiation represent generic injury responses in zebrafish, and that successful bone regeneration depends on additional, regeneration-specific events.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Osteoblasts elongate, align along the proximodistal axis, and migrate towards the amputation plane</title><p>In non-injured caudal fins, differentiated osteoblasts expressing the markers <italic>bglap</italic> and <italic>entpd5</italic> line the two segmented hemirays that together form the fin rays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We use the following terminology to describe the subsequent experiments: segment 0 is the fin ray segment through which we amputate (at 50% of its length), and segments −1, –2, and –3 are located further proximally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Note that only segment 0 is mechanically affected by the amputation injury. We have previously shown that osteoblasts dedifferentiate in response to fin amputation, that is they revert from a mature, non-proliferative state into an undifferentiated progenitor-like state, which includes loss of <italic>bglap</italic> expression and upregulation of the preosteoblast marker <italic>runx2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Knopf et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Geurtzen et al., 2014</xref>). Using RNAscope in situ hybridisation, we can now show that downregulation of <italic>bglap</italic> occurs in a graded manner and that <italic>entpd5</italic> expression is similarly downregulated during dedifferentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). At 1 day postamputation (1 dpa), expression of <italic>entpd5</italic> and <italic>bglap</italic> remains high in segment –2, but gradually decreases towards the amputation plane and is almost entirely absent from segment 0, with <italic>entpd5</italic> downregulation being more pronounced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). While RNA expression of these genes is downregulated within hours after injury, GFP or Kaede fluorescent proteins (FPs) expressed in <italic>bglap</italic> or <italic>entpd5</italic> reporter transgenic lines persist for up to 3 days, even though transgene transcription is shut down rapidly as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Knopf et al., 2011</xref>). We can confirm these earlier findings using the more sensitive RNAscope in situs. In <italic>bglap</italic>:GFP transgenics at 2 dpa, <italic>gfp</italic> RNA and GFP protein colocalised to the same cells in segment –2, where osteoblasts do not dedifferentiate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In contrast, in the distal segment –1 GFP protein was present, but barely any <italic>gfp</italic> transcript could be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Thus, persistence of GFP in <italic>bglap</italic>:GFP transgenics can be used for short-term tracing of dedifferentiated osteoblasts in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). At 1 dpa, <italic>bglap</italic>:GFP+ cells upregulated expression of the preosteoblast marker <italic>runx2a</italic> and of <italic>cyp26b1</italic>, an enzyme involved in RA signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blum and Begemann, 2015</xref>), which regulates dedifferentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Both markers were exclusively upregulated in segment –1 and segment 0 at 1 dpa, but were absent in segment –2. Together, these data show that osteoblasts in segment –1 and segment 0 lose expression of mature markers and gain expression of dedifferentiation markers.</p><p>We have previously provided evidence that osteoblasts close to the amputation plane do not only dedifferentiate, but also relocate towards the injury site after fin amputation. To trace osteoblasts, we used the transgenic line <italic>entpd5</italic>:kaede (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Geurtzen et al., 2014</xref>), in which Kaede fluorescence can be converted from green to red by UV light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ando et al., 2002</xref>). We photoconverted osteoblasts in the proximal half of segment –1, while osteoblasts in the distal half remained green (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). At 1 dpa, red osteoblasts were found in the distal half (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), showing that photoconverted osteoblasts had relocated distally. To quantify osteoblast relocation, we used the <italic>bglap</italic>:GFP transgenic line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Knopf et al., 2011</xref>). In adult non-injured fin rays, <italic>bglap</italic>:GFP is expressed in a subset of mature osteoblasts in the centre of every ray segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). The restriction of <italic>bglap</italic>:GFP+ cells to the segment centre results in a zone devoid of <italic>bglap</italic>:GFP+ cells at both ends of a segment, and its invasion by GFP+ cells can be used as a read-out for bulk migration of osteoblasts after fin injury. Within 1 dpa, the distance between the GFP+ cells and the distal joint was reduced in segment –1, while at the proximal joint, the distance increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>). Therefore, osteoblasts did not spread out across the segment, but were relocated directionally towards the amputation plane. We also analysed if osteoblasts in more proximal segments (further away from the amputation plane) move distally and quantified their relocation. 100% relocation indicates that the distal front of the GFP+ bulk of cells has reached the respective distal joint. At 1 dpa, osteoblasts in segment –1 relocated distally, while no movement could be detected in segments –3 and –2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). In summary, osteoblasts respond to fin amputation by dedifferentiation (detected by downregulation of transcription of differentiation markers, as well as upregulation of preosteoblast markers) and by movement towards the amputation plane, as detected by relocation of GFP+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Dedifferentiation and migration occur in a region encompassing about 350 µm proximal to the amputation plane, comprising the amputated segment 0 and the adjacent segment –1.</p><p>To observe osteoblast behaviour at single cell resolution in live fish after fin amputation, we generated double transgenic fish expressing <italic>bglap</italic>:GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Knopf et al., 2011</xref>) and <italic>entpd5</italic>:kaede in mature osteoblasts. Expression of two fluorescent proteins increased signal for repeated imaging, and partial photoconversion of kaedeGreen into kaedeRed resulted in a different colouring for each osteoblast, which facilitated tracking of morphology changes at single cell resolution. Live imaging revealed the formation of long protrusions, lasting for at least 2 hr and extending towards the amputation site, and the directed movement of cell bodies relative to their surroundings (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We conclude that osteoblasts relocate by active migration.

We found that <italic>bglap</italic>:GFP+ osteoblasts changed their shape after amputation. In a mature, non-injured segment, osteoblasts were roundish, and they retained this morphology after amputation in segment –3 and segment –2 at 1 dpa, as determined by a width/length ratio of ~0.4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In contrast, at 1 dpa osteoblasts in segment –1 displayed an elongated shape (width/length ratio ~0.2) and they presented long extensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). The elongation of osteoblasts occurred in alignment with the proximodistal axis of the fin, as evident by an angle reduction between this axis and the long axis of the osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Orientation of osteoblasts along the proximodistal axis could first be detected at 12 hr postamputation (hpa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), while elongation was first observed at 15 hpa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

This suggests that <italic>bglap</italic>:GFP+ osteoblasts from older segments do not migrate into less mature segments during formation of new segments in the course of fin growth. Rather, the mature osteoblast population in a segment arises via differentiation of osteoblasts at the position within the segment at which they were formed during segment addition.

Thus, migration of mature osteoblasts observed after fin amputation or bone fracture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Geurtzen et al., 2014</xref>) appears to represent a specific early response to injury, while addition of new bony segments at the distal tip of growing fins during ontogeny or regeneration does not involve migration of differentiated osteoblasts.</p><p>Since we found that differentiation markers are gradually downregulated towards the amputation plane at 1 dpa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>), we wondered whether a similar gradient can be observed for cell morphology changes.

Yet, no morphological differences in osteoblasts of proximal and distal regions of segment –1 were detected at 15 hpa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). We conclude that dedifferentiation and cell shape changes are responses of osteoblasts to injury that occur in the same cells, yet the magnitude of these responses can vary.

The zebrafish genome contains homologues of all fundamental mammalian complement components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boshra et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang and Cui, 2014</xref>), including the central components <italic>c3</italic> and <italic>c5</italic> and the corresponding receptors <italic>c3aR</italic> and <italic>c5aR1</italic>, respectively. A second <italic>c5a</italic> receptor, <italic>c5aR2</italic>, has so far only been characterised in mammals, and sequence database interrogation indicates that it is absent in zebrafish. RNAscope in situ analysis revealed that <italic>c5aR1</italic> is expressed in mature osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), as well as in other cells of the fin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Similarly, quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) on GFP+ and GFP− cells sorted from 1 dpa <italic>bglap</italic>:GFP fins revealed that <italic>c5aR1</italic> is expressed in both fractions, and thus in osteoblasts and other cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Likewise, expression of <italic>c3aR1</italic> could be detected in both fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). As measured by qRT-PCR, transcription of the complement factor precursor <italic>c5</italic> and the six <italic>c3a</italic> precursor paralogues could readily be detected in the liver, but was minimal in non-injured fins (10<sup>3</sup>–10<sup>6</sup>-fold less than in the liver, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Yet, we could observe an upregulation of <italic>c5</italic> and <italic>c3a.5</italic> expression in the fin at 6 hpa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Thus, while the majority of complement components that are available for injury-induced activation in the fin are probably produced in the liver and delivered to the fin by the circulation, injury-induced local expression in the fin might contribute to activation of the system as well.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Complement system signalling regulates osteoblast cell shape changes and migration in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) RNAscope in situ detection of <italic>c5aR1</italic> expression in <italic>bglap</italic> expressing osteoblasts in a non-injured fin segment.

This supports the view that osteoblast dedifferentiation and migration are independent responses of osteoblasts to injury.

We conclude that the complement system specifically regulates injury-induced osteoblast migration, but not osteoblast dedifferentiation or proliferation in zebrafish.</p><p>Activation of the complement system is a general early response after injury that also occurs in wounds that heal, but do not trigger structural regeneration of the kind we observe after fin amputation. Thus, we wondered whether osteoblast migration can be triggered by injuries that do not induce structural regeneration. Lesions of the interray skin quickly heal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chablais and Jazwinska, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2015</xref>) but do not trigger bone regeneration. Yet, such wounds can induce signals that are sufficient to trigger structural regeneration in a missing tissue context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Owlarn et al., 2017</xref>). We found that skin injuries induced close to the ray bone did not induce osteoblast migration, neither off the bone into the intraray nor on the bone towards the joints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Osteoblasts also migrate towards fractures induced in the fin ray bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Geurtzen et al., 2014</xref>). Interray injury combined with bone fracture resulted in osteoblast migration towards the fracture, but osteoblasts did not migrate away from the bone matrix into the interray skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4B</xref>). We conclude that generic wounding-induced signals are not sufficient to attract osteoblasts in the absence of additional prerequisites, which might include the presence of a permissive substrate for migration.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>An internal bone defect model separates generic from regeneration-specific osteoblast injury responses</title><p>In response to fin amputation, all osteoblast injury responses occur directed towards the amputation plane, that is, dedifferentiation is more pronounced distally, osteoblasts migrate distalwards, and the proliferative preosteoblast population forms distally of the amputation plane. We wondered how osteoblasts respond to injuries that occur proximal to their location. To test this, we established a fin ray injury model featuring internal bone defects. We removed hemiray segments at two locations within one ray, leaving a centre segment with two injury sites, one facing proximally, the other distally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). It was recently shown that in a similar cavity injury model a blastema forms only at the distal-facing injury, while the proximally facing site displays no regenerative growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cao et al., 2021</xref>). In our hemiray removal model, both injury sites are equally severed from the stump, and thus cut off from innervation and blood supply. Therefore, any potential differences in the injury responses at the proximal vs distal injury site cannot be explained by differences in innervation or blood circulation. Within 2 days post injury (dpi), blood flow through the centre segment was restored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). At 3 dpi, Runx2+ preosteoblasts and Osterix+ committed osteoblasts accumulated almost exclusively in the defect beyond the distal injury, but not at the proximal injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B - D</xref>). Subsequently, new bone matrix formed exclusively at the distal site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).New bone matrix also formed at the distal side of the bone located proximal to the proximal bone defect (arrowhead in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and data not shown), but not at the proximal injury site of the centre segment. Thus, our hemiray removal injury model reveals that accumulation of a preosteoblast population, and regeneration of bone occurs only at distal-facing wounds.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>A hemiray removal injury model distinguishes generic vs regeneration-specific osteoblast injury responses.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Hemiray removal scheme creating a proximal and distal facing injury on both sides of a central intact segment.

Thus, we asked whether any of these osteoblast injury responses occur at proximal-facing injuries in the hemiray injury model, which fail to form a blastema containing preosteoblasts. At 2 and 3 dpi, proliferation of osteoblasts was observed throughout the centre segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). While at 2 dpi, the median of the distribution of proliferating osteoblasts along the proximodistal axis was slightly shifted distally compared to a random distribution set, at 3 dpi proliferation was equally distributed along the segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Thus, the polarised regenerative response is not reflected by equally polarised osteoblast proliferation within the centre segment.</p><p>We next wondered whether distally-oriented bone regeneration is due to varying degrees of osteoblast dedifferentiation along the segment. We analysed the expression of <italic>bglap</italic> with single cell resolution in a proximal, central, and distal region of the centre segment at 1 dpi. Within such a distance (~300 µm), a gradual change in <italic>bglap</italic> intensity can be observed after fin amputation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and in the segments distally of the distal bone defect in the hemiray injury model (bracket in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>, right panel). Yet, we could not detect differences in the extent of <italic>bglap</italic> expression between the regions of the centre segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>, left panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>), indicating that the proximal and distal injury sites induced osteoblast dedifferentiation. Similarly, <italic>cyp26b1</italic> was upregulated along the entire segment, with no enrichment at the distal injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Together, these data show that osteoblast dedifferentiation occurs to a similar extent in the bone facing the proximal and distal injury.</p><p>Intriguingly, osteoblasts in the centre segment also migrated towards both amputation planes, ultimately spreading across the entire segment (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). The magnitude of migration was similar towards both wound sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). This suggests that at this early time point, there is no hierarchy between the injury sites, and that osteoblasts react to an initial wound signal, which is independent of the proximodistal position of the injury. Furthermore, as osteoblasts also migrate towards the proximal site where no blastema will form, it appears that osteoblasts migrate independently of whether this will be followed by bone regeneration. To further test this, we temporally separated the creation of the two bone defects flanking the centre segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K and L</xref>). We first extracted only one hemiray (segment A) and analysed osteoblasts of the adjacent distal segment (segment B). Within 1 day, the distance between osteoblasts and the distal segment border increased, while proximally it decreased, revealing a directed migration of the osteoblasts towards the proximally facing injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>). We then removed the hemiray of segment C (the one located distally to the centre segment B) and analysed osteoblast locations in segment B 1 day later. The distance between osteoblasts and the proximal segment border further decreased, indicating that the osteoblasts continued to migrate towards the proximal injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>). However, at the distal side, the previously increased distance was decreased, suggesting that osteoblasts reversed their direction and migrated towards the distal injury as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>). This phenomenon is independent of the order of hemiray removal: when the distal adjacent hemiray (segment C) was removed first, osteoblasts migrated distally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L</xref>). When we then removed the proximal adjacent hemiray (segment A), the distal osteoblasts continued to migrate distally, while the proximally located osteoblast migrated towards the new injury site, even though at this site no blastema will form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L</xref>). These data strongly suggest that all bone injuries release signals that attract osteoblasts and that osteoblasts are equally likely to migrate proximally and distally. Thus, the lack of regenerative growth and bone formation at proximally-facing injuries cannot be explained by an intrinsic polarity or bias in the migration of osteoblasts on the bone matrix along the proximodistal axis of the fin.</p><p>At 2 dpi, at the distal-facing injury site, <italic>bglap</italic>:GFP+ osteoblasts of the centre segment accumulated beyond the bone matrix in the defect, where a blastema appears to form (asterisk in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). However, no osteoblasts could be observed in the defect at the proximal side of the centre segment at 3 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). Thus, while osteoblasts migrate along the bone matrix towards both injury sites, they exclusively migrate off the centre segment and into the defect at the distal-facing injury. In a cavity injury model, Cao et al. have shown that inhibition of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin can induce blastema formation at proximal-facing injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cao et al., 2021</xref>). To analyse if such an intervention can also trigger osteoblast migration beyond the bone matrix at the proximal injury site, we treated fish with the calcineurin inhibitor FK506. Indeed, we could observe recruitment of <italic>bglap</italic>:GFP+ cells into the defect at the proximal site in FK506 treated fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6M</xref>). Surprisingly, however, migration beyond the distal amputation site was also enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6M</xref>). Therefore, to test whether calcineurin inhibition specifically enabled migration of osteoblasts into proximally-facing bone defects or whether it generally facilitated migration in all directions, we analysed osteoblast migration after regular fin amputation. FK506 treatment enhanced osteoblast migration at 1 dpa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>), indicating that calcineurin might generally negatively regulate osteoblast migration and suggesting that it does not specifically facilitate distally directed regenerative responses.</p><p>The lack of osteoblast accumulation at proximally-facing injuries could be due to absence of chemical or mechanical cues that allow them to migrate into the defect. Alternatively, migration could be actively inhibited or osteoblasts could be eliminated at proximal injuries. One possibility would be increased osteoblast apoptosis at proximally-facing injuries. However, we could not detect any apoptotic osteoblasts at all in the first 2 days after injury (data not shown), and also at 3 dpi the number of apoptotic osteoblasts was negligible at both the proximal and distal injury sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Another possibility would be that osteoclasts interfere with osteoblast differentiation and bone formation at the proximal injury. To analyse if more osteoclasts are recruited to the proximal injury in the hemiray removal model, we analysed the distribution of <italic>cathepsinK</italic>:YFP+ cells, a marker for osteoclasts, after hemiray removal. However, osteoclasts accumulated at both wound sites by 3 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><p>Bone is thicker at the proximal base of the fin than at its distal end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mari-Beffa and Murciano, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pfefferli and Jaźwińska, 2015</xref>). We thus wondered whether this structural heterogeneity along the fin ray could determine the different regenerative outcomes at proximal vs distal injuries. Yet, we did not observe a measurable difference in the diameter, radius, and thickness of one hemiray segment at its proximal vs distal end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>). This suggests that structural heterogeneities of the bone along the proximodistal axis are too small at the scale of the centre segment to explain the radically different regenerative outcome at the proximal vs distal injury in the hemiray removal model.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Generic and regeneration-specific responses of osteoblasts to injury</title><p>In this study, we interrogate the inter-relatedness of several in vivo responses of osteoblasts to injury using the zebrafish fin model. After fin amputation, osteoblasts elongate and orient along the proximodistal axis of the fin and migrate distally towards the amputation plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, upper panel). In addition, osteoblasts dedifferentiate, that is, they downregulate expression of differentiation markers like <italic>bglap</italic> and <italic>entpd5</italic> and initiate expression of the preosteoblast marker <italic>runx2a</italic>. Finally, they proliferate and migrate off the bone surface to found a population of osteogenic progenitors within the regeneration blastema that drives bone regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, upper panel). Surprisingly, we find that these injury responses appear to occur largely independently of each other. In particular, osteoblast dedifferentiation does not seem to be a prerequisite for osteoblast cell shape changes and migration. These conclusions are based on two lines of evidence: first, we identified molecular interventions that can interfere with one process without affecting the others: RA and NF-κB signalling pathways regulate only osteoblast dedifferentiation, but not cell shape changes and migration, while the complement and actomyosin systems are required for osteoblast cell shape changes and migration, but not for dedifferentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, upper panel). Second, using a hemiray injury model, where a proximally- and distally-facing bone injury is introduced in the same fin ray, we find that dedifferentiation, migration, and regenerative bone growth do not occur at both injuries. Osteoblasts migrate towards both sites and dedifferentiate equally in the proximity of both injuries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, lower panel). Stunningly, however, osteoblast migration beyond the bone into the injury defect, formation of a blastema containing a preosteoblast population, and regenerative bone growth only occur at the distally-facing injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, lower panel). Thus, osteoblast migration and dedifferentiation represent generic injury responses that can occur independently of a regenerative response.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model for osteoblast responses to fin amputation (upper panel) and hemiray removal (lower panel).</title><p>Osteoblast dedifferentiation and migration represent generic injury responses that are differentially regulated and can occur independently of each other and of regenerative bone growth. Upper panel: After fin amputation, osteoblasts downregulate the expression of differentiation markers. The extent depends on their distance to the amputation site, with osteoblasts close to the amputation site displaying more pronounced dedifferentiation. In addition, osteoblasts elongate and migrate towards the amputation plane and beyond to found osteogenic cells in the blastema (pink). Thus, osteoblast dedifferentiation, migration, and bone regeneration are all distally oriented. Osteoblast dedifferentiation is negatively regulated by NF-κB and retinoic acid signalling, while actomyosin dynamics and the complement system are required for directed osteoblast migration. Lower panel: In the hemiray removal model, a proximal and a distal injury are created on both sides of a remaining centre segment. The extent of osteoblast dedifferentiation is even along the centre segment, and osteoblasts migrate towards both injury sites. Yet, only at the distally-facing site, osteoblasts migrate into the bone defect, and blastema formation and bone regeneration only occur here.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-77614-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>The fact that dedifferentiation and migration do not always result in bone regeneration raises questions about their function. We have previously shown that experimentally enhanced dedifferentiation results in an increased population of progenitor cells in the regenerate, which, however, had detrimental effects on bone maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mishra et al., 2020</xref>), indicating that dedifferentiation must be kept within certain limits. Unfortunately, currently existing tools to block dedifferentiation are either mosaic (activation of NF- κB signalling using the Cre-lox system) or cannot be targeted to osteoblasts alone (treatment with RA). Due to these limitations in our assays, we can currently not test what consequences specific, unmitigated perturbation of osteoblast dedifferentiation has for overall fin/bone regeneration. Conversely, the interventions presented here that specifically perturb osteoblast migration are limited as they act only transiently, that is, they can severely delay, but not fully block migration. Furthermore, while interference with actomyosin dynamics reduces regenerative growth, we cannot distinguish whether this is caused by the inhibition of osteoblast migration or due to other more direct effects on cell proliferation and tissue growth. Thus, an unequivocal test of the importance of osteoblast migration for bone regeneration requires different tools. However, it has been shown that fin bone can regenerate even after genetic ablation of osteoblasts, due to activation of non-osteoblastic cells which can drive de novo osteoblast differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Singh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ando et al., 2017</xref>). We speculate that the robustness of bone regeneration in zebrafish is enhanced by redundant mechanisms of source cell formation, which can either derive from pre-existing osteoblasts, which dedifferentiate and migrate towards the injury, or from (reserve) stem/progenitor cells. Dedifferentiation and migration in response to injuries that eventually do not trigger bone regeneration likely add to the robustness, since they prime all injuries for regeneration. Interestingly, work in planaria and zebrafish fins has previously shown that all wounds, irrespective of whether they trigger structural regeneration or result merely in wound healing, appear to activate a generic signalling response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wurtzel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Owlarn et al., 2017</xref>). The differential outcome (structural regeneration vs wound healing) is rather determined further downstream and might dependent on systems that measure how much anatomy is missing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Owlarn et al., 2017</xref>). In the present work, we show that this principle also applies to injury responses that occur within osteoblasts. It appears that generic wounding-induced signals trigger the generic responses of osteoblast dedifferentiation and migration, while the decision whether these will be followed by bone regeneration is controlled by other determinants further downstream. Currently, the molecular nature of determinants that can sense the amount of missing anatomy and determine the difference between proximally and distally facing injuries remains rather mysterious.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The complement system regulates osteoblast migration in vivo</title><p>More than 20 different factors have been found to elicit a migratory response of osteoblasts in in vitro gain-of-function assays, including the activated complement peptides C5a and C3a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dirckx et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Thiel et al., 2018</xref>). However, confirmation of the role of many of these factors in regulating osteoblast migration in in vivo models is still sparse, largely due to the difficulty in assaying osteoblast migration independently of other phenotypes, for example, osteoblast proliferation or differentiation, in rodents in vivo. Using live zebrafish and time lapse imaging, we show that the complement system regulates osteoblast migration in vivo. Thus, the bone fracture repair defects observed in C5-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ehrnthaller et al., 2013</xref>) might be due to impaired recruitment of osteoblasts to the injury. The <italic>c3ar1</italic> and <italic>c5aR1</italic> receptors are expressed in mature fin osteoblasts, making it likely that the complement cascade directly regulates osteoblast migration. Interestingly, our data indicate that in zebrafish, both C3a and C5a act as guidance cues for osteoblasts, ensuring the recruitment of osteoblasts to the injury plane.</p><p>There is growing evidence that complement factors can modulate highly diverse processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and regeneration in various tissues. Both C3 and C5 were shown to play a role during liver regeneration in mammals, as C5<sup>−/−</sup>, C3<sup>−/−</sup> as well as C3R<sup>−/−</sup> deficient mice show impaired liver regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mastellos et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Markiewski et al., 2004</xref>). Expression of <italic>c5aR1</italic> is upregulated in regenerating hearts of zebrafish, axolotls, and neonatal mice, and receptor inhibition impairs cardiomyocyte proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Natarajan et al., 2018</xref>). Noteworthy, in our study on zebrafish fin regeneration, inhibition of C5aR1 had no effect on osteoblast proliferation and regenerative growth. The distinct outcome of complement activation might be dependent on the location of complement factors. Intracellular C3 and C5 storage has been proposed in T cells, and the respective cleavage products C3a and C5a bind to intracellular receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liszewski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arbore et al., 2016</xref>). In human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, intracellular C3a regulates cell survival, while activation of membrane-bound C3aR modulates induction of the immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liszewski et al., 2013</xref>). In addition to the receptors, both C3 and C5 are expressed in mammalian osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ignatius et al., 2011b</xref>). While we lack the tools to determine the spatiotemporal distribution of the C3 and C5 precursor proteins and their activated cleavage products C3a and C5a, our expression data indicates that the majority of the precursors are produced in the liver and are distributed via the circulation. Interestingly, however, local, injury-induced transcription of <italic>c5</italic> and the <italic>c3</italic> paralog <italic>c3a.5</italic> might contribute to activation of the cascade in response to fin injury as well. Intriguingly, during newt and urodele limb regeneration, C3 is expressed in blastema cells, which implies a role in mediating regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Del Rio-Tsonis et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kimura et al., 2003</xref>). However, as during zebrafish fin regeneration osteoblasts migrate before blastema formation, a different cellular source likely produces C3 and C5. Yet, we cannot exclude that complement peptides emanating from the blastema are responsible for the migration of osteoblasts beyond the bone context at later stages, which we only observed at sites where a blastema forms. Prior to blastema formation, the injury site is covered by a wound epidermis. During newt limb regeneration, C5 was shown to be absent from the blastema but highly expressed in the wound epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kimura et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, complement activation in epidermal cells might regulate the early migration of osteoblasts to the injury.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Determinants of regeneration-specific osteoblast injury responses</title><p>Removing part of the bone within a ray results in polarised bone regeneration that is exclusively directed towards the distal end of the fin. In a recently published zebrafish fin cavity injury model, blastema markers were shown to be solely upregulated at the distal facing injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cao et al., 2021</xref>). In our hemiray-removal model, we analyse the proximal and distal injury of a centre segment. Thus, both injury sites are equally severed from innervation and blood supply, giving us confidence that the differential regenerative response at proximal and distal injuries is not due to differences in circulation or innervation. The distally oriented polarised regenerative response implies intrinsic mechanisms regulating diverse outcome from seemingly equal injuries (the removal of the adjacent hemiray). Our findings show that such regulators of distally- oriented regeneration seem to act downstream to or independently of regulators of other injury responses like osteoblast migration, dedifferentiation, and proliferation, that occur at all injuries. One previously suggested regulator of distally- oriented regeneration is the Ser/Thr phosphatase calcineurin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cao et al., 2021</xref>). During zebrafish fin regeneration, inhibition of calcineurin increases regenerative growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kujawski et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, the polarised, distally-oriented blastema formation in the cavity injury model can be overridden by calcineurin inhibition, which induces blastema formation also at the proximal injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cao et al., 2021</xref>). We also found that calcineurin inhibition can trigger the recruitment of osteoblasts into the bone defect at the proximal injury site in our hemiray removal model. Yet, we also observed increased distally-oriented osteoblast migration upon FK506 treatment, suggesting that calcineurin does not specifically regulate the polarity of injury responses along the proximodistal axis, but generally dampens responses at all injuries, including osteoblast migration and cell proliferation.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings support a model in which zebrafish fin bone regeneration involves both generic and regeneration-specific injury responses of osteoblasts. Morphology changes and directed migration towards the injury site as well as dedifferentiation represent generic responses that occur at all injuries even if they are not followed by regenerative bone formation. While migration and dedifferentiation can be uncoupled and are (at least partially) independently regulated, they appear to be triggered by signals that emanate from all bone injuries. In contrast, migration off the bone matrix into the bone defect, formation of a population of (pre-)osteoblasts, and regenerative bone formation represent regeneration-specific responses that require additional signals that are only present at distal-facing injuries. The identification of molecular determinants of the generic vs regenerative responses will be an interesting avenue for future research.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

For experiments where we did not observe significant differences between experimental groups, if applicable we used the following logic to support statements that no differences exist or that these are not biologically relevant: the smallest difference that would have been significant was calculated based on the effect size and the SDs and sample sizes of the experimental groups. Using G × Power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Faul et al., 2009</xref>) the effect size was computed with these parameters: <italic>t</italic>-test, tails=2, <italic>α</italic>=0.05, power (1−β)=0.8, and the sample size of both groups.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Céline Colnot as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Additional experimental details should be provided to demonstrate the absence of biased selection of cells chosen to be incorporated into the statistical analyses. A clearer picture of how the authors obtained their final numbers starting from the original image data is needed.</p><p>2) Additional sets of marker genes (in addition to bglap:GFP downregulation) and long time–lapse imaging of the reporter (preferably with histone–GFP) would be helpful to further substantiate the claims on &quot;dedifferentiation&quot; and &quot;migration&quot; of osteoblast populations. Additional characterization of bglap:GFP+ cells would be also helpful to determine if these cells also include osteoblast precursor cells.</p><p>3) Additional results are needed to support the claim that the complement system is required for injury–induced directed osteoblast migration including expression analyses of the central complement components C3 and C5 at the amputation site and showing whether c5ar1 and c3ar are solely expressed in osteoblasts, or rather broadly within tissue lining the hemirays.</p><p>4) It is unclear whether each step of cell elongation and alignment, cell migration, cell dedifferentiation and regenerative response, is required for fin regeneration following amputation. In the absence of direct evidence for the requirement of migration or dedifferentiation for the overall success of fin regeneration, the limitations should be more clearly stated, and the title modified.</p><p>5) The word trauma should be clarified as the authors do not provide evidence for a non–healing phenotype in their trauma model.</p><p>6) The conclusions referring to the relevance of the work to bone regeneration should be toned down and more focused on fin regeneration.</p><p>7) The manuscript is overall well written but could be improved to be less technical to help the readers, and the discussion should be reduced in length.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>To determine whether each step of cell elongation and alignment, cell migration, cell dedifferentiation and regenerative response, is required for fin regeneration following amputation the authors discuss p14 that other tools will be needed. However, later time points could be assessed in this study, not only to show the long–term effects of the treatment on healing but also to show how healing eventually resolves in the two models used here. Did the authors assess the long–term effects of inhibitor treatments on the regeneration process? Does blocking the complement system or actomyosin prevent regeneration? Are both generic (migration, dedifferentiation) and regenerative growth required for regeneration? Since there are limitations in the approaches used, the authors should modify the title and replace the word &quot;requires&quot;. The use of the term &quot;require&quot; should be reconsidered also in the abstract and throughout the manuscript if the requirement for healing or a specific process is not demonstrated.</p><p>Can the authors provide evidence of the source of C3 and C5, the central components of the complement system during fin regeneration? Figure 4 shows RNAscope in situ detection of c5aR1. Analysis of c3 and c5 using the same technique should be included.</p><p>Regarding the trauma model, it is unclear whether the gaps on each side of the remaining segment eventually heal. Does the gap on the proximal side of the remaining segment heal via regeneration occurring on the distal end of the next segment? The term &quot;trauma&quot; should be replaced by another term. Further, the term &quot;trauma&quot; appears to be used in the first paragraph of the discussion when referring to amputation and in other parts of the discussion when referring to bone injury.</p><p>The Discussion section is very long and there are many redundancies with the Results section. The main findings and conclusions could be stated more briefly, and the discussion points presented in a more concise way. As indicated in the public review, the last paragraph of the discussion should be focused on &quot;fin regeneration&quot; and avoid concluding on &quot;bone regeneration&quot; and &quot;bone formation&quot;.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– Page 4, line 6: I am not sure if &quot;exoskeletal&quot; is by definition the right term in this context.</p><p>– What is the p–value in Figure 2A (left) between the width/length ratio of cytochalasin–treated osteoblasts from segments –1 and –2? It looks as if the cells of segment –1 are somewhat elongated even though they have been exposed to the drug. Could the authors please comment on this?</p><p>– The red labeling of data points for the drug–treated conditions in Figure 2A, B and C might be difficult to be detected by color–blind readers. This should be adjusted accordingly.</p><p>– An image showing cyp26b1 RNAscope in situ hybridization on which the graphs of Figure 5H are based should be shown somewhere – maybe in the dedicated Excel sheet of raw data.</p><p>– Suggestion for a further experiment (not required for acceptance from my side!!!): I think it would be nice to learn whether C3a and C5a are sufficient to drive directed osteoblast migration along bony elements. To test that one could try to implant a bead loaded with recombinant C3a or C5a somewhere along a fin ray to see whether this ectopic signaling source attracts osteoblasts. Would this be doable? Recombinant complement proteins appear to be commercially available.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Title:</p><p>– I feel that the current title does not capture the essence of the authors' major findings.</p><p>2. Abstract:</p><p>– The abstract is oversimplified and overstated, omitting important details. The authors should clearly state that they used a bglap:GFP strain to support their conclusions on osteoblast differentiation and migration.</p><p>3. Introduction:</p><p>– The authors make significant statements on osteoblast dedifferentiation. This is based on a naïve assumption that bglap:GFP is solely active in mature osteoblasts. However, it is clear from the authors' data that a substantial fraction of GFP+ cells are in proliferation (Figure 4 S1B). It seems that bglap:GFP is also expressed by osteoblast precursors. Specificity of bglap:GFP to mature osteoblasts is a major concern.</p><p>– Page 5, Line 5: Osteoblasts do not migrate to the resorbed sites. Osteoblast precursors (or pre–osteoblasts) do. Thiel 2018 review article does not appear to be particularly supportive.</p><p>4. Results:</p><p>– Page 6, Line 14: Perhaps the authors should explain in more detail about the kaedeGreen to Red system, and why they needed this approach.</p><p>– Page 7, Line 13–16: I do not understand why the authors interpret these data as directed active migration behavior towards the injury. What they showed here is merely cell shape changes.</p><p>– Page 7, Line 19: This data could be alternatively interpreted as the upregulation of bglap:GFP by invading cells (not previously bglap+), rather than the invasion of bglap:GFP+ cells. It would be essential to determine the half–life of GFP to assume cell invasion. The authors would need a more long–lasting histone–bound GFP reporter strain to conclusively define cell invasion.</p><p>– Page 8, Line 3–16: This paragraph is very difficult to read because of long sentences. They should simplify and rephrase the sentences.</p><p>– Page 9, Line 1: The authors should move the bglap RNAscope in situ data to the main figure, as this is an important piece of information.</p><p>– Page 9, Line 6: I don't understand why reduced bglap mRNA can be interpreted as osteoblast dedifferentiation.</p><p>– Overall, the authors would need live–cell imaging and tracking to make these conclusions.</p><p>– Page 10, Line 7: If the authors think that a bglap:GFP strain can be used as live reporters for osteoblast dedifferentiation, that would significantly compromise the scientific rigor of the study, as it would not support any conclusions regarding cell migration and invasion.</p><p>– Page 10, Line 20: Osteoblast migration should not be mixed up with cell shape changes.</p><p>– Page 11, Line 12: The authors did not show data for osteoblast differentiation/dedifferentiation in their genetic intervention studies.</p><p>– Page 11, Line 19: An alternative explanation is that retinoic acid and NF–kB signaling simply promote osteoblast differentiation, without anything to do with dedifferentiation.</p><p>– Page 12, Line 1–2: These conclusions are stretched and not supported by experimental data. The argument for the decoupling of dedifferentiation and migration is not well developed.</p><p>– Page 13, Line 8: As many as 20% of bglap:GFP+ cells are EdU+ therefore in proliferation. How would the authors explain this?</p><p>5. Discussion:</p><p>– The authors should clearly indicate their definition of osteoblasts in this study (i.e. bglap:GFP+ cells).</p><p>– Osteoblast dedifferentiation should be rephrased as reduced bglap expression.</p><p>– Page 18, Line 19: Osteoblast differentiation, instead of osteoblast dedifferentiation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77614.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Additional experimental details should be provided to demonstrate the absence of biased selection of cells chosen to be incorporated into the statistical analyses.

For measurement of morphology, we used a transgenic line expressing a fluorescent protein (FP) in osteoblasts in combination with Zns5 antibody labelling. Zns5 is a pan-osteoblastic marker which localizes to the cell membrane. Therefore, combination of a cytosolic FP labelling with the membrane labelling by Zns5 provides solid definition of single cell outlines. For general morphology studies and drug intervention studies, we used <italic>bglap</italic>:GFP transgenics. In the transgenic intervention studies (manipulation of NF-κB signalling), mCherry is expressed together with CreERT2 under the <italic>osterix</italic> promoter and used as cytosolic labelling of osteoblasts. Our analyses are always based on segments, e.g. we present data for segments 0, -1, 2. Within these segments all FP+ Zns5+ cells were included into the analysis, and cells along the whole proximodistal axis of a segment were measured. Measurements were performed manually, and the analysist was blinded. With these set-ups, not only a fraction but all FP+ Zns5+ osteoblasts present in those segments that we analysed were included into the analysis, and thus no selection was necessary that could have introduced bias. As suggested by Reviewer #2, we have added representative sample images to the accompanying Excel sheets of raw data for the dedicated experiments. Within these, the axes along which the measurements have been performed are indicated. We have expanded the description of the analysis in the method section. It now reads on page 36 as follows:</p><p>“To quantify osteoblast cell shape and orientation, the transgenic line bglap:GFP in combination with Zns5 AB labelling was used. Osteoblasts of the outer layer of one hemiray (facing the objective in whole fin mounting) were imaged and analysed. As Zns5 localizes to the plasma membrane of all osteoblasts, the combination of both markers provides solid definition of single cell outlines. All GFP+ Zns5+ cells with such a defined outline within an analysed segment were included into the analysis, and cells along the whole proximodistal axis of a segment were measured. In the transgenic intervention studies, mCherry is expressed under the osx promoter and was used as cytosolic labelling of osteoblasts. Using Fiji (Schindelin et al., 2012), the longest axis of a FP+ Zns5+ cell was measured as maximum length, the short axis as maximum width, and the ratio calculated. Simultaneously, the angle of the maximum length towards the proximodistal ray axis was measured for angular deviation. All measurements were performed manually, with the analyst being blinded.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Additional sets of marker genes (in addition to bglap:GFP downregulation) and long time–lapse imaging of the reporter (preferably with histone–GFP) would be helpful to further substantiate the claims on &quot;dedifferentiation&quot; and &quot;migration&quot; of osteoblast populations. Additional characterization of bglap:GFP+ cells would be also helpful to determine if these cells also include osteoblast precursor cells.</p></disp-quote><p>To address these comments, we have performed several additional experiments as described below. In addition, we would like to refer the reviewers to our previous papers, where we have analysed the process of osteoblast dedifferentiation (Knopf et al., Dev Cell 2011, doi: 10.1016/j.devcel.2011.04.014; Geurtzen et al., Development 2014, doi: 10.1242/dev.105817; Mishra et al. Dev Cell 2020, doi: 10.1016/j.devcel.2019.11.016). Using transgenic reporters and immunofluorescence we have shown in these previous papers that osteoblasts in the non-injured fin express the differentiation marker Bglap but not the pre-osteoblast marker Runx2 (and are thus by our definition differentiated), and that these cells do not only downregulate Bglap but also upregulate Runx2 in the process of dedifferentiation.</p><p>However, we have refined and expanded our methods and are now able to determine the expression patterns of markers of the osteoblast differentiation status with single cell resolution using RNAScope in situ hybridization. We think that these data are even more conclusive than those we previously published, since they don’t rely on transgenic reporters, which might not fully reflect the endogenous expression, and are not affected by issues of antibody specificity. The results that we have now obtained with this method fully support our previous conclusions.</p><p>Already in the previous version of the manuscript we have shown that endogenous <italic>bglap</italic> is strongly expressed in segment -2, (the segment that does not respond to fin amputation and thus represents the non-injured state), while it is downregulated in a graded manner in segment -1 and segment 0 (the segments where dedifferentiation happens). These data were possibly somewhat hidden in the Supplement, we have now moved them to the re-designed Figure 1B. In addition to <italic>bglap</italic>, we can now show that <italic>entpd5,</italic> a gene required for bone mineralization, is strongly expressed in osteoblasts of segment -2, while it is massively downregulated in segment -1 and segment 0. Thus, <italic>entpd5</italic> is another differentiation marker whose loss characterizes osteoblast dedifferentiation. These new data can be found in Figure 1C. Importantly, we can confirm by RNAScope that the pre-osteoblast marker <italic>runx2a</italic> is absent in mature segments but is upregulated in segment 0 and segment -1 at 1 dpa (new data in Figure 1 —figure supplement 1A). Similarly, <italic>cyp26b1</italic>, an enzyme shown to regulate dedifferentiation, is upregulated in segment 0 and segment -1, but is not expressed in segment -2 (new data in Figure 1 —figure supplement 1B). Furthermore, we have repeated all experiments where we have previously quantified dedifferentiation upon experimental interventions using downregulation of <italic>bglap</italic>:GFP (actomyosin inhibition, retinoic acid treatment, complement inhibition). We now can fully confirm the previous conclusions using the more rigorous quantification of dedifferentiation using RNAScope analysis of endogenous <italic>bglap</italic> levels. We have replaced all <italic>bglap</italic>:GFP data with the new <italic>bglap</italic> RNAScope data. These new data are found in Figure 3F, Figure 3 —figure supplement 1A, Figure 4B and Figure 5F.</p><p>To further support our conclusion that osteoblasts do not only dedifferentiate, but also migrate, we performed time-lapse imaging using a transgenic line expressing the photoconvertible protein kaede in osteoblasts (<italic>entpd5</italic>:kaede). Local photoconversion of only the proximal half of a segment allowed us to trace these photoconverted osteoblasts. This revealed that converted cells appear in the distal part of the segment within 1 dpa, which can only be explained by relocation of the cells. These new data can be found in Figure 1F.</p><p>Our main tool to monitor osteoblast migration is the <italic>bglap</italic>:GFP transgenic line. Although <italic>bglap</italic> expression is downregulated during osteoblast dedifferentiation and thus also GFP levels eventually drop in the transgenic line, we can nevertheless use this line to trace osteoblasts, since GFP protein persists for up to three days in cells that shut down endogenous <italic>bglap</italic> and also <italic>bglap</italic>:GFP transgene transcription. While we have already shown this previously (Knopf et al., Dev Cell 2011, doi: 10.1016/j.devcel.2011.04.014), we have now also used RNAScope to confirm this. We analysed the expression of GFP on protein and RNA level in the <italic>bglap</italic>:GFP line. In <italic>bglap</italic>:GFP fish, in a mature segment in non-injured fins the regions close to the joints are devoid of cells expressing GFP (Figure 1G). Yet after amputation, we observe GFP+ cells in this distal part of segment -1 (Figure 1G, D). RNAscope in situ shows that these GFP+ cells are negative for <italic>gfp</italic> RNA (new data in Figure 1D). Thus, the observed fluorescence is due to the persistence of the GFP protein and not due to a potential upregulation of the transgene, which confirms that these GFP+ cells have migrated from the centre of the segment.</p><p>To confirm the specificity of the <italic>bglap</italic>:GFP line for mature osteoblasts, we performed immunofluorescence against Runx2 on 7 dpa regenerates, at a stage where blastema proliferation at the distal tip of the regenerate produces new osteoblast progenitors, while in more proximal (older) regions osteoblasts have already started to differentiate and new bone matrix has formed. We found that Runx2 is expressed in distal regions in pre-osteoblasts, while <italic>bglap</italic>:GFP is only expressed in proximal regions in osteoblasts which do not express Runx2. Thus, <italic>bglap</italic>:GFP is activated in mature osteoblasts and the population does not include osteoblast precursor cells. These new data are found in Figure 2 —figure supplement 2B. In addition, we now also show by -RNAScope that <italic>bglap</italic>:GFP+ cells in segment -2 (the segment not affected by dedifferentiation) do not express the pre-osteoblast marker <italic>runx2a</italic> nor <italic>cyp26b1</italic>, which is upregulated in dedifferentiated osteoblasts. These additional data confirm that <italic>bglap</italic>:GFP specifically labels differentiated osteoblasts and does not include osteoblast precursors.</p><p>We have restructured the first paragraphs of the results to better describe our choice of markers and tools and describe the new data in the revised manuscript on page 6 as follows:</p><p>“(…) Using RNAScope in situ hybridization, we can now show that downregulation of bglap occurs in a graded manner and that entpd5 expression is similarly downregulated during dedifferentiation (Figure 1B, C). At 1 day post amputation (1 dpa), expression of entpd5 and bglap remains high in segment -2, but gradually decreases towards the amputation plane and is almost entirely absent from segment 0, with entpd5 downregulation being more pronounced (Figure 1B, C). While RNA expression of these genes is downregulated within hours after injury, GFP or Kaede fluorescent proteins (FPs) expressed in bglap or entpd5 reporter transgenic lines persist for up to three days, even though transgene transcription is shut down rapidly as well (Knopf et al., 2011). We can confirm these earlier findings using the more sensitive RNAScope in situs. In bglap:GFP transgenics at 2 dpa, gfp RNA and GFP protein colocalized to the same cells in segment -2, where osteoblasts do not dedifferentiate (Figure 1D). In contrast, in the distal segment -1 GFP protein was present, but barely any gfp transcript could be detected (Figure 1D). Thus, persistence of FPs in reporter lines can be used for short-term tracing of dedifferentiated osteoblasts (Figure 1E). At 1 dpa, bglap:GFP+ cells upregulated expression of the pre-osteoblast marker runx2a and of cyp26b1, an enzyme involved in retinoic acid signalling (Blum and Begemann, 2015), which regulates dedifferentiation (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1A, B). Both markers were exclusively upregulated in segment -1 and segment 0 at 1 dpa, but were absent in segment -2. Together, these data show that osteoblasts in segment -1 and segment 0 lose expression of mature markers and gain expression of dedifferentiation markers.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Additional results are needed to support the claim that the complement system is required for injury–induced directed osteoblast migration including expression analyses of the central complement components C3 and C5 at the amputation site and showing whether c5ar1 and c3ar are solely expressed in osteoblasts, or rather broadly within tissue lining the hemirays.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, we lack the tools to detect the C3 and C5 precursor proteins or the mature cleavage products of the complement factors, which mediate the biological function of the cascade (e.g. antibodies against the zebrafish proteins / peptides). However, we analysed expression of the RNAs coding for the precursors of the complement factors <italic>c5</italic> and the six zebrafish paralogs of <italic>c3</italic> using qRT-PCR on liver, non-injured fins and fins at 6 hpa (samples derived from segment -1 plus segment 0). These new data can be found in Figure 5B. Compared to the expression levels in the liver, expression in non-injured fins could hardly be detected. Interestingly, <italic>c5</italic> and <italic>c3a.5</italic> levels were upregulated in injured fins, but compared to the expression in the liver still only slightly, e.g. <italic>c5</italic> is about 17 Ct values (2 to the power of 17 = 130000 times) more highly expressed in the liver than in the injured fin. These results are consistent with the idea that the majority of complement factors that are activated after injury is derived from precursors that are expressed in the liver and are distributed via the circulation to the fin, as is considered standard for the complement system. Interestingly, however, local injury-induced expression in the fin might contribute precursor proteins as well.</p><p>While we had already shown that <italic>c5aR1</italic> is expressed in osteoblasts<italic>,</italic> we have now added additional RNAscope in situ analysis for <italic>c5aR1</italic> showing that the receptor is also expressed in other cell types in the fin (new data in Figure 5 —figure supplement 1A). We have also attempted RNAScope for <italic>c3aR1, c5a</italic> and <italic>c3a.1</italic> in fins, but these turned out to not produce any specific stainings, thus the results of these experiments remained inconclusive and we have not included them in the manuscript. However, we have established fluorescent activated cell sorting from <italic>bglap</italic>:GFP transgenic fins, which gives us an additional tool to analyse to which extent expression is specific to osteoblasts. By qRT-PCR analysis we found that <italic>c5aR1</italic> and <italic>c3aR</italic> are expressed in both GFP+ osteoblasts and other cells that are GFP– (these will mainly represent epidermis and fibroblasts, to a lesser extent endothelial and other cell types). These new data can be found in Figure 5 —figure supplement 1B.</p><p>While our qRT-PCR data and the <italic>c5aR1</italic> RNAScope results show that the complement receptors are not specifically expressed in osteoblasts, we do not consider this result to be in conflict with our model that the complement system regulates osteoblast migration. Other cell types migrate after fin amputation as well, which is best described for epidermal cells (Chen et al., Dev Cell 2016, 10.1016/j.devcel.2016.02.017), but likely also occurs for fibroblasts (Poleo et al., DevDyn 2001, doi: 10.1002/dvdy.1152), and it is conceivable that the complement system plays a role in regulating these events as well.</p><p>Overall, our new data support our conclusion that the complement system is an important regulator of osteoblast migration in vivo, since the receptors are present in osteoblasts, while systemic and local expression can provide the precursors for injury-induced production of the activated factors that might act as guidance cues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It is unclear whether each step of cell elongation and alignment, cell migration, cell dedifferentiation and regenerative response, is required for fin regeneration following amputation. In the absence of direct evidence for the requirement of migration or dedifferentiation for the overall success of fin regeneration, the limitations should be more clearly stated, and the title modified.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the title and abstract to avoid overstating the requirement of the particular responses to successful regeneration. Furthermore, we have stated the limitations of our study more clearly in the discussion.</p><p>The title now reads:</p><p>“Zebrafish fin regeneration involves generic and regeneration-specific osteoblast injury responses”</p><p>In the discussion we state the limitations on page 21 as follows:</p><p>“Unfortunately, currently existing tools to block dedifferentiation are either mosaic (activation of NF- κB signalling using the Cre-lox system) or cannot be targeted to osteoblasts alone (treatment with retinoic acid). Due to these limitations in our assays, we can currently not test what consequences specific, unmitigated perturbation of osteoblast dedifferentiation has for overall fin / bone regeneration. Conversely, the interventions presented here that specifically perturb osteoblast migration are limited as they act only transiently, that is they can severely delay, but not fully block migration. Furthermore, while interference with actomyosin dynamics reduces regenerative growth, we cannot distinguish whether this is caused by the inhibition of osteoblast migration or due to other more direct effects on cell proliferation and tissue growth. Thus, an unequivocal test of the importance of osteoblast migration for bone regeneration requires different tools.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The word trauma should be clarified as the authors do not provide evidence for a non–healing phenotype in their trauma model.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize if our use of the term trauma has caused confusion.

Morphology changes and directed migration towards the injury site as well as dedifferentiation represent generic responses that occur at all injuries even if they are not followed by regenerative bone formation. While migration and dedifferentiation can be uncoupled and are (at least partially) independently regulated, they appear to be triggered by signals that emanate from all bone injuries. In contrast, migration off the bone matrix into the bone defect, formation of a population of (pre-) osteoblasts and regenerative bone formation represent regeneration-specific responses that require additional signals that are only present at distal-facing injuries. The identification of molecular determinants of the generic vs regenerative responses will be an interesting avenue for future research.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The manuscript is overall well written but could be improved to be less technical to help the readers, and the discussion should be reduced in length.</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited the manuscript, in particular we have tried to explain the background and logic of our setup and tools at the beginning of the results. We have also shortened the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>To determine whether each step of cell elongation and alignment, cell migration, cell dedifferentiation and regenerative response, is required for fin regeneration following amputation the authors discuss p14 that other tools will be needed. However, later time points could be assessed in this study, not only to show the long–term effects of the treatment on healing but also to show how healing eventually resolves in the two models used here. Did the authors assess the long–term effects of inhibitor treatments on the regeneration process? Does blocking the complement system or actomyosin prevent regeneration? Are both generic (migration, dedifferentiation) and regenerative growth required for regeneration? Since there are limitations in the approaches used, the authors should modify the title and replace the word &quot;requires&quot;. The use of the term &quot;require&quot; should be reconsidered also in the abstract and throughout the manuscript if the requirement for healing or a specific process is not demonstrated.</p></disp-quote><p>As a read-out for long-term effects of blocking the complement system or actomyosin, we have analysed two additional aspects. First, we analysed if the upregulation of Runx2 in segment 0 at 2 dpa is affected. We consider this another, but later readout for osteoblast dedifferentiation in addition to the <italic>bglap</italic> downregulation at 1 dpa, which we also show is not affected by actomyosin or complement inhibition (Figure 3F and Figure 5F). Neither actin nor complement interference had an effect on Runx2 upregulation. These new data can be found in Figure 3 —figure supplement 1B and Figure 5 —figure supplement 3B. These data confirm that these interventions do not block osteoblast dedifferentiation.</p><p>Second, we measured the length of the regenerate at 3 dpa as read-out for regenerative growth. Complement inhibition had no effect on regenerate length (new Figure 5 —figure supplement 3C). However, while osteoblast migration is severely impaired early after fin amputation upon complement inhibition, osteoblasts eventually do migrate to the amputation plane. We attempted to use higher doses of the drugs and the C3aR and C5aR1 inhibitors in combination, but these interventions turned out to be toxic and were thus inconclusive. Thus, the absence of regenerate growth defects upon complement inhibition cannot be interpreted to indicate that osteoblast migration is not required for fin regeneration.</p><p>In contrast, actomyosin inhibition did impair regenerative growth, (new data in Figure 3 —figure supplement 1C). Unfortunately, since actomyosin has essential roles in many cellular processes we cannot distinguish whether the impaired growth upon actomyosin inhibition is an indirect consequence of failed osteoblast migration or due to a direct role of actomyosin dynamics in cell proliferation and growth. Thus, the situation remains as we have explained in the discussion, that thorough tests of the individual requirements of the different osteoblast injury responses for overall regeneration will require additional tools. While this represents a limitation or our study, we still consider our main finding, that different injury responses can be uncoupled and are independently regulated, an important advance in our understanding of regeneration. We have revised the manuscript and replaced the word “require” with “involve”, e.g. in the title and abstract, which now read:</p><p>“Zebrafish fin regeneration involves generic and regeneration-specific osteoblast injury responses”</p><p>“Successful regeneration requires the coordinated execution of multiple cellular responses to injury. In amputated zebrafish fins, mature osteoblasts dedifferentiate, migrate towards the injury and form proliferative osteogenic blastema cells. We show that osteoblast migration is preceded by cell elongation and alignment along the proximodistal axis, which require actomyosin, but not microtubule turnover. Surprisingly, osteoblast dedifferentiation and migration can be uncoupled. Using pharmacological and genetic interventions, we found that NF-ĸB and retinoic acid signalling regulate dedifferentiation without affecting migration, while the complement system and actomyosin dynamics affect migration but not dedifferentiation. Furthermore, by removing bone at two locations within a fin ray, we established an injury model containing two injury sites. We found that osteoblasts dedifferentiate at and migrate towards both sites, while accumulation of osteogenic progenitor cells and regenerative bone formation only occur at the distal-facing injury. Together, these data indicate that osteoblast dedifferentiation and migration represent generic injury responses that are differentially regulated and can occur independently of each other and of regenerative growth. We conclude that successful bone regeneration appears to involve the coordinated execution of generic and regeneration-specific responses of osteoblasts to injury.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can the authors provide evidence of the source of C3 and C5, the central components of the complement system during fin regeneration?

Introduction:</p><p>– The authors make significant statements on osteoblast dedifferentiation. This is based on a naïve assumption that bglap:GFP is solely active in mature osteoblasts. However, it is clear from the authors' data that a substantial fraction of GFP+ cells are in proliferation (Figure 4 S1B). It seems that bglap:GFP is also expressed by osteoblast precursors. Specificity of bglap:GFP to mature osteoblasts is a major concern.</p></disp-quote><p>To address these comments, we have performed several additional experiments as described below. In addition, we would like to refer the reviewer to our previous papers, where we have analysed the process of osteoblast dedifferentiation (Knopf et al., Dev Cell 2011, doi: 10.1016/j.devcel.2011.04.014; Geurtzen et al., Development 2014, doi: 10.1242/dev.105817; Mishra et al. Dev Cell 2020, doi: 10.1016/j.devcel.2019.11.016). Using transgenic reporters and immunofluorescence we have shown in these previous papers that osteoblasts in the non-injured fin express Bglap but not the pre-osteoblast marker Runx2 (and are thus by our definition differentiated). We apologize if we failed to explain the logic of our approach in this manuscript, we have restructured the results to clarify these, as indicated below.</p><p>We have also performed the following additional experiments.</p><p>1) To confirm the specificity of the <italic>bglap</italic>:GFP line for mature osteoblasts, we have performed three experiments:</p><p>a) Immunofluorescence against Runx2 on 7 dpa regenerates, at a stage where blastema proliferation at the distal tip of the regenerate produces new osteoblast progenitors, while in more proximal (older) regions osteoblasts have already started to differentiate and new bone matrix has formed. We found that Runx2 is expressed in distal regions in pre-osteoblasts, while <italic>bglap</italic>:GFP is only expressed in proximal regions in osteoblasts which do not express Runx2. Thus, formation of new bony segment during regenerative growth, <italic>bglap</italic>:GFP is activated in mature osteoblasts and the population does not include osteoblast precursor cells. These new data are found in Figure 2 —figure supplement 2B.</p><p>b) We have refined and expanded our methods and are now able to determine the expression patterns of markers of the osteoblast differentiation status with single cell resolution using RNAScope in situ hybridization. Using this, we can now show that at 1 day post amputation, in segment -2 of the fin stump, which represents a segment equivalent to the non-injured state, since no dedifferentiation occurs here, <italic>bglap</italic>:GFP+ cells do not express endogenous <italic>runx2a</italic>. These new data are found in Figure 1 —figure supplement 1A.</p><p>c) Using RNAScope, we can show that <italic>cyp26b1</italic>, a gene associated with dedifferentiated osteoblasts, is likewise not detected in <italic>bglap</italic>:GFP+ cells in segment -2 at 1 dpa (new data in Figure 1 —figure supplement 1B).</p><p>Together, these data confirm that the bglap:GFP line is specific for differentiated osteoblasts, and does not label osteoblast progenitors.</p><p>See the response to issue 2 below for how we describe these new data in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><p>2) Regarding the proliferation of <italic>bglap</italic>:GFP osteoblasts: In the experiment the reviewer refers to (now Figure 5 —figure supplement 3A), we make use of the persistence of the GFP protein in the <italic>bglap</italic>:GFP line to detect dedifferentiated osteoblasts. Thus, at the time of analysis, when these GFP+ cells proliferate, they are not differentiated anymore. We can show this as follows:</p><p>Although <italic>bglap</italic> expression is downregulated during osteoblast dedifferentiation and thus also GFP levels eventually drop in the transgenic line, we can nevertheless use this line to trace osteoblasts, since GFP protein persists for up to three days in cells that shut down endogenous <italic>bglap</italic> and also <italic>bglap</italic>:GFP transgene transcription. While we have already shown this previously (Knopf et al., Dev Cell 2011, doi: 10.1016/j.devcel.2011.04.014; Geurtzen et al., Development 2014, doi: 10.1242/dev.105817; Mishra et al. Dev Cell 2020, doi: 10.1016/j.devcel.2019.11.016), we have now also used RNAScope to confirm this. We analysed the expression of GFP on protein and RNA level in the <italic>bglap</italic>:GFP line. In <italic>bglap</italic>:GFP fish, in a mature segment in non-injured fins the regions close to the joints are devoid of cells expressing GFP (Figure 1G). Yet after amputation, we observe GFP+ cells in this distal part of segment -1 (Figure 1G, D). RNAscope in situ shows that these GFP+ cells are negative for <italic>gfp</italic> RNA (new data in Figure 1D). Thus, the observed fluorescence is due to the persistence of the GFP protein and not due to a potential upregulation of the transgene (Figure 1E).</p><p>Importantly, we have now also added data describing the proliferative state of <italic>bglap</italic>:GFP+ osteoblasts. First, in the non-injured fin, <italic>bglap</italic>:GFP+ cells are non-proliferative (new data in Figure 5 —figure supplement 2B). After amputation, proliferation can be detected in GFP+ cells at 2 dpa (Figure 5 —figure supplement 2B), and proliferation is restricted to segment -1 and segment 0 (new data in Figure 5 —figure supplement 2C). As we show in Figure 1B, at 2 dpa, dedifferentiation as defined by <italic>bglap</italic> downregulation is not complete in segment -1, rather here a mixture of cells with different <italic>bglap</italic> levels are found. We have thus combined EdU labelling with RNAscope against <italic>bglap</italic> in segment -1 to analyse to which extent <italic>bglap</italic> and EdU anticorrelate. These data show that EdU is hardly ever incorporated into cells expressing high levels of <italic>bglap</italic>, while the majority of the proliferating osteoblasts are dedifferentiated, as they express only low levels of <italic>bglap</italic> (new data in Figure 5 —figure supplement 2D). Together, these data show that mature osteoblasts are non-proliferative, and upon amputation, when they are dedifferentiated, they become proliferative. Thus, the absence of proliferation in <italic>bgla</italic>p:GFP+ cells in the non-injured fin adds to the evidence that this line is specific for mature osteoblasts, but due to the persistence of the GFP protein it can be used to analyse dedifferentiated osteoblasts.</p><p>These data are described on page 14 of the manuscript as follows:</p><p>“In the non-injured fin, bglap:GFP+ osteoblasts are non-proliferative, but upon amputation osteoblasts proliferate at 2 dpa (Figure 5 —figure supplement 2A, B). Proliferation is restricted to segment -1 and segment 0 (Figure 5 —figure supplement 2C), and RNAscope in situ analysis of bglap expression revealed that the majority of EdU+ osteoblasts have strongly downregulated bglap (Figure 5 —figure supplement 2D). Inhibition of C5aR1 with PMX205 had no effect on osteoblast proliferation in segment -1 at 2 dpa (Figure 5 —figure supplement 3A). Furthermore, upregulation of Runx2 was not changed by PMX205 treatment (Figure 5 —figure supplement 3B), and regenerative growth was not affected in fish treated with either W54011, PMX205 or SB290157 (Figure 5 —figure supplement Figure 3C). We conclude that the complement system specifically regulates injury-induced osteoblast migration, but not osteoblast dedifferentiation or proliferation in zebrafish.”</p><p>3) To support our conclusion that osteoblasts migrate, we performed time-lapse imaging using a transgenic line expressing the photoconvertible protein kaede in osteoblasts (<italic>entpd5</italic>:kaede). Local photoconversion of only the proximal half of a segment allowed us to trace these photoconverted osteoblasts. This revealed that converted cells appear in the distal part of the segment within 1 dpa, which can only be explained by relocation of the cells. These new data can be found in Figure 1F and they are described on page 7 of the revised manuscript as follows:</p><p>“To trace osteoblasts, we used the transgenic line entpd5:kaede (Geurtzen et al., 2014), in which Kaede fluorescence can be converted from green to red by UV light (Ando et al., 2002). We photoconverted osteoblasts in the proximal half of segment -1, while osteoblasts in the distal half remained green (Figure 1F). At 1 dpa, red osteoblasts were found in the distal half (Figure 1F), showing that photoconverted osteoblasts had relocated distally.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Page 5, Line 5: Osteoblasts do not migrate to the resorbed sites.

It is first introduced now on page 7 (describing a new experiment), where it reads as follows:</p><p>“To trace osteoblasts, we used the transgenic line <italic>entpd5</italic>:kaede (Geurtzen et al., 2014), in which Kaede fluorescence can be converted from green to red by UV light (Ando et al., 2002).”</p><p>In the experiment the reviewer is referring to, we used a double transgenic line expressing both GFP and kaede in osteoblasts (Video 1, Figure 2 —figure supplement 1A). We deliberately only partly converted kaedeGreen to kaedeRed, which resulted in different hues for each osteoblast. This distinct colouring facilitates identification of individual cells during repeated live imaging using a confocal microscope. Due to the curved surface of a hemiray and to counteract potential movements along the z-axis of the fin during image acquisition, several z-slides had to be recorded at each timepoint. As a consequence, there is a considerable time of recording, increasing photobleaching over time. Having two fluorescent proteins being expressed in the cells gave a higher intensity signal in the beginning, allowing lower laser power and exposure time, and thus reduced photobleaching. The description now reads as follows (page 8):</p><p>“To observe osteoblast behaviour at single cell resolution in live fish after fin amputation, we generated double transgenic fish expressing bglap:GFP (Knopf et al., 2011)and entpd5:kaede in mature osteoblasts. Expression of two fluorescent proteins increased signal for repeated imaging, and partial photoconversion of kaedeGreen into kaedeRed resulted in a different colouring for each osteoblast, which facilitated tracking of morphology changes at single cell resolution.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Page 7, Line 13–16: I do not understand why the authors interpret these data as directed active migration behavior towards the injury. What they showed here is merely cell shape changes.</p></disp-quote><p>The formation of protrusions orientated in the direction of (nascent) movement is an essential step during cell migration. Our data show that mature osteoblasts in the non-injured fin are roundish without such directed protrusion. In contrast, after amputation we see an elongation of osteoblasts in segment -1 in the direction of migration. We agree that such protrusions on their own would not be sufficient evidence of active migration. Yet, in combination with our other evidence (relocation of cells shown by <italic>bglap</italic>:GFP and <italic>entpd5</italic>:Kaede tracing via repeated imaging, live videos showing movement of osteoblasts relative to their surroundings, see the response to “Weaknesses”, issue 3 above), we interpret this morphology changes as being consistent with acquisition of active migratory behaviour. To better elucidate the relation between cell shape changes and migration, we have re-arranged the order in which we present our data. We now show the relocation / migration of osteoblasts first (Figure 1D – I), and then the cell shape changes (Figure 2A-C, Figure 2 —figure supplement 1). This highlights that only in the segments where osteoblasts migrate, they elongate. Furthermore, we have rephrased the sentence.

It now reads as follows (page 9):</p><p>“Fins grow by the addition of new segments distally, and in the distal-most, youngest segment, bglap:GFP is not expressed (Knopf et al., 2011). Similarly, in the regenerating fins increasing numbers of GFP+ cells can be detected in more proximally located, older segments, reflecting the progressive differentiation of osteoblasts with time (Figure 2 —figure supplement 2A). In less mature segments, the pre-osteoblast marker Runx2 can be detected, but its expression does not overlap with bglap:GFP expression in mature osteoblasts (Figure 2 —figure supplement 2B). Importantly, in newly regenerated segments that start to upregulate bglap expression, all bglap:GFP+ cells appear in the centre of the segments; we could not observe GFP+ cells within joints (Figure 2 —figure supplement 2A). This suggests that bglap:GFP+ osteoblasts from older segments do not migrate into less mature segments during formation of new segments in the course of fin growth. Rather, the mature osteoblast population in a segment is formed via differentiation of osteoblasts at the position within the segment where they were formed during segment formation. In contrast, within 2 days after fin amputation, bglap:GFP+ cells appeared in the fin stump within the joint between segment -1 and segment 0 (Figure 2D, yellow arrowhead), indicating that GFP+ osteoblasts from segment -1 crossed the joint during their migration towards the amputation plane. Thus, migration of mature osteoblasts observed after fin amputation or bone fracture (Geurtzen et al., 2014) appears to represent a specific early response to injury, while addition of new bony segments at the distal tip of growing fins during ontogeny or regeneration does not involve migration of differentiated osteoblasts.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Page 9, Line 1: The authors should move the bglap RNAscope in situ data to the main figure, as this is an important piece of information.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that these data were somewhat hidden in the Supplement, we have now moved them to the re-designed Figure 1B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Page 9, Line 6: I don't understand why reduced bglap mRNA can be interpreted as osteoblast dedifferentiation.</p></disp-quote><p>We define dedifferentiation as the reversion of a mature cell into an undifferentiated progenitor-like status. This involves the following characteristics: (1) the expression of markers of the differentiated state are downregulated; (2) early lineage markers are re-expressed; (3) the cells become proliferative; and (4) they have the ability to re-differentiate into mature cells. Based in this definition, the downregulation of an osteoblast-specific marker can be used as a read-out for osteoblast dedifferentiation. <italic>Bglap</italic> is an established marker for mature osteoblasts (Kaneto et al., 2016 doi.org/10.1186/s12881-016-0301-7¸ Yoshioka et al., 2021 doi: 10.1002/jbm4.10496; Kannan et al., 2020 doi: 10.1242/bio.053280; Sojan et al., 2022 doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2022.868805; Valenti et al., 2020 doi.org/10.3390/cells9081911). While we use downregulation of <italic>bglap</italic> expression as our main read-out for osteoblast dedifferentiation in our experimental interventions (actomyosin inhibition, retinoic acid treatment, complement inhibition), we have expanded our methods to characterize osteoblast dedifferentiation, and have re-arranged our manuscript to show these data in the beginning of the results.</p><p>Already in the previous version of the manuscript we have shown that endogenous <italic>bglap</italic> is strongly expressed in segment -2, (the segment that does not respond to fin amputation and thus represents the non-injured state), while it is downregulated in a graded manner in segment -1 and segment 0 (the segments where dedifferentiation happens). We have now moved this data to the re-designed Figure 1B. In addition to <italic>bglap</italic>, we can now show that <italic>entpd5,</italic> a gene required for bone mineralization, is strongly expressed in osteoblasts of segment -2, while it is massively downregulated in segment -1 and segment 0. These new data can be found in Figure 1C. Thus, <italic>entpd5</italic> is another differentiation marker whose loss characterizes osteoblast dedifferentiation. Importantly, we can confirm by RNAScope that the pre-osteoblast marker <italic>runx2a</italic> is absent in mature segments but is upregulated in segment 0 and segment -1 at 1 dpa (new data in Figure 1 —figure supplement 1A). Similarly, <italic>cyp26b1</italic>, an enzyme shown to regulate dedifferentiation, is upregulated in segment 0 and segment -1, but not expressed in segment -2. (new data in Figure 1 —figure supplement 1B). Furthermore, we have repeated all experiments where we have previously quantified dedifferentiation upon experimental interventions using downregulation of <italic>bglap</italic>:GFP (actomyosin inhibition, retinoic acid treatment, complement inhibition). We now can fully confirm the previous conclusions using the more rigorous quantification of dedifferentiation using RNAScope analysis of endogenous <italic>bglap</italic> levels. We have replaced all <italic>bglap</italic>:GFP data with the new <italic>bglap</italic> RNAScope data. These new data are found in Figure 3F, Figure 3 —figure supplement 1A, Figure 4B and Figure 5F.</p><p>Overall, we support our conclusion that osteoblasts dedifferentiate by the loss of the two differentiation markers <italic>bglap</italic> and <italic>entpd5</italic>, the upregulation of the pre-osteoblast marker <italic>runx2a</italic> and the dedifferentiation-associated gene <italic>cyp26b1</italic>, and the fact that osteoblasts become proliferative. We hope that the reviewer considers this sufficient evidence.</p><p>In mammals, the available literature relatively convincingly concludes that NF-κB signaling negatively regulates osteoblast differentiation (Yao et al., 2014, doi: 10.1002/jbmr.2108; Swarnkar et al., 2014 doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0091421, Chang et al., 2009, doi.org/10.1038/nm.1954). Yet in zebrafish osteoblasts, we have previously shown that NF-κB signaling is active in mature osteoblasts and needs to be downregulated for dedifferentiation to occur (Mishra et al., 2020, 10.1016/j.devcel.2019.11.016). Importantly, in our previous work we showed that at least during fin regeneration, NF-κB signalling is not involved in osteoblast differentiation (Mishra et al., 2020, 10.1016/j.devcel.2019.11.016). Specifically, osteoblasts in which Nf-kappaB signaling is enhanced or inhibited differentiate completely normally during the later stages of fin regeneration in the fin regenerate. Hence, our findings with the Nf-kappaB intervention studies done in this manuscript, where we look at osteoblasts in the stump within 1 dpa, cannot be explained by them affecting osteoblast differentiation.</p><p>For retinoic acid signalling, multiple roles in bone development and repair have been described in mammals. For zebrafish osteoblasts, it was shown that during the outgrowth phase of bone regeneration, retinoic acid negatively regulates osteoblast differentiation in the blastema (Blum &amp; Begemann, 2015, 10.1242/dev.120204). Yet importantly, it also negatively controls the dedifferentiation of osteoblasts in the stump right after amputation (Blum &amp; Begemann, 2015, 10.1242/dev.120204). Thus, the effect we observe at the early timepoints we analyse in our intervention studies (retinoic acid treatment) are due to the effect on osteoblast dedifferentiation.</p><p>We have added a short definition of dedifferentiation to the Results section (page 6). There it reads as follows:</p><p>“We have previously shown that osteoblasts dedifferentiate in response to fin amputation, that is they revert from a mature, non-proliferative state into an undifferentiated progenitor-like state, which includes loss of bglap expression and upregulation of the pre-osteoblast marker runx2 (Knopf et al., 2011; Geurtzen et al., 2014).”</p><p>In addition, we have restructured the results to describe our use of tools and the new data on page 6 of the revised manuscript as follows:</p><p>“Using RNAScope in situ hybridization, we can now show that downregulation of bglap occurs in a graded manner and that entpd5 expression is similarly downregulated during dedifferentiation (Figure 1B, C). At 1 day post amputation (1 dpa), expression of entpd5 and bglap remains high in segment -2, but gradually decreases towards the amputation plane and is almost entirely absent from segment 0, with entpd5 downregulation being more pronounced (Figure 1B, C). While RNA expression of these genes is downregulated within hours after injury, GFP or Kaede fluorescent proteins (FPs) expressed in bglap or entpd5 reporter transgenic lines persist for up to three days, even though transgene transcription is shut down rapidly as well (Knopf et al., 2011). We can confirm these earlier findings using the more sensitive RNAScope in situs. In bglap:GFP transgenics at 2 dpa, gfp RNA and GFP protein colocalized to the same cells in segment -2, where osteoblasts do not dedifferentiate (Figure 1D). In contrast, in the distal segment -1 GFP protein was present, but barely any gfp transcript could be detected (Figure 1D). Thus, persistence of FPs in reporter lines can be used for short-term tracing of dedifferentiated osteoblasts (Figure 1E). At 1 dpa, bglap:GFP+ cells upregulated expression of the pre-osteoblast marker runx2a and of cyp26b1, an enzyme involved in retinoic acid signalling (Blum and Begemann, 2015), which regulates dedifferentiation (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1A, B). Both markers were exclusively upregulated in segment -1 and segment 0 at 1 dpa, but were absent in segment -2. Together, these data show that osteoblasts in segment -1 and segment 0 lose expression of mature markers and gain expression of dedifferentiation markers.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Overall, the authors would need live–cell imaging and tracking to make these conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We have the following evidence for osteoblast migration:</p><p><italic>1) bglap</italic>:GFP+ cells relocate from the centre of segments towards the amputation plane (after fin amputations) or towards both injuries in the hemiray model.

However, we agree that its use as a readout for dedifferentiation is complicated and not straightforward.

There are established tools available to genetically interfere with NF-κB signalling, and we used such transgenic tools in our assays. NF-κB signalling can be inhibited by overexpression of the IkB super repressor (IkBSR) (Van Antwerp et al., 1996 doi: 10.1126/science.274.5288.787; Karra et al., 2015 DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1511209112.), while overexpression of a constitutively active IkB kinase (IKKca) results in overactivation of the pathway (Mishra et al., 2020 10.1016/j.devcel.2019.11.016). To specifically manipulate the pathway in osteoblasts, we employ the Cre-Lox system, using the established inducible line osx:CreER (Knopf et al., 2011, doi: 10.1016/j.devcel.2011.04.014). We have previously shown that such osteoblast-specific overexpression of IkBSR enhanced osteoblast dedifferentiation, while overexpression of IKKca impaired dedifferentiation (Mishra et al., 2020 10.1016/j.devcel.2019.11.016). Due to technical reasons, the assay to test the effect of the genetic interventions on dedifferentiation cannot be combined with the read-out for osteoblast cell shape.

If these two aspects were interdependent, one would expect the mitigation of one inevitably affecting the strength of the other.
