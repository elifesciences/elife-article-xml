force. However, the weak molecular tethers used for the membrane protein studies have limited the observation of long-time, repetitive molecular transitions due to force-induced bond breakage. The prolonged observation of numerous transitions is critical in reliable characterizations of structural states, kinetics, and energy barrier properties. Here, we present a robust single-molecule tweezer method that uses dibenzocyclooctyne cycloaddition and traptavidin binding, enabling the estimation of the folding ‘speed limit’ of helical membrane proteins. This method is &gt;100 times more stable than a conventional linkage system regarding the lifetime, allowing for the survival for ~12 hr at 50 pN and ~1000 pulling cycle experiments. By using this method, we were able to observe numerous structural transitions of a designer single-chained transmembrane homodimer for 9 hr at 12 pN and reveal its folding pathway including the hidden dynamics of helix-coil transitions. We characterized the energy barrier heights and folding times for the transitions using a model-independent deconvolution method and the hidden Markov modeling analysis, respectively. The Kramers rate framework yields a considerably low-speed limit of 21 ms for a helical hairpin formation in lipid bilayers, compared to μs scale for soluble protein folding. This large discrepancy is likely due to the highly viscous nature of lipid membranes, retarding the helix-helix interactions. Our results offer a more valid guideline for relating the kinetics and free energies of membrane protein folding.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>magnetic tweezers</kwd><kwd>dbco click chemistry</kwd><kwd>membrane protein</kwd><kwd>folding speed limit</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2020R1C1C1003937</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Min</surname><given-names>Duyoung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002613</institution-id><institution>Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1.190147.01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Min</surname><given-names>Duyoung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An exceedingly low speed limit was estimated for a helical hairpin formation by analyzing hours-long, incessant structural transitions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Single-molecule magnetic tweezers have emerged as a powerful tool for studying membrane proteins, providing valuable insights into their biogenesis, interactions with drugs, and the effects of chaperones on their folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hong et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Petrosyan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jefferson et al., 2018</xref>). Their extremely low spring constants allow for constant low-force measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). This advantage has made it possible to observe low-energy transmembrane (TM) helix interactions of helical membrane proteins within lipid bilayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choi et al., 2022</xref>). Rapid noncovalent tethering approach using digoxigenin (dig) and biotin is commonly used to attach target molecules to solid supports (beads or chamber surface; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bauer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Huang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Moessmer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Pandey et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zhao and Woodside, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Maciuba et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avellaneda et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gupta et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kostrz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jiao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Min et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">del Rio et al., 2009</xref>). However, the bound complexes dissociate at force ranges of tens of pN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Van Patten et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Janissen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schlingman et al., 2011</xref>). Especially, the dig-antidig binding has a short lifetime of ~1 s at 25 pN and ~0.1 s at 50 pN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Van Patten et al., 2018</xref>), limiting the stable performance of experiments. This poses a bottleneck in membrane protein studies using single-molecule tweezers.</p><p>Multiple biotins and digs have been used to improve the tethering of DNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kaczmarczyk et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berghuis et al., 2016</xref>). However, the tags are sparsely distributed in the DNA handles attached to a target DNA, with ~1 tag per every 14–20 bp. Thus, the detachment of one or more tags during experiments could interfere with small protein (un)folding signals of a few to tens of nm. Thiol- or amine-based covalent tethering approaches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Janissen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schlingman et al., 2011</xref> have limitations in studying proteins because the reactions can also attack native residues like cysteine and lysine, as well as the N-termini of proteins. Protein/peptide tags like HaloTag and SpyTag have also been used to covalently tether tandem repeat constructs to the solid supports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alonso-Caballero et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dahal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Popa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alonso-Caballero et al., 2021b</xref>). However, the methods can be restricted to specific proteins that are less vulnerable to aggregation. For example, the tandem repeat construct of maltose-binding protein has been used as a protein aggregation model to study the effects of chaperone proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mashaghi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bechtluft et al., 2007</xref>). Hence, these methods are unlikely to be applicable to membrane proteins, which are highly hydrophobic and prone to the aggregation.</p><p>Furthermore, in all covalent protein-tethering approaches, at least one end of a protein or its tandem repeat is attached to a solid support without using long molecular spacers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alonso-Caballero et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dahal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Popa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alonso-Caballero et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tapia-Rojo et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tapia-Rojo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Löf et al., 2019</xref>). This close proximity to the surface and/or between proteins of the tandem repeat can hinder membrane protein studies since lipid bilayer mimetics such as bicelles or vesicles of tens of nm or larger in diameter would not be accommodated properly in the narrow space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Min et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Min et al., 2015</xref>). On the other hand, single-molecule tweezers using long DNA handles flanking a protein of interest still rely on weak noncovalent tethers, such as the dig-antidig (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Moessmer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Pandey et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zhao and Woodside, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Maciuba et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avellaneda et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Here, we established highly stable membrane protein tweezers, which employ three orthogonal tethering strategies using dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO), traptavidin, and SpyTag. This tethering system has a lifetime of ~12 hr at 50 pN, a force level sufficient for most biomolecular interactions, covering up to 98% of surveyed protein folds. The system stability is over 100 times higher than the conventional dig/biotin system with a lifetime of only ~7 min at 45 pN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Janissen et al., 2014</xref>). The tethering strategies were tailored to membrane proteins, which differs from previous DBCO conjugation methods for DNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lin et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eeftens et al., 2015</xref>), which will be discussed in Results.</p><p>Using our tweezer method with an improved stability, we were able to observe the incessant structural changes of a 4TM-helix bundle protein for a prolonged 9 hr. This long-term observation of numerous transitions enabled us to map a folding energy landscape including the energy barriers (Δ<italic>G</italic><sup>†</sup>), using a deconvolution method independent of kinetic models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gebhardt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Woodside et al., 2006</xref>).

Using the two obtained parameters and the Kramers equation, we estimated the speed limits of structural transitions of the helical membrane protein in a lipid bilayer environment. Among three distinct transitions, the formation of a helical hairpin resulted in a significantly reduced speed limit by a factor of ~10<sup>4</sup>, compared to soluble proteins of similar size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kubelka et al., 2004</xref>). Since a helical hairpin is the minimal structural size for helical membrane proteins that require the tertiary folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Corin and Bowie, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Krainer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Engelman and Steitz, 1981</xref>), the estimate could be around the folding speed limit of helical membrane proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Assembly of our single-molecule tweezer system</title><p>Our tweezer approach, depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, involves a step-by-step procedure for single-molecule tethering, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.

However, these surface passivation methods may not be appropriate for membrane protein studies, as stable mechanical manipulations of single membrane proteins have been achieved using a much longer PEG with over 100 units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Min et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Min et al., 2015</xref>).

We conjugated scTMHC2 to 1024 bp long DNA handles at its N- and C-terminal ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Min et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The two DNA handles, with a total contour length of ~700 nm, provide ample space to accommodate a bicelle of tens of nm in diameter, which is a lipid bilayer disc wrapped in detergents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Min et al., 2018</xref>). It is crucial to reconstitute the lipid bilayer environment to maintain the native fold and stability of membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Min et al., 2015</xref>). The DNA handles also mitigate nonspecific interactions between the solid supports, including beads, and the target membrane protein. The possibility of protein aggregation is also eliminated by pulling a single protein with the DNA handles, rather than a tandem repeat of proteins.</p><p>We employed the SpyTag/SpyCatcher conjugation for the DNA handle attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Min et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zakeri et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The maleimide-modified DNA handle was first attached to a cysteine that was engineered in SpyCatcher. The SpyCatcher-labeled DNA handle was then attached to SpyTag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zakeri et al., 2012</xref>), which is a 13-residue peptide tag located at the protein ends. Once the SpyCatcher and SpyTag are bound, an isopeptide bond between the pair is spontaneously formed in 1–2 hr at 20–22°C. The other end of the handles was modified with either azide or dual biotins (2×biotin), allowing the molecular construct to be tethered to a magnetic bead and the chamber surface, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>).</p><p>Traptavidin with four biotin-binding pockets is attached at the 2×biotin-modified DNA handle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The traptavidin is a streptavidin variant with ~17-fold slower biotin dissociation (off-rate constant ratio: <italic>k</italic><sub>off,S</sub>/<italic>k</italic><sub>off,T</sub> = 16.7) and ~eightfold stronger biotin binding (dissociation constant ratio: <italic>K</italic><sub>d,S</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>d,T</sub> = 8.3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chivers et al., 2010</xref>), which can easily replace streptavidin variants typically used in single-molecule tweezers. We then tethered the traptavidin-attached construct to the chamber surface, which was passivated with a high concentration of biotinylated PEG (biotin-PEG) among methyl PEG (mPEG; ~1 biotin-PEG per 5×5 mPEG molecules; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; 10 min at 20–22°C). The high concentration and long polymer arm (~32 nm contour length) of the biotin-PEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ma et al., 2014</xref>) will likely enable the capture of all remaining biotin-binding pockets of the traptavidin.

This is likely because the hydrophobic tails of detergents/lipids may decrease the overall conjugation efficiency by interfering with the hydrophobic DBCO moiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Huynh et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, the best condition was in the absence of any detergents or lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; no detergents/lipids only during the conjugation step). This situation is possible because membrane proteins are sparsely tethered to the chamber surface, which kept them from aggregating. However, not using detergents/lipids means that the membrane proteins are definitely deformed from their native folds. Therefore, we sought an optimal solubilization condition for membrane proteins during the DBCO-azide conjugation step. Among various concentrations of diverse detergent/lipid molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>), we found that 0.05% (w/v) DDM detergent condition enabled the stable solubilization of membrane proteins along with the DBCO-mediated bead tethering (critical micelle concentration of DDM = ~0.01%).</p><p>The length of DNA handles also played a crucial role in the bead tethering. We failed in the tethering with short handles, typically less than 500 bp as used in single-molecule tweezers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Moessmer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kostrz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Min et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). This result may be due to the decreased radius-of-gyration of the short handles confined to the chamber surface, leading to reduced efficiency of the DBCO-azide conjugation in detergent/lipid solutions. Following a 1 hr incubation of the beads in the single-molecule chamber at 25°C, unconjugated beads were washed, and the detergent micelles were exchanged with bicelles to reconstitute the lipid bilayer environment for membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; 1 min at 20–22°C).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Mechanical pulling on biomolecules with opposing hydrophobicity</title><p>Our tweezer method with the strong molecular tethering allowed for repetitive mechanical pulling on the two test biomolecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>).

We surveyed 53 distinct proteins studied by optical/magnetic tweezers. For 98% of them, the most probable or average unfolding forces were measured to be less than 50 pN, regardless of their molecular weights and used force-loading rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). Since protein folding involves numerous noncovalent interactions, ranging from hundreds to thousands of inter-residue interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gromiha and Selvaraj, 2004</xref>), most biomolecular interactions could be studied below the 50 pN. Thus, the 50 pN was set as an upper bound for our robustness test. We measured the survival probability of our linkage system over time at the upper-bound force and estimated the mean lifetime until bead detachment to be 11.7±1.5 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). In contrast, the median lifetime of a conventional linkage system that uses 1 dig and 1 biotin is very short, around 7 min at 45 pN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Janissen et al., 2014</xref>). This result demonstrates that our system is at least 100 times more stable than the conventional system used in the previous membrane protein studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Robust single-molecule tweezers capable of 1000 pulling cycles</title><p>Our tweezer method can also perform a large number of unfolding cycles with a single membrane protein, up to a thousand times on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The measured variables for individual molecules, such as the unfolding force and step size, appear consistent over the thousand cycles within inherent stochastic nature of protein (un)folding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, the values are affected by the force calibration error due to variations in bead size (~3% in diameter; Methods). Thus, to effectively exclude the bead size effect, we averaged the values for different molecules tethered to different beads at each pulling cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We then tracked the level of mean forces/sizes to assess the measurement stability over the thousand cycles. The relative SD (RSD; defined as the ratio of the SD to the mean) was estimated to be 7.0 and 10.4% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, right), mainly reflecting the fluctuations from the stochastic barrier crossing. Nonetheless, the level of the mean values remained almost constant over the thousand times pulling (slope ~10<sup>–4</sup> pN[nm]/cycle; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref> for the DNA hairpin). This result demonstrates that our method is also stable over the large number of stretching experiments. A systematic trend between the unfolding force/size and the progress of pulling cycles may indicate a temporal alteration of the protein fold, such as protein aging effect via oxidative damage.

This approach eliminates the fluctuation noise of the bead and handles by iteratively deconvoluting the initial probability density of the measured extension (<italic>P</italic>[<italic>l</italic>]).

The <italic>U</italic><sub>c</sub> state is slightly more favorable than the <italic>U</italic><sub>h</sub> state (Δ<italic>G<sub>U</sub></italic><sub>c-</sub><italic><sub>U</sub></italic><sub>h</sub> = –1.7 <italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub><italic>T</italic>), although this force is ~6 pN lower than the ~18 pN force level of the helix-to-coil transition during the stretching experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This hysteresis effect arises likely because the first unfolding transition (<italic>N</italic>-to-<italic>I</italic><sub>1,2</sub>) is the rate-limiting step. Even though the force application of 12 pN lowers the energy barrier for this transition, the barrier (rate) is still highest (slowest) among all transitions (Δ<italic>G</italic><sup>†</sup><italic><sub>N</sub></italic><sub>-to-</sub><italic><sub>I</sub></italic>=7.8 <italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub><italic>T</italic> and <italic>τ<sub>N</sub></italic><sub>-to-</sub><italic><sub>I</sub></italic>=381 s).

Thus, in the stretching experiment where force is increased over time (1.4 pN/s at 12 pN), the force quickly exceeds 12 pN before the rate-limiting transition is driven. The final helix-to-coil transition follows at higher forces, resulting in the mechanical hysteresis.</p><p>While the random coil of the <italic>U</italic><sub>c</sub> state would be extracted out of the membrane as discussed in a previous section, the helical domains of the <italic>U</italic><sub>h</sub> state would penetrate into the membrane by an average of ~1.0 nm at 12 pN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>; Methods). This penetration covers approximately one third of the bicelle membrane core of ~3.0 nm thickness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Leite et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Giudice et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Murugova et al., 2022</xref>; Methods), similar to the so-called zigzag state defined in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choi et al., 2019</xref>), where a similar penetration depth of ~1.0 nm was estimated at 8 pN for GlpG. Given that the penetration depth varies depending on structural factors, such as the lengths of helices and linkers, our estimation is considered to be reasonable (see Methods). This estimation suggests that the helix-coil transitions likely accompany the insertion and extraction of TM helices in and out of the bicelle membrane.</p><p>The four helices connected by peptide linkers can undergo the transition independently, although we observed the cooperative transitions of all four helices. The transition of one part may energetically benefit adjacent parts for the same state by the geometrical perturbation of the accompanying insertion/extraction event (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). It is also possible that, due to a limited spatiotemporal resolution, we could not detect possible intermediate states during the transitions between the <italic>U</italic><sub>c</sub> and <italic>U</italic><sub>h</sub> states.</p><p>The folding pathway observed at 12 pN follows a strict progression from the <italic>U</italic><sub>c</sub> to <italic>U</italic><sub>h</sub> to <italic>I</italic><sub>1,2</sub> to <italic>N</italic> state, with no bypass of the middle <italic>U</italic><sub>h</sub> and <italic>I</italic><sub>1,2</sub> states. Thus, the <italic>U</italic><sub>h</sub> state evidently serves as the primed state for the first helix-helix association of the <italic>U</italic><sub>h</sub>-to-<italic>I</italic><sub>1,2</sub> transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The final <italic>I</italic><sub>1,2</sub>-to-<italic>N</italic> transition involves two events, i.e., the second helix-helix association and the dimerization of two helical hairpins. At 12 pN, two unassembled helices are separated by ~11 nm, whereas two helical hairpins that have not yet dimerized are very close with only ~1 nm by the intervening peptide linker. As a result, owing to the energetic penalty by the ~10 times greater distance, the helix-helix association is likely the rate-limiting step than the dimerization. Indeed, the energy barriers for the <italic>U</italic><sub>h</sub>-to-<italic>I</italic><sub>1,2</sub> and <italic>I</italic><sub>1,2</sub>-to-<italic>N</italic> transitions differ by only 0.5 <italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub><italic>T</italic>, which is less than the thermal energy level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p><p>At 12 pN, a helical hairpin is marginally stable (Δ<italic>G<sub>I</sub></italic><sub>-</sub><italic><sub>U</sub></italic><sub>h</sub> = –0.3 <italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub><italic>T</italic>), whereas the finally folded state (the dimerized state of two helical hairpins) is ~10 times more stable (Δ<italic>G<sub>N</sub></italic><sub>-</sub><italic><sub>I</sub></italic> = –3.2 <italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub><italic>T</italic>). This indicates that the formation of the other helical hairpin alone does not significantly contribute to the native fold stability. Instead, the final dimerization is likely the primary stabilizing step. This also reconciles the steep free energy slope down the small bump observed between the <italic>I</italic><sub>1,2</sub> and <italic>N</italic> states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), which may involve the final dimerization step.

Additionally, the deeper insertion of helices into the membrane at lower forces is effectively the rotation of already-inserted tilted helices toward the upright position. The helix rotation event also occurs at zero force, as the unassembled helices are tilted in a zigzag manner by the geometrical constraints at the intervening linkers. Thus, the force-induced rotation of helices within the membrane does not involve different kinds of transitions, which likely manifest as an elevation of energy barrier heights. However, this argument starts to break down as the soluble part on the membrane side opposite to the protein pulling side becomes dominant, which involves the transfer event between the membrane and water. In our case, the soluble portion is ~23% of the TM helical part in term of the number of amino acid residues. Therefore, the estimated <italic>τ<sub>ω</sub></italic> values for each transition would be valid at zero force within the error due to the transfer event.</p><p>Recently, Choi et al. measured the rate constants for helical hairpin formations in GlpG within bicelle membranes at low forces of 5–7 pN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choi et al., 2019</xref>).

A high-speed atomic force microscopy with ~1 μs temporal resolution observed μs-rapid (un)folding transitions between numerous intermediates for bacteriorhodopsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yu et al., 2017</xref>). However, the rapid transitions involve the coupled insertion and folding of a few amino acid residues from the fully unstructured polypeptide that is entirely exposed to an aqueous solution. Therefore, the μs time scales for the conformational changes are not relevant to the speed limit of membrane protein folding within lipid bilayers.</p><p>The significantly lower speed limits of the structural transitions arise likely from the high viscosity of lipid membranes. This hypothesis reconciles the previous studies on the speed limit of soluble protein folding based on the Kramers theory. In the limit of high solvent friction, the approximate linear viscosity dependency is also expected to hold for a more general Grote-Hynes theory, which incorporates time-dependent friction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dupuis et al., 2018</xref>). The high membrane viscosity may also be the microscopic origin for the prevalent mechanical hysteresis observed in membrane proteins – to drive the tardy transitions, you should apply higher forces for unfolding and lower forces for refolding.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kenton Swartz as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Heedeok Hong (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please, provide point-by-point responses to the issues raised by the reviewers and address the issues in the manuscript if necessary.</p><p>2) Reframing the uniqueness of the authors' approach by comparing it to the previous single-molecule tweezer studies that employ covalent tethers.</p><p>Reviewers 2 and 3 point out that there are multiple reports employing the covalent (including DBCO-azide click chemistry) and traptavidin-biotin x2 tethers to improve the stability of a pulling system (please, see the comments by Reviewer 2 and the references listed by Reviewer 3). I (Reviewing Editor) have an impression that the uniqueness of this work is to combine the covalent tethers with long DNA handles, which achieves a minimal interaction between solid support (including beads) and a target protein as well as a tight connection between them. The authors' approach would be particularly adequate for studying membrane proteins complexed with large amphiphilic assemblies.</p><p>I recommend that authors broaden the literature citation including the papers listed by Reviewer 3 and clarify the methodological uniqueness of this work compared to others. Currently, only Popa et al. are cited in this regard, and the papers using the DBCO-azide click chemistry are not cited. This could be achieved by modifying the first and second paragraphs in the Introduction and the contents in the Discussion.</p><p>3) Measuring the transition kinetics at a constant force.</p><p>This type of experiment is a hallmark of single-molecule force spectroscopic studies but is not presented in this work with the new tethers. Reviewer 3 strongly recommends this experiment as proof of principle. This is a suggestion, but not necessary. If authors decide to do so, I recommend showing a minimal amount of data and analysis. The result would make the paper more compelling.</p><p>4) Clarifying technical issues in the result and method sections.</p><p>Reviewer 3 brought up many technical questions (the use of a reference bead, the loading rate-force relationship, the calibration of force, the moving rate of beads vs the loading rate, the analysis of error propagation, etc.). I recommend that authors clarify these issues in Result or Methods, if appropriate.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this study, the authors have developed methods that allow for repeatedly unfolding and refolding a membrane protein using a magnetic tweezers setup. The goal is to extend the lifespan of the single-molecule construct and gather more data from the same tether under force. This is achieved through the use of a metal-free DBCO-azide click reaction that covalently attaches a DNA handle to a superparamagnetic bead, a traptavdin-dual biotin linkage that provides a strong connection between another DNA handle and the coverslip surface, and SpyTag-SpyCatcher association for covalent connection of the membrane protein to the two DNA handles.</p><p>The method may offer a long lifetime for single-molecule linkage; however, it does not represent a significant technological advancement. These reactions are commonly used in the field of single-molecule manipulation studies. The use of multiple tags including biotin and digoxygenin to enhance the connection's mechanical stability has already been explored in previous DNA mechanics studies by multiple research labs. Additionally, conducting single-molecule manipulation experiments on a single DNA or protein tether for an extended period of time (hours or even days) has been documented by several research groups. I recommend that the authors consider submitting their work to a specialized journal that focuses on methodology or experimental protocol.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– The authors mainly focus on the model membrane protein scTMH2, which is certainly an interesting system. However, they stress that their method also works for much more hydrophilic DNA and mention data for a DNA hairpin. These data, however, seem to not be shown anywhere. It would be nice to add them.</p><p>– The main improvement appears to be the more stable and robust tethering approach, compared to previous methods. However, the stability is hard to evaluate from the data provided. The much more common way to test stability in the tweezers is to report lifetimes at constant force(s). Also, there are actually previous methods that report on covalent attachment, even working using DBCO. These papers should be compared.

In light of this previous work, the statement in the abstract &quot;However, the weak molecular tethers used in the tweezers limit a long time, repetitive mechanical manipulation because of their force-induced bond breakage&quot; seems a little dubious. I do not doubt that there is a need for new and better attachment chemistries, but I think it is important to be clear about what has been done already.</p><p>– This is tangential to the current manuscript, but it has actually been demonstrated quite clearly by X-ray scattering that DDM micelles are not spherical (unlike what is often drawn, e.g. here in Figure 2D) but rather oblate ellipsoids. Similarly, bicelles are more mixed and micelle-like than what is drawn in Figure 2.</p><p>– Page 5, line 99: If the PEG layer prevents any sticking of beads, how do the authors attach reference beads, which are typically used in magnetic tweezers to subtract drift?</p><p>– Figure 3 left me somewhat puzzled. It appears to suggest that the &quot;no detergent/lipid&quot; condition actually works best, since it provides functional &quot;single-molecule conjugation&quot; for two different DBCO concentrations and two different DNA handles, unlike any other condition. But how can you have a membrane protein without any detergent or lipid? This seems hard to believe.</p><p>Figure 3 also seems to imply that the bicelle conditions never work. The schematic in Figure 1 is then fairly misleading since it implies that bicelles also work.</p><p>– When it comes to investigating the unfolding and refolding of scTMHC2, it would be nice to see some traces also at a constant force. As the authors state themselves: magnetic tweezers have the advantage that they &quot;enable constant low-force measurements&quot; (page 8, line 189). Why not use this advantage?</p><p>In particular, I would be curious to see constant force traces in the &quot;helix coil transition zone&quot;. Can steps in the unfolding landscape be identified? Are there intermediates?</p><p>– I liked the collection of references summarized in Figure 4D and the supplement. However, given that it is well known that the unfolding depends on loading rate, I am not sure how useful this analysis is to make the point that 50 pN is sufficient, in general, &quot;regardless of [...] loading rates&quot; (page 6, line 143). The authors say that the 50 pN upper limit is &quot;arbitrary&quot; (page 6, line 144). The fact is, one could always push for very high loading rates and exceed 50 pN. Note that I do not doubt that the presented attachment scheme is stable enough for a large range of very interesting measurements; in addition, if we want very high loading rates and forces, AFM is preferable anyhow. But I think this claim of generality is misleading.</p><p>– Speaking of loading rates and forces: How were the forces calibrated? This seems to not be discussed. And how were constant loading rates achieved? In Figure 4 it is stated that experiments are performed at &quot;different pulling speeds&quot;. How is this possible? In AFM (and OT) one controls position and measures force. In MT, however, you set the force and the bead position is not directly controlled, so how is a given pulling speed ensured?</p><p>It appears to me that the numbers indicated in Figures 4A and B are actually the speeds at which the magnets are moved. This is not &quot;pulling speed&quot; as it is usually defined in the AFM and OT literature. Even more confusing, moving the magnets at a constant speed, would NOT correspond to a constant loading rate (which seems to be suggested in Figure 4A), given that the relationship between magnet positions and force is non-linear (in fact, it is approximately exponential in the configuration shown schematically in Figure 1).</p><p>– Finally, when it comes to the analysis of errors, I am again puzzled. For the M270 beads used in this work, the bead-to-bead variation in force is about 10%. However, it will be constant for a given bead throughout the experiment. I would expect the apparent unfolding force to exhibit fluctuations from cycle to cycle for a given bead (due to its intrinsically stochastic nature), but also some systematic trends in a bead-to-bead comparison since the actual force will be different (by 10% standard deviation) for different beads. Unfortunately, the authors average this effect away, by averaging over beads for each cycle (Figure 4). To me, it makes much more sense to average over the 1000 cycles for each bead and then compare. Not surprisingly, they find a larger error &quot;with bead size error&quot; than without it (Figure 5A). However, this information could likely be used (and the error corrected), if they would only first analyze the beads separately.</p><p>What is the physical explanation of the first fast and then slow decay of the error (Figure 5B)? I would have expected the error for a given bead after N pulling cycles to decrease as 1/sqrt(N) since each cycle gives an independent measurement. Has this been tested?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Robust membrane protein tweezers reveal the folding speed limit of helical membrane proteins&quot; for further consideration by eLife.

I (Reviewing Editor) have an impression that the uniqueness of this work is to combine the covalent tethers with long DNA handles, which achieves a minimal interaction between solid support (including beads) and a target protein as well as a tight connection between them. The authors' approach would be particularly adequate for studying membrane proteins complexed with large amphiphilic assemblies.</p><p>I recommend that authors broaden the literature citation including the papers listed by Reviewer 3 and clarify the methodological uniqueness of this work compared to others.

The goal is to extend the lifespan of the single-molecule construct and gather more data from the same tether under force. This is achieved through the use of a metal-free DBCO-azide click reaction that covalently attaches a DNA handle to a superparamagnetic bead, a traptavdin-dual biotin linkage that provides a strong connection between another DNA handle and the coverslip surface, and SpyTag-SpyCatcher association for covalent connection of the membrane protein to the two DNA handles.</p><p>The method may offer a long lifetime for single-molecule linkage; however, it does not represent a significant technological advancement. These reactions are commonly used in the field of single-molecule manipulation studies. The use of multiple tags including biotin and digoxygenin to enhance the connection's mechanical stability has already been explored in previous DNA mechanics studies by multiple research labs. Additionally, conducting single-molecule manipulation experiments on a single DNA or protein tether for an extended period of time (hours or even days) has been documented by several research groups. I recommend that the authors consider submitting their work to a specialized journal that focuses on methodology or experimental protocol.</p></disp-quote><p>One of the unique features of our work is the development of a robust single-molecule tweezer method that is applicable to membrane proteins, rather than simply making another stable system. As re-written in Introduction, it is not straightforward as we have to consider the membrane reconstitution.

Similarly, bicelles are more mixed and micelle-like than what is drawn in Figure 2.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the comment regarding the micelles, which we have corrected by redrawing them accordingly. Thank you for bringing this to our attention.</p><p>We disagree about the bicelles as it is more complex than mentioned. Bicelles vary in size and shape depending on the ratio of lipid to detergent (known as q value), the structure of constituent lipid and detergent, total concentration of amphiphiles, and temperature (ref 1). According to the ref 1, the authors suggested from multiple experiment and simulation methods that the DMPC/DHPC bicelles (6 wt% amphiphile) with a q value below 1.0 deviated from the classic bicelles that contain lipids in the core and detergents in the rim. Thus, the comment is correct if we used the same bicelle condition.</p><p>However, we used different constituents and condition for bicelles – the DMPC/CHAPSO bicelles with q = 2.5 and ~1.4 wt% lipid. Morphological studies on DMPC/CHAPSO bicelles are relatively limited, compared to those on DMPC/DHPC bicelles. In a previous work (ref 2), the authors suggested from SANS experiments that the DMPC/CHAPSO bicelles with q = 3.0 and 0.25 wt% lipid would be the classic, bilayer-like bicelles. From a very recent work (ref 3), the authors suggested from SAXS and DLS experiments that the DMPC/CHAPS bicelles with 0.5 wt% lipid are likely the mixed micelles for a q &lt; 1, but the classic bicelles for a q &gt; 1. Additionally, in a previous single-molecule work that our development here bases on (ref 4), the unfolding of a membrane protein under a similar bicelle condition showed a homogeneous population, whereas the unfolding in DDM and CHAPSO micelles showed a highly heterogeneous population (see Supplementary Fig.5 of ref 4). This indicates that the bicelles used in our work are far from the micelles, at least regarding the membrane protein stabilization.</p><p>Therefore, although the conditions are not exactly same as that of our work, it is not unreasonable to draw bicelles in the conventional way of the bilayer-like discs for our bicelle condition.</p><p>ref (1) Caldwell et al., Low‑q Bicelles Are Mixed Micelles, JPCL, 9, 4469-4473 (2018)</p><p>ref (2) Li et al., Morphological Characterization of DMPC/CHAPSO Bicellar Mixtures: A Combined SANS and NMR Study, Langmuir, 29, 15943-15957 (2013)</p><p>ref (3) Giudice et al., Expanding the Toolbox for Bicelle-Forming Surfactant–Lipid Mixtures, Molecules, 27, 7628 (2022)</p><p>ref (4) Min et al., Mapping the energy landscape for second-stage folding of a single membrane protein, Nature Chemical Biology, 11, 981-987 (2015)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Page 5, line 99: If the PEG layer prevents any sticking of beads, how do the authors attach reference beads, which are typically used in magnetic tweezers to subtract drift?</p></disp-quote><p>The PEG layer consists of biotin-PEG and methyl-PEG at a 1:27.5 molar ratio.

It appears to suggest that the &quot;no detergent/lipid&quot; condition actually works best, since it provides functional &quot;single-molecule conjugation&quot; for two different DBCO concentrations and two different DNA handles, unlike any other condition.

This situation is possible because membrane proteins are sparsely tethered to the chamber surface, which kept them from aggregating.

However, given that it is well known that the unfolding depends on loading rate, I am not sure how useful this analysis is to make the point that 50 pN is sufficient, in general, &quot;regardless of [...] loading rates&quot; (page 6, line 143). The authors say that the 50 pN upper limit is &quot;arbitrary&quot; (page 6, line 144). The fact is, one could always push for very high loading rates and exceed 50 pN. Note that I do not doubt that the presented attachment scheme is stable enough for a large range of very interesting measurements; in addition, if we want very high loading rates and forces, AFM is preferable anyhow. But I think this claim of generality is misleading.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not intend to argue that “50 pN is sufficient, in general, regardless of loading rates&quot; nor “claim its generality”.

In Figure 4 it is stated that experiments are performed at &quot;different pulling speeds&quot;. How is this possible? In AFM (and OT) one controls position and measures force. In MT, however, you set the force and the bead position is not directly controlled, so how is a given pulling speed ensured?</p><p>It appears to me that the numbers indicated in Figures 4A and B are actually the speeds at which the magnets are moved. This is not &quot;pulling speed&quot; as it is usually defined in the AFM and OT literature. Even more confusing, moving the magnets at a constant speed, would NOT correspond to a constant loading rate (which seems to be suggested in Figure 4A), given that the relationship between magnet positions and force is non-linear (in fact, it is approximately exponential in the configuration shown schematically in Figure 1).</p></disp-quote><p>You are correct, so we simply modified the “pulling speed” to “magnet speed” in the figure caption.

We actually specified it in the caption as “average force-loading rate”. However, this can be misleading at a glance, so we just deleted all the loading-rate values in the figure and caption.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Finally, when it comes to the analysis of errors, I am again puzzled. For the M270 beads used in this work, the bead-to-bead variation in force is about 10%. However, it will be constant for a given bead throughout the experiment. I would expect the apparent unfolding force to exhibit fluctuations from cycle to cycle for a given bead (due to its intrinsically stochastic nature), but also some systematic trends in a bead-to-bead comparison since the actual force will be different (by 10% standard deviation) for different beads. Unfortunately, the authors average this effect away, by averaging over beads for each cycle (Figure 4). To me, it makes much more sense to average over the 1000 cycles for each bead and then compare. Not surprisingly, they find a larger error &quot;with bead size error&quot; than without it (Figure 5A). However, this information could likely be used (and the error corrected), if they would only first analyze the beads separately.</p></disp-quote><p>We might be wrong, but there seems to be a misunderstanding. First, we added Figure 5–figure supplement 1 where you can see individual traces. As expected, the levels of unfolding forces/sizes appear consistent during the progress of pulling cycles. Second, the advantage of averaging for different beads is that you can effectively remove the bead size effect. This “averaging-out” is the key strategy in our kinetic analysis. Based on the error estimation, if you average the values of kinetic parameters obtained from different beads, you can then estimate them with reasonably small errors despite the bead size variations. This becomes more evident after initial hundreds of pulling cycles. The errors for 200 and 1000 cycles are of only ~1% difference, indicating that you do not need to blindly run the pulling cycles. These results are based on the “averaging-out” strategy, which is the merit of our analysis. For more details, please see the section in the main text titled “Assessing statistical reliability of pulling-cycle experiments”, where relevant figures, figure supplements, and Method sections are referred.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is the physical explanation of the first fast and then slow decay of the error (Figure 5B)? I would have expected the error for a given bead after N pulling cycles to decrease as 1/sqrt(N) since each cycle gives an independent measurement. Has this been tested?</p></disp-quote><p>If the sampling was from one population (here, unfolding probability profile), the error would follow a 1/<inline-formula><mml:math id="sa2m2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msqrt><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:msqrt></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> decay as expected for the standard error. In our analysis, however, we estimated the expected “mean” errors, regardless of detailed shapes of the unfolding probability profiles. To this end, we sampled the data from different possible profiles (shown in Figure 5–figure supplement 5). We then averaged all the error plots to obtain the plot of the mean errors during progress of pulling cycles (black curve in Figure 5D). In this case, the plot does not have to follow the standard error curve represented by the factor 1/<inline-formula><mml:math id="sa2m3"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msqrt><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:msqrt></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>.</p><p>We tested this by fitting with the model function of <italic>y</italic> = <italic>A</italic>/<inline-formula><mml:math id="sa2m4"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msqrt><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:msqrt></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, for various lower limit of <italic>N</italic> = 10, 30, 50, 100, 300, and 500 in the regression analysis (Figure 5–figure supplement 6). The results of the reduced chi-square (χ<sup>2</sup>) used for a goodness-of-fit test (χ<sup>2</sup> = 1 for the best fit) indicates that the two-term exponential model (χ<sup>2</sup> = 1.60) shows a better fit than the reciprocal square root model (χ<sup>2</sup> = 2.30–6.01). The regression model adopted in our analysis is a phenomenological model that more properly describes the error decay curve. The trend of the first fast and then slow decay is not unusual because it is also expected for the reciprocal square root model – the plot 1/<inline-formula><mml:math id="sa2m5"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msqrt><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:msqrt></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> decays fast and then slowly, too (Figure 5–figure supplement 6).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the revision, the newly added experiment, measuring the transition kinetics at constant force as proof of concept, was carried out impressively for 9 continuous hours at 12 pN.

On page 12, line 15, we have added a new paragraph as follows:</p><p>“To this end, it is necessary to acquire a large amount of extension data during the transitions using a high temporal resolution. However, the temporal resolution of typical magnetic tweezers is inherently limited due to the camera-based method for the bead position tracking, which restricts the speed limit estimation. Our robust single-molecule method overcomes this limitation by conducting the prolonged observations of numerous transitions, resulting in the collection of abundant data points for each transition event. This experimental strategy would not be feasible with the previous magnetic tweezer method for membrane proteins, due to the less stable molecular tethering under applied forces.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
