neural circuits that track energy need, but how the activity of these circuits is altered in obesity remains poorly understood. Here we describe the in vivo dynamics of hunger-promoting AgRP neurons during the development of diet-induced obesity in mice. We show that high-fat diet attenuates the response of AgRP neurons to an array of nutritionally-relevant stimuli including food cues, intragastric nutrients, cholecystokinin and ghrelin. These alterations are specific to dietary fat but not carbohydrate or protein. Subsequent weight loss restores the responsiveness of AgRP neurons to exterosensory cues but fails to rescue their sensitivity to gastrointestinal hormones or nutrients. These findings reveal that obesity triggers broad dysregulation of hypothalamic hunger neurons that is incompletely reversed by weight loss and may contribute to the difficulty of maintaining a reduced weight.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>homeostasis</kwd><kwd>hypothalamus</kwd><kwd>hunger</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK106399</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Knight</surname><given-names>Zachary A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS094781</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Knight</surname><given-names>Zachary A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP2DK021153</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Knight</surname><given-names>Zachary A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Knight</surname><given-names>Zachary A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000041</institution-id><institution>American Diabetes Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Pathway Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Knight</surname><given-names>Zachary A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100003194</institution-id><institution>New York Stem Cell Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Robertson Investigator Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Knight</surname><given-names>Zachary A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001447</institution-id><institution>Rita Allen Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Scholar Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Knight</surname><given-names>Zachary A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K08DK118188</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beutler</surname><given-names>Lisa R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 DK063720</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beutler</surname><given-names>Lisa R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund10"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005270</institution-id><institution>McKnight Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Knight</surname><given-names>Zachary A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund11"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

Key components of this system are specialized neurons in the hypothalamus that monitor internal state, but how obesity alters these circuits remains poorly understood.</p><p>Among the cell types involved in body weight regulation, AgRP neurons are particularly important. These neurons are located in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and are activated by food deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hahn et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mandelblat-Cerf et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Takahashi and Cone, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">van den Top et al., 2004</xref>). Stimulation of AgRP neurons drives voracious feeding and recapitulates the motivational, affective and sensory hallmarks of hunger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aponte et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krashes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Livneh et al., 2017</xref>). Conversely, silencing or ablating AgRP neurons causes aphagia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gropp et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krashes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Luquet et al., 2005</xref>). Thus AgRP neurons link the need for energy to the desire to eat.</p><p>AgRP neurons are regulated by layers of nutritional signals that operate on different time scales. Leptin, which is secreted from adipose tissue in proportion to body fat reserves, influences AgRP neuron activity over the long term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beutler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Coleman, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cowley et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pinto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Seeley et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">van den Top et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vong et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 1994</xref>). On shorter timescales, AgRP neurons receive two rapid signals that report on impending or recent food consumption. The first is triggered by the sensory detection of food in the environment and functions to inhibit AgRP neurons within seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Betley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mandelblat-Cerf et al., 2015</xref>). The magnitude of this rapid sensory inhibition predicts the quantity of imminent food intake. Infusion of nutrients directly into the stomach bypasses this sensory response and reveals additional signals that arise from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beutler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Su et al., 2017</xref>). These are trigged by the detection of calories or the activation of mechanoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai et al., 2019</xref>) and inhibit AgRP neurons over minutes as nutrients are infused. Thus AgRP neurons integrate multiple signals, arising from different tissues, in order to estimate the bodyâs energy needs.</p><p>A critical unanswered question regards how obesity alters AgRP neuron activity in response to these diverse signals. It is thought that diet-induced obesityÂ renders AgRP neurons resistant to the effects of leptin, based in part on the fact that exogenous leptin fails to reduce food intake or induce pSTAT3 in obese animals and does not inhibit AgRP neurons in ex vivo preparations from obese animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bates et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baver et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Enriori et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Knight et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wei et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, nothing is known about how diet-inducedÂ obesity alters the response of AgRP neurons to sensory cues signaling food availability or their modulation by gastrointestinal nutrients during a meal. These aspects of AgRP neuron regulation cannot be probed using ex vivo methods, such as immunohistochemistry or slice physiology, due to their rapid timescale, inhibitory nature, and because the pathways for gut-brain communication are disrupted in a brain slice.</p><p>To address this basic question, we set out to monitor and manipulate the activity of AgRP neurons in vivo in mice during the development of obesity induced by a high-fat dietÂ (HFD). We have further tracked how these responses change during weight loss. We show that diet-induced obesity attenuates neural and behavioral responses to multiple nutritional stimuli including food presentation, hormone administration and intragastric (IG) nutrient delivery. These changes are nutrient-specific, with blunted AgRP neuron responses to fat but not glucose or protein. Moreover, while the AgRP neuron response to the sensory detection of food is rescued with the onset of weight loss, neural responses to gastrointestinal stimuli are not. This combination of changes represents a neural correlate for the long-lasting effects of obesity on the energy homeostasis system.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Diet-induced obesity attenuates the AgRP neuron response to the sensory detection of food</title><p>We set out to characterize how the regulation of AgRP neurons is modulated by diet-inducedÂ obesity and subsequent weight loss.

This reduction in caloric intake was not due solely to the lower palatability of chow, because DIO mice that were fasted and then allowed to re-feed with HFD also showed a reduction in consumption of HFD when compared either to lean controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>) or their own HFD consumption prior to obesity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This reduction in HFD consumption by DIO animals was also not due to sensory-specific satiety or a learned aversion, because when fasted DIO animals were presented with chocolate, a novel palatable food, their food intake remained significantly attenuated (control-chocolate 1.36 kcal vs DIO-chocolate 0.36 kcal, p&lt;0.001).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Diet-induced obesity reversibly attenuates fasting induced re-feeding.</title><p>(<bold>AâD</bold>) Animals were maintained on either a chow diet throughout the entire experiment (lean controls, <bold>A and C</bold>) or exposed to high-fat diet for 6 weeks before being returned to chow diet for an additional 4 weeks (DIO mice, <bold>B and D</bold>).

However this dietary switch completely restored the consumption of chow and HFD in formerly DIO mice following an overnight fast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and D</xref>). Strikingly, these behavioral responses to weight gain and loss mirrored the changes in AgRP neuron responses to food during this time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This reveals that HFD exposure inhibits fasting-induced hyperphagia, which is then rapidly restored following weight loss, and that the anticipatory dynamics of AgRP neurons track these behavioral fluctuations.</p><p>To further investigate potential metabolic mechanisms underlying blunted fasting-induced hyperphagia in obese mice, we placed wild type mice on a HFD for four weeks while maintaining control mice on a normal chow diet. These DIO animals exhibited attenuated fasting-induced re-feeding when presented with chow or HFD despite limited weight gain over this short time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1AâD</xref>). As expected, plasma leptin was significantly elevated in DIO animals, but fasting insulin levels were not elevated relative to lean controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1E and F</xref>).

Thus, hyperleptinemia is correlated with decreased fasting-induced hyperphagia in mice early in DIO.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Obesity alters the ability of AgRP neurons to drive food consumption</title><p>AgRP neuron activity is required for food deprivation to trigger compensatory re-feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Denis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). We therefore investigated whether the decreased fasting-induced re-feeding we observe in obese mice might be due to a change in the ability of AgRP neurons to drive food intake.</p><p>We equipped mice for optogenetic stimulation of AgRP neurons and then tested them, before and after the development of obesity, using two complementary stimulation protocols. In the first protocol (âpre-stimulationâ), AgRP neurons were stimulated for 30 min immediately prior to food availability, and then mice were given food and allowed to eat in the absence of continued stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). This protocol is designed to mimic the natural dynamics of AgRP neurons, in which these neurons are active in hungry mice but shut off immediately before food consumption. In the second paradigm (âconcurrent stimulationâ), mice were given food and AgRP neurons were concurrently stimulated for 30 min while mice ate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This stronger stimulation protocol has been shown to drive feeding behavior to a greater extent than natural hunger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Burnett et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>We first tested lean animals at baseline. As expected, we found that concurrent or pre-stimulation of AgRP neurons caused fed mice to eat more low-fat pellets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, baseline) or HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, baseline), and the amount of food consumed was similar between the two protocols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>, baseline). In the fasted state, pre-stimulation did not increase the consumption of either diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>, baseline), whereas concurrent stimulation caused a small increase in the consumption of low-fat pellets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, baseline) but not HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, baseline). This result is consistent with the notion that AgRP neurons are already highly active in fasted, lean mice, and therefore that optogenetic stimulation has little additional effect.</p><p>Animals were then placed on a HFD to induce weight gain and, four weeks later, the tests above were repeated. Consistent with our data from a separate cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), we found that, in the absence of optogenetic stimulation, diet-induced obesity greatly reduced the amount of food the mice consumed during the behavioral tests. For example, diet-induced obesity blunted the hyperphagia in response to presentation of HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, no stim, baseline versus DIO) as well as the hyperphagia induced by fasting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref> no stim, baseline versus DIO). Importantly, we found that optogenetic stimulation of AgRP neurons could rescue this decreased feeding in DIO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3BâE</xref>, DIO). This suggests AgRP neurons are not fully activated by fasting in DIO animals, and that optogenetic stimulation supplies this missing activation.</p><p>In obese mice, we found that concurrent stimulation induced a bigger effect on food intake than pre-stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C,E</xref>, DIO), whereas in lean animals the effect of these two stimulation protocols was indistinguishable in every test performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3BâE</xref>, baseline). One interpretation of this result is that diet-induced obesity reduces the sensitivity of the downstream circuitry to AgRP neuron activity, such that supraphysiologic stimulation (i.e. concurrent stimulation) is now required to fully drive feeding. This suggests that HFD causes dysregulation of both AgRP neurons and their downstream targets.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Obesity selectively reduces the AgRP neuron response to intragastric fat</title><p>AgRP neurons are regulated not only by the sensory detection of food but also by ingested nutrients.

Subsequent weight loss did not restore the responsiveness of AgRP neurons in DIO mice to ghrelin, similar to observations with CCK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5HâL</xref>).

This revealed that diet-induced obesity blunts the inhibition of AgRP neurons by intragastric fat but has no effect on the response to intragastric sugar or protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Ingestion of fat is communicated to AgRP neurons in part through CCK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beutler et al., 2017</xref>) and, consistent with this, we found that obesity also desensitizes AgRP neurons to peripheral CCK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5AâF</xref>). Remarkably, this resistance to dietary fat and CCK persisted after mice had been returned to a low-fat diet and lost weight, which normalized their feeding behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and D</xref>) and neural responses to food cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and JâL</xref>). This identifies a gastrointestinal fatâCCKâAgRP neuron pathway that is selectively and persistently impaired by HFD. Impairment of this pathway may contribute to the ability of dietary fat to drive obesity in mice and raises the possibility that diets with different macronutrient compositions may modulate homeostatic circuits in distinct ways.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>High-fat diet alters hunger circuit dynamics in ways predicted to both promote and suppress obesity</title><p>A fundamental question is whether diet-induced obesity is caused by the dysregulation of homeostatic circuits, or alternatively whether it occurs despite the action of those circuits to resist weight gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ottaway et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Timper and BrÃ¼ning, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Velloso and Schwartz, 2011</xref>). By monitoring AgRP neurons in vivo during weight gain and loss, the experiments described here provide new insight into this question.</p><p>Overall, we find that HFD triggers changes in AgRP neuron regulation that would be predicted to both promote and suppress obesity. Among the former is the finding that obesity renders AgRP neurons desensitized to intragastric fat and CCK. This change would create a positive feedback loop whereby over-ingestion of fat would reduce the ability of subsequent fat intake to attenuate feeding, thereby promoting weight gain. How exactly information about gastrointestinal fat is relayed to AgRP neurons, and where in the pathway from the gut to the hypothalamus resistance to CCK develops, remain unknown. However, plausible candidate mechanisms include desensitization of CCK-responsive vagal afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Daly et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grabauskas et al., 2019</xref>) and brain stem neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Covasa et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wall et al., 2019</xref>) as well as changes in lipid-induced CCK release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kentish and Page, 2015</xref>).</p><p>We also found that obesity blunts the rapid inhibition of AgRP neurons that occurs when hungry mice see and smell food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). While the function of this rapid sensory inhibition of AgRP neurons remains unresolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen and Knight, 2016</xref>), its magnitude correlates with the amount of food subsequently consumed; that is, the more AgRP neurons are inhibited when food is presented, the more food the mouse consumes in the ensuing meal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beutler et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with this, we found that the diminished inhibition of AgRP neurons by food presentation in obese mice was associated with less subsequent food consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and D</xref>). After return to a low-fat diet and weight loss, the sensory response to chow was restored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) as was chow intake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This indicates that the prediction of food intake that is relayed to AgRP neurons reliably anticipates how weight gain and loss will alter feeding behavior.</p><p>We also identified changes in AgRP circuit dynamics that would be predicted to suppress weight gain. Most notably we found that obesity blunted the activation of AgRP neurons by the appetite promoting hormone ghrelin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5GâL</xref>). This finding is consistent with prior work showing that AgRP neurons from obese mice are resistant to activation by ghrelin in slice and that obese mice show reduced Fos in the arcuate nucleus and eat less food following peripheral ghrelin injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Briggs et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Briggs et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Perreault et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, our finding that AgRP neurons become resistant to both ghrelin and CCK, along with substantial prior evidence of leptin resistance in obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Myers et al., 2010</xref>), suggests that AgRP neurons may become generally resistant to hormonal input following weight gain. It will be important to investigate whether there is a common mechanism by which AgRP neurons become desensitized to these diverse signals, and whether this change is adaptive or deleterious.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Diet-induced obesity alters the behavioral response to AgRP neuron stimulation</title><p>To understand the functional significance of these changes in AgRP neuron dynamics, we also measured the behavioral response to optogenetic manipulation of AgRP neurons before and after the development of obesity. The most prominent effect we observed was that optogenetic stimulation was able to partially rescue the deficit in food consumption of obese mice following an overnight fast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>). This indicates that downstream circuits retain the ability to respond to AgRP neuron stimulation in obese mice. It also suggests that the reason why obese mice show diminished fasting-induced re-feeding may be that AgRP neurons are not fully activated by food deprivation in these animals (and that optogenetic stimulation supplies this missing activation). This interpretation is consistent with prior data showing DIOÂ mice have reduced arcuate Fos in response to fasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Briggs et al., 2011</xref>) and an inability to respond to ghrelin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5GâL and O,P</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Briggs et al., 2010</xref>). It is also consistent with the tendency of elevated leptin levels in obese mice to suppress the activation of AgRP neurons by fasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Becskei et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>While these observations point to a primary defect in AgRP neuron activation, our findings also suggest that downstream circuits may have reduced sensitivity to AgRP neuron stimulation in obese animals. For example, we found that concurrent stimulation had a stronger effect on food intake than pre-stimulation in DIO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C,E</xref>) whereas there was no difference between these two protocols in lean animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3BâE</xref>). Given that concurrent stimulation causes stronger activation of this circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Burnett et al., 2019</xref>), this suggests that greater AgRP neuron activity is required to drive food intake in obese mice. This observation is also consistent with the possibility that NPY signaling, which is necessary for food intake in response to pre- but not concurrent stimulation, is attenuated in DIO animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beck, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stricker-Krongrad et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stricker-Krongrad et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>One limitation of these findings is that fiber photometry cannot measure absolute firing rates. Thus, we have described how obesity changes the response of AgRP neurons to food cues, nutrients infusions, and hormone injections, but we cannot measure how the tonic activity of AgRP neurons changes over time. Slice electrophysiology studies have suggested that the activity of AgRP neurons may be elevated in obese animals and then resistant to further increases caused by fasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baver et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wei et al., 2015</xref>). This could be tested by using extracellular recordings to record spiking activity in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mandelblat-Cerf et al., 2015</xref>). Another important question not addressed here is whether there is heterogeneity in AgRP neuron responses to diet-induced obesity. Such heterogeneity could be investigated using single-cell calcium imaging or electrophysiology.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Dietary history has persistent effects on feeding circuit dynamics</title><p>One reason why obesity is such a challenging clinical problem is that patients experience great difficulty maintaining weight loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fothergill et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leibel et al., 2015</xref>). To explain this, it has been suggested that obesity may alter the body weight set point, such that the energy homeostasis system comes to defend a new, heavier body weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Leibel et al., 1995</xref>). In mice, diet-induced obesity can be reversed by restricting animalsâ caloric intake, but these formerly obese animals remain sensitized to accelerated weight gain when returned to ad libitum chow or HFD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Briggs et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schmitz et al., 2016</xref>). This recidivism has been associated with a variety of physiologic mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Friedman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ravussin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zigman et al., 2016</xref>), but a core idea is that homeostatic circuits are altered by obesity in a way that persists after weight loss and promotes weight re-gain.</p><p>In this study, we set out to look for evidence of such hysteresis in the dynamics of AgRP neurons. We found that that exposure to HFD can impair to neural responses to nutrients and hormones in a way that would be predicted to promote weight gain, and that this impairment persists for weeks after mice have been returned to a low-fat diet and lost weight. This reveals that dietary history can have long-lasting effects on the dynamics of the neural circuits that control hunger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Matikainen-Ankney and Kravitz, 2018</xref>). An important task for the future will be to clarify the molecular basis of this diet-induced resistance of AgRP neurons to gastrointestinal hormones and nutrients, since this may suggest novel strategies for treating obesity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>Wildtype</td><td>Jackson Labs</td><td>Stock No:000664</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>AgRP-Cre</td><td>Jackson Labs</td><td>Stock No:012899</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>ROSA26-loxStoplox-ChR2-eYFP</td><td>Jackson Labs</td><td>Stock No:012569</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (adeno-associated virus-1)</td><td>AAV1.CAG.Flex.GCaMP6s</td><td>Addgene</td><td>ID:100842</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>CCK</td><td>Bachem</td><td>Product No:4033010.0001</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>Ghrelin</td><td>R and D Systems</td><td>Catalog #:1465/1</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Leptin ELISA</td><td>Crystal Chem</td><td>Catalog #:90030</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Insulin ELISA</td><td>Crystal Chem</td><td>Catalog #:90080</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>âhigh-fat diet; HFDâ</td><td>Research Diets</td><td>Diet Formula:D12492</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>âlow-fat pellets; food pelletsâ</td><td>Bio-Serv</td><td>Product #:F0163</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>MATLAB</td><td>MathWorks</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Prism</td><td>GraphPad</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002798">SCR_002798</ext-link></td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Experimental protocols were approved by the University of California, San Francisco IACUC following the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Protocol# AN179674).

Catheters were constructed by attaching 8 cm of Silastic tubing (508â003, Silastic) and 8 cm Tygon tubing (Tygon, AAD04119) to opposite ends of a curved metal connector (NE-9019, Component Supply Company, Sparta, TN). A 1 cm circle of biologically compatible mesh (gifted by Raul Lazaro) was attached to the silastic tubing 2.3â2.8 cm distal to the edge of the metal connector using adhesive (Xiameter RTV-3110 base and Dow Corning four catalyst). A 1 cm by 1.5 cm oval of felt was affixed to the silastic tubing at the distal edge of the curve in the connector and a 0.5 cm by 1 cm strip of felt was affixed around the metal connector on the proximal edge of its curve.

A midline abdominal skin incision about 1.5 cm was made extending from the xyphoid process caudally and the skin was dissected from the subcutaneous tissue toward the left flank to complete a subcutaneous tunnel between the two incisions. A hemostat was used to pull the sterilized catheter through the tunnel. The linea alba was incised and the abdominal cavity entered. A small incision was made in the left lateral abdominal wall through which the intragastric catheter was passed into the abdominal cavity. The stomach was externalized and a small puncture made using a jewelerâs forceps. The tip of the cathether was immediately placed into the puncture site and sutured into place using the felt circle with polypropylene suture. Saline injection into catheter confirmed absence of leakage. The stomach was placed back in the abdominal cavity, which was washed with sterile saline. The abdominal muscle was sutured and the skin incision closed in two layers. Next, the catheter was secured at its interscapular site with sutures into the felt oval and surrounding muscle. Finally, the interscapular skin incision was closed.

A 473 nm laser diode (Omicron Luxx) was used as the excitation source. This was placed upstream of an optical chopper (MC2000, Thorlabs, Newton, NJ) that was run at 400 Hz. TheÂ laser was then split with aÂ beam splitter (CM1BS013, Thorlabs) and the slit laser beams each reflected off two kinetic mirrors (BB1-E02, KM100, Thorlabs) to allow adjustment of theÂ light path. Each laser beam was passed through a GFP excitation filter (MF469-35, Thorlabs), reflected by a dichroic mirror (FF495-Di03â25 Ã 36, Semrock, Rochester, NY) and coupled through a fiber collimation package (F240FC-A, Thorlabs) into a commercially available patchcord (MFP_400/460/1100â0.48_2 m_FCM-MF2.5 or MFP_400/430/1100â0.48_2 m_FCM-MF2.5, Doric Lenses). Patchcords were not changed within experiments. The patchcords were then linked to fiberoptic implants through bronze sleeves (SLEEVE_BR_2.5, Doric Lenses).

Chow (control animals) or HFD (DIO animals) intake was monitored at 120 min after injection. Order of doses was varied among the cohorts.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Plasma hormone studies</title><p>Wildtype mice were given access to ad libitum chow or HFD in their home-cage for 4 weeks, then fasted overnight before blood collection via submandibular venipuncture into EDTA-coated tubes for plasma separation. ELISA assays for plasma leptin (90030, Crystal Chem) and insulin (90080, Crystal Chem) were performed according to the manufacturerâs instructions. For the leptin assay, all samples were diluted 1:5 to ensure all measurements remained within the standard range.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><sec id="s4-12-1"><title>Photometry analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed using a custom MATLAB script as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beutler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). For intragastric infusion and IP hormone injection experiments, background fluorescence was corrected by subtracting the photometry signal in the absence of mice from total signal. Data were then low-pass filtered at 0.5 Hz due to their slow and sustained change in response to stimuli and down sampled to 10 Hz. For peri-stimulus time plots the median value of data points in a 2 min window flanking the â5 min time point before each treatment was used as the normalization factor (F0) to calculate ÎF(t)/F0 = (F(t)-F0)/F0. To calculate the change of fluorescent signal at indicated time points after treatment, all data points F(t) over the indicated time range were averaged as Fa to estimate ÎFa/F0 = (Fa-F0)/F0.</p><p>For all experiments correction for photobleaching was not necessary due to the low laser power used during photometry recordings (0.07 mW), the short time windows for experiments (around 60 min), and the fact that all experimental groups had control groups treated with identical laser powers. In addition, correction for photobleaching could easily cause over-correction due to the slow and sustained effect in our experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12-2"><title>Behavior data analysis</title><p>Optogenetics experiments in which mice were fed pellets were analyzed using a custom MATLAB script. Consumption of each pellet was defined as the first pellet removal event after each food pellet delivery. Total food consumption was estimated by subtracting the pellets found dropped after each experiment from the total number of food removal events.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Fiber photometry data were subjected to analysis as described above. For traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, and associated figure supplements, ÎF/F(%) represents the mean ÎF(t)/F0<sup>â</sup>100.

The effects of fasting, CCK and ghrelin on feeding in lean control and DIO animals were analyzed using one-way, repeated-measures ANOVA. The effect of DIO on chocolate consumption, fast re-feeding and the effects of DIO on plasma leptin and insulin levels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref> were analyzed using an unpaired T-test. The Holm-Sidak multiple comparisons test was used in conjunction with ANOVA. Linear regression analysis was used to examine correlation between weight change and changes in neuronal activity or between food intake during fast re-feeding and plasma hormone level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). All statistical analysis was performed using Prism. Numbers of animals (biological replicates) used in each experiment are included in the figure legends. Where multiple trials of the same experiment were performed, these technical replicates were averaged and then treated as a single replicate.</p><p>Significance was defined as p&lt;0.05 and is indicated on figures and in figure legends.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>LRB is supported by NIH grants K08DK118188 and P30 DK063720.

(If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Beutler and colleagues describe results from a series of studies investigating the effects of diet-induced obesity on the responses of AgRP neurons to a number of physiological stimuli including intragastric infusions and the hormones ghrelin and CCK. The manuscript describes real-time activity of AgRP neurons in response to exterosensory cues, intragastric-infused nutrients and peripheral-injected hormones, suggesting that diet-induced obesity blunts AgRP neuron response to food cues, selectively to intragastric fat and injection of CCK and ghrelin. Further, activation on AgRP neurons using two different stimulation protocols and found that fast-induced activation is attenuated by obesity, which was rescued by the opto-stimulation. Overall the studies are well described, provide novel information and are potentially of wide interest.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>A question arises regarding data demonstrating that DIO exposure inhibits fasting induced hyperphagia, and that the anticipatory dynamics of AgRP neurons track these behavioral fluctuations. While the anticipatory dynamics appear to mostly (not in Figure 1I) correlate with changes in feeding, it's unclear if this activity change is required for the differing feeding patterns. In the current study, the authors demonstrate that DIO blunts the suppression of ÎF/F in AgRP neurons of mice presented with either chow or HFD (Figure 1). This implies the neurons are less inhibited in response to anticipatory cues after DIO. This increased activity appears further supported by slice work showing that NPY neurons are activated in DIO (Baver et al., 2014, Wei et al., 2015). If AgRP neurons are more active in DIO and after food presentation (as observed by the blunting of the ÎF/F), then one may predict DIO mice to increase feeding. However, in Figure 2B and D the authors show that DIO mice have a blunted chow or HFD food intake after an overnight fast (which is similar to previous reports). Therefore, it's unclear if the anticipatory dynamic activity state of AgRP neurons is required for the feeding behavior. A dissociation of this activity with feeding is further supported with the data presented in Figure 1I and Figure 2D. Specifically, while the ÎF/F remains blunted to anticipatory cues in the DIO group after 4 weeks on chow (Figure 1I), however this group returns to the food intake levels observed at baseline (Figure 2D). Possibly an explanation lies in work showing that the fasting induced activation of NPY neurons is blunted in DIO mice (Baver et al). However these data are likely separate from anticipatory/sensory dynamics, which could question the role of the anticipatory dynamics in the feeding response. This topic could be better addressed/explained/detailed more in the manuscript. How do these dynamics link to feeding behavior? How are these dynamics similar/different to gastrointestinal/hormonal/nutrient cues?</p><p>Similarly, what is the baseline control for DIO? Are these mice fed HFD for any period of time or are they fed chow for baseline and then switched to HFD afterward? If the baseline group is on HFD, how long were they fed HFD and considered baseline? This is important given there is considerable variability in the baseline groups in several panels possibly contributing to the perceived changes (e.g. Figure 1G-I; Figure 3; Figure 4E-G; Figure 5A-C; Figure 5E-G; Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A-D). What accounts for this variability? The significance or lack of significance for Figures 4G, 5C, and possibly others appear to have benefited from this variability. Similar to the previous point; statistical comparisons should be made within and across groups at different times to assess these changes.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript is somewhat incremental. An exception is the fact that some of the attenuated responses to nutrients/food cues are long lasting after reintroduction of LFD for few weeks. A pair-fed control group would be critical to investigate the extent to which is the diet, and not the obesity itself, that causes the phenotypes described. Quantification of fat mass (and not only body weight) and other metabolic parameters related to DIO are important. The manuscript falls short in their analysis of the different components of DIO that can be contributing to the observed phenotypes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55909.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>A question arises regarding data demonstrating that DIO exposure inhibits fasting induced hyperphagia, and that the anticipatory dynamics of AgRP neurons track these behavioral fluctuations.

The reviewer notes that this does not explain why DIO mice eat less food after fasting (they would be predicted to eat more). We agree. The sensory inhibition of AgRP neurons is correlated with subsequent food intake but does not cause that food intake.</p><p>It is important to emphasize that the paradoxical inhibition of AgRP neurons by sensory cues is observed in both lean and obese animals (Beutler et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2015) and its function is unresolved. We note this in the text (subsection âHigh-fat diet alters hunger circuit dynamics in ways predicted to both promote and suppress obesityâ, third paragraph) and cite a review article we have written that discusses various hypotheses about the function of this response (Chen and Knight, 2016).</p><p>In the revised text, we have also included a citation of slice electrophysiology studies showing that AgRP neurons are more active in DIO mice as well as an extended discussion of some of the limitations of photometry, including the inability to determine absolute activity levels (subsection âDiet-induced obesity alters the behavioral response to AgRP neuron stimulationâ, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A dissociation of this activity with feeding is further supported with the data presented in Figure 1I and Figure 2D.

The reviewer correctly notes that one exception to this correlation is Figure 1I, where the neural response of mice to HFD presentation is not restored after 4 weeks on chow (whereas food intake is restored). We have not speculated about possible causes for this discrepancy, in part because we are uncertain about whether it is a real difference (i.e. examination of the individual data points in Figure 1I reveals that 6/9 mice do show a rebound in responsiveness after return to chow, although the group means are not significantly different).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, what is the baseline control for DIO?

Briefly, animals were on low-fat chow from birth and tested on this diet at the outset of experiments. This is âbaselineâ. They were then randomized to either be switched to HFD for six weeks or maintained on chow for six weeks. After this six week period, the HFD cohort was returned to chow for four weeks and the chow cohort was maintained on chow for an additional four weeks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This is important given there is considerable variability in the baseline groups in several panels possibly contributing to the perceived changes (e.g. Figure 1G-I; Figure 3; Figure 4E-G; Figure 5A-C; Figure 5E-G; Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A-D).

The significance or lack of significance for Figures 4G, 5C, and possibly others appear to have benefited from this variability.</p></disp-quote><p>We have summarized below our interpretation of any variability between baseline groups in the various figures.</p><p>In optogenetic experiments in Figure 3, the differences in food intake between the baseline (no stimulation) groups in each panel represent real biological differences due to the different conditions tested. For example, fasted mice (Figure 3D, E) eat more than fed mice (Figure 3B, C) and mice presented with a HFD (Figure 3C, E) eat more than mice presented with a low fat diet (Figure 3B, D).</p><p>In the photometry experiments in Figures 1, 4, and 5, there is inherent variability in the magnitude of the responses of animals to stimuli at baseline due to the nature of photometry recordings. For example, small differences in fiber placement and viral expression cause differences in baseline fluorescence, and this technical variation cannot be prevented. The variability between animals that we report here is typical of these kinds of studies and the effect sizes we report (e.g. 30-40% DF/F) are larger than most photometry experiments in the published literature. However, we show the individual data points for each mouse in every experiment so that the reader can independently evaluate the spread in the data.</p><p>Several additional observations argue that variability in baseline responses is not a major contributor to the difference we observe. For example, we show that some signals are reversibly altered by weight loss (e.g. Figure 1E) and others are not (e.g. Figure 5B). Differences in the reversibility of a response cannot be explained by differential variability at baseline. Similarly, in some cases where DIO decreases AgRP neuron responses, the baseline responses were greater in the DIO group (Figure 5A-C), whereas in other cases where DIO decreases AgRP neuron responses, baseline responses were smaller in the DIO group (Figure 5G-I). Thus, differences in baseline responses do not reliably predict subsequent changes in dynamics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similar to the previous point; statistical comparisons should be made within and across groups at different times to assess these changes.</p></disp-quote><p>Statistical comparison between groups (lean and DIO) revealed no significant differences in AgRP neuron dynamics at baseline. The only significant between group comparison across all time points was the 6 week time points for chow and HFD presentation (Figure 1). This has been added to the figure. We have included information about relevant non-significant, between-group comparisons in the figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, the manuscript is somewhat incremental.

We agree that this is an interesting question, but it is not the focus of this paper and, to be properly addressed, would require repeating the entire study. We do show that there is no correlation between weight gain and the change in the photometry response to presentation of either chow or HFD (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1). We also show that is no correlation between weight gain and change in photometry response to CCK administration (new Figure 5âfigure supplement 1I). This suggests that obesity and body weight per se do not drive the changes we observe in AgRP neuron dynamics in DIO animals.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we include data from new experiments in which we subjected wild type animals to HFD (similar to our experimental animals) and then measured hormone levels and behavior and compared to lean controls (new Figure 2âfigure supplement 1) and discussion beginning in the last paragraph of the subsection âDiet-induced obesity decreases food consumption after fastingâ). These DIO mice showed significantly blunted fasting-induced refeeding and also developed hyperleptinemia. Importantly, circulating leptin levels negatively correlated with fasting-induced refeeding in DIO mice, suggesting that hyperleptinemia may be the cause of the blunted fasting induced hyperphagia in DIO mice, at least early in the course of obesity. In contrast, fasting insulin levels in DIO mice were not different from lean controls and do not correlate significantly with fasting induced refeeding.</p><p>References:</p><p>Chen, Y.M., and Knight, Z.A.
