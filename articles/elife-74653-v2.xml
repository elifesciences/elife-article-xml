hierarchy of brain regions, and subsequently update the internal predictions of the world. However, the essential feature of predictive coding, the notion of hierarchical depth and its neural mechanisms, remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigated the hierarchical depth of predictive auditory processing by combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and high-density whole-brain electrocorticography (ECoG) in marmoset monkeys during an auditory local-global paradigm in which the temporal regularities of the stimuli were designed at two hierarchical levels. The prediction-errors and prediction updates were examined as neural responses to auditory mismatches and omissions. Using fMRI, we identified a hierarchical gradient along the auditory pathway: midbrain and sensory regions represented local, shorter-time-scale predictive processing followed by associative auditory regions, whereas anterior temporal and prefrontal areas represented global, longer-time-scale sequence processing. The complementary ECoG recordings confirmed the activations at cortical surface areas and further differentiated the signals of prediction-error and update, which were transmitted via putative bottom-up γ and top-down β oscillations, respectively. Furthermore, omission responses caused by absence of input, reflecting solely the two levels of prediction signals that are unique to the hierarchical predictive coding framework, demonstrated the hierarchical top-down process of predictions in the auditory, temporal, and prefrontal areas. Thus, our findings support the hierarchical predictive coding framework, and outline how neural networks and spatiotemporal dynamics are used to represent and arrange a hierarchical structure of auditory sequences in the marmoset brain.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>predictive coding</kwd><kwd>auditory sequence</kwd><kwd>marmoset</kwd><kwd>functional magnetic

organized as a functional hierarchy, through which information propagates from the lower levels of sensory or motor regions (including subcortical areas) to the higher levels (e.g., temporal and prefrontal areas) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fuster, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huntenburg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mesulam, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Parras et al., 2017</xref>). At each processing level, neurons integrate information from multiple neurons at the level below, thus encoding increasingly abstract information over ever-larger temporal and spatial scales. Meanwhile, the reciprocal connections between cortical and subcortical areas provide neurons with feedback from the level above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Felleman and Van Essen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marques et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Robinson et al., 2016</xref>). In the time domain, the processing hierarchy is particularly important for cognition requiring a temporal integration of sensory stimuli and online action planning, such as spatial navigation and language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dehaene et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Giraud and Arnal, 2018</xref>).</p><p>The hierarchical predictive coding theory offers a unified framework for this functional hierarchy. It states that the brain develops a generative model of the world that constantly predicts sensory input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bizley and Cohen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rao and Ballard, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Spratling, 2010</xref>). The comparison of predicted and actual sensory input then updates an internal representation of the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Keller and Mrsic-Flogel, 2018</xref>). This process occurs throughout the cortical hierarchy. Specifically, the higher levels of the hierarchy send a top-down signal to lower levels in the form of a prediction of the bottom-up input to that area. The difference computed between the prediction and the bottom-up input is the prediction-error. The key assumption of the theory is that the prediction-error propagates across different depths of hierarchy, and in turn, the prediction propagates backward, providing signals to update the internal model at each level. Much of the research focuses on the signals of prediction and prediction-error at one unique level, such as the level of spatial detection in visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Attinger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fiser et al., 2016</xref>) or one scale of temporal expectations in auditory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gagnepain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rubin et al., 2016</xref>). However, the essential feature of predictive coding, that is, the notion of hierarchical depth (across multiple levels) is less well investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Parras et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Here, we combined whole-brain 9.4-T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and large-scale electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings to gain both spatial and temporal neural information during a hierarchical local-global auditory sequence task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bekinschtein et al., 2009</xref>) in the brains of marmosets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). These nonhuman primates are an important animal model for auditory processing because their social behavior and cognition are similar to those of humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eliades and Miller, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miller et al., 2016</xref>), and their ability of vocal learning from parents is comparable with vocal development in infant humans and song learning in birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Takahashi et al., 2017</xref>). It is difficult to record neural activities (both low-frequency event-related potentials and high-frequency potentials, e.g., high gamma band) in the primary auditory cortex in humans and macaque monkeys because of the cortical sulci. As a result, studies on predictive processing in audition are restricted to electroencephalography (EEG) or ECoG recordings in associative cortical areas. By contrast, the smooth surface of the lissencephalic marmoset brain provides a unique opportunity to compare whole-brain fMRI and large-scale surface ECoG signals. In the present study, we used these combined techniques to study the distribution of activities over cortical and subcortical areas along the auditory pathway. We employed a local-global paradigm enabling us to measure predictive processing at one level along with the conditional propagation of prediction-errors to the next level, depending on the predictive context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Both the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals and the electrophysiological power changes were investigated across a broad frequency spectrum at the whole-brain level. The aims of the present study were to assess the hierarchical depth of predictive auditory sequences and to identify the neural networks and temporal dynamics for processing prediction-errors and prediction updates at two distinct levels: the lower local level with a shorter timescale (i.e., 150 ms, tone-onset asynchrony) and the higher global level with a longer timescale (i.e., 3 s, sequence-onset asynchrony).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental setup and local-global paradigm.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental setup of whole-brain fMRI (9.4-T) and ECoG (96-channel); awake marmosets passively listen to auditory stimuli.

During an initial habituation phase, five marmosets (three for the fMRI and two for the ECoG experiment) passively heard one sequence type (e.g., xY) in a given block. Then, during the following test phase, we probed for brain responses to novel sequences that either respected the habituated sequence (80% of trials) or violated it (20% of trials; alternative/deviant sequence [xx in this example]). In experiments assessing the effect of an omission, the 5th tone was simply omitted in the violation sequence (comprising 20% of trials) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; for details, see Materials and methods).</p><p>We used this paradigm to test the hypothesis of hierarchical neural dynamics during auditory sequence processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), which predicts how the brain informs estimated statistics on the basis of the history of auditory sequences at two levels.</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>At the 1st (local) level, expectation violations result from tone-to-tone transition probability, which uses the most recent (150 ms) observations only, for example, the perception of an oddball (Y) tone deviating from four repetitions of standard (x) tones. The pattern of brain activation of predicted violation at this level is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> (in yellow), where the Y tone induces significantly greater activation than the x tone in both xx and xY tasks, referred to as the 1st-level prediction-error (PE1).</p></list-item><list-item><p>These local sequences, whether normal (xx) or oddball (xY), are repetitively presented to form 2nd-order sequences (sequence to sequence), thereby generating expectations at a 2nd (global) level, which takes into account all five tones (~3 s).

Because the two levels of violations are activated sequentially, the 1st-level novelty (i.e., the 5th tone is Y) determines and triggers the 2nd-level novelty (the xY sequence), referred to as a PE1 and PE2 violation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p></list-item></list></list-item><list-item><p>The brain produces predictions at both local tone (Y) and global sequence (xx or xY) levels. When the incoming signal is omitted, brain responses should reflect solely the prediction signals and how they varied depending on the current context (xx or xY task) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Specifically, in the xY task, where two successive oddball predictions are generated, we should observe a neural response to omission at both the 1st and 2nd levels, corresponding to the predictions of the Y tone and of the xY sequence. In the xx task, however, without the prediction of oddball tone in the xx sequence, the response to omission of the x tone may not be as strong as that of the Y tone at the 1st level, where only the prediction of the xx sequence at the 2nd level should be as robust as that in the xY task.</p></list-item></list><p>To test these hypotheses, we combined 9.4-T fMRI and 96-channel whole-brain ECoG of awake marmosets to assess the whole-brain neural networks and temporal dynamics during hierarchical auditory sequence processing, and searched for the neural representations of prediction-errors and predictions at two different levels.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>1st-level (local) novelty (xY sequences)</title><p>To determine the activations of multiple violations, we performed a within-subject one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), where the contrast images corresponding to different sequence types derived from a single session were used as within-subject factors (see Materials and methods). We first examined our data for the presence of a local mismatch response evoked by the deviance of the 5th tone. fMRI revealed the cortical regions activated by the novel tone, defined by the conjunction analysis using the contrasts between xY- and xx-evoked responses in both xx and xY tasks: (xY|xx – xx|xx) ∩ (xY|xY – xx|xY) (see Materials and methods). In the three marmosets, significant activation was found bilaterally along the auditory pathway, from the inferior colliculus (IC) in the midbrain and medial geniculate nucleus (MG) in the thalamus to auditory cortex (including auditory core and belt areas), the temporoparietal transitional area, dorsal prefrontal cortex, and anterior/posterior cingulate cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, red-yellow; p&lt;0.05, false-discovery rate [FDR] corrected for multiple comparisons across the brain; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>; individual marmosets: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

The ECoG system acquires high-fidelity broadband neural signals from an entire cortical hemisphere, with balanced spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions. The spatial, spectral, and temporal dynamics of ECoG signals were quantified by the time-frequency representation (TFR) (see Materials and methods). A significant novelty response was detected by the corresponding comparison using a nonparametric cluster-based permutation test. The 1st-level novelty response was defined as a significant difference in TFRs for the 5th tone (between Y and x) in both xx and xY tasks. Consistent with the regional activation observed in the fMRI experiment, the electrodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, electrodes in red; p&lt;0.05, cluster-corrected for multiple comparisons over frequency and time) exhibited an increase in γ-band power (&gt;40 Hz) right after the 5th tone (peak at 74±34 ms after the 5th-tone onset) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, right).

At this level, two internal sequence representations (xx and xY) were established during the habituation period, which enabled us to test the two different types of global novelties. We first tested the novelty responses in the xY task, where the deviant sequence (xx) only generated a violation at the 2nd level because it did not include local novelty. We then used fMRI to identify the brain regions showing significantly higher activation for xx sequences than for xY sequences in the xY task, and no difference between the xx and xY sequences in the xx task (i.e., when the sequence suddenly changed from xY to xx, but not from xx to xY). Unlike what was observed with the 1st-level novelty, we identified higher-order regions along the auditory pathway, especially in the temporal-prefrontal pathway and anterior-posterior cingulate areas, including bilateral anterolateral auditory area, superior temporal rostral area (STR), and prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, blue-light blue; p&lt;0.05, FDR-corrected; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>; individual marmosets: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>ECoG showed that the 2nd-level novelty generated a later γ-band power (peak at 242±17 ms) after the 5th-tone onset than observed for the 1st-level novelty (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>, electrodes in red; p&lt;0.05, cluster-corrected). The extended γ-band power was from the electrodes located in the anterior auditory and superior temporal cortices. Furthermore, the frontal electrodes, in regions similar to those identified in the fMRI experiment, showed a late β-band power decrease (12–30 Hz) starting at 206±170 ms after the 5th-tone onset, with a longer latency and lasting for more than 300 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>, electrodes in blue; p&lt;0.05, cluster-corrected).</p><p>Since the γ and β bands are thought to subserve bottom-up and top-down communications, respectively, in both humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnal and Giraud, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Michalareas et al., 2016</xref>) and monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bastos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">van Kerkoerle et al., 2014</xref>), the ECoG results confirmed the activated regions shown by fMRI and, more importantly, functionally dissociated the fMRI activation patterns between frontal and temporal regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Combined with the finding of increased early γ-band activity shown in the 1st-level novelty response, we thus propose that the early and late increases in γ-band activity in the auditory and temporal cortices are associated with the bottom-up prediction-errors PE1 and PE2, respectively, and that the long-lasting decrease in β-band activity in frontal areas likely represents the subsequent top-down prediction or updating process.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Violation at both 1st and 2nd levels (xY sequences in the xx task [xY|xx])</title><p>We next examined the violation sequence xY in the xx task, which generates novelty responses at two successive levels.

That is, we searched for brain regions showing significantly higher activation for xY sequences than xx sequences in the xx task, and no difference between xx and xY sequences in the xY task. As predicted, the xY sequence produced a violation at both the 1st and 2nd levels, as the strongest activation during fMRI encompassed the lower-level auditory pathway, including the subcortical area MG, auditory core and belt regions, as well as the parabelt region of the higher-order auditory cortex and progressing to the temporal-frontal network, for example, STR, A8, and A10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; p&lt;0.01, FDR-corrected; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>; individual marmosets: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Brain activations to the two successive (local and global) novelties.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Group-level fMRI activations to both local and global novelties (p&lt;0.01, FDR-corrected).

To verify a functional relationship between the frequency band and predictive function, we examined the directional correlation of corticocortical interaction in the novelty responses using the observed signals of PEs (γ-band activity) and prediction/updating (β-band activity) within and across trials (see Materials and methods). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, the current framework predicts that the activation of the 1st-level violation should determine the activation at the 2nd level, especially on xY trials in the xx task. Thus, within a deviant trial, the hypothesis is that the early γ-band power increase (1st-level error) will trigger the late γ-band power increase (2nd-level error) and then interact with the late long-lasting β-band power decrease (prediction updating). Across trials, the β-band activity should update the internal representations of tones and sequences, which will affect the processing of subsequent trials. In this way, trial-by-trial fluctuations in the β-band power will affect the top-down predictions, and the amount of change will affect prediction-errors on subsequent trials.</p><p>We first examined the correlations between the three signals (early γ-band, late γ-band, and late β-band power) within the deviant trial xY|xx. Early γ-band (from primary auditory cortex, starting at 40 ms [marmoset J] and 60 ms [marmoset N] after the 5th-tone onset) and late γ-band (from auditory and superior temporal cortices, starting at 120 ms [marmoset J] and 160 ms [marmoset N] after the 5th-tone onset) prediction-error signals were positively correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>, left yellow), and late γ-band prediction-error and β-band (from auditory and prefrontal regions, starting at 140 ms [marmoset J] and 220 ms [marmoset N] after the 5th-tone onset) prediction-updating signals were positively correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>, left red). However, within the deviant trial xx|xY, we only observed a significant correlation between late γ-band and late β-band power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>, right) as hypothesized, as the 2nd-level error was not induced by the 1st-level error in the xY task.</p><p>Across trials, we investigated whether the long-lasting β-band signal in a deviant trial would affect the early/late γ-band signals in the subsequent trial, a standard (xx|xx) trial according to the experimental design. The prediction signal (β-band) from frontal cortex correlated significantly with early (PE1) and late (PE2) γ-band signals on the following xx|xx trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>, left).

These results demonstrate the sequential processing of the prediction-error signals from PE1 to PE2 (i.e., from primary auditory cortex to high-order auditory and superior temporal regions), which were propagated to frontal cortex where they interacted with prediction signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>); in turn, the prediction signals subsequently affected the PE1 and PE2 signals in response to new sensory inputs in the following trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Omission novelties (x_|xx and x_|xY) induce prediction signals dependent on task context</title><p>Finally, we examined omission responses.

At the whole-brain level, we found progressive encoding of information along the auditory pathway: local auditory information on a shorter temporal scale is encoded and propagated from the IC and MG, and primary auditory cortex to the posterior and anterior cingulate cortices, where the local 1st-level prediction-error (PE1) signal is characterized by the early γ-band. Global auditory information on a longer temporal scale propagates from primary auditory cortex to high-order auditory, superior temporal, and prefrontal cortices, where the 2nd-level prediction-error (PE2) signals are transmitted via the late γ-band. Furthermore, at both local and global levels, temporal and prefrontal cortices produce prediction feedback signals, which are transmitted in a long-lasting β-band. The prediction signals interact with the PE2 signals within a deviant trial as well as with the updated error signals in the subsequent trial. Furthermore, the neural responses to omissions in an auditory sequence at both local and global levels dissected the multiple top-down prediction systems from auditory and frontal cortices, respectively. The prediction signals dependent on the absence of bottom-up input selectively update the internal representations of tones or sequences, thus supporting the hierarchical predictive coding framework.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Marmosets as an animal model for auditory sequences</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to construct the hierarchy of predictive auditory sequences in the marmoset brain. Predictive coding was first articulated within the visual domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rao and Ballard, 1999</xref>). Investigating this with neural recordings in the auditory domain, especially in the primary auditory cortex, is more challenging that EEG or ECoG recordings are limited in associative cortical areas in humans and macaque monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dürschmid et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). However, the lissencephalic brain of the marmoset provides convenience to study primary and high-order auditory cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Okano and Mitra, 2015</xref>). While most of the previous marmoset studies were limited to electrophysiological techniques and mainly focused on auditory calls and pitch processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bendor and Wang, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bendor and Wang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Toarmino et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhou and Wang, 2012</xref>), the present study has begun to examine the auditory sequences at the whole-brain level. In particular, we revealed that both prediction-error and prediction-updating signals are located in the core and belt regions of the auditory cortex. The results of whole-brain mapping of sequence processing would facilitate future studies in the marmoset brain, in which we can detail the finer representation of prediction and prediction-error signals in the auditory and related areas within the different cortical layers, even to the single-neuron level (e.g., via two-photon calcium imaging) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zeng et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Predictive signals in the subcortical areas along auditory pathway</title><p>Previous studies in humans and macaque monkeys have suggested that the local novelty could induce neural activations in the auditory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">El Karoui et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Uhrig et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wacongne et al., 2011</xref>). However, due to poor spatial resolution of EEG and compromised signal-to-noise of fMRI (3T), the response to local novelties was barely described in the subcortical regions. Using 9.4-T fMRI in marmosets, we found the neural responses to the local novelty in the IC, MG, and primary auditory cortex. Researches using the classical oddball paradigm have shown considerable evidence for predictive processing in the auditory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cornella et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dürschmid et al., 2016</xref>) and lower subcortical nuclei, including IC and MG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grimm and Escera, 2012</xref>). Furthermore, the prediction-error responses have been widely investigated in the subcortical auditory areas of humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Escera and Malmierca, 2014</xref>) and animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Parras et al., 2017</xref>), which support a large-scale hierarchical organization of auditory processing. Our finding is also consistent with a recent mouse study with electrophysiological recordings in these regions, where the authors examined local intervals (0.001–0.1 s) separating consecutive noise bursts and global rhythmic patterns (~1 s) of inter-burst interval sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asokan et al., 2021</xref>). They showed that neural responses to local intervals were strong in the IC, but attenuated across MG and primary auditory cortex; the response to global rhythmic patterns was robust in primary auditory, but weak in MG and IC. Combined with the early peak latency of γ-band power for PE1, the local novelty responses in IC, MG, and primary auditory cortex are in line with the thalamocortical correlates of mismatch negativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lakatos et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that classical oddball paradigms are involved in local prediction-error. Furthermore, our paradigm with the 2×2 design (e.g., xY|xx novelty) allows exploration of the interaction of local and global effects. Interestingly, in the xY|xx condition that the xx sequence as the internal template, the activations comprised both local and global effects were also observed in MG, suggesting that the auditory regions in the subcortical areas may also process the large timescale auditory information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bakay et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Robinson et al., 2016</xref>). Future studies using single or multiple units recording would help to clarify the function of sequence processing in MG and IC regions in marmosets.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Hierarchical structure and two levels of predictive coding of auditory sequences</title><p>Studies using the local-global or human language paradigm have provided empirical evidence that temporal processing is hierarchical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">El Karoui et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Uhrig et al., 2014</xref>), with early sensory regions affected by the recent properties of the input stream and higher-order regions affected by the more complex features during longer time windows within a stimulus context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bekinschtein et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hasson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lerner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wacongne et al., 2011</xref>). However, very few studies have examined the neural mechanism of the succession of prediction-error and prediction signals, that is, how lower-level or recent events trigger higher-level or prolonged signals. In one previous study, with data-driven analysis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chao et al., 2018</xref> have clearly identified prediction and prediction-error signals at two different hierarchical levels and examined their interactions using high-density ECoG in macaque monkeys. The authors proposed full-global, partial-global, and no-global components in the two-level auditory sequence processing. However, similar to most other studies using the local-global paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Uhrig et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wacongne et al., 2011</xref>), they tested the global violation by combining xx|xY and xY|xx novelties, which, in fact, contain two different types of predictions within the global violation. Therefore, our study for the first time separated the global novelties, that xx|xY novelty was only involved in the 2nd-level signal with the xY sequence as the internal sequence template, and the xY|xx novelty was involved in both 1st- and 2nd-level signals (the 1st-level novelty triggers the 2nd-level novelty), when the xx sequence was the internal template. As demonstrated in our hypotheses and results, the separation of the global novelty in the classic local-global paradigm was essential for understanding the neural mechanism of the depth of predictive auditory processing and the hierarchical propagation of prediction-error and prediction-updating information.</p><p>Finally, as most of the previous local-global studies did not test whether and how the prediction signals would respond to the omission in the auditory sequences, we adopted the omission sequence as a deviant to discern prediction signals at the two hierarchies. The neural activations induced by our deviant stimuli (e.g., xY|xx and xx|xY) cannot conclusively confirm the existence of prediction signals, because the novelty responses may act as modulatory signals of bottom-up input. However, the omission responses allowed us to study top-down prediction signal decoupled from bottom-up input signals, as without sensory input, the neural response to omission cannot be explained by any modulation of feedforward propagation and should contain specific information of upcoming predictive information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Demarchi et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, omission responses are considered as the proactive prediction and the violation of this prediction. Although detecting omission could happen retrospectively by comparing input and prediction template after the input is processed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bendixen et al., 2009</xref>), our data demonstrated that responses to the omission only occurred after unexpected omissions (in contrast to the expected xxxx omission task), more likely reflecting the specific prediction signal rather than simple novelty detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bendixen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chennu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fiser et al., 2016</xref>). In the xx task, a fixed play rate of five identical tones ensures robust temporal expectations of the next tone. In line with previous works, the responses to rare omissions in the xx task may reflect a temporal prediction of the 5th tone and violation of the global sequence, regardless of the particular identity of the omitted tone. Our observation of x_|xx sequence only in temporal and frontal cortices using both fMRI and ECoG, may thus support that responses of prediction signal do not require bottom-up thalamocortical drive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Demarchi et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, the responses of omissions could be found in xY task, only if both the timing and identity of the 5th tone could be predicted, because it was different from the previous four tones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sanmiguel et al., 2013</xref>). The early γ-band increases and fMRI signals in auditory cortex, which were found by comparing x_|xY with x_|xx sequences, may reflect the unfilled specific expectation for identified stimulus because in both conditions temporal information was predicted. Therefore, since bottom-up inputs cannot account for omission responses, the early γ after following the omission onset in x_|xY sequence could be the consequence of 1st-level top-down prediction. The correlation we observed between the extended γ and long-lasting β signals in both x_|xx and x_|xY sequences implied the interaction between PE2 caused by global violation and 2nd-level prediction. The frontal prediction signal in x_|xY sequence for the update of both PE1 and PE2 on the following sequence and the temporal prediction signal for the update of the PE1, consistently supported the hierarchical top-down predictions.</p><p>In conclusion, our results from fMRI and ECoG recordings in marmosets may reveal a complete account of a hierarchical predictive coding framework of auditory sequences, including the prediction-error and prediction-updating information at two hierarchies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Matlab</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mathworks (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mathworks.com">http://www.mathworks.com</ext-link>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Version R2017b</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Psychophysics Toolbox</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Psychophysics Toolbox (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://psychtoolbox.org">http://psychtoolbox.org</ext-link>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_002881">SCR_002881</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Version 3.0.12</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SPM Toolbox</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Statistical Parametric Mapping (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm">http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm</ext-link>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_007037">SCR_007037</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Version 12</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FieldTrip Toolbox</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FieldTrip (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org">http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org</ext-link>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_004849">SCR_004849</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N-way Toolbox</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N-way (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.modelslife.ku.dk/nwaytoolbox">http://www.modelslife.ku.dk/nwaytoolbox</ext-link>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Version 3.30</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Functional magnetic resonance imaging</title><p>Three adult common marmosets (<italic>Callithrix jacchus</italic>; two males, 350–420 g, 48–60 months) were used in the fMRI experiments.

For fMRI, each trial was a sequence of five tones. Each tone lasted 50 ms with an interval of 100 ms. Thus, the total duration of the sequence was 650 ms and the interval of sequence onsets was 3.5 s. At the local level (millisecond timescale), a sequence of five identical tones comprised the local standard (e.g., xxxxx, referred to as ‘xx’). When the 5th tone was replaced by a distinct tone, the sequence was identified as a local deviant (e.g., xxxxY, referred to as ‘xY’). In the case of an omission, the sequence consisted of only four identical tones (5th tone omitted; e.g., xxxx). The frequency of the tone x or Y was either 800 Hz or 6000 Hz. At the global level (second timescale), a series of identical sequences played repeatedly were identified as global standards (e.g., xY). A distinct sequence presented rarely and randomly was identified as the global deviant (e.g., xx).</p><p>A given fMRI run started with a resting period of 14 s, following a habitation phase during which the selected global standard sequence was repeatedly presented 20 times to establish a global regularity. In the testing period, three blocks of 25 trials were presented sequentially, each followed by a 14 s rest. The 25 trials included 20 frequent global standards (80%) and five rare global deviants (20%). The global deviants were followed by more than one global standard. Each scanning run lasted 6 min 46 s. In the xx task, the testing blocks were either a mixture of 80% xx trials (xx|xx) and 20% xY trials (xY|xx), or a mixture of 80% xx trials and 20% omission trials (x_|xx). In the xY task, the testing blocks were either a mixture of 80% xY trials (xY|xY) and 20% xx trials (xx|xY), or a mixture of 80% xY trials and 20% omission trials (x_|xY). Each regular local-global session consisted of 3–4 runs of the xx task and 3–4 runs of the xY task, depending on the marmosets’ performance on that day. In the omission local-global experiments, each session similarly consisted of 3–4 runs of the xx task and 3–4 runs of the xY task. The order of the tasks was random, and the frequencies selected for x and Y were balanced.</p><p>The duration of each ECoG trial was 850 ms, with each tone lasting 50 ms with an interval of 150 ms.

At the single-session level, the statistical maps (threshold at p&lt;0.01, uncorrected) generated by all auditory stimuli from a testing period without bilateral activation of auditory cortex were rejected. Therefore, the useful data for regular local-global stimuli comprised 55 sessions (21, 18, and 16 sessions for each of the three marmosets). The useful data for omission local-global stimuli were 48 sessions (18, 11, and 19 sessions for each of the three marmosets).</p><p>To determine the pathway of propagation of multiple novelty signals, a group analysis of within-subject one-way ANOVA was used for regular and omission local-global experiments, respectively. The single-session contrast images corresponding to each trial type derived from the 1st-level analyses were introduced to the 2nd-level ANOVA design in SPM. Subsequently, pair-wise t<italic>-</italic>tests were performed to compare the responses to different levels of novelties, which defined each type of contrast. To detect the auditory pathway of marmosets, activation in response to all sound stimuli (except during habituation trials) relative to that at rest was assessed using a threshold of p&lt;0.001 (family-wise error rate corrected for multiple comparisons across the brain) with a cluster size of &gt;50. To determine the novelty response of local level, we defined the contrast as a conjunction of xY|xx – xx|xx and xY|xY – xx|xY using a threshold of p&lt;0.05 (FDR-corrected for multiple comparisons across the brain) and a cluster size of &gt;5 (considering that the structural sizes of lower-level brain areas, like IC and MG, are relatively small, we chose the small cluster size for the local-level novelty activation). The contrast of global-level novelty response was determined using xx|xY – xY|xY (excluding xY|xx – xx|xx). The threshold used was p&lt;0.05 (FDR-corrected) with a cluster size of &gt;10. For both local- and global-level novelty effects in the xx task, the contrast was set as xY|xx – xx|xx (excluding xx|xY – xY|xY) with a threshold of p&lt;0.01 (FDR-corrected) and a cluster size of &gt;10. To investigate the omission effect, the comparisons were x_|xx versus xx|xx using a threshold of p&lt;0.001 (uncorrected) and a cluster size of &gt;10, x_|xY versus xY|xY, and x_|xY versus x_|xx using a threshold of p&lt;0.05 (FDR-corrected) and a cluster size of &gt;10.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>ECoG data analysis</title><p>ECoG data were processed using Fieldtrip toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oostenveld et al., 2011</xref>). Trials were extracted from −1 to 2 s from the onset of the first tone. Each trial was resampled at 500 Hz and bandpass filtered using a bandpass filter order five with a window from 1 to 240 Hz. The electrodes with high-frequency noise over 60% of the trials were removed. For all remaining electrodes, trials with abnormal spectra and slow-wave activity were manually rejected (ft_rejectvisual.m). After artifact rejection, a recording run with fewer than five deviant trials was excluded. The useful data were notch filtered to remove the 50 Hz line noise, re-referenced using a common average reference montage, detrended to remove linear trends, and demeaned to apply baseline correction. The numbers of runs adopted were 23 (marmoset J) and 20 (marmoset N) for the xx task with xY|xx as the deviant, and 20 (marmoset J) and 18 (marmoset N) each for the xx task with omissions, xY task with xx|xY, and xY task with omissions.</p><p>Time-frequency analysis was conducted using ‘mtmconvol’ in Fieldtrip toolbox (ft_freqanalysis.m). Multitaper time-frequency transformation was based on multiplication in the frequency between 10 and 140 Hz (1 Hz step). The time from 300 ms before the 1st tone to 800 ms after the 5th tone (0.02 s step) was analyzed. Four time windows per frequency were analyzed, and the amount of spectral smoothing through multitapering was 0.5×the frequency. TFR was calculated by comparing deviant and standard trial types with baseline correction. To assess significant differences between TFRs, Monte-Carlo estimates of the significance probabilities were determined from the permutation distribution. The permutation was performed 1000 times by shuffling the trial labels ‘deviant’ and ‘standard.’ In each permutation, an independent-sample t-test was conducted at each frequency and time point. Then, a nonparametric cluster-based test was applied for the correction of multiple comparisons over frequency and time (ft_freqstatistics.m). The cluster-level statistics were computed by adopting the sum of the t values within each cluster and taking the maximum. The cluster-corrected threshold for significance was set at p&lt;0.05.</p><p>To estimate the propagative function among different levels of prediction-error and prediction signals, the contributions of PE1, PE2, and prediction components were measured for each trial. The contribution of each component was achieved from parallel factor analysis using N-way toolbox (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.models.life.ku.dk/nwaytoolbox">http://www.models.life.ku.dk/nwaytoolbox</ext-link>). According to the statistical results of each TFR comparison, the frequency and time domains of different components in each trial type were determined by the significant activity. The trial-by-trial TFR computed from the specific frequency and time domains was projected onto the spatio-spectro-temporal pattern. Then, the values for how much the PE1, PE2, and prediction components contributed to a given trial were obtained. To investigate the relationship among PE1, PE2, and prediction activities during deviant stimuli, the correlation between the contribution of one component derived from the corresponding significant electrodes and the contribution of another within the same type of trial were assessed. For example, the contribution of PE1 component was generated from the electrodes with significant response to local-level novelty. To observe the role of updating the prediction signal, the correlation between the contribution of the prediction component derived from deviant trials was further evaluated along with the contribution of the PE1 or PE2 component derived from post-deviant trials (which was the standard trial directly after a deviant trial). For the prediction component derived from the electrodes located at frontal cortex that with corresponding significant β-band activity, we calculated the correlation between PE1/PE2 component generated from all electrodes with corresponding significant γ-band activity and the prediction. However, for the prediction component elicited from the significant electrodes located at auditory cortex, we evaluated the correlation between PE1/PE2 component generated from auditory electrodes with corresponding significant γ-band activity and the prediction. If the prediction information was updated, the contributions of the prediction component to deviant trials would significantly correlate to the contributions of the prediction-error component to post-deviant trials. The correlation coefficient from a Pearson correlation with a p value of &lt;0.05 was considered significant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Resources, Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Validation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>The protocol of the fMRI study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Institute of Neuroscience, Chinese Academy of Sciences (no.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Constructing the hierarchy of predictive auditory sequences in the marmoset brain&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Andrew King as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The work combines fMRI with extensive ECoG coverage to provide support for a hierarchical mismatch organisation. Such an organisation has been suggested by previous work, as have the β prediction and γ mismatch signals. The work has demonstrated a pattern of regional organisation in this species that is very suitable for further evaluation at the neural level.</p><p>The referees were both enthusiastic about the work, but have made detailed comments about the exposition in their evaluations below that we expect you to address in the final version of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Line 37: Putative instead of putatively.</p><p>Line 42: Neural circuits. I really read circuits to represent individual neuronal connections, or at the very least, small local neural pathways. As an fMRI and ecog study, that kind of resolution isn't available. I would recommend using neural networks.</p><p>Lines 49-58: There is a great deal of discussion here about cortical levels. However this study includes data from the thalamus and IC, both of which are generally considered to be subcortical. I would suggest the authors define their terms more clearly, either by just using the term auditory pathway, or higher.</p><p>Line 78: Remove increasingly. Don't sell your model short, it is an important animal model and you tell us why right afterwards.</p><p>Line 78: I'm not sure exactly what the final layout will look like, but try to keep the figure close to the first reference to it. It's 4 pages after the fact right now, and I had to go looking.</p><p>Lines 77 and 78. Local-global is mentioned several times by this point, but is not defined nor is there a direct reference until 100 when it is finally detailed. Please put a reference on the first mention of it.</p><p>Line 94: Again I prefer networks to circuits for this kind of macro level investigation.</p><p>Line 95. Use a shorter time scale, not a short time scale. 150ms isn't short compared to the response of a neuron. By keeping your terms relative, people like me can't complain.</p><p>Lines 101-105, and especially the word alternatively at 103. The description of the stimuli is unclear. I cannot tell if x can be either 800 or 6000Hz, so that there are stimuli of 800 800 800 800 800 and 800 800 800 800 6000 as well as 6000 6000 6000 6000 6000 and 6000 6000 6000 6000 800 or only the former. Some rephrasing should easily tidy this up.</p><p>Line 153: PE1 and PE2 need to be defined in the caption text, not just in the figure image.</p><p>Line 246: None of the MG or the cortical areas are &quot;low-level auditory pathway&quot;. You could maybe get away with lower-level and keep it relative in the context of this study, but even then, you have IC which is lower than the MG, is not mentioned here, and is still not low-level as it's midbrain not brainstem. I'd recommend saying lower cortical and subcortical areas, or something to that effect. Be very aware that the IC does a lot of auditory processing, and probably is most closely analogous with V1 in the visual system, so this is the kind of error that can upset a lot of researchers.</p><p>Line 257: It took me quite a while to figure out what you meant by In the marmoset (J).

It implies you have a resolution that you don’t have.</p><p>Line 354: Monkey should be marmoset, be consistent in how you refer to your animals.

This is one of the most important results of the paper and is buried mid paragraph here. Show it off a bit more, be proud of your results, they're good.</p><p>Lines 396 and 399: short and long temporal scales.

For the auditory task, one scanning run comprised a habituation block and three testing blocks. To make it clearer, we have added the temporal resolution of the fMRI data in the method, and revised the expression of “volumes per run” as “A scanning run comprised 116 functional image volumes”. Furthermore, in the fMRI and ECoG methods, we used “scanning run” and “recording run” instead of “run”, respectively.

Marmosets are animals that can live in large extended family groups (Miller et al., 2016). One of the principal advantages of marmosets as a research model is their rich vocal repertoire and communicative vocal behaviors displayed both in the wild and in captivity (Eliades and Miller, 2017; Tsunada and Eliades, 2020). In fact, studies have suggested that marmosets have the capacity of volitional control of their vocalization and even some extent of vocal learning, even though the vocal learning of marmosets is not as flexible as humans and some birds (Takahashi et al., 2017). Therefore, we have revised the introduction to highlight the marmoset’s vocal learning ability (Lines 84-85).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Could authors explain what the rationale is for presenting in the main figures averaged fMRI data (Figure 2A) vs fMRI data for a single animal (Figure 3A).

Both Figure 2A and 3A are group fMRI data, and the fMRI data for three single animals are shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 1A. Please see the statement in Lines 269-270: “Figure 3A; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, FDR-corrected; Supplementary File 1c; individual marmosets: Figure 3—figure supplement 1A”. From Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and C, Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, we can observe that the patterns of hierarchical processing are consistent across the three marmosets, except the significant power of activation across the marmosets are a little different. To avoid confusion, we added “group-level fMRI” in the legends of Figures 2A, 3A, 4A and 5A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Why did the authors choose a different number of clusters to determine local (cluster size&gt;5) vs global novelty responses (cluster size&gt;10)?</p></disp-quote><p>Compared to other brain areas in the auditory pathway, the structural sizes of IC and MG are relatively small.

However, the xY|xx novelty produced a violation at both 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> levels, and we cannot eliminate the possibility that the global effect may occur in MG when the xx sequence was used as an internal template. In the present study, the fMRI cannot dissociate the local and global effects in xY|xx condition, and the ECoG doesn’t cover the subcortical areas. We thus proposed that future studies using single or multiple units recording should be performed in MG and IC regions in marmosets. We have rewritten the sentence to make the statement more accurate (Lines 513-518).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) &quot;dB&quot; should probably read &quot;dB SPL&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have replaced “dB” with “dB SPL” (Lines 594 and 623).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) We would encourage the authors to expand their discussion on previous literature a bit with reference to similar work – e.g. (Grimm and Escera, 2012, Cornella et al., 2012, Escera and Malmierca, 2014, Parras et al., 2017, Dürschmid et al., 2016).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for reminding us of the impressive work.
