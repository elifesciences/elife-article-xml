Obesity is usually characterized by fat accumulation in enlarged – hypertrophic – adipocytes that are a source of inflammatory mediators, which promote the development and progression of metabolic disorders. Yet, in certain healthy obese individuals, fat is stored in metabolically more favorable hyperplastic fat tissue that contains an increased number of smaller adipocytes that are less inflamed. In a previous study, we demonstrated that loss of the inhibitory protein-isoform C/EBPβ-LIP and the resulting augmented function of the transactivating isoform C/EBPβ-LAP promotes fat metabolism under normal feeding conditions and expands health- and lifespan in mice. Here, we show that in mice on a high-fat diet, LIP-deficiency results in adipocyte hyperplasia associated with reduced inflammation and metabolic improvements. Furthermore, fat storage in subcutaneous depots is significantly enhanced specifically in LIP-deficient male mice. Our data identify C/EBPβ as a regulator of adipocyte fate in response to increased fat intake, which has major implications for metabolic health and aging.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fat metabolism</kwd><kwd>adipocytes</kwd><kwd>C/EBP</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA 283/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zidek</surname><given-names>Laura M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Gene regulation by C/EBPβ determines how surplus of dietary fat is stored, which has consequences for metabolic health.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nutrient overload, particularly in combination with a sedentary lifestyle, is the main cause of the increasing incidence of obesity we are facing today. In most cases, chronic obesity provokes the development of metabolic diseases like insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes (T2D), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NFALD), and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Longo et al., 2019</xref>). The surplus of fat is stored in the white adipose tissue (WAT) largely without an increase in adipocyte number, resulting in an increase in fat cell size. This hypertrophy is accompanied with reduced vascularization and oxygen supply, and an increase in macrophage infiltration, and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Frasca et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Tchkonia et al., 2010</xref>). Since the storage capacity of the hypertrophic cells is limited, fat starts to accumulate in ectopic tissues like liver, heart and skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Frasca et al., 2017</xref>). This steatosis, also referred to as ‘lipotoxicity’ further promotes metabolic disorders. However, there is an exception from this scenario as individuals exist that are chronically obese but stay – at least transiently – metabolically healthy. Evidence from mouse and a few human studies suggest that storing surplus of nutrients as fat through adipocyte hyperplasia (increasing number) is associated with metabolic health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">White and Ravussin, 2019</xref>). As the fat storage can be distributed over more fat cells, the individual fat cells stay smaller, are metabolically more active, and less inflamed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ghaben and Scherer, 2019</xref>). So far not much is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms and involved regulators that drive fat storage in either the hypertrophic or the hyperplastic direction. Such regulators may be attractive targets to therapeutically switch the adipocytes from a hypertrophic into a hyperplasic state in order to prevent metabolic complications associated with obesity.</p><p>CCAAT/Enhancer Binding Protein beta (C/EBPβ) is a transcription factor known to regulate adipocyte differentiation together with other C/EBPs and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Siersbæk and Mandrup, 2011</xref>). In all cases of C/EBPβ controlled cellular processes, it is important to consider that different protein isoforms of C/EBPβ exist. The two long C/EBPβ isoforms, LAP1 and LAP2 (Liver-enriched activating proteins) differ slightly in length and both function as transcriptional activators. The N-terminally truncated isoform LIP (Liver-enriched inhibitory protein) acts inhibitory because it lacks transactivation domains yet binds to DNA in competition with LAP1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Descombes and Schibler, 1991</xref>). We have shown earlier that LIP expression is stimulated by mTORC1 signaling involving a <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory short upstream open reading frame (uORF) in the Cebpb-mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Calkhoven et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Zidek et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Mutation of the uORF in mice (<italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> mice) results in loss of LIP expression, unleashing LAP transactivation function, resulting in C/EBPβ super-function.

C/EBPβ super-function in <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> mice causes fat to accumulate in hyperplastic rather than hypertrophic depots. In addition, <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> male mice store the surplus of fat more efficiently in subcutaneous fat stores. Accordingly, the <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> mice are protected against the development of steatosis and better maintain glucose tolerance, indicating a healthy obese phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Separate cohorts of male and female <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> mice and wild-type (wt) control littermates on a C57BL/6 J background were fed a high-fat diet (HFD; 60% fat) or standard chow (10% fat) for a period of 19 weeks. In males, both genotypes gained weight over the whole experimental period yet with significantly lower body weights for <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> mice, suggesting that they are partially protected from HFD induced weight gain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Both the food intake and the energy efficiency (energy that was extracted from the food during digestion) were similar in <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> and wt males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Lean mass and fat mass body composition was determined by computer tomography (CT) after 19 weeks of HFD feeding. On standard chow, fat mass of <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> males was reduced compared to wt males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) as we showed before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Zidek et al., 2015</xref>). Unexpectedly, we observed a slight but significantly increased overall fat mass volume in the <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> males compared to wt controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), which correlates with a relative reduction in lean mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). There was no significant difference in the amount of visceral fat mass between wt and <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> males under HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). However, the HFD fed <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> males had a significantly increased subcutaneous fat mass compared to the wt controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Taken together, the data show that <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> male mice store more fat upon HFD feeding compared to wt littermates, and that this extra fat is mainly stored in the subcutaneous fat depot. Similar to male mice, the body weight gain of <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> females after 19 weeks on HFD was smaller compared to the weight gain of wt females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). However, different from the male mice, in females this was associated with a reduced accumulation of fat particularly in the subcutaneous depot in <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> compared to wt females as was determined by fat tissue weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F, G</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> mice on high-fat diet (HFD).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Growth curves of wt and <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> (ΔuORF) male mice on HFD (wt, n = 10; <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic>, n = 8).

We therefore analyzed the inflammatory state of visceral white adipose tissue (WAT) by determining the expression of the macrophage marker CD68 and the inflammatory cytokines TNFα, MCP1, IL-1 and IL-6 using quantitative PCR (qPCR) and immunohistochemistry (anti-CD68). Male wt mice on HFD show a strong increase in CD68 mRNA expression compared to wt males on ND indicating increased macrophage infiltration. In contrast, CD68 mRNA expression is much lower in the visceral fat from HFD fed <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> males and not significantly different from ND fed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Accordingly, histological staining of visceral WAT derived from three different mice shows more pronounced macrophage infiltration in wt mice on HFD (19 weeks) compared to <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In addition, expression of the inflammatory markers TNFα, MCP1, IL-1β, and IL-6 was significantly induced in the visceral fat of wt males on HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In contrast, in <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> males, HFD feeding did not significantly induce TNFα and IL-1β expression, and the induction of MCP1 was significantly lower compared to HFD fed wt males. Solely IL-6 levels were comparable between the two genotypes on HFD feeding. For female wt mice the mean value of induction of CD68 expression in response to HFD is high but strongly varies between the mice. Therefore, the lower value of CD68 expression in HFD fed <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> mice is not statistically significant yet shows much less variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

We therefore analyzed the expression in the visceral WAT of the adipogenic transcription factors C/EBPα and PPARγ, the sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 c (SREBP1c) as a key transcription factor for lipogenesis, and fatty acid synthase (FAS) as a key lipogenic enzyme, by quantitative PCR. In wt male mice all four transcripts are significantly lower expressed on HFD compared to ND (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). This generally corresponds to their protein levels as determined by immunoblotting, although the expression of PPARγ and SREBP1c varies considerably between the mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In the WAT of <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> males on ND, expression of the four transcripts is similar (C/EBPα and PPARγ) or higher compared to WAT from wt males on ND (SREBP1 and FAS, also shown in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Zidek et al., 2015</xref>), and its reduction under HFD occurs to a lesser extend compared to wt mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

In two previous reports, we have shown that <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> mice display metabolic improvements and a delay in the onset of age-related conditions, collectively resulting in an extended lifespan in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Müller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Zidek et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> mice are protected against the development of metabolic disturbances in response to HFD feeding. In males, this improved metabolic phenotype occurs although the total fat mass in <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> mice is increased in response to HFD to a greater extent than in wt mice. Our data indicate that two special features of the white adipose tissue (WAT) in <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> males contribute to these metabolic improvements. Firstly, <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> males on a HFD store the surplus of nutrients in fat depots that expand through hyperplasia; they increase the number of adipocytes and thus the individual cells have to store less fat. These smaller adipocytes are metabolically more active and less inflamed compared to the inflated wt adipocytes residing in a hypertrophic fat depot. Hypertrophic adipocytes are known to secrete inflammatory cytokines that promote insulin resistance and other metabolic disturbances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Reilly and Saltiel, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Weisberg et al., 2003</xref>). Furthermore, since the number of adipocytes in hypertrophic fat tissue does not increase and the amount of fat that can be stored in an adipocyte is limited, fat starts to accumulate in ectopic tissues like liver or muscle, compromising metabolic health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Frasca et al., 2017</xref>). Accordingly, in wt males on HFD we observed pronounced inflammation and macrophage infiltration in the visceral WAT and severe steatosis. In contrast, <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> males on HFD are protected against these metabolic disturbances, which also correlated with better maintenance of glucose tolerance. We have shown earlier that the expression of genes related to fatty acid oxidation is enhanced in the liver of <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> mice accompanied by a significant increase in fatty acid oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Zidek et al., 2015</xref>). This enhanced fat utilization likely contributes to the reduced lipid accumulation in the liver of <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> mice on HFD, and the healthier metabolic phenotype of <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> mice is presumably the result of the combination of an increase in WAT function and fat utilization. In addition, the <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> males store relatively more fat in the subcutaneous compartment than wt mice, which relieves the fat storage pressure for the visceral depots. Fat storage in the subcutaneous fat depot is associated with a better metabolic health status in humans and mice, while fat storage in the visceral fat depot is associated with insulin resistance and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carey et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">McLaughlin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Tran et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast to the males, female <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> mice showed reduced fat accumulation in the subcutaneous fat depot upon HFD compared to wt mice, and the visceral fat depot showed a trend towards a reduced fat storage although this difference was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>). However, similar to the <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> males, the adipocyte cell size in the visceral fat from <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> females was significantly reduced and the calculated number of adipocytes was higher compared to wt females revealing increased adipocyte hyperplasia also in HFD fed <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> females. Accordingly, also the female mice showed an improved metabolic phenotype on HFD including reduced hepatic steatosis and better maintained glucose tolerance. The difference in inflammation between wt and <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> females was less pronounced compared to males and only visible in antibody staining of the macrophage marker CD68 indicating reduced macrophage infiltration in the visceral fat of <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> females. However, macrophage infiltration seemed to be less pronounced in wt females on HFD than in wt males based on the CD68 immunohistological staining (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B</xref>), which might be explained by the known anti-inflammatory function of β-estradiol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Camporez et al., 2019</xref>). The generally lower vulnerability for inflammation in females may mitigate the differences in inflammatory cytokines between the two genotypes.</p><p>The HFD induced adipocytic hyperplasia in <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> mice indicates that unconstrained LAP functionality – through loss of inhibitory function of LIP – stimulates adipocyte differentiation and function. It may explain why <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> male mice store more fat in WAT on a HFD than wt littermates assuming that efficient fat storage by adaptive increase of the number of adipocytes prevents relocation of fat to peripheral tissues. Although fat storage in female <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> mice upon HFD was rather reduced compared to wt littermates, also their adipocyte numbers in the visceral fat depot were increased. These observations are in line with our previous experiments showing that mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> mice are much more efficiently induced to undergo adipogenesis than wt MEFs, and differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes is strongly suppressed upon ectopic induction of LIP (see data in Expanded View Figure 3 B, C of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Zidek et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, the Kirkland lab has shown that endogenous LIP levels increase upon ageing in pre-adipocytes and in isolated fat cells from rats which correlated with reduced C/EBPα expression and reduced differentiation potential of the pre-adipocytes and that overexpression of LIP in preadipocytes from young rats impaired adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Karagiannides et al., 2001</xref>). Similarly, we observed a shift of the C/EBPβ isoform ratio towards more LIP expression in visceral fat from wt males on HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) which probably inhibits adipogenesis and thereby might contribute to adipocyte hypertrophy observed in wt mice.</p><p>In the current model of the regulatory cascade of adipocyte differentiation C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ induce the expression of C/EBPα and PPARγ, which by positive feedback stimulate each other’s expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Siersbæk and Mandrup, 2011</xref>). Pharmacological activation of PPARγ by thiazolidines similarly to the <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> mutation stimulates adipocyte differentiation, results in fat storage in hyperplastic adipocytes and in a shift to fat storage in the subcutaneous compartment, resulting in improved metabolic health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fujiwara et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">McLaughlin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Okuno et al., 1998</xref>). Our finding that the mRNA expression of adipogenic transcription factors PPARγ, SREBP1 and C/EBPα in the visceral fat of <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> males is better maintained on HFD compared to wt mice also fits to these observations. However, in contrast to our qPCR data, C/EBPα protein levels were rather downregulated in <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> males both at ND and HFD conditions upon HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) suggesting counter-regulation at the level of translation. This might be an adaptive response to increased LAP function yet does not seem to affect the adipocyte hyperplasia phenotype.</p><p>In the visceral WAT of wt females, LIP levels and the LAP/LIP isoform ratios do not significantly change in response to HFD feeding, in contrast to males. Accordingly, the mRNA expression levels of the adipogenic transcription factors are maintained upon HFD feeding in wt females. Whether this sex-specific difference might be due to the less pronounced inflammation (macrophage infiltration) observed in females or to other sex-specific responses to HFD feeding has to be examined in future studies. Probably, the slight increase in PPARγ expression together with the increased LAP function might be sufficient for the observed adipocyte hyperplasia in female <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> mice on HFD, which however, seems to be less pronounced compared to HFD fed <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> males. The downregulation of fatty acid synthetase (FAS) mRNA levels that we observe in wt mice upon HFD seems to be independent from the expression of the adipogenic transcription factors tested because at least in females these regulatory events were uncoupled and might be due to other effects of HFD feeding. Furthermore, in <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> females the protein expression of FAS on HFD does not correspond to the FAS mRNA levels, it is efficiently reduced despite almost completely maintained mRNA levels suggesting interfering, post-transcriptional effects. What these effects are and why they are only observed in female mice is so far not known.</p><p>Taken together, our data propose pharmacological reduction of LIP expression as an approach to switch the unhealthy metabolic phenotype of obese individuals into a healthy obese phenotype to prevent the development of metabolic disease (possibly together with pharmacologic PPARγ activation). We have shown that a search for such an intervention is feasible through the identification of drugs that inhibit LIP expression similar to mTORC1-inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Zaini et al., 2017</xref>). One drug that we identified as an inhibitor of LIP expression, the antiviral drug adevovir dipivoxil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Zaini et al., 2017</xref>), was recently tested on female wt mice upon ND and HFD feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bitto et al., 2021</xref>). This study showed that adevovir is effective in increasing the LAP/LIP isoform ratio also in vivo (although in the mice LIP expression was not affected but rather LAP expression was increased), which resulted in increased C/EBPβ target gene activation and increased expression of β-oxidation genes in the liver similar to what we observed in the <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Zidek et al., 2015</xref>). Remarkably, adevovir treatment resulted in a significant reduction of body weight and fat content particularly in the HFD fed mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bitto et al., 2021</xref>) similar to what we found with the <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> females on HFD. Whether this effect on body weight and fat accumulation is caused only by increasing C/EBPβ function or whether additional not yet identified effects of adevovir contribute in addition is not known so far. Furthermore, it will be interesting to examine whether adevovir treatment of males results in reduced fat accumulation like in females or in increased (subcutaneous) fat accumulation as we observed in the <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> males. Since the increased C/EBPβ function in <italic>Cebpb<sup>ΔuORF</sup></italic> mice also has the potential to extend the healthspan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Müller et al., 2018</xref>), therapeutic interference with the C/EBPβ isoform ratio may represent a promising strategy to attenuate the metabolic disturbances not only associated with overnutrition but also with ageing.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

generations (females) into the C57BL/6 J background. Mice were kept at a standard 12 hr light/dark cycle at 22 °C in a pathogen-free animal facility and for all experiments age-matched mice were used. Mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD; 60% fat, D12492, Research Diets New Brunswick, USA) for 19 weeks starting at an age of 12–15 weeks or a standard chow diet (normal diet, ND; 10% fat, D12450B, Research Diets New Brunswick, USA) as control. For each genotype, weight-matched mice were distributed over the different diet groups. Mice were analyzed at different time points as indicated in the figure legends. The determination of male body weight and food intake (per cage divided through the number of mice in the cage) was performed weekly for 16 or 18 weeks, respectively. The body weight of females was determined in week 19 after mice were terminated. During the performance of all experiments the genotype of the mice was masked.

After different time points, the blood glucose concentration was measured using a glucometer (AccuCheck Aviva, Roche). For the determination of insulin sensitivity, an insulin solution (0,05 IU/ml insulin in 1xPBS supplemented with 0.08% fatty acid-free BSA) was i.p. injected into non-starved mice using 10 μl per gram body weight and the blood glucose concentration was measured as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Histological staining</title><p>Tissue pieces were fixed for 24 hr with paraformaldehyde (4%) and embedded in paraffin. Sections (5 μm) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) in the Autostainer XL (Leica). Adipocyte area was determined using the ImageJ software from 12 adjacent cells per mouse. For CD68 staining, sections (5 μm) from paraffin embedded tissue were dried for 2 hr at 55 °C, deparaffinized and rehydrated. For antigen retrieval, sections were incubated for 25 min in 10 mM citrate buffer, pH 6.0. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked in 1% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in methanol for 30 min. After blocking with normal goat serum (1:10 in PBS), sections were incubated with a CD68 specific antibody (E307V, #97,778 from Cell Signaling, 1:200) over night at 4 °C followed by incubation with a biotin-conjugated secondary goat anti rabbit antibody (Vector Labs, BA-1000, 1:250) for 30 min and incubation with reagents of the Vectastain ABC HRP kit (Vector Labs, PK-4000) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Slides were stained with DAB and counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated and covered using Eukitt. A Hamamatsu scanner was used to take images. For lipid staining with Sudan III, cryosections (10 μm) were fixed with paraformaldehyde (4%) and stained with Sudan-III solution (3% (w/v) Sudan-III in 10% ethanol and 90% acetic acid) for 30 min. For lipid staining with Oil-Red-O, cryosections (10 μm) were fixed with paraformaldehyde (10%), washed shortly in 60% isopropanol and stained with Oil-Red-O solution (3 mg/ml isopropanol stock solution diluted to 1.8 mg/ml with H<sub>2</sub>0) for 15 min. After shortly washing first with isopropanol and then with water, cells were counterstained with hematoxylin and covered with 10 mM Tris HCl pH 9.0 in glycerol.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Calculation of adipocyte number</title><p>The mean adipocyte area from the visceral fat per mouse was used to calculate the adipocyte volume per mouse with r (radius) = and V (volume) = π r<sup>3</sup>. For males, the mean volume of the visceral fat as determined by CT analysis was then divided by the mean adipocyte volume to get the cell number. For females, adipocyte weight was calculated by multiplying the calculated cell volume with 0.915 (the density of triolein). Then, the mean weight of the visceral WAT tissue was divided by the calculated adipocyte weight.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Determination of organ weight</title><p>After termination of the mice organs were collected and cleaned from surrounding fat or connective tissue and their weight was determined using an analytical balance.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>qRT-PCR analysis</title><p>Tissue pieces were homogenized using the Precellys 24 system (Peqlab) in the presence of 1 ml QIAzol reagent (QUIAGEN).

This study demonstrates that C/EBPβ acts as a key protective factor against many of the negative consequences of a high-fat diet in mice and further clarifies the downstream processes involved. Obesity is an already significant and growing health problem, and this work may help identify new strategies to combat obesity going forward.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62625.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Kaeberlein</surname><given-names>Matt</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00cvxb145</institution-id><institution>University of Washington</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;C/EBPβ regulates hyperplastic versus hypertrophic fat tissue growth&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Matt Kaeberlein as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>There is consensus among the reviewers that this study provides an interesting and important advance in understanding the role of CEBP/b LAP in metabolism and response to a high fat diet challenge. The major discoveries reported here are fairly well supported by the data, including that male uORF KO mice show an increase in fat cell number as opposed to fat cell size, less inflammation, and improved glucose tolerance/insulin sensitivity.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>However, all of the reviewers shared the major concern that it appears that only male mice were studied here, and that this fact – or the rationale for using only male mice – was not clearly articulated within the manuscript. This makes interpretation quite challenging, especially given that the authors previously published that lifespan extension in the uORF KO mice is much more pronounced in female compared to male mice. There was consensus that this is a substantial weakness to the current manuscript which limits its overall impact. It's possible the authors already have this data, and we would need to see inclusion of data supporting similar outcomes for the key experiments in female mice to recommend publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. If the outcomes are different in males and females, this is likely quite interesting and would need to be developed further.</p><p>The other significant concern was related to the RT-qPCR data, which is indicative but not conclusive support for the authors' conclusions, especially since many of the changes are small in magnitude. It was noted that most of the relevant proteins have ELISAs available, and they all have antibodies which could be used to support the robustness and importance of the small but plausibly important differences observed. IHC against CD68 in the fat depots could be performed and the authors could strengthen their claims about adipose tissue inflammation by measuring the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines in adipose depots.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62625.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>However, all of the reviewers shared the major concern that it appears that only male mice were studied here, and that this fact – or the rationale for using only male mice – was not clearly articulated within the manuscript.
