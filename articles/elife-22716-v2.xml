underlying processes remain incompletely elucidated. We have previously reported that myeloid-defective zebrafish mutants display apoptosis of regenerative cells during fin fold regeneration. Here, we found that the apoptosis phenotype is induced by prolonged expression of <italic>interleukin 1 beta</italic> (<italic>il1b</italic>). Myeloid cells are considered to be the principal source of Il1b, but we show that epithelial cells express <italic>il1b</italic> in response to tissue injury and initiate the inflammatory response, and that its resolution by macrophages is necessary for survival of regenerative cells. We further show that Il1b plays an essential role in normal fin fold regeneration by regulating expression of regeneration-induced genes. Our study reveals that proper levels of Il1b signaling and tissue inflammation, which are tuned by macrophages, play a crucial role in tissue regeneration.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22716.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22716.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22716.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Animals and other multicellular organisms all have at least some ability to regenerate lost or wounded tissues. Zebrafish are particularly good at this to the extent that they can replace damaged or lost body parts with exact replicas of the originals. In 2015, a team of researchers found that some mutant zebrafish that lack blood cells including immune cells are unable to regenerate lost tissues. This is because the cells that are primed to regenerate die instead, but it was not clear why this happens.</p><p>Many immune cells have roles in fighting infection and in responding to tissue damage.When a tissue is damaged, the area often becomes inflamed as white blood cells called macrophages flock to the damaged area to protect it from infection and remove damaged cells.</p><p>Hasegawa et al. – who include several researchers involved in the 2015 study – used genetic approaches to investigate the role of inflammation in tissue regeneration in zebrafish. The experiments show that several genes involved in inflammation – including one called <italic>interleukin 1b –</italic> were active over longer periods of time in the mutant fish compared with normal zebrafish. The gene produces a signal protein and this prolonged activity causes the primed regenerative cells to die. However, the cells can survive if <italic>interleukin 1b</italic> activity is quickly suppressed by macrophages. The experiments also show that, in order for tissues to regenerate properly, <italic>interleukin 1b</italic> needs to be active for only a short period of time.</p><p>The findings reveal that some inflammation is needed for tissues to regenerate, but that a more severe inflammatory response can block the process. A future challenge will be to identify the signals that macrophages produce to suppress inflammation to allow tissues to regenerate. These anti-inflammatory signals may have the potential to be used as drugs to cure chronic inflammatory diseases and boost tissue regeneration potential in humans.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22716.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22716.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>Interleukin 1 beta</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>macrophage</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>fin fold</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kawakami</surname><given-names>Atsushi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009619</institution-id><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>National BioResource Project</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kawakami</surname><given-names>Koichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001509</institution-id><institution>Royal Society of New Zealand</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Marsden Fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hall</surname><given-names>Christopher J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The Interleukin 1 beta signaling and tissue inflammation act as a double-edged sword: they are required for regeneration, but when in excess, they impair tissue regeneration and induce apoptosis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Progress in regenerative medicine depends on unraveling the mechanisms underlying tissue and organ regeneration. The zebrafish is a powerful model species for investigation of regeneration mechanisms because it exhibits high regenerative capacity. Zebrafish can regenerate complex structures such as fins, heart, brain, retina, and other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gemberling et al., 2013</xref>). The caudal fin of zebrafish, in particular, has been used as a model for analyzing epimorphic regeneration, a type of regeneration in the urodele limb and fish fin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Poss et al., 2003</xref>). During epimorphic regeneration, two characteristic tissues, the wound epidermis and the blastema, are induced in response to tissue amputation, and their coordinated actions regulate cell proliferation and morphogenesis and thus lead to tissue regeneration. Studies conducted using the caudal fin regeneration model have identified numerous genes and molecular signaling pathways that are critical for fin regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yoshinari and Kawakami, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wehner and Weidinger, 2015</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the classical regeneration model developed using the adult caudal fin, a zebrafish larval fin fold model has been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kawakami et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mateus et al., 2012</xref>), allowing identification of additional genes and signaling pathways required for regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mathew et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ishida et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yoo et al., 2012</xref>). Specifically, the fin fold regeneration model has facilitated genetic analysis of the regeneration mechanism by exploiting a number of mutant zebrafish resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rojas-Muñoz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yoshinari et al., 2009</xref>), because several zebrafish lethal mutants survive beyond 7 days post fertilization (dpf)—an adequate period for assaying tissue regeneration—because of nutrient supply from the yolk.</p><p>Previously, we reported that zebrafish mutants, <italic>cloche</italic> (<italic>clo</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stainier et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Reischauer et al., 2016</xref>) and <italic>tal1/scl</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bussmann et al., 2007</xref>), showed a unique regenerative defect: these mutants could not regenerate their fin fold because of apoptosis of the regenerative cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hasegawa et al., 2015</xref>). Our analyses of the <italic>clo</italic> mutant revealed that a diffusible survival factor from myeloid-lineage cells is required to prevent apoptosis of the primed regenerative cells. That study suggested that the regenerative cells are sensitive to apoptosis during tissue regeneration, but the mechanism of this sensitization and the identity of the survival factor remain unknown.</p><p>Myeloid cells are widely recognized to play a role in protection against pathogens and microorganisms after tissue injury. Neutrophils are first recruited to sites of inflammation, and these cells encounter pathogens and phagocytose and kill microorganisms by producing reactive oxygen species and/or antibacterial proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kolaczkowska and Kubes, 2013</xref>). Subsequently, macrophages infiltrate the inflammation site, produce pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokines, remove tissue debris, secrete growth factors, and support tissue restoration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Koh and DiPietro, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Several recent studies have used the zebrafish model and addressed the roles of myeloid cells in response to tissue injury: Li and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2012</xref>) showed that knockdown of macrophage differentiation delayed fin fold regeneration and resulted in formation of an abnormal fin fold featuring large vacuoles. Furthermore, Petrie and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Petrie et al., 2014</xref>) showed that genetic ablation of macrophages in adult zebrafish impaired fin outgrowth and often induced an abnormal fin. These studies suggest a crucial role for macrophages in tissue regeneration; however, the mechanism by which myeloid cells affect regeneration remains to be elucidated.</p><p>Here, we show that a pro-inflammatory cytokine gene, <italic>interleukin 1 beta</italic> (<italic>il1b</italic>), is aberrantly upregulated in the <italic>clo</italic> mutant, and that the resulting excessive and prolonged inflammation causes apoptosis of the regenerative cells. Moreover, although myeloid cells are widely regarded as the main cells that secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines such as Il1b and thereby promote inflammation, we demonstrate that epidermal cells surrounding the amputated tissue are the source of Il1b in both wild-type (WT) and <italic>clo</italic> larvae. Notably, <italic>il1b</italic> expression in the regenerating epidermis is usually quenched by the action of macrophages, and a lack of this anti-inflammatory effect of the macrophages results in apoptosis. Lastly, we show that Il1b signaling plays an indispensable role in normal tissue regeneration by activating expression of regeneration-induced genes. Thus, our study highlights the function of Il1b and the inflammatory response in tissue regeneration. A proper level of <italic>il1b</italic> expression and the inflammatory response, which are tuned by macrophages, are necessary for progression of tissue regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Prolonged <italic>il1b</italic> expression in the <italic>clo</italic> mutant during regeneration</title><p>To understand the molecular pathway leading to apoptosis of regenerative cells in the <italic>clo</italic> mutant, we performed a transcriptome analysis of amputated larval tail tissues of WT and <italic>clo</italic> mutant zebrafish at approximately 6 hr post amputation (hpa), just before the stage at which apoptosis is first detectable in the <italic>clo</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hasegawa et al., 2015</xref>). Compared with WT larvae, the <italic>clo</italic> larvae showed marked upregulation of regeneration-induced genes such as <italic>junba</italic>, <italic>junbb</italic>, <italic>matrix metallopeptidase 9</italic> (<italic>mmp9</italic>), <italic>fibronectin 1b</italic> (<italic>fn1b</italic>), and <italic>fgf20a</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yoshinari et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shibata et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

The pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as Il1b) produced by myeloid cells, including macrophages, induce early responses against infection or injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Dinarello, 2009</xref>). Thus, myeloid cells are considered to trigger inflammation by providing pro-inflammatory cytokines. Here, we demonstrated that the pro-inflammatory cytokine Il1b is provided by epidermal cells in response to tissue injury. We showed that apoptosis occurred if the Il1b action at the injury site was prolonged, and that macrophages were responsible for attenuation of <italic>il1b</italic> expression and resolution of inflammation. Furthermore, our data suggest that normal <italic>il1b</italic> expression and inflammatory response are necessary in tissue regeneration to activate expression of regeneration-induced genes. Thus, our study has revealed that Il1b signaling and tissue inflammation act as a double-edged sword: they are required for regeneration, but in excess, they impair tissue regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22716.018</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Schematic of the role of Il1b and macrophages during fin fold regeneration.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) Tissue injury induces <italic>il1b</italic> expression in epithelial cells.

In this study, we showed that <italic>il1b</italic> is expressed by epidermal cells around the injury site. Notably, LPS injection induced <italic>il1b</italic> expression in myeloid cells, but not in the injured epidermal cells, suggesting that <italic>il1b</italic> induction by tissue injury occurs through a mechanism distinct from the mechanism underlying induction in myeloid cells following bacterial infection. Although it remains unknown how tissue injury stimulates <italic>il1b</italic> expression, a subject for future study, a substance released from disrupted cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rock and Kono, 2008</xref>) or a mechanical signal could be responsible for inducing <italic>il1b</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kanjanamekanant et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We also showed that in the <italic>clo</italic> mutant apoptosis is caused by prolonged <italic>il1b</italic> expression and inflammatory response. The precise mechanism by which Il1b induces apoptosis is unclear, but Tnf signaling could be a downstream mediator for triggering apoptosis. Tnfα signaling is known to stimulate apoptosis through activation of Caspase 8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sedger and McDermott, 2014</xref>). Tissue inflammation has been suggested to induce <italic>tnfα</italic> expression, and zebrafish <italic>tnfb</italic>, one of the zebrafish homologs of <italic>tnfα</italic>, was upregulated in the <italic>clo</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>); therefore, Tnfα signaling potentially serves as a direct mediator for inducing apoptosis in the <italic>clo</italic> mutant. Alternatively, the <italic>clo</italic> apoptosis might occur because of ER stress signaling: Il1b administration into primary rat β-cells and MIN6 cells was reported to increase ER stress through intracellular release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and to induce apoptosis in a JNK-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Eizirik and Mandrup-Poulsen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, excessive ER stress evoked by Il1b around the injury site could induce apoptosis in the <italic>clo</italic> mutant.</p><p>In this study, we further demonstrated that macrophages play a crucial role in fin fold regeneration by attenuating <italic>il1b</italic> expression and supporting survival of regenerative cells. Recent studies have shown that knockdown of macrophage differentiation delayed fin fold regeneration and resulted in an abnormal fin fold featuring large vacuoles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2012</xref>), and genetic ablation of macrophages in adult zebrafish was demonstrated to affect fin ray patterning and fin growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Petrie et al., 2014</xref>). These studies suggest that macrophages play a critical role in tissue regeneration, but the precise function of the cells remains unknown. Our study has, for the first time, elucidated a role of macrophages in attenuating <italic>il1b</italic> expression and inflammation during tissue regeneration. In accordance with our observation, macrophage-depleted mice and salamanders were found to display elevated <italic>il1b</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Goren et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Godwin et al., 2013</xref>), which suggests that the macrophage function of attenuating <italic>il1b</italic> transcription is conserved in other vertebrate species.</p><p>Our observation of macrophage accumulation in the injured fin fold suggests that the macrophage migration could play a role in attenuating <italic>il1b</italic> expression and quenching inflammation. However, we cannot conclude that the macrophage migration is necessary for attenuating the <italic>il1b</italic> expression, because our preceding study showed that an activity that rescues the <italic>clo</italic> apoptosis exists in the WT body extract prior to tissue amputation. We previously suggested that the effect of myeloid cells is mediated by a factor that is diffusible and heat-stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hasegawa et al., 2015</xref>), but its identity remains unknown. The factor could be an anti-inflammatory protein/molecule such as IL-10, Tgf-β, or a lipid mediator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Serhan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ortega-Gómez et al., 2013</xref>). It is speculated that signals such as nFkB and/or STAT3, which are activated by tissue injury, are involved in inducing <italic>il1b</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ogryzko et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Karra et al., 2015</xref>). The anti-inflammatory molecules bind to cell surface receptors to activate intracellular pathways and antagonize the nFkB and/or STAT3 signals to attenuate <italic>il1b</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Saraiva and O'Garra, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liao et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Most importantly, our study suggests that inflammation mediated by Il1b is also necessary for normal fin regeneration. Previously, we showed that genes such as <italic>fn1b</italic>, <italic>junba</italic>, and <italic>junbb</italic> were induced in response to tissue injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yoshinari et al., 2009</xref>), but the upstream mechanism that regulates the expression of these genes remains unknown. Here, we have demonstrated that Il1b signaling is necessary and sufficient for triggering expression of regeneration-induced genes. Although the primary factors involved in tissue regeneration, tentatively named alarmins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bianchi, 2007</xref>), remain to be identified, Il1b could represent one of the key upstream mediators for initiating expression of regeneration-induced genes and advancing tissue regeneration.</p><p>Given that macrophages are required for resolving inflammation, an impairment or reduction of this function will lead to the diseases that accompany chronic inflammation, such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and auto-inflammatory diseases. Therefore, elucidation of the regulatory mechanism of the Il1b signal and the action of anti-inflammatory substances released from macrophages will enhance our understanding of the pathogenic processes of chronic-inflammation diseases and lead to development of suitable therapeutics.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fish husbandry and fin amputation</title><p>Zebrafish of a WT line, which has been maintained in our facility for &gt;10 years through inbreeding, were housed in a recirculating system in a 14 hr day/10 hr night cycle at 28.5°C.

According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we further examined temporal changes of neutrophil and macrophage accumulation, respectively, in the injured fin fold. We observed that both of neutrophil and macrophage increased until 3 hpa, reached at a maximum number between 3-6 hpa in the vicinity of <italic>il1b</italic>-expressing site, and then decreased thereafter. The timing coincides with the stage when the initial <italic>il1b</italic> expression in WT was downregulated, suggesting a possibility that myeloid cell migration could play a role for attenuating <italic>il1b</italic> expression. However, we cannot conclude that it is necessary for attenuating <italic>il1b</italic> expression. Because, we have previously shown that an anti-apoptosis activity exists in the WT body fluid irrespective of tissue injury (Hasegawa et al., 2015).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>: We added the ISH analyses of neutrophil and macrophage accumulation in amputated fin fold.</p><p>Subsection “Macrophages support the survival of regenerative cells”, first paragraph: We added a description of myeloid cell accumulation in amputated fin fold in the Results section.</p><p>Discussion, fifth paragraph: We also added a discussion regarding the significance of myeloid cell migration to injured site.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>: The illustration in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref> was revised, because we cannot conclude that macrophage infiltration in the vicinity of <italic>il1b</italic>-positive epithelial cells is necessary for attenuating <italic>il1b</italic> expression.</p><p><italic>2) Overexpression of il1b induced pro-regenerative gene expression in uninjured fins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7L</xref>).

This is probably because the macrophages in WT suppress the inflammatory effect of <italic>Il1b</italic> overexpression. The induction of regenerative genes shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7L</xref> was observed at 6 hpa, a stage before the apoptosis by <italic>il1b</italic> overexpression was evident.
