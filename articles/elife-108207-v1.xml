The <italic>pid</italic> mutants fail to initiate flowers on inflorescences, a phenotype that is mimicked by disrupting either the <italic>NAKED PINS IN YUC MUTANTS</italic> (<italic>NPY</italic>) gene family or <italic>PIN FORMED 1</italic> (<italic>PIN1</italic>). Both PID and NPY1 have been reported to positively modulate PIN-mediated polar auxin transport. Here, we show that overexpression of <italic>NPY1</italic> (<italic>NPY1 OE</italic>) completely suppressed <italic>pid</italic> null mutants, demonstrating that <italic>NPY1</italic> functions downstream of <italic>PID. NPY1 OE</italic> triggered phosphorylation of PIN proteins at multiple sites that are mostly different from the previously characterized phosphorylation sites regardless of the presence of <italic>PID</italic>. Phosphorylation of the newly identified PIN sites in <italic>NPY1 OE</italic> plants likely leads to the inhibition of PIN functions, as we previously showed that <italic>pid</italic> is suppressed by decreasing <italic>PIN1</italic> gene dosage or decreasing PIN1 activity. Furthermore, we show that the Ser/Thr-rich C-terminal motif in NPY1 is phosphorylated and is required for <italic>pid</italic> suppression by <italic>NPY1 OE</italic>. Overexpression of <italic>NPY1</italic> that lacked the C-terminal motif (<italic>NPY1∆C</italic>) failed to rescue <italic>pid</italic>, but overexpression of <italic>NPY1∆C</italic> was still able to trigger phosphorylation of PIN proteins, including PIN2, which is known to cause agravitropic roots when mutated. <italic>NPY1∆C</italic> overexpression plants displayed a complete loss of root gravitropic response, likely caused by PIN2 phosphorylation. Our results suggest a pathway for auxin-mediated flower initiation, in which PID regulates NPY1 accumulation and/or activity, and subsequently, NPY1 triggers phosphorylation of PIN proteins and inhibition of PIN functions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>auxin</kwd><kwd>PIN proteins</kwd><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/021nxhr62</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1546899</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Briggs</surname><given-names>Steven P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Tata Endowed professorship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Yunde</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A cause and impact of PIN-FORMED protein phosphorylation has been revealed.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Auxin is required for flower initiation in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and other plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng and Zhao, 2007c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yamaguchi et al., 2013</xref>). Several <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants and mutant combinations fail to initiate flowers on inflorescences, despite the fact that they can undergo the normal transition from vegetative growth to reproductive growth, resulting in the formation of pin-like inflorescences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennett et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Przemeck et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gälweiler et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2007a</xref>). All of the known pin-like <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants are caused by defects in some aspects of auxin biology. <italic>PIN-FORMED 1</italic> (<italic>PIN1</italic>) was the first characterized gene that causes the formation of pin-like inflorescences when compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gälweiler et al., 1998</xref>). PIN1 is an auxin efflux carrier that transports auxin from the cytosol into the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yang et al., 2022</xref>). Plants grown on media containing the polar auxin transport inhibitor <italic>N</italic>-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) phenocopy <italic>pin1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Okada et al., 1991</xref>). It has been shown that NPA can directly bind to PIN1 to inhibit auxin transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yang et al., 2022</xref>). Disruption of <italic>PINOID</italic> (<italic>PID</italic>), which encodes a Ser/Thr protein kinase, also leads to the formation of pin-like inflorescences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennett et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Christensen et al., 2000</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>PID</italic> leads to phenotypes similar to the well-characterized auxin-resistant mutants, linking <italic>PID</italic> functions to auxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Christensen et al., 2000</xref>). <italic>NAKED PINS IN YUC MUTANTS 1</italic>(<italic>NPY1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2007b</xref>), which is also called <italic>ENHANCER OF PINOID</italic> (<italic>ENP</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Treml et al., 2005</xref>) and <italic>MACCHI-BOU 4 (MAB4</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Furutani et al., 2007</xref>), was isolated from genetic screens for <italic>pid</italic> enhancers and for enhancers of <italic>yuc1 yuc4</italic> double mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheng et al., 2006</xref>), which are defective in auxin biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2007a</xref>). The <italic>yuc1 yuc4 npy1</italic> triple mutants produce pin-like inflorescences similar to those in <italic>pin1</italic> and <italic>pid</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2007b</xref>). Inactivation of <italic>NPY1</italic> and its close homologs <italic>NPY3</italic> and <italic>NPY5</italic> also causes the failure of floral initiation from inflorescences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2008</xref>). The <italic>yuc1 yuc2 yuc4 yuc6</italic> quadruple mutants also develop small pin-like structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheng et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Although the aforementioned genes are known to participate in auxin-mediated flower development, the mechanisms by which the genes regulate floral development and the relationships between them are not fully understood. The predominant model regarding the relationship among <italic>PIN1</italic>, <italic>PID</italic>, and <italic>NPY</italic> genes is centered on regulating PIN polarity, localization, and activity by PID and NPY proteins. It was reported that PID directly phosphorylates the hydrophilic loop of PIN proteins, resulting in changes in PIN polarity and activation of PIN-mediated auxin export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Friml et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Michniewicz et al., 2007</xref>). NPYs were suggested to regulate PIN internalization through the endocytosis pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Furutani et al., 2011</xref>). Recently, it was reported that NPY1, PID, and PIN1 form a protein complex at the plasma membrane and that the recruitment of NPYs to the plasma membrane by PIN limits the lateral diffusion of PINs, thus maintaining PIN polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Glanc et al., 2021</xref>). Phosphorylation of PIN by PID enhances the recruitment of NPY to plasma membrane, which then promotes PIN phosphorylation by recruiting or interacting with AGC kinases, thus forming a self-reinforcing loop to maintain PIN polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Glanc et al., 2021</xref>). Other protein kinases, including D6 PROTEIN KINASE, are also involved in phosphorylating PIN proteins and activating PIN-mediated auxin transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Willige et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barbosa et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Recently, we discovered that <italic>pid</italic> null mutant phenotypes were suppressed when one copy of the <italic>PIN1</italic> gene is inactivated (heterozygous <italic>pin1</italic> mutants) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mudgett et al., 2023</xref>). The <italic>pid</italic> null mutants were also suppressed by the PIN1-GFP<sub>HDR</sub> fusion in which <italic>GFP</italic> was precisely inserted into the <italic>PIN1</italic> gene via CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mudgett et al., 2023</xref>). PIN1-GFP<sub>HDR</sub> is less active than wild-type (WT) PIN1, indicating that <italic>pid</italic> is suppressed by lowering either PIN1 activity or <italic>PIN1</italic> gene dosage. This new type of genetic interaction between <italic>pid</italic> and <italic>pin1,</italic> called haplocomplementation, renders <italic>PID</italic> unnecessary for flower development when expressing only 50% of <italic>PIN1</italic>, whereas the presence of 0% or 100% <italic>PIN1</italic> makes <italic>PID</italic> essential. The observed genetic interaction between <italic>pid</italic> and <italic>pin1</italic> suggests a much more complex relationship between the two genes than the current model of PIN1 phosphorylation by PID directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mudgett et al., 2023</xref>). Moreover, it was known that <italic>pid</italic> mutants produce more cotyledons and true leaves than WT plants, whereas <italic>pin1</italic> mutants make fewer cotyledons and fewer true leaves compared to WT plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennett et al., 1995</xref>). The opposite cotyledon/true leaf phenotypes of <italic>pid</italic> and <italic>pin1</italic> cannot be accounted for by PID-mediated direct phosphorylation/activation of PIN1.</p><p>In this study, we analyzed the dosage effects of <italic>NPY1</italic> on <italic>pid</italic> phenotypes. We show that overexpression of <italic>NPY1</italic> (<italic>NPY1 OE</italic>) completely suppressed <italic>pid</italic> null mutants, demonstrating that <italic>NPY1</italic> and <italic>PIN1</italic> have opposite dosage effects on <italic>pid</italic> mutants. Furthermore, we find that <italic>NPY1 OE</italic> led to an increase in PIN phosphorylation, suggesting that <italic>NPY1 OE</italic>-triggered PIN phosphorylation actually inhibits PIN functions. Moreover, we discovered that the C-terminal motif of NPY1, which contains 30 amino acid residues with 50% Ser/Thr, is required for suppression of <italic>pid</italic> by <italic>NPY1 OE</italic>. Overexpression of <italic>NPY1</italic> that lacked the C-terminal motif (<italic>NPY1∆C</italic>) did not suppress <italic>pid</italic>, but caused auxin resistance and a complete loss of gravitropism. Overexpression of <italic>NPY1∆C</italic> also increased phosphorylation of PIN proteins, including PIN2, which causes agravitropic roots when mutated, further suggesting that phosphorylation of certain residues/regions of PIN proteins inhibits PIN functions. Our results demonstrated that NPY1 functions downstream of PID during flower development. In addition, our results indicate that NPY1 affects PIN phosphorylation, which inhibits PIN function and which may account for the suppression of <italic>pid</italic> by <italic>NPY1 OE</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Protein null <italic>pin</italic>1 mutants further confirm haplocomplementation of <italic>pid</italic> mutants by <italic>pin</italic>1</title><p>We previously showed that <italic>pid</italic> null mutants were rescued by either PIN1-GFP<sub>HDR</sub> fusion or the presence of only one copy of functional <italic>PIN1</italic> gene, suggesting that a reduction in PIN1 activity or <italic>PIN1</italic> gene dosage is sufficient to restore the fertility of <italic>pid</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mudgett et al., 2023</xref>). Because the <italic>pin</italic>1 mutants in our previous study had the potential to produce truncated PIN1 proteins, we could not completely rule out the possibility that the predicted truncated PIN1 proteins might have played a role in rescuing <italic>pid</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mudgett et al., 2023</xref>). To further clarify the mechanisms of rescuing <italic>pid</italic> by heterozygous <italic>pin</italic>1 mutants, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to delete the coding region of <italic>PIN</italic>1 so that no truncated PIN1 proteins would be produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We obtained two <italic>pin</italic>1 mutants, which lacked almost the entire coding region of <italic>PIN</italic>1 and which were unlikely to produce any truncated PIN1 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The two <italic>pin</italic>1 mutants displayed strong pin-like phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). In the heterozygous <italic>pin</italic>1 mutant backgrounds, the <italic>pid</italic> null mutants no longer produced pin-like inflorescences and were able to set seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>).

Our data presented in this study are consistent with our previous hypothesis that PID/NPY1-mediated flower initiation uses a mechanism that is analogous to that of phototropism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2008</xref>). The hypothesis was based on the observation that three signaling components in phototropism have their homologous counterparts in the flower initiation pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In phototropism, blue light is perceived by phototropins (PHOT1 and PHOT2), which have two LOV domains in the N-terminal part and a kinase domain in the C-terminal part (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huala et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Christie et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harper et al., 2003</xref>). LOV domains function as photo-receptors that regulate the kinase activities of PHOT1 and PHOT2. The kinase domain of phototropins is highly homologous to PID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2007b</xref>). Downstream of the phototropins is NPH3, which is homologous to NPY1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Motchoulski and Liscum, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2007a</xref>). Phototropins are the starting point of phototropic signal transduction and are undoubtedly upstream of NPH3. Our genetic results unambiguously demonstrated that NPY1 functions downstream of PID (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), further strengthening the hypothesis that phototropism and PID/NPY1 use analogous mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In the dark, NPH3 is phosphorylated and forms a complex with PHOT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pedmale and Liscum, 2007</xref>). Upon receiving light, NPH3 is dephosphorylated and transiently dissociated from PHOT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Christie et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sullivan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haga and Sakai, 2023</xref>). Continuous light exposure leads to reconstituting the PHOT1-NPH3 complex and phosphorylation of NPH3 by PHOT1, suggesting that NPH3 phosphorylation by PHOT1 is rather complicated. We found that NPY1 is phosphorylated regardless of the presence of PID (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Moreover, we identified a predominant NPY1 phospho-peptide, which is located right after the NPH3 domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). It will be interesting to determine the biological consequences of the phosphorylation sites in NPY1 through mutagenesis. At present, we do not have evidence that PID uses NPY1 as a substrate. However, it is clear that PID has an impact on NPY1 accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Without PID, NPY1 accumulates significantly less (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The flower initiation pathway and phototropic pathway use analogous signaling mechanisms.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Plasma-membrane-localized phototropins perceive blue light, causing changes in phosphorylation status of NPH3 and NPH3-PHOT association.

It is not clear whether <italic>NPY1 OE</italic>-triggered phosphorylation of PINs inhibits auxin transport activity <italic>per se</italic> or disrupts protein-protein interactions between PINs and their partners or both.</p><p> Both <italic>NPY1 OE</italic> and <italic>NPY1∆C</italic> caused great changes in PIN phosphorylation, and the phosphorylation led to inhibition of PIN functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). However, <italic>NPY1 OE</italic> suppressed <italic>pid</italic> mutants, whereas <italic>NPY1∆C</italic> could not suppress <italic>pid</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>)<italic>,</italic> suggesting that inhibition of PIN functions per se is not sufficient for suppression of <italic>pid</italic>. It is known that PIN and NPY proteins physically interact to form protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Glanc et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Matthes et al., 2024</xref>). Our results suggest that the C-terminal domain of NPY1 likely interacts with an unknown protein, which is required for normal PID and PIN functions and which needs to be recruited to the NPY-PIN complexes.</p><p> In previous models regarding the mechanisms of PID, PIN1, and NPY1, the first step is direct phosphorylation of PINs by PID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Friml et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Michniewicz et al., 2007</xref>). Phosphorylated PINs recruit NPY1 to the plasma membrane to maintain PIN polarity by limiting lateral diffusion of the PIN complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Glanc et al., 2021</xref>). However, that overexpression of <italic>NPY1</italic> eliminates the need for <italic>PID</italic> in flower initiation and that overexpression of <italic>NPY1</italic> leads to phosphorylation of PIN proteins in the absence of PID are not consistent with the model that PIN1 needs to be directly phosphorylated by PID to be activated. The fact that <italic>pin1</italic> and <italic>pid</italic> displayed opposite cotyledon/leaf phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennett et al., 1995</xref>) and that <italic>pid</italic> is suppressed by heterozygous <italic>pin1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and PIN1-GFP<sub>HDR</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mudgett et al., 2023</xref>) demonstrated that PID and PIN1 function in opposite directions. Our results firmly established the relative positions of PID and NPY1 in the pathway responsible for flower initiation in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Moreover, we show that PIN1 functions downstream of NPY1, which recruits unknown kinase(s) to phosphorylate PIN1 and to inhibit PIN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). It will be interesting to test whether candidate protein kinases such as D6PK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Willige et al., 2013</xref>) are recruited by NPY1 to phosphorylate PIN proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

Protein solution was diluted eight times to 1 M urea with 100 mM Tris and digested with trypsin (Roche, 03708969001) for 12 hr. Cysteines were alkylated by adding 10 mM iodoacetamide and incubating at 37°C for 30 min in the dark.</p><p>Digested peptides were purified on a Waters Sep-Pak C18 cartridges, eluted with 60% acetonitrile.

TMT labeling efficiency was checked by LC-MS/MS to be greater than 99%. Labeled peptides from different samples were pooled together. 150 µg of pooled peptides were analyzed by 2D-nano-LC-MS/MS for total proteome profiling, and 1 mg of total peptides was used for phosphopeptide enrichment.</p><p>Phosphopeptide enrichment was performed using CeO<sub>2</sub> affinity capture. 20% colloidal CeO<sub>2</sub> (Sigma, 289744) was added to the acidified peptide solution (2% TFA/2M lactic acid/60% acetonitrile). After brief vortexing, CeO<sub>2</sub> with captured phosphopeptides was spun down at 5000×<italic>g</italic> for 1 min.

Column phases were a 10-cm-long reverse phase (RP1, 5 μm Zorbax SB-C18, Agilent), 6-cm-long strong cation exchange (SCX, 3 μm PolySulfoethyl, PolyLC), and 20-cm-long reverse phase 2 (RP2, ReproSil-Pur 120 C18-AQ, 1.9 µm), with the electrospray tip of the fused silica tubing pulled to a sharp tip.</p><p>Peptide mixtures were loaded onto RP1 using an off-line pressure chamber, and the three sections were joined for online 2D LC separation.

Automated data-dependent acquisition was employed for the top 20 ions, with an isolation window of 0.7 Da and collision energy of 35. Precursor Fit was set to 70% of fit threshold and 0.7 Da fit window. The mass resolution is set at 100,000 for MS and 30,000 for MS/MS scans, respectively. TurboTMT was enabled. Dynamic exclusion of 30 s was used to improve the duty cycle.</p><p>The raw data was extracted and searched using Spectrum Mill vBI.07 (Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard). MS/MS spectra with a sequence tag length of 1 or less were considered to be poor spectra and were discarded. The remaining high-quality MS/MS spectra were searched against <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> TAIR11 protein database. A 1:1 concatenated forward-reverse database was constructed to calculate the false discovery rate (FDR). Common contaminants such as trypsin and keratin were included in the protein database. There were 96,562 protein sequences in the final protein database. Search parameters were set to Spectrum Mill’s default settings with the enzyme parameter limited to full tryptic peptides with a maximum mis-cleavage of 1. Cutoff scores were dynamically assigned to each dataset to obtain the FDRs of 0.1% for peptides and 1% for proteins. Phosphorylation sites were localized to a particular amino acid within a peptide using the variable modification localization score in Spectrum Mill software. Proteins that share common peptides were grouped using principles of parsimony to address protein database redundancy. Total TMT reporter intensities were used for relative protein quantitation. Peptides shared among different protein groups were removed before TMT quantitation. Isotope impurities of TMT reagents were corrected using correction factors provided by the manufacturer (Thermo). Median normalization was performed to normalize the protein TMT reporter intensities in which the log ratios between different TMT tags were adjusted globally such that the median log ratio was zero.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Proteomics data deposition</title><p>The raw spectra for the proteome data have been deposited in the Mass Spectrometry Interactive Virtual Environment (MassIVE) repository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/static/massive.jsp">massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/static/massive.jsp</ext-link>, accession ID MSV000098241).

Micro vectorial auxin flows directed by PIN1 are essential to flower initiation, and loss of PIN1 or two of its regulators, PID and NPY1 (in a yucca-deficient background) phenocopies the pinformed phenotype. This group has previously shown that PID-PIN1 interactions and function are dosage-dependent. The authors pick up this thread by demonstrating that a heterozygote containing a CRISPR deletion of one copy of PIN1 can restore quasi-wild type floral initiation to pid.</p><p>The authors then show that overexpression of NPY1 is sufficient to more or less restore wild-type floral initiation to the pid mutant. The authors claim that this result demonstrates that NPY1 functions downstream of PID, as this ectopic abundance of NPY1 resulted in phosphorylation of PIN1 at sites that differ from sites of action of PID. The authors pursue evidence that PID action via NPY1 is analogous to the mode of action by which phot1/2 act on NPH3 in seedling phototropism. Such a model is supported by the evidence presented herein that the C terminus of NPY1, which has abundant Ser/Thr content, is phosphorylated, and that the deletion of this domain prevents overexpression compensation of the pinformed phenotype.</p><p>While the results presented support evidence in the literature that PID acts on NPY1 to regulate PIN1 function, it is also possible that NPY1 overexpression results in limited expansion of phosphorylation targets observed with other AGC kinases. And if the phot model is any indication, there may be other PID targets that modulate PIN1-dependent floral initiation.</p><p>However, overexpression of the NPY1 C-terminal deletion construct resulted in phosphorylation of both PIN1 and PIN2 and agravitropic root growth similar to what is observed in pin2 mutants. This suggests that direct PID phosphorylation of PINs and action via NPY1 can be distinguished by phosphorylation sites and by growth phenotypes.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>A very important effort that places NPY1 downstream of PID in floral initiation.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>As PID has been shown to act on sites that regulate PIN protein polarity as well as PIN protein function, it would be useful if the authors consider how their results would fit/not fit with a model where combinatorial function of NPY1 and PID regulate PIN1 in a manner similar to the way that PID appears to function combinatorially with D6PK on PIN3.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.108207.2.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Mudgett</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, San Diego</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">La Jolla</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Zhouxin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, San Diego</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">La Jolla</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kang</surname><given-names>Ruofan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, San Diego</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">La Jolla</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Dai</surname><given-names>Xinhua</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, San Diego</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">La Jolla</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Briggs</surname><given-names>Steven P</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California San Diego</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">La Jolla</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Yunde</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, San Diego</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">La Jolla</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors of this study propose a model in which NPY family regulators antagonize the activity of the pid mutation in the context of floral development and other auxin-related phenotypes.

Micro vectorial auxin flows directed by PIN1 are essential to flower initiation, and loss of PIN1 or two of its regulators, PID and NPY1 (in a yucca-deficient background) phenocopies the pinformed phenotype. This group has previously shown that PID-PIN1 interactions and function are dosage-dependent. The authors pick up this thread by demonstrating that a heterozygote containing a CRISPR deletion of one copy of PIN1 can restore quasi-wild type floral initiation to pid.</p><p>The authors then show that overexpression of NPY1 is sufficient to more or less restore wild-type floral initiation to the pid mutant. The authors claim that this result demonstrates that NPY1 functions downstream of PID, as this ectopic abundance of NPY1 resulted in phosphorylation of PIN1 at sites that differ from sites of action of PID. The authors pursue evidence that PID action via NPY1 is analogous to the mode of action by which phot1/2 act on NPH3 in seedling phototropism. Such a model is supported by the evidence presented herein that the C terminus of NPY1, which has abundant Ser/Thr content, is phosphorylated, and that the deletion of this domain prevents overexpression compensation of the pinformed phenotype.</p><p>While the results presented support evidence in the literature that PID acts on NPY1 to regulate PIN1 function, it is also possible that NPY1 overexpression results in limited expansion of phosphorylation targets observed with other AGC kinases. And if the phot model is any indication, there may be other PID targets that modulate PIN1-dependent floral initiation.</p><p>However, overexpression of the NPY1 C-terminal deletion construct resulted in phosphorylation of both PIN1 and PIN2 and agravitropic root growth similar to what is observed in pin2 mutants. This suggests that direct PID phosphorylation of PINs and action via NPY1 can be distinguished by phosphorylation sites and by growth phenotypes.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>A very important effort that places NPY1 downstream of PID in floral initiation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>As PID has been shown to act on sites that regulate PIN protein polarity as well as PIN protein function, it would be useful if the authors consider how their results would fit/not fit with a model where combinatorial function of NPY1 and PID regulate PIN1 in a manner similar to the way that PID appears to function combinatorially with D6PK on PIN3</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that we do not have a complete picture of how NPY, PID, PIN work together to control flower initiation. Some aspects of our results are difficult to reconcile with the model of PIN1 and PID acting in tandem, i.e., by PID directly phosphorylating and activating PIN1. Indeed, our results suggest that PIN1 and PID have opposite effects on organogenesis. For example, heterozygous pin1 (or PIN1-GFP<sub>HDR,</sub> which is presumably less active than wild type PIN1) suppresses the pid phenotype. Moreover, pid and pin1 have opposite effects on cotyledon number and true leaf number. Mutations in PID lead to more cotyledons and more true leaves than WT whereas pin1 mutants make fewer cotyledons and fewer true leaves than WT (Bennett SRM, Alvarez J, Bossinger G, Smyth DR (1995) Morphogenesis in pinoid mutants of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. The Plant Journal 8: 505-520). We have elaborated on this point in the last paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p>The genetic materials we have generated may allow us to uncover additional components in the pathway from forward genetic screens, which may eventually lead to a clear picture.</p></body></sub-article></article>
