biological basis for mutual exclusivity of <italic>KRAS</italic> and <italic>EGFR</italic> mutations. We have now defined the biochemical events responsible for the toxic effects by combining pharmacological and genetic approaches and to show that signaling through extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) mediates the toxicity. These findings imply that tumors with mutant oncogenes in the RAS pathway must restrain the activity of ERK1/2 to avoid toxicities and enable tumor growth. A dual specificity phosphatase, DUSP6, that negatively regulates phosphorylation of (P)-ERK is up-regulated in EGFR- or KRAS-mutant LUAD, potentially protecting cells with mutations in the RAS signaling pathway, a proposal supported by experiments with <italic>DUSP6</italic>-specific siRNA and an inhibitory drug. Targeting DUSP6 or other negative regulators might offer a treatment strategy for certain cancers by inducing the toxic effects of RAS-mediated signaling.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>KRAS</kwd><kwd>EGFR</kwd><kwd>DUSP6</kwd><kwd>mutual exclusivity</kwd><kwd>synthetic lethality</kwd><kwd>feedback inhibition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJT-148725</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lockwood</surname><given-names>William W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004376</institution-id><institution>Terry Fox Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lockwood</surname><given-names>William W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000245</institution-id><institution>Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Scholar Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lockwood</surname><given-names>William W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Varmus</surname><given-names>Harold</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Meyer Cancer Center at Weill Cornell Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Varmus</surname><given-names>Harold</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>BC Cancer Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lockwood</surname><given-names>William W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cancer cells driven by mutations in KRAS or EGFR are dependent on DUSP6 to prevent ERK-induced cell death, creating a novel vulnerability for targeted therapy.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Extensive characterization of cancer genomes has begun to change the classification of neoplasms and the choice of therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Garraway and Lander, 2013</xref>). The genetic profiles of most cancers are notoriously heterogeneous, often including thousands of mutations affecting genes with a wide range of credentials---from those well-known to drive oncogenic behavior to those not known to have a role in pathogenesis. Moreover, cancers continue to accumulate mutations during carcinogenesis, producing tumor subclones with selectable features such as drug resistance or enhanced growth potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McGranahan and Swanton, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Despite this heterogeneity, consistent patterns have been observed, such as the high frequency of gain-of-function or loss-of-function mutations affecting specific proto-oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes in cancers that arise in certain cell lineages. Conversely, coincident mutations in certain genes are rare, even when those genes are frequently mutated individually in specific types of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kandoth et al., 2013</xref>). Examples of these ‘mutually exclusive’ pairs of mutations have been reported in a variety of cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yoshida et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Unni et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Petti et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sensi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Varmus et al., 2016</xref>); the mutual exclusivity has usually been attributed either to a loss of a selective advantage of a mutation in one gene after a change in the other has occurred (‘functional redundancy’) or to the toxicity (including ‘synthetic lethality’) conferred by the coexistence of both mutations in the same cells.</p><p>We recently reported that the mutual exclusivity of gain-of-function mutations of <italic>EGFR</italic> and <italic>KRAS</italic>, two proto-oncogenes often individually mutated in lung adenocarcinomas (LUADs), can be explained by such synthetic toxicity, despite the fact that products of these two genes operate in overlapping signaling pathways and might have been mutually exclusive because of functional redundancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Unni et al., 2015</xref>). Support for the idea that the mutual exclusivity of <italic>KRAS</italic> and <italic>EGFR</italic> mutations is synthetically toxic in LUAD cells was based largely on experiments in which we used doxycycline (dox) to induce expression of mutant <italic>EGFR</italic> or <italic>KRAS</italic> alleles controlled by a tetracycline (tet)-responsive regulatory apparatus in LUAD cell lines containing endogenous mutations in the other gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Unni et al., 2015</xref>). When we forced mutual expression of the pair of mutant proteins, the cells exhibited signs of RAS-induced toxicity, such as macropinocytosis and cell death. In addition, we observed increased phosphorylation of several proteins known to operate in the extensive signaling network downstream of RAS, implying that excessive signaling, driven by the conjunction of hyperactive EGFR and KRAS proteins, might be responsible for the observed toxicity.</p><p>Recognizing that such synthetic toxicities might be exploited for therapeutic purposes, we have extended our studies of signaling via the EGFR-RAS axis, with the goal of better understanding the biochemical events that are responsible for the previously observed toxicity in LUAD cell lines. In the work reported here, we have used a variety of genetic and pharmacological approaches to seek evidence that identifies critical mediators of the previously observed toxicities. Based on several concordant findings, we argue that activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1 and ERK2), serine/threonine kinases in the EGFR-RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway, is a critical event in the generation of toxicity, and we show that at least one feedback inhibitor of the pathway, the dual specificity phosphatase, DUSP6, is a potential target for therapeutic inhibitors that could mimic the synthetic toxicity that we previously reported.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Synthetic lethality induced by co-expression of mutant KRAS and EGFR is mediated through increased ERK signaling</title><p>In previous work, we established that mutant EGFR and mutant KRAS are not tolerated in the same cell (synthetic lethality), by placing one of these two oncogenes under the control of an inducible promoter in cell lines carrying a mutant allele of the other oncogene. These experiments provided a likely explanation for the pattern of mutual exclusivity in LUAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Unni et al., 2015</xref>). While we documented several changes in cellular signaling upon induction of the second oncogene to produce toxicity, we did not establish if there is a node (or nodes) in the signaling network sensed by the cell as intolerable when both oncoproteins are produced. If such a node exists, we might be able to prevent toxicity by down-modulating the levels of activity; conversely, we might be able to exploit identification of that node to compromise or kill cancer cells.</p><p>To seek critical nodes in the RAS signaling pathway, we extended our previous study using the LUAD cell line we previously characterized (PC9, bearing the EGFR mutation, E746_A750del) and two additional LUAD lines, H358 and H1975. H358 cells express mutant KRAS (G12C), and H1975 cells express mutant EGFR (L858R/T790M). As in our earlier work, we introduced tet-regulated, mutant <italic>KRAS</italic> (G12V) into these lines to regulate mutant KRAS in an inducible manner and used the same vector encoding GFP rather than KRAS as a control. This single-vector system includes rtTA constitutively expressed from a ubiquitin promoter, allowing us to induce KRAS with the addition of dox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Meerbrey et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>KRAS or GFP were appropriately induced after adding dox to the growth medium used for these cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To establish whether induction of a mutant <italic>KRAS</italic> transgene is detrimental to H358 cells producing endogenous mutant KRAS or H1975 cells producing mutant EGFR proteins, we cultured cell lines in dox for 7 days and measured the relative numbers of viable cells with Alamar blue. As we previously showed, the number of viable PC9 cells is reduced by inducing mutant KRAS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Similarly, when mutant KRAS was induced in either H358 or H1975 cells for seven days, we observed fewer viable cells compared to cells grown without dox or to cells in which GFP was induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These results indicate that increased activity of the RAS pathway, either in LUAD cells with an endogenous <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation (H358 cells) or with an endogenous <italic>EGFR</italic> mutation (PC9 and H1975 cells) is toxic to these cell lines.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33718.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Induction of mutant KRAS reduces the numbers of viable lung cancer cells harboring KRAS or EGFR mutations, and the effects can be rescued by inhibiting ERK (<bold>A</bold>) Reduced numbers of viable LUAD cells after activation of KRAS.</title><p>Production of GFP or KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> was induced by addition of 100 ng/mL dox in the indicated three cell lines as described in Methods.

We used a phospho-protein array to assess the status of protein activation more broadly after KRAS induction, using PC9-tetO-KRAS cells after 1 and 5 days of dox treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). After 5 days, we again observed increases in P-JNK, P-p38, and P-ERK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting that three major branches of the MAPK pathway are activated after extended induction of mutant KRAS. In addition, several other proteins show enhanced phosphorylation at this time. At 24 hr after addition of dox, however, only P-ERK and P-AKT show a pronounced increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Specifically, the stress kinases, JNK and p38, were not detected as phosphorylated proteins with the protein array. A possible interpretation of these findings is that ERK may be phosphorylated relatively soon after induction of mutant KRAS, with subsequent phosphorylation (and activation) of stress kinases and several other proteins. We also observed increased phosphorylation of ERK 24 hr after induction of mutant KRAS by western blot in all three LUAD cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In H358 and in H1975-based cell systems we observed persistently increased levels of P-ERK and, ultimately, the presence of cleaved PARP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We previously reported multiple mechanisms of RAS-induced toxicity in PC9-tetO-KRAS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Unni et al., 2015</xref>). Based on the cleavage of PARP in the studies shown here, apoptosis appears to be at least one of the mechanisms of reduced viability in H358 and H1975 cell lines.</p><p>The results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> suggest that ERK itself could be the signaling node that causes a loss of viable cells when inappropriately activated. As one test of this hypothesis, we used trametinib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gilmartin et al., 2011</xref>), an inhibitor of MEK, the kinase that phosphorylates ERK, to ask whether reduced levels of P-ERK would protect cells from the toxicity caused by induction of mutant KRAS. In all three LUAD cell lines, trametinib completely or partially rescued the loss of viable cells caused by induction of mutant KRAS by dox (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We confirmed that doses of trametinib that protected cells from the toxic effects of seven days of treatment with dox were associated with reduced levels of P-ERK after 24 hr of induction of mutant KRAS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). A PI3K inhibitor, buparlisib, did not rescue mutant KRAS-induced lethality in H358-tetO-KRAS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), implying that the toxic effects of KRAS are not mediated by enhanced signaling via PI3K.</p><p>To extend these findings and further challenge the hypothesis that P-ERK is an important node in the cell signaling network downstream of KRAS that confers cell toxicity, we transduced LUAD cell lines with retroviral vectors encoding shRNAs that ‘knock down’ expression of ERK1 or ERK2. Using two different shRNAs for each gene, as well as a non-targeted shRNA vector as control, we stably reduced the levels of ERK1 or ERK2 in the three LUAD cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). When PC9 and H358 lines were treated with dox to assess the effects of ERK1 or ERK2 knockdowns on the loss of viable cells, we found that depletion of ERK2, but not ERK1, rescued cells from KRAS toxicity after 7 days in dox (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In H1975 cells, however, neither knockdown of ERK1 nor of ERK2 prevented KRAS-induced cell toxicity. Since trametinib rescues the number of viable cells after induction of KRAS in H1975 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), it seemed possible that either ERK1 or ERK2 might be sufficient to mediate RAS-induced toxicity in this line. In that case, it would be necessary to reduce the levels or the activity of both ERK proteins to rescue H1975 cells from toxicity. We tested this idea by treating dox-induced H1975-tetO-KRAS cells with SCH772984 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Morris et al., 2013</xref>), a drug that inhibits the kinase activity of both ERK1 and ERK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). As we observed with the MEK inhibitor, trametinib, in other lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, far right), the ERK inhibitor reduces KRAS-associated toxicity in H1975 cells with concomitant reductions of P-ERK1 and P-ERK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><p>To examine this issue in a different way, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen to evaluate mechanisms of mutant KRAS-induced toxicity in an unbiased manner. After growing H358-tetO-KRAS cells for 7 days following introduction of the appropriate vectors carrying Cas9 and a library of DNA encoding gene-targeted RNAs (see Materials and methods), guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting ERK2 (MAPK1) was highly enriched in cells grown in the presence of doxycycline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Guide RNA targeting RAF1 (CRAF) was also significantly enriched. Data from this CRISPR-Cas9 genome-wide screen strongly suggests that depletion of critical proteins in the RTK-RAS pathway can mitigate the toxicity induced by excess RAS activation. Collectively, our data suggest that LUAD cell lines are sensitive to inappropriate hyperactivation of the ERK signaling node and that toxicity mediated by activation of the RAS pathway is ERK-dependent.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>DUSP6 is a major regulator of negative feedback, expressed in LUAD cells, and associated with KRAS and EGFR mutations and with high P-ERK levels</title><p>The evidence that hyperactive ERK signaling has toxic effects on LUAD cells raises the possibility that cancers driven by mutations in the RAS pathway may have a mechanism to ‘buffer’ P-ERK levels and thereby avoid reaching a lethal signaling threshold.

One way to reconcile this apparent discrepancy is to examine the kinetics of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of ERK after manipulation of the abundance of DUSP6 and its resulting effects on RAS signaling.

While there was no correlation between sensitivity to DUSP6 knockdown and basal DUSP6 protein levels, KRAS or EGFR mutant cell lines demonstrate higher P-ERK levels and/or a high P-ERK to DUSP6 protein ratio that could contribute to P-ERK hyperactivity and the subsequent decrease in cell viability after inhibition of DUSP6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>-figure supplement D,E,F). Lastly, as described above, reduction of ERK1 or ERK2 levels with shRNAs in EGFR-mutant PC9 cells partially rescued the decreased cell viability caused by DUSP6 knockdown, suggesting that ERK – at least in part - mediates the toxic effects of DUSP6 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G,H,I</xref>).

However, blocking synthesis of DUSP6 efficiently with siRNA is difficult, in part because reduced levels of DUSP6 lead to increased levels of phosphorylated ERK, stimulating a subsequent increase in <italic>DUSP6</italic> mRNA. As <italic>DUSP6</italic> mRNA rises, more siRNA may be required to sustain the reduction of DUSP6. Based on this negative feedback cycle, we reasoned that pharmacological inhibition of the enzymatic activity of DUSP6 would be more effective. A small molecule inhibitor of DUSP6, (E)−2-benzylidene-3-(cyclohexylamino)−2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-one (BCI), was identified through an in vivo chemical screen for activators of fibroblast growth factor signaling in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Molina et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Korotchenko et al., 2014</xref>). BCI inhibits DUSP6 allosterically, binding near the active site of the phosphatase, inhibiting activation of the catalytic site after binding to its substrate, ERK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Molina et al., 2009</xref>). BCI also selectively inhibits DUSP1, which, like DUSP6, has catalytic activity dependent on substrate binding. However, as demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <italic>DUSP1</italic> is not significantly up-regulated in LUADs with <italic>EGFR</italic> or <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated knockdown of DUSP1, as opposed to knockdown of DUSP6, has no effect on viability of EGFR-mutant H1975 cells, suggesting that DUSP6 should be the main target of BCI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).</p><p>We tested 11 lung cancer cell lines - 8 with a <italic>KRAS</italic> or <italic>EGFR</italic> mutation and 3 with no known activating mutations in these genes – with a dosing strategy covering the previously determined active range of the drug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shojaee et al., 2015</xref>). We predicted that cancer lines with mutations in <italic>KRAS</italic> or <italic>EGFR</italic> would be more sensitive to the potential effects of BCI treatment on numbers of viable cells, since DUSP6 would be required to restrain the toxic effects of P-ERK in these cells.

To test this proposal, we measured total ERK and P-ERK after BCI treatment in sensitive and insensitive cell lines. A subset of the most sensitive cell lines, H358 (KRAS mutant) and PC9 and H1975 (EGFR mutants), demonstrated a large, dose-dependent increase in P-ERK in response to BCI treatment, with appreciable increases observed even at the lowest doses tested (1 uM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). This induction of P-ERK precedes the appearance of cleaved PARP and cell death, as indicated by a time course of observations after BCI treatment in KRAS-mutant H358 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Likewise, another sensitive cell line, A549 (KRAS mutant), demonstrated an increase in P-ERK, albeit at higher BCI concentrations, consistent with a less acute BCI sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4C,D</xref>). Conversely, BCI did not induce increases in P-ERK in the insensitive cell lines HCC95 and H1648, even at the highest levels of BCI (10 uM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). Importantly, cell lines sensitive to BCI were also dependent on sustained P-ERK signaling for survival, as the MEK inhibitor trametinib, while effectively reducing P-ERK in all cell lines, reduced cell viability to a greater degree in BCI- sensitive lines (H358 and PC9) compared to BCI-insensitive lines (H1648 and HCC95; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>). Thus, the oncogenic mutation profile and dependency on activation of the EGFR-RAS-ERK pathway correlates with dependence on DUSP6 activity. These correlations are likely to reflect the central significance of P-ERK as a determinant of cell growth and viability.</p><p>To confirm whether P-ERK is involved in regulation of BCI-mediated cell death, we treated KRAS mutant H358 cells with a combination of BCI and the ERK1/2 inhibitor VX-11E, predicting that simultaneous inhibition of DUSP6 and ERK would mitigate the toxic effects of BCI treatment. Unlike other ERK inhibitors such as SCH772984, VX-11E does not block ERK phosphorylation, but instead limits ERK activity following phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chaikuad et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with this, while no difference in P-ERK induction was observed, VX-11E treatment limited BCI- induced phosphorylation of the downstream ERK target RSK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>). In addition, treatment with VX-11E lead to a relative increase in the number of viable cells after BCI treatment in a dose-dependent manner, with higher VX-11E concentrations demonstrating less decline in viability in response to BCI compared to lower doses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Together, these data suggest that ERK activation plays a vital role in mediating the inhibitory effects of BCI treatment in KRAS or EGFR mutant lung cancer cells.</p><p>To further understand BCI-mediated toxicity, we searched for potential resistance mechanisms through an unbiased, genome-wide CRISPR screen of the type described earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). If loss of genes targeted by guide RNA confers resistance, that can reveal the nature of the pathway being targeted, since inhibited expression of the gene mitigates the effects of the drug. We performed this screen in H460 cells that are mutant (Q61H) for KRAS and sensitive to BCI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In the screen, we found that sgRNAs targeting KRAS were significantly enriched in <italic>KRAS</italic>-mutated H460 cells upon treatment with BCI compared to untreated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Guide RNA targeting <italic>KRAS</italic> were depleted in the absence of drug suggesting a dependence on mutant KRAS in this cell line. These results suggest that KRAS pathway activity is a major determinant of sensitivity to BCI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref>). To validate these results, we cloned two individual sgRNAs targeting <italic>KRAS</italic> and transduced H460 cells. After 7 days of puromycin selection, the polyclonal population was evaluated for KRAS depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H</xref>). The KRAS-targeted and control H460 cells were treated at this time point with a dose response of BCI for 72 hr. Cells that contained sgRNAs against <italic>KRAS</italic> were less sensitive to BCI than cells containing control sgRNA and un-manipulated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1I</xref>).</p><p>We also generated two clones of DUSP6-deficient H358 cells using CRISPR-Cas9 and independent guide RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1J</xref>). Unexpectedly, both clones remained responsive to BCI’s cell killing activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1K</xref>). These results may be explained by the presence of DUSP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1J</xref>) and the reported activity of BCI against DUSP1 in addition to DUSP6. Further studies will be required to ascertain if these cells are still dependent on P-ERK for BCI-mediated sensitivity through DUSP1 or through another mechanism. While BCI sensitivity may not be solely due to DUSP6, our genome-wide screen for resistance to BCI suggests activation of the RAS pathway is at least partly required.</p><p>To further test RAS pathway dependency and its relation to BCI sensitivity, we predicted that stimulating the EGFR-RAS-ERK pathway in a BCI-insensitive cell line would make the cells more dependent on DUSP6 activity and more sensitive to BCI. Using HCC95 lung squamous carcinoma cells, which express relatively high levels of wild-type EGFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), we showed that EGF increased the levels of both P-EGFR and P-ERK, confirming activation of the relevant signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, BCI further enhanced the levels of P-ERK, especially in the EGF-treated cells, with dose-dependent increases; these findings are similar to those observed in cell lines with <italic>EGFR</italic> or <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). After pretreatment with EGF (100 ng/mL) for ten days and treating the cells with increasing doses of BCI to inhibit DUSP6, 3 uM BCI reduced the number of viable HCC95 cells by approximately 40% compared to the control culture that did not receive EGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This outcome implies that prolonged EGF treatment and subsequent activation of P-ERK signaling makes HCC95 cells dependent on DUSP6 activity, as also observed in cell lines with <italic>EGFR</italic> or <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that LUAD cells with <italic>KRAS</italic> or <italic>EGFR</italic> mutations are sensitive to BCI because the drug acutely increases P-ERK beyond a tolerable threshold in a manner analogous to the synthetic lethality we previously described in LUAD lines after co-expression of mutant KRAS and EGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Unni et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33718.010</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title><italic>EGF-mediated activation of ERK signaling leads to dependence on DUSP6.</italic></title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) EGF increases P-ERK in HCC95 cells.

There are reports of exceptions to this mutual exclusivity but these arise in conditions that include inhibition of EGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blakely et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ramalingam et al., 2018</xref>). This is to be expected, as cells treated with kinase inhibitors are not experiencing the effects of both oncogenes (i.e. mutant EGFR and mutant KRAS). A cancer cell that has not been exposed to inhibitors (e.g. against mutant EGFR) could arise, particularly at an advanced stage of disease, with activating mutations in both EGFR and KRAS; but we would anticipate that other events—like decreased RAS-GTP levels---might prevent P-ERK from reaching toxic levels.</p><p>Despite the possible exceptions, it remains critical to understand why, based on the pattern of mutual exclusion, cells are generally unable to tolerate the combination of these two oncogenes more readily. And what are the biochemical mechanisms by which the toxicity is mediated, might be modulated to avoid lethality, or could be exploited therapeutically? To address these questions, we began by regulating the expression of mutant <italic>KRAS</italic> in LUAD cell lines carrying mutant <italic>RAS</italic> or <italic>EGFR</italic> alleles. The levels of RAS activation in these cells are not expected to mirror what is found in tumors; these levels presumably will exceed what tumors can tolerate. We suggest that tumor cells could experience this state during progression, particularly when co-mutations in the RAS pathway have occurred. Understanding how the toxicity arises provides insight into mutual exclusivity and how limits for RAS activation may be set and exploited in cancer cells.</p><p>Our efforts to answer these questions have led to the conclusions that the toxicity is mediated through the hyperactivity of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and that inhibition of DUSP6 may re-create the toxicity through the role of this phosphatase as a negative regulator of ERK1/2. Several results reported here support these conclusions: (i) the previously reported toxicity that results from co-expression of mutant <italic>EGFR</italic> and mutant <italic>KRAS</italic> is accompanied by an early increase in the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, and the effects can be attenuated by inhibiting MEK (which phosphorylates and activates ERK1/2) or by reducing ERK levels with inhibitory RNAs; (ii) DUSP6, a phosphatase known to be a feedback inhibitor of ERK activity, is present at relatively high levels in LUADs with <italic>EGFR</italic> and <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations; and (iii) inhibition of DUSP6, either by introduction of siRNAs or by treatment with the drug BCI, reduces the number of viable LUAD cells with <italic>EGFR</italic> or <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations or of BCI-resistant cells exposed to EGF.</p><p>Taken in concert, these findings support a general hypothesis about cell signaling. Activation of a biochemical signal from a critical node, such as ERK, in a signaling pathway must rise to a certain level to drive neoplastic changes in cell behavior; if signal intensity falls below that level, the cells may revert to a normal phenotype or initiate cell death as a manifestation of what is often called ‘oncogene addiction” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nissan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Weinstein et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dow et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Varmus et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sharma et al., 2006</xref>). Conversely, if the intensity of signaling rises to exceed a higher threshold, the cells may display a variety of toxic effects, including senescence, vacuolization, or apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Unni et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Serrano et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Joneson and Bar-Sagi, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Overmeyer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhu et al., 1998</xref>). In this model, two approaches to cancer therapy can be envisioned: (i) blocks to signaling that reverse the oncogenic phenotype or induce the apoptosis associated with oncogene addiction, or (ii) enhancements of signaling that cause selective toxicity in cells with pre-existing oncogenic mutations, a form of synthetic lethality that depends on changes that produce a gain rather than a loss of function. The former is exemplified by using inhibitors of EGFR kinase activity to induce remissions in LUAD with EGFR mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lynch et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Paez et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pao et al., 2004</xref>). Based on the findings presented here, the latter strategy might be pursued by using inhibitors of DUSP6 or other negative feedback regulators to block its usual attenuation of signals emanating from activated ERK1/2.</p><p>Several factors are likely to determine the threshold for producing the cell toxicity driven by hyperactive signaling nodes, such as ERKs, in cancer cells.

All such factors would need to be considered in the design of therapeutic strategies to generate signal intensities that are intolerable specifically in cancer cells. DUSP6 is a well-established negative regulator of ERK activation in a normal cellular context (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Keyse, 2008</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Theodosiou and Ashworth, 2002</xref>), so it is perhaps not surprising that this protein appears to have a critical role in persistently limiting ERK activation, even in a pathological context such as cancer.</p><p>The findings presented here, as well as recent results from others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shojaee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leung et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wittig-Blaich et al., 2017</xref>), support several underlying features of a therapeutic strategy based on inordinate signaling activity involving RAS proteins: that the activity of ERK needs to be actively controlled in cancer cells of diverse tissue origins; that hyperactivation of ERK can be deleterious to cells; and that inhibition of negative regulators like DUSP6 can create a toxic cellular state. This leads to the hypothesis that cancer cells <italic>dependent</italic> on ERK signaling have an active RTK-RAS-RAF-MEK pathway that produces levels of activated (phosphorylated) ERK1/2 that <italic>require</italic> attenuation. In other words, ERK-dependent tumor cells, including cancers driven by mutant RTK, RAS, BRAF, or MEK proteins, will have a vulnerability to hyperactivated ERK and that vulnerability can potentially be exploited by inhibition of feedback regulators like DUSP6.</p><p>Relevant to this concept are recent studies that address ‘drug addiction’ whereby cells lose viability when the inhibitor (e.g. vemurafenib) is removed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Das Thakur et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moriceau et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sun et al., 2014</xref>). These scenarios, in which an additional mutation can arise in the RTK-RAS-RAF-MEK pathway, create conditions similar to those we have modeled, once the inhibitor is removed. Additionally, Hata et al. have shown that mutations can arise while cells are exposed to a drug; as mentioned above, such mutations might appear to violate patterns of mutual exclusivity but the pattern only arose because of pathway down-modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hata et al., 2016</xref>) Recently, Leung et al. have found a similar dependency on ERK activation limits in mutant BRAF-driven melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leung et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The mechanisms of cell toxicity that arise from hyper-activation of ERK are likely to be diverse. We previously documented autophagy, apoptosis and macropinocytosis in cells expressing mutant EGFR and mutant KRAS, and others have described parthanatos and pseudosenescence as mechanisms for cell death from hyper-activation of ERK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hong et al., 2018</xref>). ERK-dependent processes may differ from cell type to cell type based on mutation profiles and cellular state at the time of ERK activation. This same dependence on ERK (ERK2 specifically) has been documented for senescence when mutant RAS is introduced into normal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shin et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The hypothesis that DUSP6 regulates ERK activity in the presence of signaling through the RAS pathway is particularly attractive in view of the frequency of <italic>RAS</italic> gene mutations in human cancers and the difficulties of targeting mutant RAS proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Simanshu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Papke and Der, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Downward, 2015</xref>). Because DUSP6 directly controls the activities of ERK1 and ERK2, rather than proteins further upstream in the signaling pathway, it appears to be well-situated for controlling both the signal delivered to ERK through the activation of RAS and the signal emitted by phosphorylated ERK. Recently, Wittig-Blaich et al. have also found that inhibition of DUSP6 by siRNA was toxic in melanoma cells carrying mutant BRAF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wittig-Blaich et al., 2017</xref>). Inhibition of other DUSPs, like DUSP5, that regulate ERK1 and ERK2 may create similar vulnerabilities and should be explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kidger and Keyse, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kidger et al., 2017</xref>). These ideas should provoke searches for inhibitors of DUSPs and other feedback inhibitors of this signaling pathway, as well as experiments that better define the downstream mediators and the consequences of non-attenuated ERK signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines and culture conditions</title><p>PC9 (PC-9), H358 (NCI-H358), H1975 (NCI-H1975), H1648 (NCI-H1648), A549, H460 (NCI-H460), H23 (NCI-H23), H2122 (NCI-H2122), H1650 (NCI-H1650), H2009 (NCI-H2009), H2030 (NCI-H2030), H1437 (NCI-H1437) and HCC95 cells were obtained from American Type Tissue Culture (ATCC) or were a kind gift from Dr. Adi Gazdar (UTSW) or Dr. Romel Somwar (MSKCC).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom (Thomas Look) is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this letter to express the many issues that we feel must be addressed if this work is to advance to publication.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript Unni et al., describe their work on understanding the mechanism leading to cytotoxicity following forced overexpression of KRAS in LUAD cell lines harboring EGFR or KRAS mutations. They conclude that such toxicity owes to hyperactivation of pERK, which occurs through DUSP6. They show that MEK/ERK inhibitor treatment rescues the effect of forced overexpression while reducing the levels of pERK and that DUSP6 mRNA levels are increased in LUAD harboring EGFR or KRAS mutations relative to those with a wild type status of these proteins. Genetic or pharmacologic targeting of DUSP was found to induce pERK (transiently) and lead to diminished cell proliferation in EGFR/KRAS mutant cell lines but not in those with a wild type status. While overall the findings are intriguing, there are gaps in the experimental evidence provided which bias their conclusions. If the authors can address the issues noted below however this could be a very interesting article.</p><p>We have the following suggestions to improve the manuscript. For clarity, we address below the essential revisions related to the results presented in each figure.</p><p>1) Figure 1 a) Figure 1A: The expression level of tet-driven ectopic KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> is very high in each of the three lung adenocarcinoma lines. The authors should demonstrate by western blotting whether these levels are comparable to endogenous KRAS levels found in lung adenocarcinoma lines. Studies from Tyler Jacks on mutant KRAS in knockin mice over 10 years ago emphasized the importance of expression levels of mutant KRAS to mediate transformation in lung adenocarcinoma. Massive overexpression of KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> can induce senescence rather than transformation in most cell types.</p><p>b) Figure 1D: The trametinib/SCH984 experiments in Figure 1D require additional appropriate controls; the authors should show the effect of treatment in the absence of dox stimulation. Also, why are different concentrations of trametinib used?</p><p>c) In addition to the biochemistry and cell count data shown in each panel of Figure 1, straightforward studies need to be done to establish the cellular mechanism underlying the cell growth phenotype. Before and after induction of KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> using dox, studies of cell cycle progression by DNA flow cytometry, for β-GAL expression assays should be done to assess senescence, and cleaved caspase 3, TUNEL and PARP cleavage assays should be done to assess apoptosis. The reduction of cell number 7-days after dox induction of KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> of ~ 20-40 percent of control could be due to growth arrest, senescence or apoptosis. This will be important to establish with regard to the author's interpretation that over activation of ERK leads to synthetic lethality. The need for studies of cellular phenotype in the context of the experiments shown in Figure 1 apply broadly to experiments throughout the paper.</p><p>d) Does overexpression of KRASG12C in EGFR or KRAS WT cells also induce toxicity which can be mitigated by co-treatment with trametinib in cells with no activating mutations in EGFR-RAS-ERK pathway? The levels of overexpressed KRASG12C are so high that such levels could induce toxicity by exceeding the upper threshold of RAS-mediated signaling even in cells without hyperactive EGFR-KRAS-ERK signaling.</p><p>e) Since the main claim is that hyperactivation of ERK leads to toxicity, the authors ought to replicate their dox-inducible experiments with active ERK to show that these also lead to cytotoxicity. Also, just because inhibiting MEK/ERK reverses the some of the phenotype in plastic, this doesn't exclude that other RAS effectors are also involved (see induction of pAKT in addition to pERK in Figure 1B). The authors should thus carry out similar siRNA or inhibitor studies to demonstrate that the cytotoxic effects of KRAS overexpression are not due to pAKT.</p><p>2) Figure 2 a) Figure 2A: There should be symbols under the heat map denoting which tumors are KRAS mutant and which are EFGR mutant. Are there any tumors with ALK/ROS1/RET activation by translocation? Are there tumors with NF1, MET and BRAF mutations? These should be addressed since most of lung adenocarcinoma have activation of RTK/RAS/RAF pathway (TCGA, 2014) and increased dusp6 is among the five gene signatures to predict poor outcome (Chen et al., 2007).</p><p>b) After describing the emergence of DUSP6 as a key gene responding to activated ERK based on their own studies, the authors should put their findings of DUSP6 elevated expression in the context of previous work. It has been known for over 10 years that DUSP6 is transcriptionally regulated by ERK-responsive ETS transcription factors downstream of MAPK activation and that DUSP6 serves as a major negative feedback regulator of ERK signaling (Reffas et al., 2000; Kawakami et al., 2003; Eblaghie et al., 2003; Li et al., 2007; Ekerot et al., 2008; Furukawa et al., 2008; Jurek et al., 2009).</p><p>c) Figure 2B and C: For these panels, please show separate data categories for KRAS mutant and EGFR mutant tumors. The box plots shown do not really look statistically significantly different. The medians are close, and the quartiles are largely overlapping. Which statistical test was used to show significant differences? Has a biostatistician been consulted about whether parametric or non-parametric tests would be better for these comparisons? A detailed statistical section is needed in the Materials and methods section, outlining the statistical tests used for the data shown in each figure.</p><p>d) In Figure 2 A-C, the authors must also include the correlation between DUSP6 and P-p38 and p-JNK to show the readers that no correlation exists between them.</p><p>e) Figure 2D: Please provide information or citations about the mouse models used in this figure.</p><p>f) Figure 2E: The Material/Methods description about this experiment seems to be missing. Expression levels need to be shown of the transduced onco-proteins by Western blot to verify overexpression.</p><p>g) Figure 2G and H: Same comments as 2B and C.</p><p>3) Figure 3 a) Figure 3A: Only one siRNA was used for DUSP6 or EGFR and there is no rescue experiment to prove that the effect is due to knockdown of the intended target. DUSP6 de-phosphorylates ERK so ERK phosphorylation is expected to be increased with DUSP6 knockdown. Please explain why Figure 3A shows the opposite with reduced p-ERK after siDUSP6 knockdown.</p><p>b) Figure 3A: Can the toxicity mediated by DUSP6 knockdown in PC9 cells be reduced by co-treatment with trametinib (Figure 3A)? This would help confirm that toxicity caused by depletion of DUSP6 in these cells is due to increased pERK levels.</p><p>c) Figure 3B: PC9 cells in this panel show increased p-ERK after DUSP6 kd. Please explain why this is the opposite result compared to Panel A.</p><p>d) Figure 3B and C: Did the authors determine if the levels of DUSP6 in their EGFR and KRAS wild-type cell lines, HCC95 and H1648, are not as high as in the cell lines with EGFR or KRAS activating mutations? Lower levels of DUSP6 would indicate that these cells do not need to have similar buffering ability as the EGFR or KRAS mutant cell lines and would be consistent with their findings in Figure 2. In Figure 3B, it seems that DUSP6 is also buffering the pERK levels in HCC95 because knockdown of DUSP6 increases the levels of pERK in these cells by over 1.5 fold, similar to the cells with EGFR or KRAS activating mutations; but this increase in pERK has no impact on the cell survival (Figure 3C). This needs to be reconciled with the authors' main claim.</p><p>e) There seems to be a disconnect between the first part of the manuscript, where the authors describe the mechanism of toxicity caused by forced overexpression of KRAS and the second part, where they describe the effect of DUSP inhibition in cell lines with endogenous KRAS/EGFR mutations. To close this gap, the authors need to determine the levels of DUSP6 protein in their dox-inducible KRAS models and how they correlate with pERK. They should determine if the induction of pERK is transient, as that observed with DUSP6 siRNA, or sustained. Finally, they should use DUSP6 siRNA or BCI to determine if this reverses the effect of forced KRAS expression on pERK or proliferation. Another question that has not been addressed is why doesn't forced overexpression of KRAS induce sufficient DUSP6 to override the induction of pERK, if DUSP expression is under the control of EGFR/KRAS? Could there be other factors involved? If the authors can experimentally address these it would be a significant improvement.</p><p>f) More evidence is needed to show that the increase in DUSP mRNA is associated with an increased in DUSP6 protein levels or increased DUSP activity. The data in Figure 2I, where the authors compare the relationship between pERK (measured by RPPA) and DUSP6 mRNA is the only such evidence provided. This is underwhelming because the correlation is not great (r=0.1) and because the pERK does not seem to have been controlled for total ERK.</p><p>g) Finding that DUSP6 siRNA caused only a transient elevation in pERK (followed by inhibition of pERK at longer intervals), while mimicking the antiproliferative effect observed with forced overexpression of KRAS needs to be clarified with additional experiments. As it stands, it is difficult to agree with the authors conclusion that DUSP6 is the main mediator of the proliferative effect or that the effect of DUSP6 is through pERK. One consideration may be to use constitutively active ERK (i.e. DD phosphomimetic mutants) and attempt to reverse the effect of DUSP6. This is another point that, if addressed experimentally, could add value to the manuscript.</p><p>h) If indeed it is true that a transient induction in pERK leads to cytotoxicity several days later, then does EGF stimulation (which also causes a transient induction in pERK) have the same effect in EGFR WT/KRAS MT cells?</p><p>i) All three reviewers noted that HCC95 (RRID:CVCL_5137) is a squamous cell carcinoma line. This not comparable to lung adenocarcinoma because this tumor type has different pathway dependencies than LUAD (TCGA, Nature 2012). A wild type LUAD line should be tested instead.</p><p>j) Figure 3C: Same comments as 3A.</p><p>k) The investigators might consider inactivating DUSP6 with CRISPR-Cas9 in these cell lines to show genetic dependence.</p><p>4) Figure 4 a) Figure 4A: 11 lung cancer cell lines were treated with BCI and viable cells were measured after 72-hour treatment. Most of these cell lines are fast growing cells with doubling time around 20~30 hours. Reduction of viable cells by 72-hours does not necessarily mean cell killing. TUNEL or caspase-3/PARP western blot needs to be performed to detect the levels of apoptosis. Senescence and cell cycle arrest should be examined too.</p><p>b) Figure 4C and D: p-ERK levels at a single time point was measured in multiple cell lines (30 min). In order to explain the loss of viable cells at 72hours in Figure 4A, p-ERK should be measured at serial time points such as 1, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 hours.</p><p>c) The data on BCI are very interesting but it's not clear how have the authors established that BCI is selective for DUSP? Sensitive and insensitive cell lines all have IC50s in the 1-5μM range (12/13 cells lines tested). What is the IC50 of the inhibitor in DUSP6 KD or KO cells (or in DUSP1/6 double KD/KO cells)? How do the authors know that the antiproliferative effect of BCI is due to its ability to induce pERK? These questions need to be addressed experimentally. The authors should also attempt to show that the inhibitor has an effect in vivo, given their claim that such an approach could be therapeutically beneficial in patients.</p><p>d) Figure 4E and F: Four cell lines were treated with 125nM trametinib for 72 hours. 125nM is a very high dose for trametinib-sensitive cell lines such as H358 (reported IC50 ~50nM). Apoptosis levels should be measured to document any cell death.</p><p>5) Figure 5.</p><p>See comments for Figure 3B. HCC95 is a SQCC cell line that is quite different from the LUAD cells used in the rest of this manuscript.</p><p>a) In figures where the authors make a comparison of protein levels under different conditions the uncut blot with all the lanes on the same blot must be shown. It is not ideal to make a comparison between levels of proteins on two different strips of blots. For example, in Figure 5B, authors claim that EGF increase levels of pEGFR and pERK in HCC95 cells when the pEGFR and pERK levels with and without EGF are on two different strips of blots. This is important to confirm that BCI treatment increases pERK levels in EGFR treated cells. Quantifications should be shown in addition.</p><p>Overall comment:</p><p>The authors should soften earlier claims that EGFR-mutations and KRAS-mutations are synthetically lethal in the adenocarcinoma subtype of NSCLC (Unni et al., 2015). Recent genetic studies of EGFR-mutant lung cancer (Blakely et al., 2017) have shown that 2.5%~4.7% EGFR-mutant lung cancer also harbor KRAS copy number gain or activating mutations. Tumor genomic analyses have indicated that bona fide driver mutations causing lung adenocarcinoma are not as mutually exclusive as previously thought (e.g. PMIDs: 25301630, 28498782, 28445112, 29106415, and other recent publications), particularly in metastatic lung adenocarcinoma instead of early-stage disease and/or during the evolution of treatment resistance in metastatic disease. Further, preclinical studies have shown acquired KRAS gain/activation in response to EGFRi in EGFR-mutant NSCLC, indicating that this can be a mechanism of drug resistance (Politi et al., 2000; Eberlein et al., 2015). The authors should acknowledge these recent works and temper their claim of absolute mutually exclusivity in this disease, at least under these more advanced-stage disease contexts and in the light of the emerging literature.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Hyperactivation of ERK by mutation-driven RAS signaling or by inhibition of DUSP6 is toxic to lung adenocarcinoma cells&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. First, let me apologize profusely for the very long time this has taken. The problem is basically that the reviewers are at an impasse and could not decide on a course of action.</p><p>Briefly, this is a follow up to a previous paper, that reported anti-proliferative effects of activation of Ras and EGFR in the same cancer cells. This new paper has provides evidence that the anti-proliferative effect of over-expressed, active Ras is due to ERK hyperactivation, and that DUSP6 is critical to prevent adverse effects of active ERK in lung cancer cells. In the revision, the authors have added results using ERK shRNA, ERKi, and a CRISPR screen that together provide convincing evidence that ERK mediates the antiproliferative effect of oncogene overexpression. The finding that sgKRAS are enriched in the BCI screen also indirectly supports that conclusion. The authors have also ruled out that the PI3K pathway is not involved by adding PI3K inhibitor experiments. These additions greatly strengthen the conclusion that hyperactivation of ERK is detrimental. However, the evidence that DUSP6 plays a key role is not convincing.</p><p>The DUSP6 knockdown was done with a single siRNA with no rescue experiment. (Other siRNAs did not effectively inhibit DUSP6 expression). Attempts to recapitulate the result with a DUSP6 CRISPR knockout were unsuccessful. Therefore, the conclusion that DUSP6 is necessary relies in large part on the specificity of the chemical BCI. The DUSP6 KO cells have the same IC50 to BCI, while DUSP1 siRNA did not affect proliferation in their system. Based on these results, the authors cannot claim that the BCI effect is DUSP6 specific nor that the BCI effect in DUSP6KO cells is driven by DUSP1 inhibition. It probably isn't, and by inference, the observed phenotype is not dependent on DUSP6 alone but on other ERK specific DUSPs as well.</p><p>The reviewers disagreed whether these weaknesses undermined the impact to the point where the paper was unsuitable for publication, or whether lengthy additional experiments would be needed. The <italic>eLife</italic> approach is not to ask for multiple rounds of revision. In this spirit, I suggest two possibilities:</p><p>Either</p><p>- Provide convincing evidence that validates DUSP6 as the key enzyme that downregulates ERK in lung cancer cells (e.g. try more siRNAs to find another that gives strong knockdown, and/or rescue DUSP6 siRNA with DUSP6 from mouse, or with silent mutations in the siRNA target sequence).</p><p>Or,</p><p>- Modify the title and abstract to allow for the possibility that other DUSPs are involved and be more open about the shortcomings of the results.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33718.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ notes: the authors’ response after being formally invited to submit a revised submission follows.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript Unni et al., describe their work on understanding the mechanism leading to cytotoxicity following forced overexpression of KRAS in LUAD cell lines harboring EGFR or KRAS mutations.

As your review points out, there may be exceptions to this mutual exclusivity, but we do not believe they undermine our arguments. Nevertheless, we will make changes to the Discussion section to include the observations that the reviewers cite and also note their shortcomings (such as the difficulty of knowing whether normally excluded combinations of mutations have occurred in the same cell or separately in tumor subclones). Of particular relevance, p-ERK intolerance has also been documented in ‘drug addicted’ cells when inhibitors are removed (Kong et al., 2017; Hong et al., 2018, Das Thakur et al., 2013, Moriceau et al., 2015, Sun et al., 2014). Cells in these conditions appear to violate the mutual exclusivity pattern, however, we would argue that these mutations could have arisen while cells were on drug (Hata et al., 2016).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We have the following suggestions to improve the manuscript.

In that study, we documented apoptosis, autophagy, vacuolization and macropinocytosis in cell lines similar to those we now use (Unni et al., 2015). A recent study (Hong et al., 2018) found that cancer cells that were ‘drug addicted’ die by apoptosis, parthanatos and pseudosenescence when inhibitors were removed (similar p-ERK overload principle). For these reasons there are likely to be several distinct mechanisms that result in a loss of cell viability. Our goal here has been to focus on the factors that generate the cytotoxic signal, rather than on a cell’s response to the signal. Nevertheless, in response to the reasonable concerns raised by this comment, we will assess the extent of apoptosis by measuring cleaved PARP, CASP3 activity, or Annexin V levels to help clarify our statements about cell toxicity.</p><p>We have measured cleaved PARP in the H358 and H1975 experimental systems described in this manuscript and some assays are shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1.

The levels of overexpressed KRASG12C are so high that such levels could induce toxicity by exceeding the upper threshold of RAS-mediated signaling even in cells without hyperactive EGFR-KRAS-ERK signaling.</italic></p><p>Overexpression of KRAS G12V is likely to result in cell death or senescence in a variety of cell lines, as others have shown in the past. However, the motivation for experiments in Figure 1 was to test the limits of <italic>cancer</italic> cells to activation of the RAS pathway in a reproducible way that could allow us to study the mechanism by which the toxic signals arise.</p><p>We have added a comment on RAS-mediated senescence in the text (Discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e) Since the main claim is that hyperactivation of ERK leads to toxicity, the authors ought to replicate their dox-inducible experiments with active ERK to show that these also lead to cytotoxicity. Also, just because inhibiting MEK/ERK reverses the some of the phenotype in plastic, this doesn't exclude that other RAS effectors are also involved (see induction of pAKT in addition to pERK in Figure 1B). The authors should thus carry out similar siRNA or inhibitor studies to demonstrate that the cytotoxic effects of KRAS overexpression are not due to pAKT.</p></disp-quote><p>Including data that an inducible active ERK2 allele is toxic would be valuable. However, creating and characterizing these lines will take a significant amount of time. We have prioritized other experiments that the reviewers advise that will strengthen our paper. We did show increases in p-AKT at an early time point and it is possible that effectors of RAS other than RAF proteins can also be toxic to cells. To address this point, tetO KRAS G12V cells will be treated with a PI3K inhibitor (to inhibit AKT phosphorylation) and placed on dox. We will document the effects on cell viability, and on p-AKT and p-ERK signaling.</p><p>We have included data with a PI3K inhibitor (buparilisib) in H358-tetO-KRAS cells (Figure—figure supplement 1D). Using the same cell line, a genome wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen did not reveal an enrichment of guide RNA targeting PIK3CA (Figure 1—figure supplement 1F and Supplementary file 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 2a) Figure 2A: There should be symbols under the heat map denoting which tumors are KRAS mutant and which are EFGR mutant. Are there any tumors with ALK/ROS1/RET activation by translocation? Are there tumors with NF1, MET and BRAF mutations?

It has been known for over 10 years that DUSP6 is transcriptionally regulated by ERK-responsive ETS transcription factors downstream of MAPK activation and that DUSP6 serves as a major negative feedback regulator of ERK signaling (Reffas et al., 2000; Kawakami et al., 2003; Eblaghie et al., 2003; Li et al., 2007; Ekerot et al., 2008; Furukawa et al., 2008; Jurek et al., 2009).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers correctly point to many papers that highlight the significance of DUSP6 in controlling ERK activity. Our main point in this analysis was to discover which of the prominent negative regulators (DUSPs, SPRYs and SPREDs) have been significantly modulated in lung adenocarcinoma. This revealed that lung adenocarcinoma with mutations in KRAS or EGFR appear to rely on DUSP6 to actively restrain the RTK-RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway. Our work also emphasizes that tumor cells have a level of ERK activation that is <italic>still</italic> subject to negative feedback regulation and that this reliance is a vulnerability based on the data we show in Figure 1. We will mention several of the papers the reviewers cite to properly document the previous work with DUSP6.</p><p>The papers suggested by the reviewers are cited through two reviews in the text (Discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Figure 2B and C: For these panels, please show separate data categories for KRAS mutant and EGFR mutant tumors.

DUSP6 de-phosphorylates ERK so ERK phosphorylation is expected to be increased with DUSP6 knockdown. Please explain why Figure 3A shows the opposite with reduced p-ERK after siDUSP6 knockdown.</p></disp-quote><p>We have used pooled siRNA in the knockdown experiments. We now have PC9 cells expressing wildtype or catalytically inactive DUSP6. These cells will be used to verify that our DUSP6 siRNA is on-target (using siRNA against the 3’UTR of the endogenous <italic>DUSP6</italic> which is not represented in the transgenes).</p><p>Unfortunately, despite repeated efforts, no siRNAs targeting the 3’UTR proved to be effective at knocking down DUSP6. In addition to using the original siRNA pool, we have now transfected PC9 cells with each individual siRNA comprising the pool, four in total, all of which target the coding region. This revealed a dose-dependent effect of knockdown on growth inhibition: suppression but incomplete knockdown stimulated cell growth, whereas more complete inhibition was toxic to cells (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B). This conforms with our hypothesis and suggests the siRNAs for DUSP6 are on target.</p><p>The challenging aspect of this study was that knockdown of DUSP6 will result in increased p-ERK leading to increased DUSP6 mRNA, which is being targeted by the siRNA (‘technical’ feedback loop). p-ERK is reduced in this figure probably because the measurement was made on day 5 (see 3B) when the cells are dying. We will include a measure of apoptosis (cleaved PARP) at this time point. We will also provide a longer exposure of the western blot showing the efficiency of DUSP6 knockdown as there could be remaining DUSP6 protein. This may contribute to the decreased p-ERK on day 5.</p><p>We have assessed cleaved PARP on day 5 after DUSP6 knockdown and shown that it is indeed induced in EGFR mutant H1975 cells but not EGFR/KRAS wild-type HCC95 cells (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C). We conclude that P-ERK levels are low at day 5 after DUSP6 knockdown because cells with increased P-ERK have already become non-viable by this time. This point was further investigated in BCI experiments below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Figure 3A: Can the toxicity mediated by DUSP6 knockdown in PC9 cells be reduced by co-treatment with trametinib (Figure 3A)? This would help confirm that toxicity caused by depletion of DUSP6 in these cells is due to increased pERK levels.</p></disp-quote><p>This experiment was tried several times, but we could not find a dose of Trametinib that rescues lethality. MEK and ERK inhibitors are lethal in this line (PC9) and this presents a technical problem: both ERK inhibition and ERK hyperactivation are not tolerated. However, H1975 cells are much more tolerant to ERK inhibition using SCH772984. Experiments are underway to treat H1975 cells that have received siRNA against DUSP6 with an ERK inhibitor like SCH772984 to try and rescue the loss of cell viability.</p><p>Addition of drug (SCH772984) to cells transfected with siRNA against DUSP6 led to indiscriminate toxicity; cells could not withstand the stress of transfection coupled with an ERK inhibitor. As an alternative strategy, we knocked down DUSP6 with siRNA in PC9 cells co-transduced with shRNAs targeting either ERK1 or ERK2 as used in Figure 1. Stable, viable cells were established with reduced ERK levels. These cells displayed increased relative viability after DUSP6 knockdown compared to shScramble control cells, further suggesting that ERK plays a role in mediating the toxic effects of DUSP6 inhibition (now shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 1G,H,I).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Figure 3B: PC9 cells in this panel show increased p-ERK after DUSP6 kd. Please explain why this is the opposite result compared to Panel A.</p></disp-quote><p>These data are from 24hr samples, not 5 day samples (Figure 3A). We expect that acute loss of DUSP6 should increase levels of p-ERK that will then be part of a feedback loop of <italic>DUSP6</italic> activation, followed by de-phosphorylation of ERK.</p><p>As mentioned above, 24 hours after DUSP6 knockdown, cells are still viable and P-ERK is induced whereas, at day 5, cells have induced cleaved PARP and demonstrate substantially decreased viability. We postulate that cells transfected with siRNA for DUSP6 develop high levels of P-ERK and subsequent cell death, leaving only cells with lower P-ERK at day 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) Figure 3B and C: Did the authors determine if the levels of DUSP6 in their EGFR and KRAS wild-type cell lines, HCC95 and H1648, are not as high as in the cell lines with EGFR or KRAS activating mutations? Lower levels of DUSP6 would indicate that these cells do not need to have similar buffering ability as the EGFR or KRAS mutant cell lines and would be consistent with their findings in Figure 2. In Figure 3B, it seems that DUSP6 is also buffering the pERK levels in HCC95 because knockdown of DUSP6 increases the levels of pERK in these cells by over 1.5 fold, similar to the cells with EGFR or KRAS activating mutations; but this increase in pERK has no impact on the cell survival (Figure 3C). This needs to be reconciled with the authors' main claim.</p></disp-quote><p>We will provide the basal levels of DUSP6 across the lines in one figure. Additionally, we will include the quantitation of p-ERK changes from our independent experiments to help establish the fold changes.</p><p>We have included immunoblots indicating the basal levels of DUSP6 and P-ERK across the panel of cell lines (Figure 3—figure supplement 1D). Due to the variability associated with transfection-based experiments, we have now compiled dosimetry for three independent western blots in Figure 3B and plotted the results. This revealed that EGFR or KRAS mutant, but not wild type, cells consistently demonstrate increased P-ERK upon DUSP6 knockdown. All these results and their potential implications are now described in the text (subsection “Knockdown of DUSP6 elevates P-ERK and reduces viability of LUAD cells with either KRAS or EGFR oncogenic mutations”).</p><p><italic>e) There seems to be a disconnect between the first part of the manuscript, where the authors describe the mechanism of toxicity caused by forced overexpression of KRAS and the second part, where they describe the effect of DUSP inhibition in cell lines with endogenous KRAS/EGFR mutations. To close this gap, the authors need to determine the levels of DUSP6 protein in their dox-inducible KRAS models and how they correlate with pERK. They should determine if the induction of pERK is transient, as that observed with DUSP6 siRNA, or sustained. Finally, they should use DUSP6 siRNA or BCI to determine if this reverses the effect of forced KRAS expression on pERK or proliferation. Another question that has not been addressed is why doesn't forced overexpression of KRAS induce sufficient DUSP6 to override the induction of pERK, if DUSP expression is under the control of EGFR/KRAS? Could there be other factors involved? If the authors can experimentally address these it would be a significant improvement.</italic></p><p>We don’t understand why the reviewers believe there is a “disconnect” between the early and late phases of the manuscript. In fact, we believe that there is a logical flow from identification of p-ERK as the locus that transmits a toxic signal to the implication of DUSP6 as a critical regulator of the activity of ERK. So the notion of an informational gap is not clear to us. Nevertheless, we agree that the situation is complicated by the kinetics of activation and de-activation of the components of the signaling system, and we will follow the request to obtain more kinetic data. We will perform time course experiments in tetO-RAS lines, measuring p-ERK induction and DUSP6 protein levels at 1,3,5 and 7 days. Contrary to the reviewers’ speculation, we would not anticipate that DUSP6 siRNA or BCI would reverse the effects of forced KRAS expression; they should potentiate the effects of KRAS. On the other hand, it is unclear why DUSP6 cannot ‘override’ the induction of p-ERK. It is possible that p-ERK has fully localized to the nucleus and is no longer accessible to DUSP6. We will consider these possibilities in the revised manuscript.</p><p>The kinetics of p-ERK induction have been provided for H358 (days 1, 3, 5 and 7) and H1975 (day 7) cells in Figure 1—figure supplement 1B). The time course of induction of p-ERK upon treatment of H358 cells with BCI (at 1, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 hours) is provided in Figure 4—figure supplement 1D. Experiments with BCI provide initial assessment of the kinetics of induction of p-ERK upon DUSP6 inactivation. The kinetics suggest that p-ERK induction for at least 24 hours is required before markers of apoptosis (PARP cleavage) are detected. Similar kinetics of p-ERK induction (at least 24-48 hours) before PARP cleavage detection were observed for H358-tetO-KRAS cells (subsection “Synthetic lethality induced by co-expression of mutant KRAS and EGFR is mediated through increased ERK Signalling”, subsection “P-ERK levels increase in LUAD cells after inhibition of DUSP6 by BCI, and P-ERK is required for BCI-mediated</p><p>toxicity.”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>f) More evidence is needed to show that the increase in DUSP mRNA is associated with an increased in DUSP6 protein levels or increased DUSP activity. The data in Figure 2I, where the authors compare the relationship between pERK (measured by RPPA) and DUSP6 mRNA is the only such evidence provided. This is underwhelming because the correlation is not great (r=0.1) and because the pERK does not seem to have been controlled for total ERK.</p></disp-quote><p>The RPPA assays (from TCGA) are controlled for total protein. The time course studies in tetO lines and BCI-treated cell lines may help address the issue of ‘sufficient’ levels of DUSP6.</p><p>We have performed and included in the manuscript time course experiments for both dox treatment in TetO cell lines and BCI treated cells as described above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>g) Finding that DUSP6 siRNA caused only a transient elevation in pERK (followed by inhibition of pERK at longer intervals), while mimicking the antiproliferative effect observed with forced overexpression of KRAS needs to be clarified with additional experiments. As it stands, it is difficult to agree with the authors conclusion that DUSP6 is the main mediator of the proliferative effect or that the effect of DUSP6 is through pERK. One consideration may be to use constitutively active ERK (i.e. DD phosphomimetic mutants) and attempt to reverse the effect of DUSP6. This is another point that, if addressed experimentally, could add value to the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>The ‘transient elevation’ in p-ERK with siRNA against DUSP6 may be a technical limitation of this assay as previously described. The time course studies in tetO lines and with BCI will help establish this. We will try and rescue the effects of siRNA against DUSP6 and BCI in H1975 cells—a cell line that is tolerant to ERK inhibition and provides an experimental system to ‘dial’ back appropriate p-ERK levels. A constitutively active ERK mutant is likely to be lethal in the presence of tet-induced mutant KRAS; for instance, ERK mutants have been documented to have a lethal effect in melanoma cells (Goetz et al., 2014). We will focus our attention on H1975 cells to rescue the effects of DUSP6 siRNA and BCI w/ MEK or ERK inhibition.</p><p>As mentioned above, we have used shRNA to inhibit ERK1 or ERK2 in PC9 cells and inhibition of ERK1 or ERK2 limited the toxic effects of knocking down DUSP6 (Figure 3—figure supplement 1G,H,I). In addition, we observed similar reductions in the toxic effects of BCI when H358 cells were co-treated with an ERK inhibitor (Figure 4—figure supplement 1E). These experiments further reinforce the conclusion that inhibition of DUSP6 (genetically or pharmacologically) decreases viability of EGFR or KRAS mutant cells – at least partially – through ERK induction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>h). If indeed it is true that a transient induction in pERK leads to cytotoxicity several days later, then does EGF stimulation (which also causes a transient induction in pERK) have the same effect in EGFR WT/KRAS MT cells?</p></disp-quote><p>As previously mentioned, the effects of transient vs. prolonged p-ERK will be addressed by studying the time course of response to BCI in cells and to mutant KRAS induced by dox. Transient treatment of cells with EGF is not expected to cause cytotoxicity based on our earlier experiments. In fact, transient administration of EGF to HCC95 cells failed to shift the IC50 for BCI; only prolonged exposure to EGF did that (Figure 5A). We will consider inclusion of this information during revision of the manuscript.</p><p>We have provided time course experiments of dox-mediated induction in TetO-KRAS cells (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B) and of BCI treatment in H358 cells (Figure 4—figure supplement 1D). Both approaches caused an initial increase in P-ERK levels coupled with later induction of cleaved-PARP and subsequent decrease in P-ERK (Figure 4—figure supplement 1D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>i) All three reviewers noted that HCC95 (RRID:CVCL_5137) is a squamous cell carcinoma line. This not comparable to lung adenocarcinoma because this tumor type has different pathway dependencies than LUAD (TCGA, 2012). A wild type LUAD line should be tested instead.</p></disp-quote><p>HCC95 cells were used because they are a cancer cell line (lung) that does not have mutations in EGFR or other examined components of the RAS pathway. We will state in the text that this is a squamous lung cancer cell line.

Cells without these mutations (like HCC95) illustrate cancers (of any origin) that we would predict to be un-responsive to DUSP6 inhibition.</p><p>We have noted the nature of HCC95 cells in the text (subsection “Knockdown of DUSP6 elevates P-ERK and reduces viability of LUAD cells with either KRAS or EGFR oncogenic mutation”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>j) Figure 3C: Same comments as 3A.</p></disp-quote><p>Addressed above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>k) The investigators might consider inactivating DUSP6 with CRISPR-Cas9 in these cell lines to show genetic dependence.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now created PC9 and H358 cells in which <italic>DUSP6</italic> has been deleted or damaged using CRISPR-Cas9. We anticipate that the cells selected for this loss may have developed other mechanisms to maintain p-ERK or may have other pathways activated to bypass the need for p-ERK to mediate survival. Thus, they may or may not be uniquely vulnerable to inhibition of MEK or ERK. We will analyze the recently identified mutant cells for p-ERK levels, growth rates, and sensitivities to BCI and to inhibition of MEK and ERK.</p><p>We created H358 cells deficient in DUSP6 (Figure 4—figure supplement 1J,K). These cells were equally sensitive to BCI as cells that were targeted with a control (lacZ) sgRNA. We suspect that DUSP1 may be controlling p-ERK levels in the absence of DUSP6, and BCI has known specificity towards DUSP1 in addition to DUSP6. Additionally, these cell lines were derived from clones, so it is possible that new mutations or pathway re-wirings have taken place and that they continue to control p-ERK.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 4 a) Figure 4A: 11 lung cancer cell lines were treated with BCI and viable cells were measured after 72-hour treatment. Most of these cell lines are fast growing cells with doubling time around 20~30 hours. Reduction of viable cells by 72-hours does not necessarily mean cell killing. TUNEL or caspase-3/PARP western blot needs to be performed to detect the levels of apoptosis. Senescence and cell cycle arrest should be examined too.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the reduction in numbers of viable cells does not reveal the mechanism by which the numbers were reduced, and we have been careful to avoid any suggestion that it does (e.g. by labeling our charts “number of viable cells”). As explained earlier, our focus has been on the generation of the toxic signal, not the response to it. Nevertheless, in response to the reviewers’ concerns on this point, we will examine cells for apoptosis by measuring PARP cleavage.</p><p>We have assessed cleaved-PARP after BCI treatment in a panel of seven sensitive and insensitive cell lines and in a time course experiment in H358s (Figure 4—figure supplement 1).

Sensitive and insensitive cell lines all have IC50s in the 1-5μM range (12/13 cells lines tested). What is the IC50 of the inhibitor in DUSP6 KD or KO cells (or in DUSP1/6 double KD/KO cells)? How do the authors know that the antiproliferative effect of BCI is due to its ability to induce pERK? These questions need to be addressed experimentally. The authors should also attempt to show that the inhibitor has an effect in vivo, given their claim that such an approach could be therapeutically beneficial in patients.</p></disp-quote><p>A potential target of BCI is DUSP1, but we have data showing that siRNA against DUSP1 is not lethal in H1975 cells while siRNA to DUSP6 is. We will now also try to rescue the effects of BCI in H1975 cells by inhibiting ERK, using this cell line for the reasons described above (3b,g). In addition to PC9 CRISPR-Cas9 DUSP6 knockout cells described above (Figure 3, comment k), we have generated PC9 cells expressing wild type and catalytically inactive DUSP6. We will use these cell models to determine if there is a shift in the BCI IC50 with manipulation of DUSP6 to further evaluate its role as the biological target of BCI.</p><p>Importantly, we have now completed a genome-wide CRISPR screen in H460 cells (an KRAS mutant cell line sensitive to BCI), looking for loss of function mutations that confer resistance to BCI. The most highly enriched guide RNA in this screen was specific for KRAS, suggesting that BCI is ‘on-target’ with respect to its proposed role in causing excessive activation of the RAS pathway. We will confirm these findings by measuring BCI sensitivity in H460 cells treated with siRNA against KRAS and expect to include a version of the results in the revised paper to further support our interpretation of our findings with BCI.</p><p>We have included data showing that DUSP1 knockdown, as opposed to DUSP6 knockdown, is not lethal in H1975 cells (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B). Further, we have demonstrated that co-treatment with an ERK inhibitor decreases the toxic effects of BCI in H358 cells (Figure 4—figure supplement 1E,F). Lastly, we added the genome-wide CRISPR screen data in H460 cells showing that sgRNAs for KRAS are enriched upon BCI treatment, which we have subsequently confirmed using individual sgRNAs and BCI dose response experiments. Together, these results confirm that BCI works mainly through DUSP6 in the context described and mediates its toxic effects through ERK.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) Figure 4E and F: Four cell lines were treated with 125nM trametinib for 72 hours. 125nM is a very high dose for trametinib-sensitive cell lines such as H358 (reported IC50 ~50nM).

Tumor genomic analyses have indicated that bona fide driver mutations causing lung adenocarcinoma are not as mutually exclusive as previously thought (e.g. PMIDs: 25301630, 28498782, 28445112, 29106415, and other recent publications), particularly in metastatic lung adenocarcinoma instead of early-stage disease and/or during the evolution of treatment resistance in metastatic disease. Further, preclinical studies have shown acquired KRAS gain/activation in response to EGFRi in EGFR-mutant NSCLC, indicating that this can be a mechanism of drug resistance (Politi et al., 2000; Eberlein et al., 2015). The authors should acknowledge these recent works and temper their claim of absolute mutually exclusivity in this disease, at least under these more advanced-stage disease contexts and in the light of the emerging literature.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted earlier, we will provide a more thorough discussion of these points in the manuscript.</p><p>The additional discussion of these issues has been added to the text (Discussion section). We hope that with these changes and additions to the manuscript, the revised version will suitable for re-submission and consideration for publication at <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Hyperactivation of ERK by mutation-driven RAS signaling or by inhibition of DUSP6 is toxic to lung adenocarcinoma cells&quot; for further consideration at eLife. First, let me apologize profusely for the very long time this has taken. The problem is basically that the reviewers are at an impasse and could not decide on a course of action.</p><p>Briefly, this is a follow up to a previous paper, that reported anti-proliferative effects of activation of Ras and EGFR in the same cancer cells. This new paper has provides evidence that the anti-proliferative effect of over-expressed, active Ras is due to ERK hyperactivation, and that DUSP6 is critical to prevent adverse effects of active ERK in lung cancer cells. In the revision, the authors have added results using ERK shRNA, ERKi, and a CRISPR screen that together provide convincing evidence that ERK mediates the antiproliferative effect of oncogene overexpression. The finding that sgKRAS are enriched in the BCI screen also indirectly supports that conclusion. The authors have also ruled out that the PI3K pathway is not involved by adding PI3K inhibitor experiments. These additions greatly strengthen the conclusion that hyperactivation of ERK is detrimental. However, the evidence that DUSP6 plays a key role is not convincing.</p><p>The DUSP6 knockdown was done with a single siRNA with no rescue experiment. (Other siRNAs did not effectively inhibit DUSP6 expression). Attempts to recapitulate the result with a DUSP6 CRISPR knockout were unsuccessful. Therefore, the conclusion that DUSP6 is necessary relies in large part on the specificity of the chemical BCI. The DUSP6 KO cells have the same IC50 to BCI, while DUSP1 siRNA did not affect proliferation in their system. Based on these results, the authors cannot claim that the BCI effect is DUSP6 specific nor that the BCI effect in DUSP6KO cells is driven by DUSP1 inhibition. It probably isn't, and by inference, the observed phenotype is not dependent on DUSP6 alone but on other ERK specific DUSPs as well.</p><p>The reviewers disagreed whether these weaknesses undermined the impact to the point where the paper was unsuitable for publication, or whether lengthy additional experiments would be needed. The eLife approach is not to ask for multiple rounds of revision. In this spirit, I suggest two possibilities:</p><p>Either</p><p>- Provide convincing evidence that validates DUSP6 as the key enzyme that downregulates ERK in lung cancer cells (e.g. try more siRNAs to find another that gives strong knockdown, and/or rescue DUSP6 siRNA with DUSP6 from mouse, or with silent mutations in the siRNA target sequence).</p><p>Or,</p><p>- Modify the title and abstract to allow for the possibility that other DUSPs are involved and be more open about the shortcomings of the results.</p></disp-quote><p>1) To test additional DUSP6 siRNAs for their effects on protein abundance and cell fitness, we obtained a DUSP6-specific siRNA from Qiagen (the previous siRNAs were prepared by Dharmacon). In contrast to the DUSP6-8 siRNA that targeted a sequence in the 3’ domain of DUSP6 mRNA, the new species (called DUSP6-Qiagen in Figure 3B,C) targeted a sequence in the 5’ coding region of DUSP6 mRNA and reduced levels of DUSP6 protein in PC9 cells to levels similar to those achieved with one of the previously tested Dharmacon siRNAs (DUSP6-8 in Figure 3B and Figure 3—figure supplement 1A) and with the pool of four Dharmacon siRNAs (DUSP6-pool in Figure 3B and Figure 3—figure supplement 1A). Furthermore, DUSP6-Qiagen reduced the number of viable PC9 cells to a level similar to that observed with the pooled Dharmacon siRNAs (Figure 3C). We have described the effects of this second effective inhibitory RNA in the text and conclude that it strengthens the case for a central role of DUSP6 in regulation of ERK activity in RTK-RAS-driven LUAD. We also point out that this conclusion is supported by the correlation between the effects of one Dharmacon siRNA (DUSP6-8) on both DUSP6 protein levels and cell fitness (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B).</p><p>2) We also attempted, unsuccessfully, to rescue the effects of DUSP6 siRNA by generating a plasmid encoding <italic>DUSP6</italic> mRNA with several synonymous mutations in the coding sequence to render the mRNA target sequence resistant to the siRNA without changing the protein sequence. For a variety of technical reasons related to transfection procedures, we have not been able to perform these experiments in a reproducible manner. We are convinced that the work required to carry out a satisfying rescue experiment would take an unreasonable amount of time and inappropriately delay publication, when we have provided the requested data with a second effective siRNA.</p><p>3) Despite our positive findings with the Qiagen siRNA, we recognize that our conclusions about the role of DUSP6 in regulation of the activity of ERK kinases should be cautious. (DUSP6 may not be the only important regulator and we cannot fully exclude some off-target effects of our siRNAs.) We have therefore removed specific mention of DUSP6 in the title of the manuscript, and we have modulated the description of the results in the abstract, along the lines suggested in your letter.</p><p>One other relevant item: two recent papers confirm the significance of the level of ERK kinase activity in another cancer type, melanoma, and address the possible role of DUSP6. Leung et al., over-express <italic>ERK2</italic> in melanoma cell lines and show that high levels of ERK2 protein are toxic specifically in lines that carry BRAF V600E. Wittig-Blaich et al., use a complex screening method to identify genes that produce a synthetic lethality when disrupted in melanoma cell lines carrying the BRAF V600E mutation; one of the five implicated genes is <italic>DUSP6</italic>, allowing the authors to draw conclusions similar to our own. We mention and cite these papers (Leung et al., 2018 and Wittig-Blaich et al., 2017) in the Discussion section.</p><p>In addition to the changes that address your main concerns, we have found a few places in the text that lacked clarity upon careful re-reading of our previously submitted revision.</p></body></sub-article></article>
