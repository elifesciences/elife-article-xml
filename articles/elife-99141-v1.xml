While traditionally viewed as a motor neuron disorder, there is involvement of various peripheral organs in SMA. Notably, fatty liver has been observed in SMA mouse models and SMA patients. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether intrinsic depletion of SMN protein in the liver contributes to pathology in the peripheral or central nervous systems. To address this, we developed a mouse model with a liver-specific depletion of SMN by utilizing an <italic>Alb-Cre</italic> transgene together with one <italic>Smn<sup>2B</sup></italic> allele and one <italic>Smn1</italic> exon 7 allele flanked by loxP sites. Initially, we evaluated phenotypic changes in these mice at postnatal day 19 (P19), when the severe model of SMA, the <italic>Smn<sup>2B/-</sup></italic> mice, exhibit many symptoms of the disease. The liver-specific SMN depletion does not induce motor neuron death, neuromuscular pathology or muscle atrophy, characteristics typically observed in the <italic>Smn<sup>2B/-</sup></italic> mouse at P19. However, mild liver steatosis was observed, although no changes in liver function were detected. Notably, pancreatic alterations resembled that of <italic>Smn<sup>2B/-</sup></italic>mice, with a decrease in insulin-producing β-cells and an increase in glucagon-producingα-cells, accompanied by a reduction in blood glucose and an increase in plasma glucagon and glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1). These changes were transient, as mice at P60 exhibited recovery of liver and pancreatic function. While the mosaic pattern of the Cre-mediated excision precludes definitive conclusions regarding the contribution of liver-specific SMN depletion to overall tissue pathology, our findings highlight an intricate connection between liver function and pancreatic abnormalities in SMA.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>pancreas</kwd><kwd>neuromuscular disease</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005202</institution-id><institution>Muscular Dystrophy Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.55762/pc.gr.157042</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kothary</surname><given-names>Rashmi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJT-186300</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kothary</surname><given-names>Rashmi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>University of Ottawa Brain and Mind Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TRIMS Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>de Almeida</surname><given-names>Monique Marylin Alves</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A liver-specific depletion of the survival motor neuron protein in a mouse model unveils a compelling and intricate connection between liver function and pancreatic abnormalities in spinal muscular atrophy.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Insufficient levels of Survival Motor Neuron (SMN) protein, primarily arising from mutations or deletions in the <italic>SMN1</italic> gene, are the root cause of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a hereditary neuromuscular disorder widely acknowledged as one of the leading genetic causes of infant mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lefebvre et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lefebvre et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crawford and Pardo, 1996</xref>). Characterized by the loss of motor neurons, SMA presents as a progressive weakening of muscle strength, primarily impacting proximal muscles. If left untreated, this deterioration culminates in respiratory failure and premature mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Finkel et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The diverse phenotypes observed in SMA patients can be attributed to the genetic variations within the <italic>SMN</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lefebvre et al., 1995</xref>). Humans harbor two copies of the <italic>SMN</italic> gene, <italic>SMN1</italic> and <italic>SMN2</italic>, which share a nearly identical sequence except for a critical C to T substitution at position 6 of exon 7 in <italic>SMN2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lorson et al., 1999</xref>). This single nucleotide change disrupts splicing of the gene, resulting in the predominant production of an unstable protein lacking exon 7, known as <italic>SMNΔ7 (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lorson et al., 1999</xref>). Despite this, approximately 10% of functional full-length (FL) SMN protein is still produced by the <italic>SMN2</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lefebvre et al., 1997</xref>). Consequently, the <italic>SMN2</italic> gene serves as a modifier of disease phenotype, with a higher copy number correlating with milder disease severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Feldkötter et al., 2002</xref>). In contrast, mice possess a single copy of the <italic>Smn1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lefebvre et al., 1997</xref>). Notably, while homozygous deletion of both <italic>SMN</italic> genes has not been observed in humans, the homozygous deletion of the <italic>Smn1</italic> gene in mice induces morphological alterations and degenerative changes in embryos post-morula stage, ultimately resulting in death at preimplantation stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schrank et al., 1997</xref>). This underscores the pivotal role of the <italic>SMN</italic> gene in early embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vitte et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Recent research has unveiled the extensive impact of SMN depletion beyond motor neurons, implicating additional tissues such as the liver and pancreas in both SMA patients and mouse models of SMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bowerman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bowerman et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bowerman et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deguise et al., 2019a</xref>). Despite major therapeutic advancements focusing on restoring SMN levels, which have notably enhanced both lifespan and quality of life in SMA patients, complete phenotypic rescue remains elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Finkel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chiriboga, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McMillan et al., 2022</xref>). Additionally, existing therapies primarily target postnatal treatment, potentially overlooking crucial developmental changes stemming from SMN depletion. This underscores the likelihood of a broader role for the <italic>SMN</italic> gene in multiple non-neuronal cell types, necessitating further exploration.</p><p>Attention has been increasingly drawn to the liver as a critical area of investigation in SMA research. Both clinical studies and preclinical mouse models have unveiled disruptions in fatty acid metabolism, leading to an increased susceptibility among SMA patients to dyslipidemia and liver steatosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deguise et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crawford et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deguise et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deguise et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deguise et al., 2021b</xref>). Given its multifaceted role in regulating numerous biological functions, including the storage and regulation of lipids, carbohydrates, amino acids, and iron, as well as the synthesis of essential growth factors and the clearance of toxic metabolites, any disruptions in liver function may have deleterious effects on other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Trefts et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>To explore the role of SMN in the liver, prior studies have utilized a transgenic mouse model featuring the Cre recombinase transgene driven by the α-fetoprotein promoter (<italic>Alfp-Cre</italic>). This approach led to near-total depletion of SMN protein specifically in the liver, resulting in severe impairment of liver development and late embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vitte et al., 2004</xref>). In our study, to better represent the level of SMN depletion in the liver observed in SMA and elucidate the intricate interplay between SMN deficiency in the liver and its systemic impact in SMA-like pathology, we utilized a mouse model employing <italic>Alb-Cre</italic>, where the albumin promoter drives expression of Cre recombinase in a liver-specific manner. This model also harbors one <italic>Smn<sup>2B</sup></italic> allele and one <italic>Smn1</italic> exon 7 allele flanked by loxP sites (F7). The <italic>Smn<sup>2B</sup></italic> allele contains a 3-base pair substitution in the mouse <italic>Smn1</italic> gene, resulting in aberrant splicing of exon 7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">DiDonato et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hammond et al., 2010</xref>). Consequently, this genetic approach results in the production of approximately 30% full-length functional SMN protein production in the liver.</p><p>Our findings reveal that our novel liver-specific SMN depleted (herein referred to as <italic>Alb<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Smn<sup>2B/F7</sup></italic>) mouse model induces mild liver steatosis and disrupts pancreatic function at postnatal day 19 (P19), characterized by decreased insulin-positive and increased glucagon-positive cells, alongside reduced blood glucose levels. However, both liver and pancreatic defects were rescued by P60. Remarkably, this mouse model does not exhibit an overt SMA phenotype, demonstrating normal lifespan and motor function. Nevertheless, our data suggests an intricate relationship between hepatic function and pancreatic abnormalities in SMA, thereby enhancing our comprehension of the disease’s pathophysiology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of liver-specific SMN-depleted mice</title><p>To elucidate the impact of liver-specific SMN depletion on both CNS and peripheral tissue pathology, we utilized mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the mouse albumin promoter, referred to as <italic>Alb<sup>Cre</sup></italic>.

However, in <italic>Alb<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Smn<sup>2B/F7</sup></italic>, there was a~70% decrease in FLSMN protein expression in the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and D’</xref>) compared to littermate control counterparts (<italic>+/+;Smn<sup>2B/F7</sup></italic>). Conversely, SMN protein levels in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and E’</xref>), muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and F’</xref>), spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and G’</xref>) and pancreas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and H’</xref>) remained unaltered, indicating that deletion of <italic>Smn</italic> exon 7 was restricted to the liver in <italic>Alb<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Smn</italic><sup>2<italic>B/</italic></sup><italic><sup>F7</sup></italic>mice.

These encompass, among others, the storage and balance of lipids, carbohydrates, and iron, as well as the synthesis of vital growth factors and the clearance of non-essential or harmful metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Trefts et al., 2017</xref>). Given its multifaceted role, any alterations in liver function can potentially have cascading effects on other organs within the body. Hence, aside from elucidating the impact of liver-specific SMN depletion on hepatic function, it is imperative to explore its effects on other tissues, as alterations in these tissues have been documented in various mouse models of SMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bowerman et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deguise et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hua et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hua et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Previous work on conditional knockout of <italic>Smn1</italic> in the livers of mice resulted in severe impairment of liver development characterized by iron overload and subsequent liver atrophy, ultimately leading to late embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vitte et al., 2004</xref>). In our study, we generated a novel mouse model where instead of a complete knockout of <italic>Smn1</italic> in the liver, we created a scenario where SMN protein was depleted to 30% of full-length SMN production specifically within the liver, while SMN protein levels in other tissues remain comparable to those of heterozygous controls. Notably, this mouse line did not exhibit any signs of developmental delays, liver atrophy, or reduced lifespan. Nonetheless, within 19 days after birth, <italic>Alb<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Smn<sup>2B/F7</sup></italic> mice showed a mild yet rapid onset of fatty liver disease and trends towards an increase in lipid levels when maintained on a normal chow diet, underscoring the importance of SMN in lipid metabolism. Interestingly, these changes were transient, as by P60, liver-specific SMN-depleted mice displayed no lipid accumulation or hepatocyte morphological changes, likely due to the compensatory proliferation of non-recombined cells.</p><p>A recent study found that 75% of pediatric and adult SMA patients showed ultrasonic evidence of mild to moderate hepatic steatosis, independent of disease severity or SMA subtype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leow et al., 2024</xref>). In an in vitro model using SMA patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell-derived hepatocyte-like cells (iHeps), a 10-fold increase in lipid accumulation was observed, correlating with reduced SMN protein expression. Proteomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed dysregulation in mitochondrial and lipid metabolism pathways, including downregulation of key genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation, alongside increased lipid biosynthesis. Notably, repletion of SMN in SMA iHeps restored metabolic and hepatic functions, rescuing steatosis and mitochondrial defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leow et al., 2024</xref>). Excitingly, our current work further supports these findings, demonstrating that treatment with an adeno-associated viral vector carrying a liver-specific albumin promoter in <italic>Smn<sup>2B/-</sup></italic> mice resulted in partial restoration of liver SMN levels, improving survival, alleviating liver pathology, and restoring muscle size and pancreatic cell balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sutton et al., 2024</xref>). Additionally, a recent study found that 60.8% of adult SMA type 3 patients (23 patients) exhibited at least one lipid abnormality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Miletić et al., 2024</xref>), further supporting the hypothesis that hepatocyte-specific SMN deficiency contributes to liver pathology.</p><p>Mild liver steatosis may be accompanied by disruptions in crucial liver function markers, notably those implicated in iron metabolism, autophagy, and growth factor regulation, such as IGF-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deguise et al., 2021a</xref>). Accordingly, we initially investigated the expression of HO-1, an enzyme responsible for heme degradation into iron, carbon monoxide, and biliverdin; and transferrin, a liver-synthesized glycoprotein involved in iron transport across tissues (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Muckenthaler et al., 2017</xref>). Prior studies have documented alterations in these proteins in <italic>Smn<sup>2B/-</sup></italic> mouse livers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deguise et al., 2021b</xref>). While our current analysis did not reveal significant differences in <italic>Alb<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Smn<sup>2B/F7</sup></italic> mice, the observed upward trend in transferrin and HO levels suggests ongoing changes in iron metabolism, which may not be fully manifested at P19. In addition, incomplete Cre-mediated excision of <italic>Smn<sup>F7</sup></italic> allele may be hindering a comprehensive understanding of SMN’s role in liver function.</p><p>Furthermore, no alterations were observed for P62 levels, a multifunctional scaffold protein implicated in autophagy, formation of hepatic inclusion bodies, and hepatocyte cell death (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Manley et al., 2013</xref>) despite its increased presence in mouse models of SMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deguise et al., 2021b</xref>). Similarly, there were no changes detected in IGF-1 protein levels, whose deficiency has been linked to liver pathology and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hribal et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ichikawa et al., 2007</xref>), and its decrease is evident in <italic>Smn<sup>2B/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deguise et al., 2021b</xref>). NAFLD involves the accumulation of fatty acids in more than 5% of liver cells, occurring in the absence of alcohol consumption. This condition presents with varying degrees of severity, with simple steatosis being the most common manifestation. Simple steatosis is characterized by the accumulation of fat in the liver with minimal impact on liver function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Loomba and Sanyal, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tandra et al., 2011</xref>). Consequently, our model holds promise as a valuable resource for investigating microvesicular steatohepatitis and NAFLD during the early postnatal period. Additionally, unlike the well-studied <italic>Smn<sup>2B/-</sup></italic> model of SMA, this liver-specific SMN depletion enables the study of hepatic SMN function without the confounding effects of systemic SMN depletion or the severe phenotype observed in the <italic>Smn<sup>2B/-</sup></italic> mice.</p><p>Previously, our research unveiled metabolic abnormalities in SMA-like mice, including glucose intolerance, insulin hypersensitivity, and hyperglucagonemia, accompanied by changes in pancreatic islet composition characterized by an increase in glucagon-producing α-cells at the expense of insulin-producing β-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bowerman et al., 2012b</xref>). Histopathological examination of pancreatic tissue from infants and children with SMA type I corroborated these findings, revealing a predominant presence of glucagon-producing α-cells within pancreatic islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bowerman et al., 2012b</xref>). Furthermore, one-year-old <italic>Smn1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> +/- producing approximately 50% of SMN protein, when exposed to a high-fat diet, exhibited dysregulation in the proportion of glucagon-producing α-cells within pancreatic islets and heightened hepatic insulin and glucagon sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bowerman et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Here, we uncovered a novel intrinsic role of liver-specific SMN in pancreatic function, distinct from IGF-1 signaling, pancreatic SMN levels (which remained stable), or canonical SMA pathology. Although the precise role of SMN in the liver-pancreas axis remains unclear, we speculate that altered amino acid metabolism may contribute to the disrupted communication between these two organs. The liver plays a central role in amino acid metabolism, and disturbances in this process can affect the liver-α cell axis, a well-documented feedback loop in which circulating amino acids stimulate glucagon secretion, which in turn regulates hepatic amino acid uptake and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Richter et al., 2022</xref>). In the context of metabolic diseases such as NAFLD and SMA, liver dysfunction, including impaired lipid metabolism, may disrupt this axis, leading to abnormal glucagon secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Richter et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deng et al., 2024</xref>). It is possible that dysregulated amino acid pathways may directly influence this feedback loop.</p><p>Further evidence for this hypothesis comes from a recent study in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and NAFLD, which found hyperglucagonaemia and altered amino acid profiles. In T2D-NAFLD patients, plasma glucagon levels were significantly higher than in individuals without NAFLD, with a positive correlation between plasma glucagon concentrations and liver fat content. This study also showed increased plasma levels of isoleucine and glutamate, and decreased levels of glycine and serine in individuals with NAFLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rix et al., 2024</xref>). These findings suggest that metabolic dysregulation in the liver, including alterations in amino acid metabolism, may exacerbate glucagon secretion. Interestingly, such changes in amino acid metabolism are consistent with clinical observations in SMA patients, where an ‘amino acid diet’ — low in fats and rich in specific amino acids — has been shown to provide some clinical benefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">O’Connor et al., 2023</xref>). Given this, it is plausible that impaired liver metabolism in SMN-depleted mice alters the liver-α cell axis, leading to dysregulated glucagon and GLP-1 secretion. While this proposed link between liver steatosis, amino acid metabolism, and pancreatic dysfunction is speculative, we are actively investigating the mechanisms underlying this liver-pancreas interplay in mouse models of SMA.</p><p>In addition, while the hallmark pathological features of SMA include motor neuron loss, NMJ pathology, muscle atrophy, and consequent motor function alterations, these were not evident in the <italic>Alb<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Smn<sup>2B/F7</sup></italic> mouse model at P19. However, given that glucose metabolism defects are observed in various neurodegenerative and neuromuscular disorders, subsequent work is required to clarify the impact of liver-specific SMN depletion on pancreatic function. Although hepatic and pancreatic abnormalities likely occur independently of disease onset, given that SMN depletion in motor neurons and muscle alone is sufficient to induce an SMA-like phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Frugier et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cifuentes-Diaz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cifuentes-Diaz et al., 2002</xref>), the potential influence of these anomalies on SMA progression warrants careful consideration.</p><p>Overall, our findings suggest that alterations in SMN production solely within the liver may suffice to induce pathological hepatic and pancreatic function, shedding light on a novel role of SMN in liver physiology.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse models</title><p>The <italic>Smn<sup>2B</sup></italic> mouse, which harbors the <italic>Smn<sup>2B</sup></italic> mutation resulting from the substitution of three nucleotides within the exon splicing enhancer of exon 7, was developed and maintained on a C57BL/6 background in our laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bowerman et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eshraghi et al., 2016</xref>).

Spinal cord sections were examined under fluorescence using an Axio Imager M2 microscope (Zeiss) and imaged at ×20 magnification for quantification, and at ×63 for representative pictures. The number of ChAT-positive motor neurons with a diameter of ≥20 μm per ventral horn was recorded for 7–10 different sections per animal, each separated by at least 100 μm to prevent re-counting of the same motor neuron. An average number of motor neuron cell bodies per section was determined. Analysis was blinded where possible.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Neuromuscular junction (NMJ)</title><p>To evaluate neuromuscular innervation, we performed immunohistochemistry using established protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reilly et al., 2022</xref>). After euthanasia, the TVA muscles were promptly dissected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Science) in PBS for 15 min. Post-synaptic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) were labeled for 10 min with alpha-bungarotoxin (aBTX) conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488. Subsequently, the muscles were blocked in 4% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 1% Triton-X-100 in PBS for 30 min.</p><p>Following blocking, the muscles underwent overnight incubation with primary antibodies for neurofilament and synaptic vesicle protein 2 (refer to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Visualization of the labeled structures was achieved using DyLight-conjugated secondary antibodies. The muscles were then whole-mounted in Dako Fluorescent mounting media and imaged with a 20 x objective on a Zeiss Axio Imager M1 microscope.</p><p>A minimum of three fields of view (FOV) were quantified per muscle. For each FOV, the percentage of fully occupied endplates was noted. Fully occupied endplates were defined as motor endplates completely covered by the presynaptic terminal labeled with synaptic vesicle protein 2 (SV2) and neurofilament (NF). Analysis was blinded where possible.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Muscle fiber analysis</title><p>Muscle fiber analysis was performed using ImageJ software (version 2.9.0/1.53t). A total of one hundred fibers were evaluated per animal, covering various regions of the muscle section to ensure good representation. The area of each fiber was measured in square micrometers (μm²) to compute both the average and distribution of fiber sizes for each animal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Glucose levels</title><p>Non-fasting blood glucose concentrations were assessed using a OneTouch Ultra2 Blood Glucose Test Strips (LifeScan Europe GmbH, Zug, Switzerland) immediately following blood collection. Approximately 2 μL of blood was applied to the test strip for glucose concentration measurement.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>ELISA for insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-1)</title><p>The concentration of IGF-1 in the liver was quantified using the Mouse/Rat IGF-I/IGF1 Quantikine ELISA Kit (MG100, R&amp;D Systems, Inc, Minneapolis, MN, USA). Liver protein lysates were diluted at a ratio of 1:6 in calibrator diluent and the assay was performed following the manufacturer’s instructions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Triglycerides quantification</title><p>Liver tissues from P19 mice were promptly dissected and flash frozen. Subsequently, triglyceride analysis was conducted at the Vanderbilt Mouse Metabolic Phenotyping Center, employing established protocols previously utilized by our team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deguise et al., 2021b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Mouse metabolic hormone assay</title><p>Blood was collected from the mice immediately after decapitation using a Microcuvette CB 300 K2E coated with K2 EDTA (16.444.100) for capillary sampling. All samples were taken randomly without a fasting period. The blood was centrifuged at 5000 × <italic>g</italic> for 5 min at room temperature to separate the plasma. For plasma volumes less than 50 µL, genotypes were pooled to achieve a minimum volume of 50 µL as needed. The multiplexing analysis was performed using the Luminex 200 system (Luminex, Austin, TX, USA) by Eve Technologies Corp. (Calgary, Alberta). Twelve markers were simultaneously measured in the samples using Eve Technologies' Mouse Metabolic Hormone 12-Plex Discovery Assay (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, Massachusetts, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The 12-plex consisted of Amylin(active), C-Peptide 2, Ghrelin, GIP(total), GLP-1(active), Glucagon, Insulin, Leptin, PP, PYY, Resistin and Secretin. Assay sensitivities of these markers range from 1.4 to 91.8 pg/mL for the 12-plex. Individual analyte sensitivity values are available in the MilliporeSigma MILLIPLEX MAP protocol. If analyte levels were too low to be detected and fell outside the dynamic range, they were recorded as 0 in the graphs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Motor function, weight, and survival assessments</title><p>Motor function, weight, and survival were assessed according to established protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chehade et al., 2022</xref>). Spinal reflexes were evaluated using the righting reflex test, while motor balance and coordination were evaluated with the pen test. Additionally, muscle strength was measured using the inverted mesh grip test (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). The righting reflex test was conducted from P7 to P13, the inverted mesh grip test from P13 to P25, and the pen test from P19 to P25. Assessments were performed every 2 days. A maximum duration of 30 s for the pen test and 60 s for the inverted mesh grip represented the established threshold. Three consecutive measurements were obtained, and their average was recorded for subsequent analysis. Weight was measured every 2 days starting at day 7 until day 30, and then weekly until day 60. Animal welfare was monitored throughout the 60-day period during weight measurements.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Survival data were visualized using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, and intergroup differences were evaluated using the Mantel-Cox test. Brown-Forsythe and Welch ANOVA were employed to compare three or more sets of unpaired measurements, given the mosaic-like outcome observed in the <italic>Alb<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Smn<sup>2B/F7</sup></italic> model, where assumptions of equal variances were not tenable. Two-way ANOVA, followed by Šídák’s method for multiple comparisons, was utilized to assess the influence of two factors on a response. Pairwise comparisons were performed using a two-tailed Student’s t-test. Statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism V.10.2.1 (GraphPad Prism Software, San Diego, CA), with significance set at p&lt;0.05. Data were presented as mean ± standard error of the mean. Sample sizes (n) are provided in figure legends, indicating the number of biological replicates analyzed, with each data point corresponding to an individual mouse from at least two different litters.

This study is pioneering in its approach, focusing on the broader physiological implications of SMN, which has traditionally been associated predominantly with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) Novelty and Relevance: The study addresses a significant gap in understanding the role of liver-specific SMN depletion in the context of SMA. This is a novel approach that adds valuable insights into the multi-organ impact of SMN deficiency.</p><p>(2) Comprehensive Methodology: The use of a well-characterized mouse model with liver-specific SMN depletion is a strength. The study employs a robust set of techniques, including genetic engineering, histological analysis, and various biochemical assays.</p><p>(3) Detailed Analysis: The manuscript provides a thorough analysis of liver pathology and its potential systemic effects, particularly on the pancreas and glucose metabolism.</p><p>(4) Clear Presentation: The manuscript is well written.

Achieving complete consistency across samples is particularly challenging, especially given the complexity of our breeding scheme, which occasionally results in litters without any animals of the desired genotype. Importantly, our study not only demonstrates that liver-specific SMN depletion results in liver alterations and pancreatic dysfunction but also highlights the limitations and challenges associated with this mouse model. By doing so, we aim to provide valuable insights for other researchers considering similar approaches in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Marylin Alves de Almeida et al. developed a novel mouse cross via conditionally depleting functional SMN protein in the liver (AlbCre/+;Smn2B/F7).

It has been corrected to reflect that insulin is produced by beta cells and glucagon by alpha cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Efficiency and specificity of the Alb-Cre: if possible, cross the Alb-Cre with the Rosa26 reporter line to test the efficiency and specificity of the Alb-Cre.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this would provide valuable insights. However, initiating a new breeding program to generate the required genotypes would take over a year and is beyond the scope of this study. To address this in part, we performed Cre immunostaining of the liver, pancreas, and spinal cord at P19, as well as the liver at P60. These results, now included in Supplemental Figure 1, demonstrate liver-specific expression and variability across hepatocytes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>The title of this manuscript is potentially misleading. The manuscript largely investigates the involvement of SMN protein on peripheral organs such as the liver, muscles, neuromuscular junction, and the pancreas. Yet, the title could be interpreted that the peripheral nervous system or central nervous system is the main focus. The title should be edited to indicate key terms such as &quot;motor neuron and peripheral tissue pathology&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have revised the title to better represent the study’s focus. It is now “Impact of liver-specific survival motor neuron (SMN) depletion on central nervous system and peripheral tissue pathology”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Suggestions:</p><p>Please clarify and explain clearly the various mouse lines (Smn2B/+, Smn2B/- and +/+; Smn2B/F7) used as controls as the nomenclature used is confusing. In addition, authors could consider the use of a wild-type mouse line to be used as a control to validate changes in AlbCre/+; Smn2B/F7 mice.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now provided clarification on mouse line nomenclature in the Results section (lines 104–124). Full-body heterozygous mice (_Smn_2B/+) are used as controls due to their slightly reduced SMN protein levels and absence of phenotypic changes compared to wild-type mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given that the main phenotype implicated by the liver-specific depletion of SMN protein in AlbCre/+;Smn2B/F7 mice is pancreatic abnormalities (changes in alpha- and beta- cell numbers and blood glucose levels), authors should expand further on the pancreatic phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a full panel of metabolic hormones related to glucose metabolism in animals at P19 and P60. Furthermore, this has been discussed in detail in lines 284-298 and 334-344 of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A pancreas-specific depletion of SMN would provide this current manuscript with a better understanding of the role of SMN in regulating SMA pathology and provide more definitive conclusions on the contribution of liver-specific SMN depletion on normal pancreatic function.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this would be very informative. However, to do this would require initiation of a new breeding program that will take more than a year to arrive at the right genotypes. Although valuable, it is beyond the scope of the present study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should also delineate the role of hepatic SMN in pancreatic function, and how the intrinsic liver-specific loss of SMN directly impacts the pancreas. Currently, literature demonstrates that the fatty liver phenotype in SMA patients is a primary SMN-dependent hepatocyte-intrinsic liver defect associated with mitochondrial and other hepatic metabolism implications (see Leow et al, 2024 J Clin Invest). Given that the authors describe that SMN protein levels are not altered in the pancreas of AlbCre/+;Smn2B/F7 mice at P19, the authors ought to clarify how pancreas development and function is impacted in this mouse model, whether in-utero or postnatally. This could potentially underscore the cross-talk between liver SMN and pancreas function.</p></disp-quote><p>We have discussed the relationship between hepatic SMN and pancreatic function in the Discussion at lines 284-298 and 334-359.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Authors should also perform some metabolic tolerance tests to both oral glucose and insulin at an older age (e.g. P60) to study their homeostasis in these mice. These would help to substantiate the authors' conclusion and provide the paper with a greater level of novelty.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. A full panel of metabolic hormones related to glucose metabolism at P19 and P60 has been included, supported by additional figures that enhance the manuscript's novelty and depth.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Authors mentioned in the Discussion in lines 238 to 240: &quot;Altogether, our findings underscore the necessity of conducting further investigations at later time points to unveil potential modifications in other pathways and their repercussions on liver physiology&quot;. Please elucidate the effects of longer term liver-specific depletion of SMN beyond P19, such as the onset of NAFLD or a diabetic phenotype due to pancreatic dysfunctions.</p></disp-quote><p>We extended our data to include P60 mice and performed liver and pancreatic analyses at these time points. The observed effects were transient, possibly due to the stochastic nature of Cre expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, while AlbCre/+;Smn2B/F7 mice had similar weight gain trends as controls, it does appear that AlbCre/+;Smn2B/F7 mice weigh more than their controls by P60 (Figure 9C). This data would provide more convincing evidence of the metabolic defects observed in these mice.</p></disp-quote><p>As per the reviewer’s suggestion, we included new data (Figure 9D) showing % weight gain at P60 normalized to basal weight at P7. However, no statistically significant differences were detected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other than protein quantification, authors should perform immunohistochemistry or in-situ hybridization of SMN and imaging of AlbCre/+;Smn2B/F7 organs to validate the loss of liver-specific SMN. It is unclear from western blots that the expression of SMN is only in hepatocytes.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. Unfortunately, SMN antibodies have not produced reliable tissue immunostaining. To address this, we performed Cre immunostaining of the liver, pancreas, and spinal cord at P19, and the liver at P60, which demonstrated liver-specific expression. These results are now included in Supplemental Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Authors should consider re-wording lines 228 through 231: &quot;While our current analysis did not reveal significant differences in AlbCre/+;Smn2B/F7 mice, the observed upward trend in transferrin and HO levels suggests ongoing changes in iron metabolism, which may not be fully manifested at P19&quot;. Alternatively, a higher number of mouse samples would allow them to qualify this statement. Authors should also consider comparing levels of liver biomarkers such as ALT and AST, to check for liver homeostatic function.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed speculative statements to avoid unsupported claims.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Recommendations:</p><p>The methods and additional details to generate the AlbCre/+;Smn2B/F7 should be explained better in section 2.1 of the Results. It is potentially confusing as to why these mice had to carry both 2B and F7 alleles. Additionally, the role of the F7 allele is not deliberately clear in the Introduction.</p></disp-quote><p>Additional details are now included in the Introduction (lines 87-90) and the Results section (lines 104-124).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Authors should refer to Leow et al 2024 (J Clin Invest) and discuss how their current findings compare with their hepatocyte-intrinsic SMN deficiency IPSCs model.</p><p>We note a previous publication (Deguise et al 2021 Cell Mol Gastroenterol Hepatol) by the authors which characterized the Smn2B/- mouse model and its NAFLD/NASH features. From our understanding, the Smn2B/- mouse model appears to recapitulate SMA phenotype well, such as the early onset of hepatic steatosis and neurological conditions. As a follow-up to this publication, authors should discuss why this current study of a liver-specific SMN depletion is important and relevant to the study of SMA pathology.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the insightful suggestions. We have included a discussion of these findings and their relevance to the study of SMA pathology in lines 284-298 and 309-322.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor corrections:</p><p>Abstract (line 32) reads: &quot;a decrease in insulin producing alpha-cells and an increase in glucagon producing beta-cells&quot;. The authors should clarify and correct as insulin producing beta-cells and glucagon producing alpha-cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for catching the error. We corrected the description of insulin- and glucagon-producing cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please clarify the number and gender of mice used for weight tracking and motor function experiments up to P60 (Figure 9C). It would be inappropriate if male and female mice were plotted together. If so, authors should stratify data by gender.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. Unfortunately, we did not stratify the animals by sex due to the unequal and insufficient number of males and females in our study. To address this, we normalized weight gain to each animal’s starting weight, and no significant differences were observed (now shown in Figure 9D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The number of figures should be reduced. We recommend merging Figures 1 and 2 (generation of AlbCre/+;Smn2B/F7 mouse line and validation) and Figures 3 and 4 (liver function). Figures 5 through 9 may be supplemental figures instead.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestions. We merged Figures 1 and 2, and Figures 3 and 4, as requested. However, we would prefer to keep the other figures within the main results as they assess the impact of liver-specific depletion of SMN on other pathologies within the mouse model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Standardize the use of asterisks and reporting p-values in Figure 2. All other figures in the manuscript utilize asterisks, but Figures 2C', 2D' and 2E' use p-values across comparisons.</p></disp-quote><p>P-values were included only when they approached statistical significance, providing additional clarity to the results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is unclear what the white arrow in Figure 7A indicates.</p></disp-quote><p>It is meant to point out the absence of an innervating axon.

We have corrected the typo to indicate muscle fiber instead.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please clarify if muscle fiber size should be indicated as µm2 instead of µ2 in Figures 8B and 8C, as written in Materials and Methods under line 394.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for catching this.
