to exocytosis to maintain SV pool size and thus neurotransmitter release. Intense stimulation induces activity-dependent bulk endocytosis (ADBE) to recapture large quantities of SV constituents in large endosomes from which SVs reform. How these consecutive processes are spatiotemporally coordinated remains unknown.

Strong stimuli trigger PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> microdomain formation at periactive zones. Upon exocytosis, Flower translocates from SVs to periactive zones, where it increases PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels via Ca<sup>2+</sup> influxes. Remarkably, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> directly enhances Flower channel activity, thereby establishing a positive feedback loop for PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> microdomain compartmentalization. PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> microdomains drive ADBE and SV reformation from bulk endosomes. PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> further retrieves Flower to bulk endosomes, terminating endocytosis. We propose that the interplay between Flower and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is the crucial spatiotemporal cue that couples exocytosis to ADBE and subsequent SV reformation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>synaptic vesicle endocytosis</kwd><kwd>Ca2+ channel</kwd><kwd>PIP2</kwd><kwd>bulk endocytosis</kwd><kwd>periactive zone</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004663</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>107-2311-B-001-003-MY3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yao</surname><given-names>Chi-Kuang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004663</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>106-0210-01-15-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yao</surname><given-names>Chi-Kuang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004663</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>107-0210-01-19-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yao</surname><given-names>Chi-Kuang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The interplay between the Flower Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> spatiotemporally couples synaptic vesicle exocytosis to activity-dependent bulk endocytosis and synaptic vesicle reformation from bulk endosomes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Proper synaptic vesicle (SV) exocytosis dictates the robustness of brain activity. Coupling SV exocytosis with proper endocytosis is crucial for maintaining a balance of SV proteins at the release site, plasma membrane equilibrium, SV identity, and SV pool size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chanaday et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Haucke et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lou, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wu et al., 2014a</xref>). Currently, four modes of SV endocytosis are proposed. These differ in terms of stimulation intensity for their induction, formation, and molecular components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Haucke et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kononenko and Haucke, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wu et al., 2014a</xref>). Under mild neuronal stimulation, the SV partially fuses with the plasma membrane and reforms at the active zone, the so called âkiss and runâ mode. During clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), the SV fully collapses into the plasma membrane, followed by reformation of a single SV. Ultrafast endocytosis was also shown to recycle SVs at a sub-second timescale by forming aÂ ~Â 80 nm-sized bulk endosome predominantly at the edge of the active zone. SVs subsequently regenerate from this bulk endosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Granseth et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Watanabe et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Watanabe et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zhu et al., 2009</xref>). High frequency stimulation and thus exocytosis could easily surpass the capacity of the three above-described endocytic mechanisms. It has therefore been proposed that activity-dependent bulk endocytosis (ADBE) has the necessary recapture capacity upon intense stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clayton et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Soykan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wu and Wu, 2007</xref>). This retrieval mode is elicited at the periactive zone to recapture large quantities of SV constituents via bulk endosome (~100â500 nm) formation, from which SVs subsequently reform. Hence, specific routes of SV recycling may fit the specific demands of a wide range of neuronal activities at the synapse. However, how stimulation intensity dictates the choice between these different endocytic modes is not well understood.</p><p>ADBE has been documented in many different types of neurons in invertebrates and vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clayton et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heerssen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Heuser and Reese, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Holt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kasprowicz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kittelmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Miller and Heuser, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Richards et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Soykan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stevens et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vijayakrishnan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wenzel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wu and Wu, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Yao et al., 2017</xref>). Although the precise mechanism regulating ADBE is not known, multiple lines of evidence suggest that actin polymerization may serve as the membrane invagination force responsible for generating bulk endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gormal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Holt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kokotos and Low, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nguyen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Richards et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Soykan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, phosphatidylinositol metabolism has also been implicated in controlling this recycling mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gaffield et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Holt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Richards et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vijayakrishnan et al., 2009</xref>). Importantly, loss of Synaptojanin, the major phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>) catalytic enzyme in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tsujishita et al., 2001</xref>), leads to reduced SV endocytosis elicited by intense stimulation, presumably by affecting ADBE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mani et al., 2007</xref>). PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is known to promote actin polymerization by activating a number of actin modulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Janmey et al., 2018</xref>). PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is clustered to form microdomains upon the demand for diverse cellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoyagi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Honigmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kabeche et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Picas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Riggi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">van den Bogaart et al., 2011</xref>). It has also been reported that formation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> microdomains precedes actin polymerization during a process reminiscent of ADBE in neurosecretory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gormal et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, subcellular compartmentalization of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> may provide the spatial information dictating where bulk membranes will invaginate. However, the mechanism initiating the formation of the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> microdomains is unknown.</p><p>Coordinated SV protein and membrane retrieval plays an important role in maintaining the identity of newly formed SVs during SV recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kaempf and Maritzen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">McMahon and Boucrot, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Saheki and De Camilli, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Traub and Bonifacino, 2013</xref>). It has been well documented that proper sorting of SV proteins to the nascent SV is achieved in CME by the cooperative action of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and adaptor protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Saheki and De Camilli, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Traub and Bonifacino, 2013</xref>). Recent studies have also revealed a distinct sorting mechanism that retrieves selective SV cargoes to the bulk endosome via ADBE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kokotos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nicholson-Fish et al., 2015</xref>). Several lines of evidence further suggest that clathrin and adaptor protein complexes are required for reforming SVs from the bulk endosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheung and Cousin, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glyvuk et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kokotos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kononenko et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Park et al., 2016</xref>). A dynaminI/dynaminIII/clathrin-independent mechanism has also been reported as being involved in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wu et al., 2014c</xref>). Thus, during SV regeneration via ADBE, multiple protein sorting steps may be required to ensure that the SVs harbor the proper compositions of lipids and proteins, thereby endowing specific release probabilities in relation to other modes of endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheung et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hoopmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nicholson-Fish et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Silm et al., 2019</xref>). The mechanism by which protein sorting and membrane retrieval are coordinated in this process remains to be explored.</p><p>Here, we show that, upon intense stimulation, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is compartmentalized into microdomains at periactive zones in the synaptic boutons of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). Blockade of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> microdomain formation diminishes ADBE and SV reformation from the bulk endosome. Increased intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and SV exocytosis are prerequisites for initiating ADBE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Morton et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wu and Wu, 2007</xref>). We have previously shown that Flower (Fwe), a SV-associated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel, regulates both CME and ADBE, and that its channel activity is strongly activated upon intense stimulation to elicit ADBE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Yao et al., 2017</xref>). We show that Fwe initiates a positive feedback loop upon PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> increase to ensure the formation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> microdomains and thus trigger ADBE and subsequent SV reformation. Intriguingly, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> also participates in retrieval of Fwe to the bulk endosome, thereby stopping membrane recycling. Hence, spatiotemporal interplays between Flower and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> coordinate the retrieval of SV cargos and membranes, coupling exocytosis to ADBE and subsequent SV reformation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Intense neuronal activity induces formation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> microdomains at the presynaptic periactive zone of <italic>Drosophila</italic> synapses</title><p>To investigate the dynamics of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in the presynaptic compartment, we expressed a GFP fusion protein of the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of PLC<sub>Î´1</sub> (PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP) in synaptic boutons of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval NMJs using <italic>nSyb-GAL4</italic>, a pan-neuronal driver. PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP binds to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> with high affinity and is widely used to label subcellular compartments in which PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is enriched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Khuong et al., 2010</xref>). We delivered 20 Hz stimuli for three minutes to synaptic boutons in a 2 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> solution and performed live imaging in the third minute. Consecutive snapshot images were taken before stimulation, during the third minute of stimulation, and after stimulation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1aâb</xref>, we observed a very subtle increase in PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP fluorescence in individual boutons (white arrows), similar to findings of a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Verstreken et al., 2009</xref>). However, when we raised the stimulus intensity to 40 Hz, we recorded a robust increase in fluorescence relative to a GFP fusion protein of the plasma membrane-integrated mCD8 domain (<italic>UAS-mCD8-GFP</italic>). Fluorescence signals rapidly returned to basal levels within tens of seconds when the stimuli were removed. We have previously documented that treatment with 40 Hz electric pulses or 90 mM high KCl solution can cause comparable stimulation intensities in <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ boutons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Yao et al., 2017</xref>). High K<sup>+</sup> treatment also increased the fluorescence signal of PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP. No increase in the presynaptic protein level of PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP was found under this condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1aâb</xref>), arguing that this stimulation does not induce protein synthesis. These results suggest that, in response to intense stimulation, PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP is redistributed and concentrated to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-enriched subdomains of the plasma membrane, thereby enhancing the overall fluorescence.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> forms microdomains at periactive zones under conditions of intense stimulation.</title><p>(<bold>aâb</bold>) Increased fluorescence of PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP but not mCD8-GFP in NMJ boutons upon intense stimulation.

Confocal images revealed that, for neurons at rest, native PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP fluorescence was weakly detected on the presynaptic plasma membrane labeled by Î±-Hrp staining, with some additional fluorescent signal being dispersed in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1c</xref>). We then elevated PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> on the plasma membrane by removing a copy of <italic>synaptojanin</italic> (<italic>synj</italic>), which encodes the major neuronal PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tsujishita et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Verstreken et al., 2003</xref>). Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Verstreken et al., 2009</xref>), this reduction in Synj levels enhanced PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1câd</xref>). In this context, we did not observe a significant change in protein expression of PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP in the presynaptic compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1eâf</xref>). By using Î±-GFP immunostaining, these PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP signals could be faithfully amplified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1câd</xref>). Therefore, this immunostaining approach was subsequently used to monitor presynaptic PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels.</p><p>Next, we stimulated the boutons expressing PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP with 90 mM K<sup>+</sup> and 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> for 10 min. Similar to our live-imaging results, PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP signals were significantly increased on the presynaptic plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1gâh</xref>). In particular, we observed high-level induction of PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1câd</xref>). To assess the possibility that chemical fixation may have altered membrane properties and consequently plasma membrane PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP clustering upon intense stimulation, we further examined the distributions of mCD8-GFP and PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PHS39R-EGFP, a PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-binding mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Khuong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Verstreken et al., 2009</xref>). There was no obvious change in the plasma membrane pattern of mCD8-GFP in fixed boutons stimulated with high K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2aâb</xref>). Unlike PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP, PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PHS39R-EGFP was found mainly in the cytosol at rest. After intense stimulation, immunostaining signals of PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PHS39R-EGFP did not accumulate on the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2câd</xref>) and were not increased within the boutons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2e</xref>). Thus, clustering of PLCÎ´1-PH-EGFP on the plasma membrane upon stimulation results from an increase in local PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> concentration, although a potential effect of chemical fixation, if any, on PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP clustering cannot be excluded. To assess potential dominant-negative effects of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding by PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP on the stimulation-induced accumulation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, we further examined the recruitment of the AP-2 complex by PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. Similar to PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP, levels of the Î± subunit of the AP-2 complex (AP-2Î±) were also increased on the plasma membrane upon high K<sup>+</sup> stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3aâb</xref>). Together, these data indicate that intense stimulation can promote the formation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> microdomains.</p><p>We noted that the induced PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> microdomains were primarily sited at periactive zones marked by activity-dependent localization of Eps15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Koh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Winther et al., 2013</xref>).

By using structured illumination microscopy (SIM), we estimated that the average size of these PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> microdomains formed after stimulation isÂ ~300 nm in diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1eâf</xref>) (0.07655Â Â±Â 0.004 Î¼m<sup>2</sup>, meanÂ Â±Â S.E.M., nÂ =Â 37 boutons).</p><p>Next, to determine the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence of the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> microdomains, we stimulated the boutons in a solution of 90 mM K<sup>+</sup> and 0 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which resulted in failure to induce PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> microdomain formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>).

In contrast, SV reformation actively occurred in the boutons expressing high levels of PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PHS39R-EGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2câd</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Furthermore, we observed a loss of SV reformation ability upon mild overexpression of Synj (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2câd</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Hence, the formation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> microdomains is essential for both ADBE and SV reformation from the bulk endosome, with the latter event being elicited by relatively high levels of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. Note that perturbation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> microdomain formation did not cause SV accumulation on the bulk endosome during recovery periods, indicating that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> microdomains may play an early role in SV reformation from bulk endosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> microdomains are established via a positive feedback loop of fwe and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub></title><p>We have previously shown that the SV-associated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel Flower (Fwe) elevates presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in response to strong stimuli to trigger ADBE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Yao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Yao et al., 2017</xref>). Given the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> microdomains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>), we hypothesized that exocytosis evoked by intense stimulation promotes Fwe clustering at periactive zones, where it may provide the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx to induce PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> microdomain formation. To test this hypothesis, we first conducted a proximity ligation assay (PLA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">SÃ¶derberg et al., 2008</xref>) to investigate if there is a close association between Fwe and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in response to stimulation.

However, intense stimulation failed to elicit PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> microdomain formation in the <italic>fwe</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3câd</xref>), revealing a crucial role for Fwe in this process. To determine if the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activity of Fwe is responsible for this activity, we conducted rescue experiments based on our previous report in which <italic>fwe</italic> mutant boutons exhibited expression of the wild-type Fwe transgene or the FweE79Q mutant transgene that has reduced Ca<italic><sup>2+</sup></italic> conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Yao et al., 2017</xref>).

Thus, Fwe triggers the formation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> microdomains in a Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel-dependent manner.</p><p>Calmodulin and Calcineurin are thought to be the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors for ADBE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Evans and Cousin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Marks and McMahon, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sun et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wu et al., 2014b</xref>). The Calcineurin complex dephosphorylates PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> metabolic enzymes, including Synj and Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase IÎ³ (PIPKIÎ³) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cousin and Robinson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lee et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">van den Bout and Divecha, 2009</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> possesses three isoforms of the catalytic subunit of Calcineurin, i.e., CanA1, CanA-14F, and Pp2B-14D. CanA1 regulates development of <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ boutons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wong et al., 2014</xref>).

Similar to the effect of loss of Fwe, reducing CanA1 levels via expression of either RNAi construct greatly suppressed the formation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> microdomains compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3gâh</xref>), indicating that Calcineurin mediates the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx conducted by Fwe to induce PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> microdomains.</p><p>Our previous Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging data showed that intense stimulation activates Fwe to increase presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Yao et al., 2017</xref>). We measured intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator GCaMP6f (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2013</xref>), and found that whereas control boutons exhibited a robust increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> upon high K<sup>+</sup> stimulation, <italic>fwe</italic> mutant boutons exhibit an impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup> response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3iâj</xref>). Unexpectedly, <italic>canA1</italic> knockdown also elicited the same deficient Ca<sup>2+</sup> response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3iâj</xref>). Similar suppressive effects were obtained upon overexpressing Synj or the PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3iâj</xref>). Hence, Calcineurin activation may increase PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> activity, which may in turn promote the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activity of Fwe to further increase intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. To investigate the potential for such feedback regulation, we expressed the PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH domain in a loss of Fwe background. Expression of the PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH domain did not rescue the low Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration caused by the <italic>fwe</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3iâj</xref>), showing that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> suppression exerted by the PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH domain indeed depends on Fwe. These findings support that a positive feedback loop involving Fwe and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is responsible for the formation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> microdomains.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> gates fwe</title><p>A well-known function of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is to modulate ion channel activity through its electrostatic binding to clustered positively-charged amino acids adjacent to the transmembrane domains of ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hille et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Suh and Hille, 2008</xref>). Through protein alignment analysis, we found tandem positively-charged amino acids, including lysine (K) and arginine (R), in the intracellular juxta-transmembrane regions of Fwe. These residues are evolutionarily conserved in mice and humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>), whereas other cytosolic residues show poor conservation. This feature inspired us to test the potential impact of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> on the channel function of Fwe. To determine direct interaction between Fwe and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, we conducted a nanoluciferase (Nluc)-based bioluminance resonance energy transfer (BRET) assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cabanos et al., 2017</xref>). In our BRET assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>), upon ion channel binding of BODIPY-TMR-conjugated PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, illumination of Nluc-fused ion channels wrapped in detergent-formed micelles can excite BODIPY-TMR-conjugated PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> to emit a BRET signal. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, we reconstituted the micelles containing purified Nluc-Fwe-1D4 fusion proteins and, after adding BODIPY-TMR-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and furimazine (a Nluc substrate), we observed a remarkable increase in BRET signal. Excess cold PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> reduced the signal toÂ ~50% of the BRET signals by competing for the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding sites in Fwe, suggesting direct PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding to Fwe. To assess the involvement of the positively-charged amino acids of Fwe in PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding, we mutated all of the clustered positively-charged amino acids to non-charged alanine to eliminate the electrostatic interactions. Residue substitution resulted in a significant reduction in BRET signal, comparable to the competitive effect attributable to provision of excess cold PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. Therefore, the majority of the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding activity of Fwe is mediated by these positively-charged amino acids. Specifically, alanine substitution of residues in both the middle (K95, K100, R105) and C-terminal (K146, K147, R150) regions of Fwe reduced PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-specific binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4bâc</xref>). Moreover, when N-terminal residues (K29, R33) of Fwe were further substituted with alanines, binding of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> was also reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4bâc</xref>). Hence, these in vitro assays reveal that Fwe directly binds PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> through multiple regions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binds to Fwe and promotes its Ca<sup>2+</sup> channelling activity.</title><p>(<bold>aâc</bold>) PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binds Fwe.

Increased PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> enhances Fwe Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activity, thereby establishing a positive feedback loop that induces PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> microdomain formation (Step 2). High levels of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> within these microdomains elicit bulk membrane invagination by triggering actin polymerization (Step 3). In parallel, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> facilitates proper retrieval of Fwe to the bulk endosome (Step 4), thereby terminating the ADBE process.

PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is known to control a range of actin regulators, thereby modulating the dynamics of actin polymerization and branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Janmey et al., 2018</xref>). It has been shown previously that, in response to nicotine stimulation, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> forms clustered microdomains of sub-micrometer scale prior to the appearance of an actin-based ring structure in bovine chromaffin cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gormal et al., 2015</xref>).

Perturbations of the formation of these microdomains reduces ADBE activity very significantly, demonstrating that rapid accumulation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in microdomains is needed to trigger extensive actin polymerization, which likely generates sufficient mechanical force to produce the large endosomes. Furthermore, loss of <italic>fwe</italic> or RNAi-mediated calcineurin knockdown effectively inhibited PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> microdomain formation and, as a consequence, ADBE.

At mammalian central synapses, PIP5KÎ³661, one of the PIP5KÎ³ isoforms, is the most abundant relative to other isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wenk et al., 2001</xref>). Activation of PIP5Ks can be engaged by binding to its regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">van den Bout and Divecha, 2009</xref>). In response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation, Calcineurin has been shown to dephosphorylate PIP5KÎ³661 to promote its interaction with AP-2 complexes, which augments the enzymatic activity of PIP5KÎ³661 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nakano-Kobayashi et al., 2007</xref>). Synj is the major PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> phosphatase in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tsujishita et al., 2001</xref>) and it is involved in the SV endocytosis prompted by strong stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mani et al., 2007</xref>). Whereas phosphorylation of Synj by CDK5 inhibits its activity, Calcineurin enhances Synj activity via dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lee et al., 2004</xref>). In yeasts, cells undergo bulk membrane invagination, a process reminiscent of neuronal ADBE, under conditions of hyperosmotic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guiney et al., 2015</xref>).

Hence, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> controls Fwe gating, so that Fwe can promote PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> compartmentalization through positive feedback regulation.

Given that the AP-2 adaptor complex works closely with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">McMahon and Boucrot, 2011</xref>), these findings imply a role for PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and the AP-2 adaptor complex in SV protein sorting via ADBE. Indeed, our data show that bulk endosomes recycle few in a PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> microdomain-dependent manner. Hence, in addition to initiating ADBE, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> may participate in SV protein sorting to bulk endosomes.</p><p>SV regeneration occurs following formation of the bulk endosome. Our results also show that either removing Fwe-derived Ca<sup>2+</sup> or perturbing PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> activity impaired the ability of SVs to reform from the bulk endosome, highlighting the essential role of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> microdomains in this process. How could PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> of the plasma membrane regulate subsequent SV reformation? It has been shown that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is rapidly downregulated on bulk endosomes once formed by ADBE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang-Ileto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cremona et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Milosevic et al., 2011</xref>). It is conceivable that the high concentrations of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in microdomains may compensate for rapid turnover, thereby ensuring appropriate concentrations of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> or PI(4)P for further recruitment of clathrin and adaptor protein complexes, such as AP-1 and AP-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blumstein et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheung and Cousin, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">FaÃºndez et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glyvuk et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kokotos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kononenko et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Park et al., 2016</xref>). Alternatively, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> may facilitate SV protein sorting prior to ADBE, meaning proper SV protein compositions on bulk endosomes could control recruitment of adaptor protein complexes. Both of these potential mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and may operate in parallel. Therefore, we propose that the Fwe-dependent formation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> microdomains is potentially important in coordinating retrieval of SV membranes and cargos when SVs are recycled via ADBE. Notably, the Fwe channel is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Yao et al., 2009</xref>). We have also previously demonstrated conserved functions of Fwe in CME and ADBE at the mammalian central synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Yao et al., 2017</xref>). A recent study has also identified Fwe as a key protein mediating Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent granule endocytosis in mouse cytotoxic T lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang et al., 2018</xref>). Hence, we hypothesize that the mechanism of ADBE we report here may be generally deployed across synapses and species, even in other non-neuronal cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> strains and genetics</title><p><italic>fwe</italic> mutants and transgenes: <italic>fwe<sup>DB25</sup></italic> and <italic>fwe<sup>DB56</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Yao et al., 2009</xref>); <italic>UAS-Flag-Fwe-HA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Yao et al., 2009</xref>); <italic>UAS-Flag-Fwe[E79Q]-HA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Yao et al., 2017</xref>); <italic>UAS-canA1-RNAi(FB4)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dijkers and O'Farrell, 2007</xref>); <italic>UAS-canA1-RNAi(TRiP.JF01871)</italic> (Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center, BDSC#25850); <italic>UAS-synj</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Khuong et al., 2013</xref>); <italic>UAS-PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Verstreken et al., 2009</xref>) (Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center, BDSC#39693); <italic>UAS-PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PHS39R-EGFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Verstreken et al., 2009</xref>) (Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center, BDSC#39694); <italic>nSyb-GAL4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pauli et al., 2008</xref>); <italic>UAS-mCD8-EGFP</italic> (Kyoto Stock Center, DGRC#108068); <italic>vglut-lexA</italic> (Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center, BDSC #60314); <italic>13XLexAop2-IVS-GCaMP6f</italic> (Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center, BDSC #44277)); <italic>synj<sup>1</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Verstreken et al., 2003</xref>) (Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center, BDSC#24883; <italic>LexAop2-PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-APEX2-HA</italic> (This paper); and <italic>LexAop2-PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP</italic> (This paper).

High concentrations of glutamate were used to desensitize glutamate receptors, thereby reducing muscle contraction when stimulated. A cut axonal bundle was sucked into the tip of a glass capillary electrode and then stimulated at 20 or 40 Hz for 3 min. Stimulus strength was set at 5 V and 0.5 ms duration by means of pClamp 10.6 software (Axon Instruments Inc). Ten images were taken from larval fillets at rest. After stimulation for 2 min, muscle contraction significantly decelerated. Thus, we captured 60 consecutive snapshot images every second from the third minute. Muscles 6 and 7 of abdominal segment three were imaged. Under the condition of high K<sup>+</sup> stimulation, larval fillets were bathed in a solution of 90 mM K<sup>+</sup>/2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>/7 mM glutamate (25 mM NaCl, 90 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 5 mM trehalose, 5 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 30 mM sucrose, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 7 mM monosodium glutamate) for 5 min.

levels of PI(4,5)P2. The observation that Flower recruits PI(4,5)P2 which directly enhances Flower channel activity is elegantly demonstrated. Moreover, the fact that PI(4,5)P2 drives ADBE which in turn removes Flower, nicely explains how the process is terminated.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Flower initiates a positive feedback loop upon PIP<sub>2</sub> enrichment at periactive zones to control bulk endocytosis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Hugo Bellen, Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich, Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Patrik Verstreken (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. As you will notice the reviewers find your data interesting and they have a positive tone. However, they raise a number of issues. I have read their reviews and your manuscript. Many of the issues that are raised relate to better controls, textual changes, clarifications, and quantification of data. We think you can address most of these in a timely manner.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this paper Li et al. show how the calcium channel and PI(4,5)P2 regulate bulk endocytosis at synapses. Their work brings exciting new mechanistic insight into the regulation of this process, and what I find of particular interest is the notion that Fwe might be gated by PI(4,5)P2 to control the retrieval of synaptic membrane. I think this is an exciting paper and I have mostly minor comments on interpretation and one suggestion for a set of genetic interactions to cement the role for calcineurin in this pathway.</p><p>1) The authors elegantly confirm and demonstrate further that PI(4,5)P2levels increase during stimulation. They conclude this is in microdomains based on several pieces of data. This indeed seems to be the case but I think it is important to note that chemical fixation may alter distribution. I would either note this in the text or try to include single particle tracking experiments (eg sptPALM).</p><p>2) In Figure 2 they investigate the role for PI(4,5)P2 in ADBE using PLCdPH over expression and Synj over expression. It might be interesting to look at the role for Tweek in this process as well, giving the opposing effect of Tweek in comparison to Synj1.</p><p>3) I wonder if in the reformation assays in Figure 2 the authors can observe the formation of small SVs at the surface of bulk endosomes?</p><p>4) I think the conclusion that the PLA signal indicates a physical interaction between Fwe and PI(4,5)P2 is overstated: to conclude that Fwe moves in to PI(4,5)P2-enriched domains would be more correct. The demonstration of a direct interaction is given later in the paper in Figure 4.</p><p>5) The authors write &quot;Similar to the effect of loss of Fwe, reduced CanA1 levels greatly suppressed the formation of PIP2 microdomains compared to the control (Figure 3E-F), indicating that Calcineurin mediates the Fwe Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel to induce PIP2 microdomains.&quot; This is not shown: the authors show that both Fwe and CanA1 reduce the formation of PI(4,5)P2 microdomains during stimulation, but not that CanA1 mediates this effect in an Fwe-dependent manner. This should be shown using genetic interactions: eg test if double mutants show a similar (non-additive) effect compared to either single mutant, or overexpress Fwe in CanA1 mutants (and vice versa) to determine if this rescues the defect.</p><p>6) Figure 6G-H seem superfluous to me and not central to the story. I would remove this from the manuscript.</p><p>7) I also suggest to write PI(4,5)P2 or PhIns(4,5)P2 instead of PIP2 because the latter refers to all phosphoinositides that have 2 phosphate groups, and not specifically to PI(4,5)P2.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This paper describes an intriguing model for a feedback pathway by which the calcium channel Flower, Ca++ signaling, and PIP2 together regulate activity dependent bulk endocytosis and synaptic vesicle regeneration at a neuronal synapse. This is an interesting and novel idea, which could illuminate key molecular dynamics downstream of synaptic activity that regulate synaptic vesicle recycling. The strengths of the paper are the in vitro-in vivo analysis of fwe-PIP2 binding and function, and in the measurement of each of PIP2, Calcium signaling, and membrane traffic for each component.</p><p>1) The authors claim the increase in fluorescence of PHPLC-GFP as evidence of clustering in microdomains. However, this is a circular argument, as the increase in fluorescence is proposed as the evidence that PIP2 microdomains have formed. This claim is an important premise of the paper, as PHPLC fluorescence intensity is the primary quantified metric for a central conclusion of the paper (that PIP2 microdomains form upon stimulation, and require fwe).</p><p>At a technical level, it is difficult to understand why clustering should increase fluorescence, since the total amount of protein is not changed by Western blotting. One possibility is that diffuse fluorescence is below the detection limit of the microscope, while clustered fluorescence is above this limit; however, comparing measurements in this way from inside and outside the linear range of detection is misleading. Another possibility is that GFP fluorescence emission (but not levels) is increased in the microenvironment of the puncta, but this is not evidence for clustering, but instead for a changed microenvironment. The authors could quantify this by post-staining after fixation with anti-GFP antibodies in a second channel (they would expect to see no clustering if the effect was purely on GFP fluorescence). Either way, the whole-bouton quantification presented here is not sufficient, and more rigorous quantification of clustering is required (see point 4).</p><p>Finally, there are concerns about potential effects of PH-PLCdelta (which has been used here and elsewhere both as a reporter and manipulation for PIP2). What level of expression were used in Figure 1 compared to 2, and could the &quot;clusters&quot; coincide with malfunctioning endocytosis? Levels should be compared directly (rather than inferred from temperature).</p><p>Due to these questions, some form of independent evidence (published or novel) for PIP2 clustering must be shown or cited.</p><p>2) The consistency of phenotypes among experimental manipulations on Calcium, PIP2, and vesicle dynamics is compelling evidence for a feedback loop. However, not all functional links in the loop are completely tested; for instance, whether CanA1 loss of function leads to calcium signaling defects via synj/PIP2, or through its myriad other targets. While it might be possible to ânormalizeâ synj phosphorylation using minibrain heterozygotes or mutants, this is beyond the scope of suggested revisions. However, where a link in the chain has not been as rigorously tested (as for CanA1), the authors should discuss other possible interpretations of these data (as they do for other possible means of gating Flower).</p><p>3) Figure 2âfigure supplement 2- why does FM get taken up to similar extent with high PLC or synj if EM data suggests ABDE is not happening? And why is unloading not impaired if vesicle recycling is diminished?</p><p>4) There are several instances where images are not quantified, or where the method of quantification is insufficiently described:</p><p>a) Currently Materials and methods indicate only that âimage processing and quantification were achieved using LSM Zen and ImageJâ. The authors must describe in detail how fluorescence imaging was processed and quantified. What processing steps were performed? In 2D or 3D? Projections or slices? How were NMJ masks or ROIs created? Materials and methods do not describe what kind of microscope and objective were used for live imaging (important for understanding resolution). All this information is required to correctly interpret the imaging data.</p><p>b) Microdomains are poorly described: how is their size quantified? 200nm is very close to the resolution limit of SIM, suggesting many measurements may have been at the floor of the resolution of the system and that this measurement likely represents an overestimate of the size of the domain. It would be informative to see a histogram of values to determine to what degree this is the case, and discuss if appropriate.</p><p>c) How was DAB staining (Figure 6) quantified? What was the criterion used to discriminate between no labeling and âsimilar to SVâ (eg in d, where the overall staining appears to be more similar to a than to b). In the text, the data are presented as both SV and bulk endosome levels decreasing, though these data are not quantified or presented in the figure.</p><p>5) If fwe initiates a positive feedback loop, why do only high levels of activity stimulate clustering and ADBE?</p><p>6) The claim that Fwe is âselectively sortedâ by PIP2 seems overstated, especially given the companion idea that Fwe sorts PIP2 into microdomains. In general, the data in Figure 6 are a bit unconvincing or overinterpreted:</p><p>a) AP2 complexes strongly associated with PIP2 microdomains- this is completely unsupported by the data, which show an exceedingly low correlation.</p><p>b) How were âcolocalizedâ pixels determined in Figure 6H (not described in legend or Materials and methods)? Further, the figure legend for 6I indicates that âQuantification data for Pearson correlation coefficientsâ is the overlapping area divided by the overall area. This is not a Pearson's correlation coefficient, which rather depends on the linear relationship between channel intensities of all (or a subset) of pixels.</p><p>c) âsynj altered the localization of the AP2 complexâ- this is not quantified and is very difficult to determine from the images presented. This is also a clear example where it is not obvious that images are being taken from the same Z-plane, which further confounds interpretation of the data.</p><p>d) AP2-fwe IPs are not very convincing. The difference between negative control and IP is subtle, only a very small fraction of input, and neither repeated or quantified. These data should be strengthened or removed.</p><p>e) Is synj expressed at room temperature or 29 degrees?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Previous work by the Yao lab showed that the SV-associated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel Flower (Fwe) is required for both clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) of synaptic vesicles (SVs) from the plasma membrane (PM) and activity-dependent bulk endocytosis (ADBE). Importantly, Fwe has likely a distinct role for each endocytotic route since only ADBE requires Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel function. This follow-up study pursues the mechanisms underlying Fwe's role for ABDE. The study provides evidence for an interesting model of Fwe's role in ADBE that may significantly advance our understanding of mechanisms underlying ADBE. Specifically, it suggests that freshly exocytosed Fwe on the PM forms a positive Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent feedback loop that facilitates the generation and accumulation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) in microdomains on the PM. In turn, accumulating PIP2 may facilitate compartmentalization of Fwe to bulk endosomes, thereby terminating ADBE. I have a number of concerns.</p><p>1) To visualize PIP2 at fly NMJs, the entire study relies only on a single PIP2 marker, the Gal4-driven expression of PLCÎ´1-PH-EGFP. Unfortunately, this marker not only reduces &quot;free&quot; PIP2 levels but also has dominant-negative effects on synaptic growth and SV cycling (Khuong et al., 2010). To properly support the notion that intense stimulation causes accumulation of PIP2 in microdomains on the PM, a number of corrections are required:</p><p>a) the PLCÎ´1-PH-EGFP imaging experiments require a proper control, like the expression of PLCÎ´1-PHS39R-GFP, which does not bind PIP2. Measuring mCD-EGFP expression levels is not a proper control.</p><p>b) the stimulation-induced accumulation of PIP2 should be verified by a second independent marker like quantitative immunostainings for edogenous Î±-adaptin or other PIP2-binding proteins. This is especially important to rule out unaccounted dominant-negative effects.</p><p>c) It is unclear how changes in PLCÎ´1-PH-EGFP fluorescence (Figure 1A-B, D, plus all subsequent experiments using PLCÎ´1-PH-EGFP including Figure 3C-F, 4F-G) are measured at larval NMJs since no information about respective ROIs is provided. To make a strong statement about a PIP2 accumulation on the PM, PLCÎ´1-PH-EGFP fluorescence measured for an entire bouton (from one or a few slices) should be subtracted by the PLCÎ´1-PH-EGFP fluorescence obtained from the cytosol of the bouton. Measurements using ROIs for the entire bouton do not allow specific conclusions about PM levels.</p><p>2) To significantly strengthen the conclusion that PIP2 accumulation drives ADBE initiation and SV reformation (Figure 2) a proper control should be used for the postulated PLCÎ´1-PH-EGFP-mediating reduction of PIP2 levels. Ideally, one may use expression of the PLCÎ´1-PHS39R-GFP mutant. Overexpression of synaptojanin alone does not make the point that the reduced ADBE levels are due to PIP2 depletion since synaptojanin also affects several other phosphatidylinositides.</p><p>3) The proximity ligation experiments of Figure 3A require a proper control like PLCÎ´1-PHS39R-GFP co-expression with Flag-Fwe-HA. Otherwise, the observed proximity could be due to other factors.</p><p>4) The images of Figure 3C, e show little evidence of PLCÎ´1-PH-EGFP microdomains at the PM, much in contrast to Figure 1. Does this mean that the quantification associated with these figures mostly reflects PIP2 on cytosolic bulk endosomes?</p><p>5) The shown knockdown data of CanA1 in Figure 3E-H require a control for specificity, best co-expression of an RNAi-resistant WT transgene.</p><p>6) The study suggests that PIP2 binding to freshly exocytosed Fwe gates Fwe's Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activity. In turn, the resulting Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx activates calcineurin and the postulated feedback loop accumulating PIP2 at the PM. If correct, one would expect that a mutation that several affects Fwe' Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activity (like FweE79Q) should significantly reduce the accumulation of PIP2. Is this indeed the case? If not, the Fwe-dependent PIP2 accumulation may occur through a different mechanism.</p><p>7) The HA-Fwe-APEX2 experiments of Figure 6 require further controls including documentation that the fusion protein is properly localized to SVs and not excessively retained on the PM during ADBE. The EM alone is not convincing.</p><p>8) The co-immunoprecipitation of Fwe with AP2 shown in Figure 6G requires quantification.</p><p>9) The evidence for the conclusion that accumulating PIP2 facilitates &quot;sorting&quot; of Fwe for ADBE is weak because it essentially rests on the HA-Fwe-APEX2 experiment. Since reducing PIP2 levels by synaptojanin expression reduced the bulk endosome localization of Fwe as judged by DAB staining levels (Figure 6D-F), the authors conclude that &quot;PIP2 microdomains can facilitate the retrieval of Fwe to the bulk endosome&quot;. However, this appears to be somewhat a catch22 since reduced PIP2 levels decrease the overall amount of bulk endocytosis. Whether the potentially reduced levels of internalized Fwe are disproportionally reduced has not been addressed. In addition, DAB staining intensity should not be used to quantify protein levels as the enzymatic reaction may have different constrains on SVs versus endosomes.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A positive feedback loop between Flower and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> at periactive zones controls bulk endocytosis in <italic>Drosophila</italic>&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Richard Aldrich (Senior Editor) and Hugo Bellen (Reviewing Editor).</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The authors have provided a meaningfully improved manuscript that largely addresses the major concerns of the paper. In particular, the authors provide several new lines of evidence that levels or organization of PI(4,5)P2 are likely changing in response to stimulation: There is no change in the new negative control PH S39 mutant, AP2a levels increase at the membrane, and the levels of native and anti-GFP fluorescence of PH-PLC increase at the membrane. Especially given the strong correspondence between in vitro and in vivo data and the consistent phenotypes among the perturbations in the proposed pathway, these new data further strengthen the main claim that Fwe acts in a positive feedback loop with Ca++ and PI(4,5)P2.</p><p>It is worth noting that the precise nature of the microdomains remains a bit unclear. It is difficult to discern whether PI(4,5)P2 microdomains are forming de novo following stimulation, or whether PI(4,5)P2 Â¬signal increases in existing microdomains (for example, AP2a recruitment to the membrane is quite high even under resting conditions). And as noted by the authors, while the PH domain is the best available tool to answer the questions posed, it remains possible that properties of the microdomains partially reflect the function-perturbing aspects of the probe. However, these caveats do not significantly detract from the core conclusions of the paper.</p><p>Figure 3H. Something is wrong with the shown KD data by UAS-canA1-RNAi(FB5) or the drawn conclusion that &quot;reducing CanA1 levels via expression of either RNAi construct greatly suppressed the formation of PI(4,5)P2 microdomains compared to the control (Figure 3G-H)&quot;. The resting levels for the canA1 KD are only 50% of control. The K<sup>+</sup>-induced increase PLCÎ´1-PH-EGFP in the KD is as large as in control. Accordingly, the KD seems to have no effect, which would suggest that one of the two KDs is not specific for canA1.</p><p>If the FB5 KD is not working, the one needs a wild type CanA1 co-expression for the KD with the canA1-RNAi(JF01871) transgene to demonstrate specificity.</p><p>Please clarify.</p><p>Figure 3I. The canA1 KD uses the controversial UAS-canA1-RNAi(FB5) transgene, which does not appear to block the formation of PI(4,5)P2 microdomains (Figure 3H). The experiment should be done with the UAS-canA1-RNAi(JF01871) transgene as only this transgene reliable affects PI(4,5)P2 microdomains (assuming the KD can be rescued). Otherwise, one cannot conclude that &quot;Calcineurin mediates the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx conducted by Fwe to induce PI(4,5)P2 microdomains&quot;. Resolving this issue is critical.</p><p>&quot;Together, these data suggest that the PI(4,5)P2 microdomains initiate ADBE to control SV membrane retrieval upon intense stimulation.&quot; This sentence should be rephrased. The shown FM1-43 data (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2B) only suggest that overexpression of PLCÎ´1-PH-EGFP or Synj impairs SV endocytosis independent of the mode of endocytosis. The shown FM1-43 data do not exclude a role of PI(4,5)P2 for other modes of endocytosis.</p><p>Moreover, the FM1-43 data use a much shorter (30 seconds) and milder stimulation than the solid EM data visualizing ADBE (10 minutes; Figure 2). Therefore, the FM1-43 and EM data are not directly comparable.</p><p>The same concern applies to the FM1-43-visulaized SV exocytosis data, which indicate that SV exocytosis is not impaired by overexpression of PLCÎ´1-PH-EGFP or Synj if endocytosis is stimulated for 1 minute. Again, the data are not comparable to the ADBE defect shown in Figure 2. I suggest either to omit the data of Figure 2âfigure supplement 2 or use the same stimulation paradigm for the FM1-43 and EM data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60125.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this paper Li et al. show how the calcium channel and PI(4,5)P2 regulate bulk endocytosis at synapses. Their work brings exciting new mechanistic insight into the regulation of this process, and what I find of particular interest is the notion that Fwe might be gated by PI(4,5)P2 to control the retrieval of synaptic membrane. I think this is an exciting paper and I have mostly minor comments on interpretation and one suggestion for a set of genetic interactions to cement the role for calcineurin in this pathway.</p><p>1) The authors elegantly confirm and demonstrate further that PI(4,5)P2levels increase during stimulation. They conclude this is in microdomains based on several pieces of data. This indeed seems to be the case but I think it is important to note that chemical fixation may alter distribution. I would either note this in the text or try to include single particle tracking experiments (eg sptPALM).</p></disp-quote><p>For our live-imaging experiments (also see Materials and methods), we stimulated the NMJs with 40-Hz electric stimulation or a 90-mM K<sup>+</sup> chemical stimulation under conditions of 2 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. However, these stimuli caused pronounced muscle contraction, which prevented us from precisely focusing the objective lens on a single NMJ bouton over the imaging timespan for confocal microscopy. Attempts to slow down contractions by desensitizing the glutamate receptors with 7 mM glutamate treatment were unsuccessful. Therefore, in our experiments, we manually adjusted the focus plane and captured snapshot images of the same single boutons each second for one minute during stimulation by using a long working distance water immersion objective (XLUMPLFLN20XW water lens) and an EMCCD camera (iXon, Andor) mounted on a SliceScope Pro 6000 (Scientifica) microscope. For each imaging experiment, at least three focused images of the same boutons under resting, stimulation, or post-stimulation conditions were used for data quantification. Fluorescence intensities of PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP within the boutons were assessed using ImageJ and averaged to serve as one individual data point. Due to these technical issues, it is difficult to perform single-particle tracking.</p><p>We have assessed the possibility that chemical fixation may alter membrane properties and thereby account for plasma membrane clustering of PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP upon intense stimulation. We have now examined the distribution of mCD8-GFP and PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PHS39R-EGFP (as also suggested by reviewer #3), a PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-binding mutant Khuong et al., 2010Verstreken et al., 2009(; ). We found that there was no obvious change in the plasma membrane pattern of mCD8-GFP in fixed boutons stimulated with high K<sup>+</sup> (Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A-B). Unlike PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP, PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PHS39R-EGFP was observed mainly in the cytosol at rest. After intense stimulation, immunostaining signals of PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PHS39R-EGFP did not accumulate on the plasma membrane (Figure 1âfigure supplement 2C-D) and did not increase within the boutons (Figure 1âfigure supplement 2E). In addition, we have further assessed potential dominant-negative effects of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding by PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP on the stimulation-induced accumulation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> by examining recruitment of the AP-2 complex by PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. Similar to PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP, levels of the Î± subunit of the AP-2 complex (AP-2Î±) were also increased on the plasma membrane upon high K<sup>+</sup> stimulation (Figure 1âfigure supplement 3A-B). Taken together, these results suggest that PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP clustering on the plasma membrane upon stimulation arises from an increase in local PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> concentration, although a potential effect of chemical fixation, if any, on PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP clustering cannot be excluded. The new data from PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PHS39R-EGFP and AP-2Î± experiments have been added to the figures indicated in our explanation here, and a respective statement has been added to the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 2 they investigate the role for PI(4,5)P2 in ADBE using PLCdPH over expression and Synj over expression.

We have carefully re-examined our TEM images collected during recovery periods. However, we did not observe any accumulation of SVs budding from the bulk endosome in control boutons or boutons in which the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> microdomains were perturbed. This observation further indicates that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> microdomain formation likely plays an early role in promoting SV reformation from the bulk endosome. We now state this observation in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) I think the conclusion that the PLA signal indicates a physical interaction between Fwe and PI(4,5)P2 is overstated: to conclude that Fwe moves in to PI(4,5)P2-enriched domains would be more correct. The demonstration of a direct interaction is given later in the paper in Figure 4.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by this reviewer and also by reviewer #3, we have now rephrased our conclusion to: âThe PLA signal was low in resting boutons, whereas high K<sup>+</sup> treatment significantly increased PLA signal intensity (Figure 3A-B).

This should be shown using genetic interactions: eg test if double mutants show a similar (non-additive) effect compared to either single mutant, or overexpress Fwe in CanA1 mutants (and vice versa) to determine if this rescues the defect.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have now assessed if Fwe overexpression can rescue the ADBE defect caused by <italic>canA1</italic> RNAi knockdown. Neuronal <italic>canA1</italic> was knocked down by expressing two independent <italic>canA1</italic> RNAi lines, which impaired ADBE relative to the <italic>nsyb-GAL4</italic> control (Figure 5A-B)[To address the similar concern raised by reviewer #3, we have conducted an additional <italic>canA1</italic> RNAi knockdown experiment using <italic>UAS-canA1-RNAi</italic> (JF01871)]. We found that Fwe overexpression was able to significantly reverse the ADBE defect under both of these <italic>canA1</italic> RNAi knockdown conditions (Figure 5A-B). Therefore, increasing Fwe-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx can augment activation of the residual CanA1 enzymes and thus normalize downstream ADBE. These new data support that CanA1 mediates this effect in an Fwe-dependent manner. The new data have been added to Figure 5A-B, and a respective statement has been added to the main text.</p><p>We have also attempted to express a constitutive form of CanA1 in the <italic>fwe</italic> mutant background using two different neuronal <italic>GAL4</italic> drivers, <italic>nsyb-GAL4</italic> and <italic>elav-GAL4.</italic> Whereas single expression of a constitutive form of CanA1 did not affect larval viability, this expression caused precocious lethality of <italic>fwe</italic> mutants at very early larval stages. Unfortunately, the tiny size of the resulting larvae prevented us from further NMJ characterization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 6G-H seem superfluous to me and not central to the story. I would remove this from the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this constructive suggestion. We have removed these data from Figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) I also suggest to write PI(4,5)P2 or PhIns(4,5)P2 instead of PIP2 because the latter refers to all phosphoinositides that have 2 phosphate groups, and not specifically to PI(4,5)P2.</p></disp-quote><p>Acknowledged. We have now changed PIP<sub>2</sub> to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This paper describes an intriguing model for a feedback pathway by which the calcium channel Flower, Ca++ signaling, and PIP2 together regulate activity dependent bulk endocytosis and synaptic vesicle regeneration at a neuronal synapse. This is an interesting and novel idea, which could illuminate key molecular dynamics downstream of synaptic activity that regulate synaptic vesicle recycling. The strengths of the paper are the in vitro-in vivo analysis of fwe-PIP2 binding and function, and in the measurement of each of PIP2, Calcium signaling, and membrane traffic for each component.</p><p>1) The authors claim the increase in fluorescence of PHPLC-GFP as evidence of clustering in microdomains. However, this is a circular argument, as the increase in fluorescence is proposed as the evidence that PIP2 microdomains have formed. This claim is an important premise of the paper, as PHPLC fluorescence intensity is the primary quantified metric for a central conclusion of the paper (that PIP2 microdomains form upon stimulation, and require fwe).</p><p>At a technical level, it is difficult to understand why clustering should increase fluorescence, since the total amount of protein is not changed by Western blotting. One possibility is that diffuse fluorescence is below the detection limit of the microscope, while clustered fluorescence is above this limit; however, comparing measurements in this way from inside and outside the linear range of detection is misleading. Another possibility is that GFP fluorescence emission (but not levels) is increased in the microenvironment of the puncta, but this is not evidence for clustering, but instead for a changed microenvironment. The authors could quantify this by post-staining after fixation with anti-GFP antibodies in a second channel (they would expect to see no clustering if the effect was purely on GFP fluorescence).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this concern. We have now performed the suggested experiments. Our confocal images revealed that, for neurons at rest, there was weak fluorescence signal of native PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP on the presynaptic plasma membrane labelled by Î±-Hrp staining, with some additional signal dispersed in the cytosol (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C). First, we elevated PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels on the plasma membrane by removing a copy of <italic>synaptojanin</italic> (<italic>synj</italic>), which encodes the major neuronal PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> phosphatase (Tsujishita et al., 2001; Verstreken et al., 2003). The resulting reduced level of Synj enhanced PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP fluorescence (green channel, Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C-D), consistent with previous studies (Chen et al., 2014; Verstreken et al., 2009). In this context, we did not observe a significant change in protein expression of PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP in the presynaptic compartment (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1E-F). By using Î±-GFP immunostaining (red channel), these PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP signals could be faithfully amplified (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C-D).</p><p>Next, we stimulated the boutons expressing PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP and treated with 90 mM K<sup>+</sup> and 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> for 10 min. Similar to our live-imaging results, both native fluorescence and Î±-GFP immunostaining signals of PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP were significantly increased on the presynaptic plasma membrane (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1G-H) In particular, we observed high-level induction of PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP puncta (Figure 1C-D). As a control experiment, we examined the distribution of mCD8-GFP and PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PHS39R-EGFP, a PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-binding mutant (Khuong et al., 2010; Verstreken et al., 2009) (as suggested by reviewer #3), which revealed no obvious change in the plasma membrane pattern of mCD8-GFP in fixed boutons stimulated with high K<sup>+</sup> (Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A-B). Unlike PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP, PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PHS39R-EGFP was found mainly in the cytosol at rest. After intense stimulation, immunostaining signals of PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PHS39R-EGFP did not accumulate on the plasma membrane (Figure 1âfigure supplement 2C-D) and were not increased (Figure 1âfigure supplement 2E). As suggested by reviewer #3, we have now assessed recruitment of the AP-2 complex upon PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> increase. Similar to PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP, levels of the Î± subunit of the AP-2 complex (AP-2Î±) were also increased on the plasma membrane upon high K<sup>+</sup> stimulation (Figure 1âfigure supplement 3A-B). Thus, the clustering of PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP on the plasma membrane upon stimulation results from an increase in local PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> concentration. As pointed out by this reviewer, we think that the signal of the diffuse PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP probe in <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ boutons is below the detection limit of confocal microscopy, whereas the signal from the clustered probe on the plasma membrane exceeds this limit and thus is much more detectable.</p><p>These new data have been added to the above-mentioned figures, and a respective statement has been added to the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Either way, the whole-bouton quantification presented here is not sufficient, and more rigorous quantification of clustering is required (see point 4).</p></disp-quote><p>Since the signals of PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP are mainly associated with the plasma membrane in boutons (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1), we previously quantified the immunostaining signals of PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP from the entire bouton outlined by Î±-Hrp staining to indicate any change in the plasma membrane association of PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP.

What level of expression were used in Figure 1 compared to 2, and could the &quot;clusters&quot; coincide with malfunctioning endocytosis? Levels should be compared directly (rather than inferred from temperature).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. In Figure 1, we expressed PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP using <italic>nsyb-GAL4</italic> at 25 Â°C. We also quantified the level of PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP expressed at 25 Â°C vs 29 Â°C. As shown in Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A-B, compared to its expression at 25 Â°C, elevating the temperature to 29 Â°C led to a two-fold increase in probe expression. This information has now been added to the revised manuscript. We also now state the experimental temperatures in all figure legends.</p><p>It is conceivable that PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP can suppress the binding of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> effectors and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> catalytic enzymes to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> when this reporter is highly expressed. For all figures, we measured the level of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> under conditions of mild PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP expression (reared at 25 Â°C). This expression level only mildly affects normal ADBE (Figure 2C-D). Therefore, such a mild ADBE defect should not account for PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> clustering upon intense stimulation. In support of this notion, similar to PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP, the AP-2 complex was recruited to the plasma membrane upon high K<sup>+</sup> stimulation (Figure 1âfigure supplement 3A-C). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP expression may suppress the binding of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> catalytic enzymes to slow rapid PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> turnover, thereby enabling us to capture PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> clustering. Nevertheless, our data suggest that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> microdomains are formed upon intense stimulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Due to these questions, some form of independent evidence (published or novel) for PIP2 clustering must be shown or cited.</p></disp-quote><p>As also suggested by reviewer #3, we have now investigated recruitment of the AP-2 complex upon PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> increase. Similar to PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP, levels of the Î± subunit of the AP-2 complex (AP-2Î±) were also increased and clustered on the plasma membrane upon high K<sup>+</sup> stimulation (Figure 1âfigure supplement 3A-B). This finding represents further evidence of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> clustering on the plasma membrane upon stimulation.</p><p>Moreover, we now cite additional studies showing PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> clustering in different cellular contexts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The consistency of phenotypes among experimental manipulations on Calcium, PIP2, and vesicle dynamics is compelling evidence for a feedback loop. However, not all functional links in the loop are completely tested; for instance, whether CanA1 loss of function leads to calcium signaling defects via synj/PIP2, or through its myriad other targets. While it might be possible to ânormalizeâ synj phosphorylation using minibrain heterozygotes or mutants, this is beyond the scope of suggested revisions. However, where a link in the chain has not been as rigorously tested (as for CanA1), the authors should discuss other possible interpretations of these data (as they do for other possible means of gating Flower).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added further discussion on this topic in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 2âfigure supplement 2- why does FM get taken up to similar extent with high PLC or synj if EM data suggests ABDE is not happening? And why is unloading not impaired if vesicle recycling is diminished?</p></disp-quote><p>For our loading/unloading FM4-64 dye uptake assay, we stimulated the NMJ boutons with high K<sup>+</sup> to take up the dye for a long period of time, e.g. 5 minutes, so that a majority of both the exo-endo cycling pool (ECP) and reserved pool (RP) were loaded with FM dye. Then we stimulated them with high K<sup>+</sup> for 1 minute to release the loaded dye. By calculating the ratio of unloaded dye to loaded dye, we could rule out the effect of SV endocytosis and measure the efficacy of SV exocytosis. Our results revealed no effect on the rate of SV exocytosis when the PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH domain or Synj was expressed. Since we did not image the fluorescence intensities of FM dye under the same imaging detection conditions, the signal intensities of loaded dye by endocytosis cannot be compared directly.</p><p>To address the reviewerâs question, we have conducted a FM1-43 dye uptake assay. We stimulated the boutons with a 30-second pulse under conditions of 90 mM K<sup>+</sup> and 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> to trigger SV exocytosis and prompt the recycling SVs to take up FM dye (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2A). We imaged the boutons under different genotypes with same imaging setup. Whereas control boutons exhibited appropriate dye uptake, overexpression of either PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP or Synj impaired dye uptake (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2B-C). These findings are consistent with ADBE being defective. This new data has been added to Figure 2âfigure supplement 2A-C and a respective statement has been added to the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) There are several instances where images are not quantified, or where the method of quantification is insufficiently described:</p><p>a) Currently Materials and methods indicate only that âimage processing and quantification were achieved using LSM Zen and ImageJâ.

Perturbation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-Fwe binding further impaired the formation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> microdomains, as well as ADBE initiation. Hence, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> controls Fwe gating, so that Fwe can promote PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> compartmentalization through positive feedback regulation. Furthermore, loss of Fwe impaired the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase evoked upon strong activity stimulation (Figure 3I-J) (Yao et al., 2017). These results indicate that, in addition to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, the channel function of Fwe may be gated by a significant change in membrane potential. Therefore, it is possible that both factors may gate Fwe, thereby only allowing channel opening when exocytosis targets Fwe to periactive zones. Future studies should explore the details of this channel gating mechanism. These points have now been added to our revised Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The claim that Fwe is âselectively sortedâ by PIP2 seems overstated, especially given the companion idea that Fwe sorts PIP2 into microdomains.

Importantly, Fwe has likely a distinct role for each endocytotic route since only ADBE requires Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel function. This follow-up study pursues the mechanisms underlying Fwe's role for ABDE. The study provides evidence for an interesting model of Fwe's role in ADBE that may significantly advance our understanding of mechanisms underlying ADBE. Specifically, it suggests that freshly exocytosed Fwe on the PM forms a positive Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent feedback loop that facilitates the generation and accumulation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) in microdomains on the PM. In turn, accumulating PIP2 may facilitate compartmentalization of Fwe to bulk endosomes, thereby terminating ADBE. I have a number of concerns.</p><p>1) To visualize PIP2 at fly NMJs, the entire study relies only on a single PIP2 marker, the Gal4-driven expression of PLCÎ´1-PH-EGFP. Unfortunately, this marker not only reduces &quot;free&quot; PIP2 levels but also has dominant-negative effects on synaptic growth and SV cycling (Khuong et al., 2010). To properly support the notion that intense stimulation causes accumulation of PIP2 in microdomains on the PM, a number of corrections are required:</p><p>a) the PLCÎ´1-PH-EGFP imaging experiments require a proper control, like the expression of PLCÎ´1-PHS39R-GFP, which does not bind PIP2. Measuring mCD-EGFP expression levels is not a proper control.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have now examined the expression and distribution of PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PHS39R-EGFP at rest and after high K<sup>+</sup> stimulation. We found that, unlike PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP, PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PHS39R-EGFP mainly localized in the cytosol of cells at rest. After intense stimulation, immunostaining signals of PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PHS39R-EGFP did not accumulate on the plasma membrane (Figure 1âfigure supplement 2C-D) and were not increased within the boutons (Figure 1âfigure supplement 2E). Thus, the clustering of PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP on the plasma membrane upon stimulation results from an increase in local PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> concentration. These new data have been added to Figure 1âfigure supplement 2C-E, and a respective statement has been added to the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) the stimulation-induced accumulation of PIP2 should be verified by a second independent marker like quantitative immunostainings for edogenous Î±-adaptin or other PIP2-binding proteins. This is especially important to rule out unaccounted dominant-negative effects.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have now assessed recruitment of endogenous Î±-adaptin upon high K<sup>+</sup> stimulation. We found that, similar to PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP, levels of the Î± subunit of the AP-2 complex (AP-2Î±) were also increased on the plasma membrane upon high K<sup>+</sup> stimulation (Figure 1âfigure supplement 3A-B). The new data have been added to Figure 1âfigure supplement 3A-B and a respective statement has been added to the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) It is unclear how changes in PLCÎ´1-PH-EGFP fluorescence (Figure 1A-B, D, plus all subsequent experiments using PLCÎ´1-PH-EGFP including Figure 3C-F, 4F-G) are measured at larval NMJs since no information about respective ROIs is provided. To make a strong statement about a PIP2 accumulation on the PM, PLCÎ´1-PH-EGFP fluorescence measured for an entire bouton (from one or a few slices) should be subtracted by the PLCÎ´1-PH-EGFP fluorescence obtained from the cytosol of the bouton. Measurements using ROIs for the entire bouton do not allow specific conclusions about PM levels.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising our oversight.

Ideally, one may use expression of the PLCÎ´1-PHS39R-GFP mutant. Overexpression of synaptojanin alone does not make the point that the reduced ADBE levels are due to PIP2 depletion since synaptojanin also affects several other phosphatidylinositides.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion. We conducted the recommended experiments and found that when larvae expressing PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PHS39R-EGFP were grown at 29 ÂºC, the mutant protein failed to suppress ADBE (Figure 2C-D).

Otherwise, the observed proximity could be due to other factors.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have now performed a PLA assay to assess the association of Fwe with PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PHS39R-EGFP. As shown in Figure 1âfigure supplement 1 and 2, whereas PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP mainly localized on the plasma membrane, PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PHS39R-EGFP localized in the cytosol, both at rest and even upon high K<sup>+</sup> stimulation. We further found that PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PHS39R-EGFP indeed locates to the SVs marked by the SV proteins, Csp and Fwe (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Consequently, when we did the PLA assay on the Flag-Fwe-HA rescue boutons expressing PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PHS39R-EGFP, the close proximity between Fwe and SV-localized PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PHS39R-EGFP due to 30-50 nm-sized SV already generated very strong PLA signals when the boutons were at rest and even after high K<sup>+</sup> stimulation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). Therefore, since PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PH-EGFP and PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PHS39R-EGFP have totally different subcellular localizations, we are not comfortable using PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PHS39R-EGFP as a control protein in our PLA assay.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PHS39R-EGFP locates to SVs marked by Csp or Fwe.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-60125-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="sa2fig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>A close association between PLC<sub>Î´1</sub>-PHS39R-EGFP and Flag-Fwe-HA on the SVs generates PLA signals at rest or after high K<sup>+</sup> stimulation.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-60125-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The images of Figure 3C, E show little evidence of PLCÎ´1-PH-EGFP microdomains at the PM, much in contrast to Figure 1.

It is therefore difficult to predict the functional small RNA fragments generated by this construct and thus to design an RNAi-resistant <italic>canA1</italic> transgene. As an alternative, we expressed another <italic>UAS-canA1 RNAi</italic> (JF01871) (Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center, BDSC#25850), which was generated by using different regions of the CanA1 coding region, the funcionality of which had been tested previously (Wong et al., 2014). We found that expression of <italic>UAS-canA1 RNAi</italic> (JF01871) using <italic>nsyb-GAL4</italic> suppressed PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> microdomain formation (Figure 3H) and ADBE initiation (Figure 5A-B).

These new data have been added in the figures indicated above, and respective statements have been added to the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The study suggests that PIP2 binding to freshly exocytosed Fwe gates Fwe's Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activity. In turn, the resulting Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx activates calcineurin and the postulated feedback loop accumulating PIP2 at the PM. If correct, one would expect that a mutation that several affects Fwe' Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activity (like FweE79Q) should significantly reduce the accumulation of PIP2. Is this indeed the case? If not, the Fwe-dependent PIP2 accumulation may occur through a different mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have now conducted experiments to determine if the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activity of Fwe is involved in this process. We undertook rescue experiments based on our previous report in which <italic>fwe</italic> mutant boutons exhibited expression of the wild-type Fwe transgene or the FweE79Q mutant transgene that exhibits reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> conductance (Yao et al., 2017). We found that the wild-type Fwe transgene promoted PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> microdomain formation, whereas the FweE79Q mutant transgene lost that ability (Figure 3E-F). Thus, Fwe triggers the formation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> microdomains in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner. The new data have been added to Figure 3E-F, the detailed genotypes have been added to the respective figure legend, and an explanatory statement has been added to the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The HA-Fwe-APEX2 experiments of Figure 6 require further controls including documentation that the fusion protein is properly localized to SVs and not excessively retained on the PM during ADBE. The EM alone is not convincing.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have now performed confocal imaging analysis to verify the SV localization of HA-Fwe-APEX2. As shown in Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A, HA-Fwe-APEX2 (stained with Î±-Fwe) was highly colocalized with the specific SV markers, Syt and Csp. Furthermore, expression of this fusion protein was able to rescue the endocytic defects (Figures 4 and 5) and early animal lethality caused by loss of <italic>fwe</italic>. Therefore, HA-Fwe-APEX2 is functionally equivalent to endogenous Fwe. In our TEM images (Figure 6âfigure supplement 1C-D), DAB signals generated by HA-Fwe-APEX2 were found on SVs (yellow arrows) and on the plasma membrane (white arrows) under both resting and stimulation conditions. These new data have been added to Figure 6âfigure supplement 1, and a respective statement has been added to the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The co-immunoprecipitation of Fwe with AP2 shown in Figure 6G requires quantification.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by reviewer #1, since the data on Fwe and AP-2 complex association (previous Figure 6G-H and text) was deemed superfluous, we have now removed this data from the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The evidence for the conclusion that accumulating PIP2 facilitates &quot;sorting&quot; of Fwe for ADBE is weak because it essentially rests on the HA-Fwe-APEX2 experiment. Since reducing PIP2 levels by synaptojanin expression reduced the bulk endosome localization of Fwe as judged by DAB staining levels (Figure 6D-F), the authors conclude that &quot;PIP2 microdomains can facilitate the retrieval of Fwe to the bulk endosome&quot;. However, this appears to be somewhat a catch22 since reduced PIP2 levels decrease the overall amount of bulk endocytosis. Whether the potentially reduced levels of internalized Fwe are disproportionally reduced has not been addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point. In our data (Figure 6C-E), we controlled animal growth temperature at 25 Â°C to express a mild level of Synj. Under this condition, the suppressive effect on the formation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> microdomains (Figure 2B) is much stronger than that on ADBE initiation (Figure 2C-D), and increasing Synj expression further abolished ADBE (Figure 2C-D). Therefore, our data argue that reduced Fwe localization in the bulk endosome is unlikely to be due to a reduction in the overall amount of bulk endocytosis. Instead, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> plays a role in retrieval of Fwe to the bulk endosomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, DAB staining intensity should not be used to quantify protein levels as the enzymatic reaction may have different constrains on SVs versus endosomes.</p></disp-quote><p>Upon H2O2 activation, APEX2 catalyzes DAB polymerization, and DAB polymers proximally label the phospholipids where the APEX2-fused proteins are closely localized. Synaptic vesicles and bulk endosomes are generated freshly from the plasma membrane upon exocytosis. Therefore, both vesicular compartments are expected to hold very similar compositions of phospholipids, glycolipids, and cholesterols, even though they also contain distinct types of phosphoinositides as minor components. We certainly agree that the enzymatic reaction may have different constraints on SVs versus endosomes. It has not been demonstrated that the lipid and protein composition of the membrane affects DAB labeling. Therefore, we assume that the DAB staining intensity is positively related to the membrane density of the APEX2-fused Fwe protein on both bulk endosomes and SVs. Even so, to ease the reviewerâs concern, we have now re-quantified the DAB signal intensity ratio of bulk endosome to SV to indicate the protein levels of HA-Fwe-APEX2 on bulk endosomes, relative to those on the SVs. With this normalization, we can verify the role of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> microdomains in Fwe localization on bulk endosomes.

And as noted by the authors, while the PH domain is the best available tool to answer the questions posed, it remains possible that properties of the microdomains partially reflect the function-perturbing aspects of the probe. However, these caveats do not significantly detract from the core conclusions of the paper.</p><p>Figure 3H. Something is wrong with the shown KD data by UAS-canA1-RNAi(FB5) or the drawn conclusion that &quot;reducing CanA1 levels via expression of either RNAi construct greatly suppressed the formation of PI(4,5)P2 microdomains compared to the control (Figure 3G-H)&quot;. The resting levels for the canA1 KD are only 50% of control. The K<sup>+</sup>-induced increase PLCÎ´1-PH-EGFP in the KD is as large as in control. Accordingly, the KD seems to have no effect, which would suggest that one of the two KDs is not specific for canA1.</p><p>If the FB5 KD is not working, the one needs a wild type CanA1 co-expression for the KD with the canA1-RNAi(JF01871) transgene to demonstrate specificity.</p><p>Please clarify.</p><p>Figure 3I. The canA1 KD uses the controversial UAS-canA1-RNAi(FB5) transgene, which does not appear to block the formation of PI(4,5)P2 microdomains (Figure 3H). The experiment should be done with the UAS-canA1-RNAi(JF01871) transgene as only this transgene reliable affects PI(4,5)P2 microdomains (assuming the KD can be rescued). Otherwise, one cannot conclude that &quot;Calcineurin mediates the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx conducted by Fwe to induce PI(4,5)P2 microdomains&quot;. Resolving this issue is critical.</p></disp-quote><p>For suggested rescue experiment, we have carefully gone through public resource indicated in Flybase. Unfortunately, a wild-type <italic>canA1</italic> transgene is not available. If we would begin the experiment by establishing a wild-type canA1 transgene, it will take at least 3-4 months to be able to get the result. Alternatively, we have used a <italic>UAS</italic> transgene of a constitutively active form of CanA1 (UAS-CanA1.Î´.HA(4B)), which was published by Dijkers and OâFarrell, 2007, and is available in Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center (#83343). However, we observed that expression of UAS-CanA1.Î´.HA(4B) alone already inhibited the formation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> microdomains in high K<sup>+</sup> stimulation and expression of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> at rest (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>). Therefore, sustained high CanA1 activity can also perturb the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> increase after strong stimulation and even lower the resting PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> concentrations. One would expect that expression of a wild-type canA1 transgene likely causes similar effects. Therefore, we are not comfortable to assess the rescue effect by constitutively increasing CanA1 enzymatic activity if dynamic CanA1 activity is needed to promote PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> microdomain formation.</p><fig id="sa2fig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-60125-resp-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><p>To address the reviewerâs concern, we have tested another independent line of UAS-canA1-RNAi (FB)(Dijkers and OâFarrell, 2007), UAS-canA1-RNAi (FB4). FB4 and FB5 lines carries identical UAS-canA1-RNAi transgene, but their canA1-RNAi transgenes are inserted on different chromosomes, e.g. second chromosome for FB4 and third chromosome for FB5. Unlike UAS-canA1-RNAi (FB5), we found that expression of UAS-canA1-RNAi (FB4) significantly impaired the formation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> microdomains but did not affect the resting level of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (Figure 3H), which is close to the effects of UAS-canA1-RNAi (JF). Thus, the FB5 line may have an unclean genetic background which influences the resting levels of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. In addition, we have examined the effect of expression of both UAS-CanA1-RNAi (JF01871) and UAS-CanA1-RNAi (FB4) on intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase upon high K<sup>+</sup> stimulation. As shown in Figure 3I-J, expression of UAS-CanA1-RNAi (JF01871) or UAS-CanA1-RNAi (FB4) was able to suppress intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase upon high K<sup>+</sup> stimulation. We hope that the new data of two independent RNAi lines we added can support the role of CanA1 in the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> microdomain formation. We have done the best we can do during limited revision time. The new data have been added to Figure 3H-J, and a respective statement has been added to the revised manuscript. Accordingly, we have removed the results of UAS-canA1-RNAi (FB5) from Figures 3 and 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;Together, these data suggest that the PI(4,5)P2 microdomains initiate ADBE to control SV membrane retrieval upon intense stimulation.&quot; This sentence should be rephrased. The shown FM1-43 data (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2B) only suggest that overexpression of PLCÎ´1-PH-EGFP or Synj impairs SV endocytosis independent of the mode of endocytosis. The shown FM1-43 data do not exclude a role of PI(4,5)P2 for other modes of endocytosis.</p><p>Moreover, the FM1-43 data use a much shorter (30 seconds) and milder stimulation than the solid EM data visualizing ADBE (10 minutes; Figure 2). Therefore, the FM1-43 and EM data are not directly comparable.</p><p>The same concern applies to the FM1-43-visulaized SV exocytosis data, which indicate that SV exocytosis is not impaired by overexpression of PLCÎ´1-PH-EGFP or Synj if endocytosis is stimulated for 1 minute. Again, the data are not comparable to the ADBE defect shown in Figure 2. I suggest either to omit the data of Figure 2âfigure supplement 2 or use the same stimulation paradigm for the FM1-43 and EM data.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have removed Figure 2âfigure supplement 2 and the statement.</p></body></sub-article></article>
