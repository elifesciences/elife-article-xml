OKR occurs when ON direction-selective retinal ganglion cells (oDSGCs) detect slow, global image motion on the retina. How oDSGC activity is integrated centrally to generate behavior remains unknown. Here, we discover mechanisms that contribute to motion encoding in vertically tuned oDSGCs and leverage these findings to empirically define signal transformation between retinal output and vertical OKR behavior. We demonstrate that motion encoding in vertically tuned oDSGCs is contrast-sensitive and asymmetric for oDSGC types that prefer opposite directions. These phenomena arise from the interplay between spike threshold nonlinearities and differences in synaptic input weights, including shifts in the balance of excitation and inhibition. In behaving mice, these neurophysiological observations, along with a central subtraction of oDSGC outputs, accurately predict the trajectories of vertical OKR across stimulus conditions. Thus, asymmetric tuning across competing sensory channels can critically shape behavior.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>visual system</kwd><kwd>retinal ganglion cells</kwd><kwd>direction selectivity</kwd><kwd>accessory optic system</kwd><kwd>behavioral reflex</kwd><kwd>sensorimotor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31 EY-033225</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harris</surname><given-names>Scott C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 EY-029772</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dunn</surname><given-names>Felice A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 EY-030136</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dunn</surname><given-names>Felice A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Moritz-Heyman Discovery Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harris</surname><given-names>Scott C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Kavli Institute for Neuroscience</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harris</surname><given-names>Scott C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000872</institution-id><institution>McKnight Endowment Fund for Neuroscience</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Scholar Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dunn</surname><given-names>Felice A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001818</institution-id><institution>Research to Prevent Blindness</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Unrestricted Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dunn</surname><given-names>Felice A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Retinal physiology and anatomy and visual behavior reveal how sensory circuits in the retina can shape an organismâs eye movements over a range of ethologically relevant stimulus conditions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>From humans to insects, a wide range of organisms depend on vision to navigate their environments. When these animals respond to incoming visual information by enacting motor plans, however, relative motion is created between the eye and the visual scene. Such motion, termed âretinal slip,â has the potential to corrupt subsequent vision and threaten survival. To compensate for this possibility, the optokinetic reflex (OKR) is a highly conserved visual behavior that stabilizes retinal image motion across species (including invertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zeil et al., 1989</xref>], reptiles, amphibians, fish, birds, and all mammals, reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Masseck and Hoffmann, 2009</xref>). OKR consists of visually-evoked, compensatory eye movements (or head movements in some species) that offset the slow, global image motion generated by self-movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Simpson, 1984</xref>). In most species, OKR also changes across stimulus conditions: adjustments to stimulus contrast, color, location, velocity, or spatial frequency, for example, can elicit distinct OKR patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Collewijn, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Donaghy, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gravot et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Knorr et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Leguire et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cahill and Nathans, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dehmelt et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shimizu et al., 2010</xref>). Nonetheless, neurophysiological mechanisms for such phenomena remain unknown.</p><p>The anatomical pathways that underlie OKR in mammals are well defined (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Masseck and Hoffmann, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Simpson, 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dhande et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Giolli et al., 2006</xref>). Starting in the retina, a dedicated class of biological motion detectors known as ON direction-selective retinal ganglion cells (oDSGCs) encode the slow global image motion that occurs during retinal slip. Classic work identified three types of oDSGCs that each spike maximally in response to a different cardinal direction of stimulus motion (i.e., upward/superior, downward/inferior, and nasal/anterior) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Oyster, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Oyster and Barlow, 1967</xref>). A recent study also identified a fourth oDSGC type in mice that encodes temporal/posterior motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sabbah et al., 2017</xref>). Projections from oDSGCs avoid typical retinorecipient structures such as the superior colliculus and lateral geniculate nucleus. Instead, axons from vertically and horizontally preferring oDSGCs course along dedicated retinofugal tracts to a set of midbrain nuclei known collectively as the accessory optic system. Vertically tuned oDSGCs terminate exclusively in, and comprise the sole retinal inputs to, the medial and lateral terminal nuclei (MTN and LTN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dhande et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dhande et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lilley et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sun et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yonehara et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yonehara et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">van der Togt et al., 1993</xref>) (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kay et al., 2011</xref> and âDiscussionâ) - though in mice, LTN is engulfed within MTN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dhande et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yonehara et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Osterhout et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pak et al., 1987</xref>). Here, their inputs are likely integrated into a single velocity signal that reflects the vertical component of retinal slip. This information is then relayed deeper into the brainstem where corresponding eye movements are enacted. Likewise, horizontally tuned oDSGCs exclusively target the nucleus of the optic tract/dorsal terminal nucleus (NOT/DTN) where their signals are similarly integrated to ultimately generate the horizontal component of OKR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dhande et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Osterhout et al., 2015</xref>). While correlations have been recognized between the physiological properties of oDSGCs and OKR â particularly a matched speed tuning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Oyster et al., 1972</xref>) â little is known about how signals from multiple oDSGC types are integrated to generate OKR across varying stimulus conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dhande et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wei, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Here, we reveal a general mechanism by which OKR may be generated across a range of stimulus statistics. First, we focus on a single parameter that is known to affect OKR: motion direction. In many species, including both humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Takahashi et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hainline et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Murasugi and Howard, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">van den Berg and Collewijn, 1988</xref>) (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Knapp et al., 2013</xref>) and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yonehara et al., 2009</xref>), OKR is more robust in response to superior motion than inferior motion. We aim to illuminate the mechanism underlying this asymmetry in order to reveal more general processes by which oDSGC signals are centrally integrated to produce OKR. Focusing on the directional asymmetry of vertical OKR is methodologically strategic in that (1) it limits the source of possible neurophysiological mechanisms to functions of only the vertical OKR pathway, and (2) unlike horizontal OKR, which relies on interhemispheric communication and mirror-image motion signals from each eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Masseck and Hoffmann, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dhande et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hoffmann and Fischer, 2001</xref>), vertical OKR can be studied unilaterally. Our results indicate that the behavioral asymmetry between superior and inferior OKR is linked to differences in the direction tuning properties of oDSGCs that prefer superior and inferior motion. These physiological differences arise from a shift in the balance of excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) synaptic inputs across cell types, along with nonlinear transformations associated with spike thresholding. More generally, we demonstrate that motion encoding in vertically tuned oDSGCs is uniquely sensitive to such changes in synaptic input weights and show how this sensitivity, along with a central subtraction of oDSGC activity, can account for changes to OKR across additional stimulus conditions in behaving mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>OKR is more robust in the superior than inferior direction</title><p>Across species, superior motion generates a more robust OKR than inferior motion (e.g., cat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hoffmann and Fischer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Evinger and Fuchs, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grasse and Cynader, 1988</xref>], chicken [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wallman and Velez, 1985</xref>], monkey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Takahashi and Igarashi, 1977</xref>], human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Takahashi et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hainline et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Murasugi and Howard, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">van den Berg and Collewijn, 1988</xref>]). In mice, this phenomenon has been reported in juvenile animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yonehara et al., 2009</xref>). To investigate whether an asymmetry between superior and inferior OKR exists in adult mice, we designed a behavioral rig to accurately evoke and quantify vertical OKR in head-fixed animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>, âMaterials and methodsâ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Denman et al., 2017</xref>). Eye movements were measured in response to vertically drifting, full-field gratings used previously to evoke OKR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sun et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yonehara et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Osterhout et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Yonehara et al., 2016</xref>). Across all adult mice, superior- and inferior-drifting gratings generated distinct, but reproducible eye movements: while superior gratings elicited repetitive slow, upward-drifting eye movements (âslow nystagmusâ) interleaved with frequent resetting saccades in the opposite direction (âfast nystagmusâ) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), inferior gratings tended to reliably drive only an initial slow nystagmus immediately following stimulus onset, after which fast nystagmuses were infrequent and eye position changed minimally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To quantify these differences, we isolated periods of slow and fast nystagmus post hoc by extracting saccadic eye movements from the raw eye position trace. Superior stimuli elicited more frequent fast nystagmuses than did inferior stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In addition, the total distance traveled during slow nystagmus was greater for superior stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

Moreover, gain tended to be higher during the superior stage compared to the inferior stage of individual oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). This bias was reflected by an average offset of vertical eye position in the superior direction over the course of a single stimulus oscillation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that superior motion drives a more robust OKR than inferior motion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Superior and Inferior oDSGCs have distinct direction tuning properties</title><p>While behavioral asymmetries between superior and inferior OKR could arise anywhere along the vertical OKR pathway, a plausible neurophysiological substrate is at the level of the retina where the pathways that encode superior and inferior motion remain distinct. Further, because the ganglion cells that encode superior motion (âSuperior oDSGCsâ) and inferior motion (âInferior oDSGCsâ) together serve as an information bottleneck for the remainder of the pathway, any physiological asymmetry between these cell types will propagate to behavior unless specifically corrected for by subsequent circuitry (see âDiscussionâ). Thus, we hypothesized that the behavioral asymmetry between superior and inferior OKR may result from physiological differences between Superior and Inferior oDSGCs.</p><p>To probe oDSGCs involved in vertical OKR, we made central injections of a fluorescent retrograde tracer into their central target, MTN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). This approach labeled an average of 669 Â± 15 retinal ganglion cells (RGCs; N = 20 retinae) across the contralateral retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Retrogradely labeled RGCs were then targeted in ex vivo retinae for electrophysiological investigation using epifluorescence, and we independently validated these data by using two-photon targeting in a separate set of experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">5</xref>; epifluorescence targeting was used for all experiments unless otherwise specified in the figure legends). To investigate the direction tuning properties of MTN-projecting RGCs, we made cell-attached recordings from labeled RGCs while presenting a drifting bar stimulus that moved slowly (10Â°/s) across the retina in eight directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The parameters of this stimulus matched those of the gratings used to evoke vertical OKR in behaving animals (i.e., equivalent cycle width, wavelength, and speed to the unidirectional gratings). The majority (94.76%) of retrogradely labeled RGCs were direction-selective and preferred either dorsal-to-ventral (n = 116 of 286) (i.e., Superior oDSGCs because these cells detect superior motion in visual space after accounting for inversion of the image by the eyeâs optics; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) or ventral-to-dorsal (i.e., Inferior oDSGCs, n = 155 of 286) motion on the retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In agreement, mosaic analyses of soma locations indicated that retrogradely labeled cells likely consisted of two RGC types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Both Superior and Inferior oDSGCs invariably had baseline firing rates of approximately 0 Hz (spikes/s: Sup. 0.0134 Â± 0.006; Inf. 0.0338 Â± 0.016; p=0.13 Sup. vs. Inf.). Nonetheless, Superior oDSGCs tended to produce more total spikes than Inferior oDSGCs in response to the drifting bar stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>), and the total areas of their tuning curves were greater (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3A</xref>). Similarly, we noticed topographic differences within cell types, with MTN-projecting RGCs in dorsal retina spiking more than those in ventral retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2âfigure supplement 5</xref>). However, the firing rates of Superior and Inferior oDSGCs covaried, with Superior oDSGCs spiking more than Inferior oDSGCs in every retinal quadrant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Superior and Inferior ON direction-selective retinal ganglion cells (oDSGCs) have asymmetric spike tuning curves.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic illustrating unilateral bead injections into medial terminal nucleus (MTN) to retrogradely label ganglion cells in the contralateral retina.

For excitation vs. spikes, the fit line for Superior oDSGCs tends to fall below the fit line for Inferior oDSGCs, indicating lower intrinsic excitability. However, greater excitatory inputs to Superior oDSGCs outweigh the difference in intrinsic excitability, leading to more total spikes in Superior oDSGCs. Further, inhibition does not intuitively explain spike outputs since there is a positive correlation between inhibitory input and number of spikes across directions. This correlation is likely caused by an additional positive correlation between excitation and inhibition. Therefore, spikes are best explained by excitation.

As with the drifting bar, the light increment elicited more total spikes in Superior than in Inferior oDSGCs.

Under voltage-clamp conditions, the increment evoked greater EPSCs in Superior than Inferior oDSGCs. However, there was no difference in IPSC magnitude between cell types. Further, we found a strong correlation between the maximum firing rate of a cell to the increment and the magnitude of its peak EPSC, but not peak IPSC. These results demonstrate that Superior oDSGCs spike more than Inferior oDSGCs across multiple stimuli, and, further, that this difference in spiking is consistently associated with the amount of excitatory, but not inhibitory, input.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Postsynaptic differences may account for shifts in E/I</title><p>Differences in the postsynaptic currents of Superior and Inferior oDSGCs could result from asymmetries in presynaptic wiring and/or the postsynaptic properties of each oDSGC type.

In the following experiments, we investigate the relationship between spike tuning curve shape and the overall amount of excitation to an oDSGC. We ask whether and how different magnitudes of excitatory input to Superior and Inferior oDSGCs can explain their difference in tuning curve width.</p><p>To test how the magnitude of excitation, even when directionally untuned, to an oDSGC changes the shape of its tuning curve, we measured the spikes of Superior and Inferior oDSGCs in the current-clamp configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5AâB and F</xref>) while injecting constant amounts of either positive (to add ~6 mV, âdepolarizingâ) or negative (to subtract ~6 mV, âhyperpolarizingâ) current across stimulus directions. Importantly, the depolarizing current injections were small enough such that every cell retained a baseline firing rate of 0 Hz. This approach allowed us to investigate how providing a cell with more or less directionally untuned excitation influences the shape of its spike tuning curve, as quantified by the direction selectivity index (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>, a metric that decreases with greater tuning curve width) and the area of the normalized tuning curve (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>, referred to as ânormalized area,â a metric that increases with tuning curve width). We found that tuning curves measured under depolarizing conditions were not only larger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5CâD and G</xref>), but also wider, with lower direction selectivity indices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>) and larger normalized areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1F</xref>) than those measured under hyperpolarizing conditions.

In the first mechanism, excitation influences the nonlinear transformation between synaptic input and spike output that is introduced by a neuronâs spike threshold. More specifically, thresholding may sharpen a neuronâs spike tuning curve relative to the tuning of underlying membrane fluctuations by clamping spike output at zero in response to subthreshold membrane responses that are likely to occur for null direction stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Oesch et al., 2005</xref>). When the amount of untuned excitatory input increases, however, membrane fluctuations more readily surpass the spike threshold for all stimulus directions, thereby broadening the spike tuning curve. In the second mechanism, untuned excitation directly circularizes the tuning curve of underlying membrane potentials by increasing null direction responses proportionally more than preferred direction responses. This âadditiveâ contribution would then be inherited by the spike tuning curve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Poleg-Polsky and Diamond, 2016a</xref>).</p><p>We first tested whether thresholding contributes to the width of oDSGC tuning curves. To do so, we isolated the underlying subthreshold voltages (Vm) from our current-clamp recordings that also contained spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). Three independent observations about these Vm tuning curves each suggests that thresholding critically influences spike tuning curve shape. First, unlike for spikes, depolarizing and hyperpolarizing current injections did not affect the direction selectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K and N</xref>) or normalized area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1G and I</xref>) of Vm tuning curves. The total areas of Vm tuning curves were, however, slightly larger under the hyperpolarizing condition, likely due to the marginally greater driving force on excitatory conductances in this setting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). Second, the Vm tuning curves of Superior oDSGCs were larger in magnitude than those of Inferior oDSGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref> arrowheads), but also more sharply tuned, with greater direction selectivity indices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref> arrowheads) and smaller normalized areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1G</xref> arrowheads). This latter result was anticipated from our voltage-clamp recordings that indicated that inhibition is more direction-selective in Superior oDSGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). It also suggests, however, that the shape of the spike tuning curve is not directly inherited from that of the underlying membrane potential and instead reflects the interplay between Vm magnitude and spike threshold. Third, spike tuning curves were more direction-selective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L and M</xref>) and had smaller normalized areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1J and K</xref>) than those of simultaneously measured Vms for both depolarizing and hyperpolarizing injections. The difference between the shape of the spike and Vm tuning curves was smaller for the depolarizing condition, however, because in this setting the majority of stimulus directions elicited Vm responses that surpassed the spike threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5O</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1L</xref>). Together, these three results corroborate the notion that thresholding prominently influences the width of the spike tuning curve relative to the amount of untuned excitation that an oDSGC receives.</p><p>To test the extent to which excitation broadens oDSGC tuning curves through additive effects, we recomputed Vm tuning curves after including a constant, additive offset that reflected the average current injection supplied during depolarizing and hyperpolarizing injections. These offset-corrected Vm tuning curves were significantly wider under depolarizing conditions than they were under hyperpolarizing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1E and H</xref>). However, the observation that (uncorrected) Vm tuning curves â in which putative additive differences <italic>between</italic> cell types are expected to persist â were more sharply tuned for Superior than Inferior oDSGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1G</xref> arrowheads) indicates that thresholding has a greater influence on spike tuning curves than does additive excitation. In agreement, current injections caused significantly larger changes in spike tuning curves than in offset-corrected Vm tuning curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5N</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1I</xref>). These results demonstrate that while untuned excitation likely has some additive effect, complementary thresholding has greater influence over oDSGC spike tuning curves.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>A parallel conductance model recapitulates the influence of thresholding on oDSGC direction tuning</title><p>Together, our current injection experiments suggest that (1) spike thresholding plays a prominent role in setting the width of oDSGC tuning curves, and (2) additive effects contribute minorly.

We tested this hypothesis by comparing the tuning curves of Superior and Inferior oDSGCs in response to high-contrast (stimuli used in previous figures unless specified otherwise) and fivefold lower contrast (i.e., 20% relative contrast) drifting bars. For most cells, the low-contrast bars elicited fewer spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2A</xref>).

Contrast invariance in ooDSGCs appears to rely on the stability of E/I across contrasts. For this reason, we tested whether the contrast sensitivity of oDSGCs was associated with a mutable E/I by sequentially measuring excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents for preferred and null direction stimuli across contrasts. Our data show that E/I in neither the preferred nor null direction changed systematically with contrast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1D and E</xref>). Further, the fraction of cells with spike tuning curves that sharpened under low-contrast conditions was significantly greater than the fraction of E/I ratios that were lower under low-contrast conditions (DSI: PD p=0.0044, ND p=0.0044; normalized area: PD p=0.0132, ND p=0.0132; two-sided Fisherâs exact) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1A, D, and E</xref>). These results suggest that as in ooDSGCs, E/I in oDSGCs is relatively stable across contrasts. However, the spike tuning curves of oDSGCs are nonetheless contrast-sensitive. Thus, stable E/I alone is insufficient to maintain the contrast invariance of spikes. In the case of oDSGCs, changes to the absolute magnitude of synaptic inputs across contrasts, along with thresholding effects, appear to trump the contrast invariance of E/I.</p><p>To further test the extent to which the magnitude of synaptic inputs can affect oDSGC tuning curves even with stable E/I, we revisited our parallel conductance model of an exemplary oDSGC. We modeled oDSGC responses while changing the gain of excitatory and inhibitory conductances together, thereby keeping E/I constant while nevertheless adjusting the total magnitude of E and I. As in our empirical data, lowering the gain of E and I together to simulate responses to low-contrast stimuli resulted in sharper spike tuning curves. The width of Vm tuning curves, however, remained relatively contrast invariant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1F</xref>). These results recapitulate our empirical findings and indicate that the spike threshold nonlinearity influences spike tuning curve width across contrasts. Other stimulus parameters that affect the magnitude of excitation, inhibition, or both are also likely to modulate the direction tuning properties of oDSGCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>A subtraction algorithm predicts vertical OKR from oDSGC activity</title><p>Having established the tuning properties of Superior and Inferior oDSGCs, we asked whether the asymmetries between these cell types, along with their contrast-sensitivities, could explain how vertical OKR changes across stimulus conditions.

The light available to a single oDSGC follows such luminance fluctuations over the course of a single stimulus oscillation cycle, but the position of the oDSGC relative to the phase of the grating will cause a corresponding phase shift in its luminance function.

Superior and Inferior oDSGC firing rate distributions were compared for superior and inferior drifting bars at high (full) and low (20% relative) contrast (i.e., four stimulus conditions) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1BâE</xref>). We inferred that the relative OKR gain under each stimulus condition would be related to the corresponding difference in spike rate between Superior and Inferior oDSGCs under that same condition. For instance, gain in response to a high-contrast superior grating was predicted by the difference between the preferred direction responses of Superior oDSGCs and the null direction responses of Inferior oDSGCs to high-contrast bars. Importantly, such inferences constitute linear predictions of gain. Allowing for the possibility that downstream circuitry incorporates additional monotonic nonlinearities, a linear prediction is consistent with behavior so long as it predicts gain changes in the correct <italic>direction</italic> (but not magnitude) across stimulus conditions.</p><p>The asymmetries in the tuning curves of Superior and Inferior oDSGCs resulted in the following key predictions for how OKR gain would change across stimulus directions and contrasts: (1) gain would decrease with stimulus contrast, (2) OKR would be asymmetric, with superior stimuli eliciting greater gain than inferior stimuli, and (3) this asymmetry between responses to superior and inferior stimuli would decrease with stimulus contrast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Next, we tested these predictions in behaving mice. OKR in the superior and inferior directions was measured in response to high-contrast (full) and low-contrast (20% relative) oscillating gratings. All of the linear predictions were consistent with behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">3</xref>). Most notably, gain decreased with stimulus contrast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1H, I, and P</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8âfigure supplement 3</xref>), and the asymmetry between superior and inferior OKR that we originally noticed under high-contrast conditions diminished in response to low-contrast stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1L, M, and Q</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8âfigure supplement 3</xref>). While these results may be related, they do not <italic>necessitate</italic> each other, and instead rely on further subtleties in the relationship between Superior and Inferior oDSGC responses at both contrasts. Indeed, permuting the behavioral predictions by scrambling which cellular responses were assigned to superior/inferior motion and high/low contrast revealed that only five permutations (out of 256 possibilities, 1.95%) accurately matched our behavioral results. Consistent with these findings, the relationship between our linear predictions and behavioral results was fit well by a monotonic function that was near linear within the measured regime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we tested whether instantaneous subtraction of Superior and Inferior oDSGC firing rates on millisecond timescales could also predict vertical OKR behavior. We directly recorded the spikes of Superior and Inferior oDSGCs in response to oscillating gratings with the same parameters as those used to induce behavioral OKR. This stimulus evoked more spikes in Superior oDSGCs as gratings drifted dorsal to ventral on the retina (superior motion), and more spikes in Inferior oDSGCs as gratings drifted ventral to dorsal on the retina (inferior motion) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8âfigure supplement 2C and D</xref>). To make behavioral predictions, the average population instantaneous firing rates of Superior and Inferior oDSGCs were subtracted every 5 ms over the course of an oscillation cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8âfigure supplement 2E and F</xref>). Such values constituted linear predictions of instantaneous eye velocity for each time point, and their cumulative integrals yielded predictions of eye position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8âfigure supplement 2G and H</xref>). Recordings were initially made in response to both high (full) and 20% relative contrast gratings; however, the low-contrast condition failed to evoke consistent spiking in oDSGCs. Thus, we instead used high (full) and 50% relative contrast gratings to predict how responses would change across contrasts (see âMaterials and methodsâ). Moment-by-moment subtraction of oDSGC firing rates indicated that (1) eye movements would track the sinusoidal pattern of stimulus motion, (2) gain would decrease with decreasing stimulus contrast, (3) OKR would be asymmetric with greater gain in response to superior motion than inferior motion, and (4) asymmetries between Superior and Inferior OKR would decrease with decreasing stimulus contrast. Not only do these predictions match those generated from the drifting bar stimulus, but they also accurately predict OKR in behaving mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>). The moment-by-moment difference between Superior and Inferior oDSGC firing rates was also generally linearly related to the time-matched eye velocity of behaving animals, with nonlinear regimes occurring only at extreme firing rate differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>). Together, these results provide a neurophysiological explanation for how vertical OKR changes across multiple stimulus conditions and reveal that the circuit and cellular properties that shape oDSGC motion encoding have direct and predictable consequences for behavior.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results depict a neurophysiological mechanism by which vertical OKR changes across stimulus conditions. We demonstrate that superior and inferior OKR are asymmetric in adult mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), and show how this behavioral phenomenon can be traced to novel asymmetries in the direction tuning properties of Superior and Inferior oDSGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Mechanistically, a shift in the balance of excitatory and inhibitory inputs across cell types influences direction tuning, primarily through an effect associated with spike thresholding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Similar thresholding effects also confer contrast-sensitivity of the spike tuning curve, even when E/I is contrast-invariant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Together, these cellular properties accurately predict how vertical OKR changes with stimulus direction and contrast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>Directional asymmetries in OKR are common across species. Besides the vertical asymmetries investigated here, horizontal OKR is asymmetric in many organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Masseck and Hoffmann, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mowrer, 1936</xref>). This asymmetry manifests nearly universally as higher OKR gain in response to temporal-to-nasal (anterior) motion than to nasal-to-temporal (posterior) motion, and often only when stimuli are viewed monocularly. Such horizontal asymmetries may similarly be linked to direction tuning in the retina: while anterior-preferring oDSGCs are critical to horizontal OKR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dhande et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Osterhout et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Yonehara et al., 2016</xref>), posterior-preferring oDSGCs were only recently identified in rodents and display distinct direction tuning properties compared to their anterior-preferring counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sabbah et al., 2017</xref>). Further, a subtraction mechanism between horizontally tuned oDSGCs may also underlie horizontal OKR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hoffmann and Fischer, 2001</xref>). However, at least two confounds obscure a connection between the tuning properties of anterior and posterior oDSGCs and asymmetries in horizontal OKR. First, oDSGCs in the left and right eyes, and their contralateral central targets (NOT/DTN), encode different absolute directions of stimulus motion (reflection occurs over the sagittal body axis). To compensate, signals are compared across eyes/hemispheres prior to behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hoffmann and Fischer, 2001</xref>), and, in some species, NOT/DTN receives descending, often binocular, inputs from visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Masseck and Hoffmann, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Giolli et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wood et al., 1973</xref>). Second, recent studies have suggested that ooDSGCs could be involved in horizontal OKR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dhande et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kay et al., 2011</xref>). Asymmetries in the horizontal version of the behavior may thus depend on more complex considerations.</p><p>Analogous confounds are less concerning when considering the mechanisms that could account for asymmetries in vertical OKR. For one, stimuli that induce vertical OKR, such as the gratings used here, are perceived identically by both eyes. Interhemispheric communication is unlikely to influence behavior under such conditions. Though signals are probably also exchanged between the horizontal and vertical OKR pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Simpson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Giolli et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lilley et al., 2019</xref>), these channels may play a minimal role in shaping OKR to purely vertical stimuli. Finally, while it has been suggested that a vertically tuned ooDSGC may also project to MTN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kay et al., 2011</xref>), this cell type was not clearly revealed by either anatomical or electrophysiological analyses during our retrograde labeling experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Instead, we find that two populations of ganglion cells project to MTN, and that these cells can be classified as Superior and Inferior oDSGCs. These results are consistent with characterizations of MTN-projecting RGCs across many species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yonehara et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yonehara et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cook and Podugolnikova, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dann and Buhl, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ruff et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, unlike for horizontal OKR, asymmetries in vertical OKR can be explained more simply by the physiology of oDSGCs.</p><p>Despite the possibility that asymmetries in vertical and horizontal OKR are influenced by separate mechanisms, the two phenomena could share a common ethological function. Optic flow associated with forward locomotion typically includes a large posterior component. Thus, it has been suggested that posterior OKR is less reliable than anterior OKR in order to mitigate lateral eye movements that might otherwise occur when an animal walks forward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tauber and Atkin, 1968</xref>). Similar reasoning may explain the asymmetry between superior and inferior OKR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Takahashi et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grasse and Cynader, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Takahashi and Igarashi, 1977</xref>). Indeed, recent work in freely moving mice demonstrated that optic flow has a stronger inferior than superior component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Holmgren et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, the cellular and behavioral asymmetries identified in this study may provide an ethological advantage by mitigating aberrant eye movements during forward locomotion. Future work should address this possibility by mapping OKR gain as a function of the extent to which various stimuli reflect locomotion-associated optic flow.</p><p>From a physiological perspective, our results provide the first evidence that Superior and Inferior oDSGCs encode motion asymmetrically. Superior oDSGCs produce more spikes and have broader tuning curves than Inferior oDSGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). These findings coincide with previous work demonstrating genetic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Khindi et al., 2022</xref>) and anatomical differences between oDSGC types. Multiple transgenic lines are known to label either Superior or Inferior oDSGCs, but not both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lilley et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yonehara et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yonehara et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ruff et al., 2021</xref>). The axons of Superior and Inferior oDSGCs take separate retinofugal tracts and project to different MTN subnuclei in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yonehara et al., 2009</xref>). Additional differences exist between vertically and horizontally tuned oDSGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dhande et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Osterhout et al., 2015</xref>). The competitive advantage of mitigating OKR during forward locomotion may have thereby shaped the development of many differences between oDSGC types.</p><p>The asymmetric spike tuning of Superior and Inferior oDSGCs is associated with differences in the magnitude of excitatory synaptic input to each cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Three synaptic partners are primary candidates for the source of this asymmetry: (1) glutamatergic input from bipolar cells (types 5 and 7), (2) cholinergic input from SACs, and (3) glutamatergic input from VGluT3 amacrine cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amthor et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yonehara et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Yoshida et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mani et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Matsumoto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yonehara et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sivyer et al., 2019</xref>). Glutamatergic conductances in oDSGCs rely on AMPARs and NMDARs, whereas cholinergic conductances rely on nicotinic AChRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kittila and Massey, 1997</xref>). These conductances have been studied primarily in ooDSGCs and deserve further characterization in oDSGCs. Interestingly, VGluT3 amacrine cells also corelease glycine, which cancels oDSGC spiking in response to high-velocity stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mani et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Summers and Feller, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sivyer et al., 2019</xref>). Asymmetries at the VGluT3-oDSGC synapse could coincide with differences in the speed tuning properties of Superior and Inferior oDSGCs. A combination of genetic, optical, and pharmacological manipulations could distinguish among these possible sources of asymmetric tuning.</p><p>In addition to the gain of excitatory inputs, other mechanisms could contribute to tuning curve differences between Superior and Inferior oDSGCs. Debate remains over the extent to which excitatory inputs to DSGCs are directionally tuned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Vaney et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Matsumoto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Matsumoto et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Percival et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Poleg-Polsky and Diamond, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Summers and Feller, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yonehara et al., 2013</xref>). Our data indicate that excitation may be less direction-selective in Superior than in Inferior oDSGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), which could contribute to their broader spike tuning curves. Qualitatively, excitation also showed a bimodal average tuning curve in Superior oDSGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>) that matched their average spike tuning curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). However, bimodal spike tuning curves also resulted from directionally untuned depolarizing current injections in both cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>), so the influence of excitatory tuning remains unclear. In addition, previous studies with simultaneous somatic and dendritic recordings have revealed that dendritic spikes in rabbit oDSGCs contribute to directional tuning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sivyer and Williams, 2013</xref>). Different spatial distributions of voltage-gated sodium channels along dendrites could also contribute to asymmetric direction tuning between oDSGC types. Indeed, we show that Superior and Inferior oDSGCs have distinct morphologies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Thus, while a single-compartment conductance model captured the empirical data in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), development of multicompartment models could elucidate potential contributions of dendritic spikes to asymmetric tuning between oDSGC types. Intriguingly, however, among mechanisms that are unlikely to explain differences between Superior and Inferior oDSGC tuning curves is that of direction-selective inhibition. We find that inhibition is more sharply tuned in Superior oDSGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>), and that this is associated with sharper Vm tuning curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>, arrowheads). In agreement, analyses leveraging our parallel conductance model also demonstrated that, all else equal, sharper inhibitory tuning contributes to sharper Vm and spike tuning in oDSGCs (not shown). Nonetheless, empirically measured spike tuning curves are broader in Superior oDSGCs than in Inferior oDSGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J and K</xref>). Thus, while the relationship between inhibitory tuning curve shape and spike tuning curve shape is nuanced and requires further investigation, the difference in spike tuning curve shape between Superior and Inferior oDSGCs is unlikely to be explained by inhibitory tuning. Evidently, other mechanisms, including differences in excitatory gain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), counteract and outweigh the influence of differences in inhibition. Consequently, a comprehensive understanding of direction selectivity will require mapping the contributions of mechanisms that have been less well-studied than directionally tuned inhibition.</p><p>Further insight into how oDSGCs encode motion can be gained by comparing their tuning properties to those of the more comprehensively studied ooDSGCs. While prior work has focused on speed tuning as the primary difference between oDSGCs and ooDSGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Oyster, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Oyster et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mani et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Summers and Feller, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sivyer et al., 2019</xref>), our results reveal an additional difference between these two classes of DSGCs that has been previously overlooked: oDSGCs are contrast sensitive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), whereas ooDSGCs are not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sethuramanujam et al., 2016</xref>). In ooDSGCs, preservation of E/I across contrasts is apparently critical for retaining contrast-invariant direction tuning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Poleg-Polsky and Diamond, 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sethuramanujam et al., 2017</xref>). Counterintuitively, we find that E/I in oDSGCs is also relatively stable across contrasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1D and E</xref>). Therefore, stability of E/I is not alone sufficient for contrast-invariant spike tuning; independence from thresholding effects is also required. Indeed, thresholding modulates oDSGC direction tuning following changes to either E/I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) or the absolute magnitude of E and I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1F</xref>). Evidently, the influence of thresholding constitutes a major difference in the mechanisms that govern how oDSGCs and ooDSGCs encode motion.</p><p>That E/I is contrast-invariant in both oDSGCs and ooDSGCs also indicates some extent of shared circuitry between these cell types. Contrast invariance of E/I in ooDSGCs relies on postsynaptic NMDA conductances and constrains possible presynaptic wiring motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Poleg-Polsky and Diamond, 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sethuramanujam et al., 2017</xref>). oDSGCs likely share many of these features. Indeed, serial block-face electron microscopy has confirmed that oDSGCs and ooDSGCs share many of their presynaptic partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Briggman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ding et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mani et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Matsumoto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Matsumoto et al., 2021</xref>). Nonetheless, differences in the intrinsic properties between and within DSGC classes, including dependence on thresholding, could magnify the impact of subtle circuit differences on spike output.</p><p>Finally, our results show that vertical OKR is predicted by a simple subtraction between the outputs of Superior and Inferior oDSGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). It is interesting that asymmetries in oDSGCs are not apparently corrected by downstream circuitry, considering that normalization operations pervade the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carandini and Heeger, 2011</xref>). One explanation is that there is no simple compensatory solution to normalize the responses of Superior and Inferior oDSGCs because multiple stimulus parameters (e.g., stimulus direction and contrast) simultaneously affect the asymmetry magnitude. On the other hand, the ethological advantage of asymmetric OKR (i.e., mitigating aberrant eye movements during forward locomotion) may have provided sufficient evolutionary pressure to allow asymmetries between Superior and Inferior oDSGCs to propagate to behavior when they might otherwise have been compensated. Regardless, a linear subtraction of oDSGC outputs offers an accurate and parsimonious explanation of vertical OKR. Moreover, this algorithm fits well with both the anatomy and physiology of MTN and the isolation of the vertical OKR pathway from other visual circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Giolli et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yonehara et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">van der Togt et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Soodak and Simpson, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Giolli et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grasse and Cynader, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Natal and Britto, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Simpson et al., 1979</xref>).</p><p>Similar subtraction algorithms are prevalent across the animal kingdom. In the mammalian retina, such computations confer both the spatial center-surround (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barlow, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hartline et al., 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kuffler, 1953</xref>) and chromatic dichotomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dacey et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Monasterio and Gouras, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Field et al., 2009</xref>) of receptive fields. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, spatially offset antennae allow accurate estimation of wind velocity by differentiation of signals across two input sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Suver et al., 2019</xref>). Similar mechanisms likely underlie tropotaxic orienting behaviors that also rely on spatially offset receptors, including arthropod antennae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Martin, 1965</xref>), reptile forked tongues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schwenk, 1994</xref>), and mammalian ears (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Middlebrooks and Green, 1991</xref>). The ubiquity of this circuit motif may reflect an efficient solution for integrating complementary information streams. Our results highlight how such circuits can be influenced by subtle asymmetries across input channels. Further investigation will determine whether diverse sensory systems rely on asymmetric inputs to adaptively change behavior across stimulus conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WT C57BL/6J Mice</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-Lucifer yellow (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Invitrogen</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat #A5750;

This process was repeated across five different luminances to fit a linear regression between pupil size and angular eye position. The meridian and equator of the eye were measured by turning on the top- and side-aligned infrared LEDs in sequence. During experiments, only the top LED was on.

Prior to surgery, mice were anesthetized by IP injection of ketamine/xylazine and 5% isoflurane inhalation. Once fully anesthetized, as assessed by absence of the pedal reflex, animals were transferred to a sterile-heated surface and the eyes were covered with a lubricating ointment. Then, 2% isoflurane was administered continuously to maintain anesthesia. Fur was removed prior to incision and lidocaine (&lt;7 mg/kg) was injected locally under the scalp. After incision, animalsâ heads were leveled by aligning bregma and lambda in the horizontal plane. A burr hole was drilled at A/P: 0.00 mm, M/L: 0.85 mm from bregma. All injections were performed into the right MTN. A glass needle filled with retrobeads (diluted 1:3 in distilled water) and connected to a Hamilton syringe was lowered into the burr hole at an angle of 30Â° A/P to a depth of 5.36 mm below the surface of the brain. After 10 min, an injection of 400 nL was made at a rate of 5 nL/s. After injection, the needle was left in place for an additional 10 min before removal. The scalp was sutured and animals recovered in a heated cage. Analgesics (buprenorphine [0.05â0.1 mg/kg] and NSAIDs [5â10 mg/kg]) were delivered via subcutaneous injection immediately after animals awoke from anesthesia, again 12 hr later, and a third time the following morning. Animal health was monitored for 3 days after surgery and additional analgesics were administered as required. Labeling of retinal ganglion cells in the contralateral eye was typically observed as soon as 48 hr following surgery and did not increase or decrease with time.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-6"><title>Empirical mosaic analysis</title><p>All mosaic analyses occurred â¥2 days after injection of the retrograde tracer into MTN. Retinas were dissected, fixed in 4% PFA for 20 min, and flat-mounted onto a microscope slide with a spacer. One widefield fluorescent image was taken of each retina. The location of each labeled cell in the image was determined using custom MATLAB scripts. Only retinas with near complete labeling (determined as greater than 500 identified RGCs) were included in analyses. The retina perimeter, optic nerve head, and dorsal-ventral axis were manually measured. These points were used to define a normalized polar coordinate system that allowed for the comparison of cell locations and densities across multiple retinas.

Coverage factors were changed systematically such that the total number of cells across all mosaics â regardless of the number of mosaics being modeled â always approximated the number of retrogradely labeled cells per retina in our empirical data set.

Prior to electrophysiology experiments, mice were dark-adapted for â¥12 hr.

Retina dissections occurred in the dark using infrared converters and warmed bicarbonate-based Ames solution, equilibrated with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Brains were simultaneously harvested and fixed in 4% PFA for imaging and to confirm that the retrograde tracer was properly injected into MTN.

The center of the retina was estimated by computing the median of the circumcenters of all unique triangles that could be formed from these eight points. The radius of the retina was estimated by finding the median radius of the circles that circumscribed these same triangles. In all cases, the convex hull of the whole-mount retina was well approximated by a circle and the retina center estimation was near the optic nerve head. The coordinates of each recorded cell were computed in reference to the retina center. Cell locations were combined across retinas by normalizing to the estimated radius in a polar coordinate system.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-10"><title>Identification of MTN-projecting RGCs</title><p>An NIR light source (950 nm, Sutter) was used to visualize the tissue for the majority of the experiment. To identify retrogradely labeled ganglion cells, a green epifluorescent light was turned on briefly (~1â3 s) prior to recording from each cell. This light evoked a moderate number of spikes in oDSGCs. At least 1 min of darkness was provided between the offset of the epifluorescent light and the beginning of subsequent experiments. The epifluorescence exposure likely contributed variance to our dataset by differentially modulating adaptation states along the dorsal/ventral retinal axis as the absorption spectra of cone photoreceptors change. However, for all electrophysiology experiments, care was taken to record from comparable spatial distributions of Superior and Inferior oDSGCs such that reported asymmetries between cell types cannot be attributed to uneven proportions of Superior and Inferior oDSGCs recorded from dorsal and ventral retina. Further, repeated exposures to epifluorescence throughout an experiment had no effect on oDSGC responsivity. Moreover, asymmetries between Superior and Inferior oDSGC tuning curves were observed within each retinal quadrant and between pairs of Superior and Inferior oDSGCs (within 30 Âµm of each other) across the retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>For a subset of cell-attached experiments, two-photon targeting was employed to validate and replicate our central findings.

In such cases, the cellâs spike tuning curve area was set to 0, the area of its normalized tuning curve was set to 0, and its direction selectivity index was set to 1. We chose this convention because of the observation that, across cells, as the total number of spikes approached 0, the direction selectivity index approached 1 and the area of the normalized tuning curve approached 0.

The preferred and null directions of each cell in our dataset were computed in response to high-contrast drifting bars. Gain predictions were made for high- and low-contrast (20% relative) stimuli moving in the superior and inferior directions (i.e., four total conditions) by (1) resampling from distributions of oDSGC responses for that condition 10,000 times, (2) computing the difference (i.e., âdeltaâ) between the median preferred and null direction responses on each iteration for the appropriate cell types, and (3) using the median of these bootstrapped distributions of delta as an estimate of relative gain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The amplitudes of the predicted eye movements shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref> reflect these predictions, while the sinusoidal trajectories are inferred from the stimulus motion.</p><p>Computing the preferred and null direction of each cell has the advantage of controlling for the fact that the observed preferred direction of individual oDSGCs can change based on retinotopic location when the retina is flat mounted. Assigning the preferred direction to a constant stimulus direction across cells (e.g., dorsal-to-ventral motion on the retina for Superior oDSGCs) did not change the behavioral predictions (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-25"><title>Behavioral predictions from oscillating grating stimulus</title><p>oDSGC responses were measured in the cell-attached configuration in response to the same oscillating grating stimulus used in behavioral experiments. Two-photon targeting was used for all oscillating grating electrophysiology experiments. Stimulus oscillations were sinusoidal and had a period of 15 s and an amplitude of 20Â°. The intensity of the grating was also sinusoidal across space, and had a spatial frequency of 0.15 cycles/Â°. For the high-contrast stimulus, the mean light intensity of the grating evoked 3.8 Ã 10<sup>3</sup> S-cone photoisomerizations/s, the peak intensity evoked 7.6 Ã 10<sup>3</sup> S-cone photoisomerizations/s, and the trough intensity evoked 124 S-cone photoisomerizations/s. For the low-contrast stimulus, the 20% relative (Michelson) contrast stimulus used in behavior experiments failed to evoke consistent spiking in oDSGCs. That 20% relative contrast gratings evoked OKR behavior but not oDSGC spikes can likely be explained by the fact that absolute contrasts and adaptation states were not matched between behavior and electrophysiology. However, assuming monotonic nonlinearities, it is only necessary to match the <italic>direction</italic> (e.g., higher to lower) of contrast change to predict the corresponding <italic>direction</italic> of behavioral change across contrasts. Thus, in electrophysiology experiments, we used a version of the low-contrast oscillating grating stimulus that was 50% relative contrast compared to the high-contrast stimulus described above. The mean light intensity of this stimulus evoked 3.8 Ã 10<sup>3</sup> S-cone photoisomerizations/s, the peak intensity evoked 5.7 Ã 10<sup>3</sup> S-cone photoisomerizations/s, and the trough intensity evoked 1.9 Ã 10<sup>3</sup> S-cone photoisomerizations/s. For all stimuli, M-cone photoisomerizations were 74% those of S-cones. The initial positional phase of the grating was randomized between cells.</p><p>Linear behavioral predictions were made from the spike responses of Superior and Inferior oDSGCs to these oscillating stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8âfigure supplement 2</xref>). The following procedure was repeated separately for responses to high- and low-contrast gratings: first, the median spike rate of Superior and Inferior oDSGCs was computed every 5 ms over the course of a single 15 s oscillation cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8âfigure supplement 2C and D</xref>). A point-by-point subtraction was then performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8âfigure supplement 2E and F</xref>). The difference between the median spike rates of Superior and Inferior oDSGCs served as a linear prediction of eye velocity at each point in time.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Markus Meister as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Tirin Moore as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Keisuke Yonehara (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>General recommendations:</p><p>1 â There are too many figures. The main text figures alone contain 125 panels, not counting small insets. The reader is likely to miss the important results in a sea of less relevant information. The paper would be more readable with half the number of panels.</p><p>2 â Small effects: Many of the panels report tiny effect sizes, e.g. 1I, 1J, 1K etc. The differences may be statistically significant (small p-values), owing to the large number of cells examined, but they are small on an absolute scale, or relative to the variance in the cell population. Sometimes, effects of the same magnitude are declared non-significant in one condition and significant in another (e.g. 3K, 3L). The paper could be more convincing if it just focused on robust effects.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>3 â Relation of physiology to behavior: The OKR responses for uni-directional gratings (Figure 1C) and oscillating gratings (Figures1G-H) look strikingly different, with more reliable responses in both directions to the oscillating gratings. The physiology in this study is derived from drifting gratings but ultimately used to explain the behavior under oscillating gratings. To reconcile the two, it would be useful to see some oDSGC spiking responses to oscillating gratings used in the behavioral experiments. Do they reveal the same asymmetries between inferior and superior oDSGCs?</p><p>4 â Morphology and space clamp, Line 247-252: The authors found that the spike-to-EPSC ratio (Figure S4P) and input resistance were lower in superior oDSGCs, and claimed that superior oDSGCs are less excitable. As the authors discuss, the morphological difference (size of the dendritic field) between superior and inferior oDSGC types can cause space clamp problems and an apparent difference in EPSC. To validate the intrinsic excitability, the authors should measure the membrane excitability or gain by recording of membrane potentials while applying electrical stimulation, ranging from subthreshold to saturation level.</p><p>5 â Effects of current injection, Figure 5: The authors describe that injected currents that induce ~6 mV changes did not cause baseline firing. However, there may be subthreshold biophysical effects of this depolarization, such as inactivation of LVA ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, known to exist in certain RGCs (Henderson and Miller, Vis Neurosci, 2003; Huang and Li, J Neurosci Res, 2006). Steady hyperpolarization may de-inactivate Na<sup>+</sup> channels (Hodgkin and Huxley, J. Physiol. 1952; Armstrong and Bezanilla, J. Gen. Physiol. 1974). The authors should consider contribution of such sub-threshold mechanisms to visual excitability.</p><p>6 â Interpretation of current injection, Figure 5: The steady current injection experiments in Figure 5 are informative for exploring spike thresholding. However, this manipulation is different from the actual difference of EPSCs between superior and inferior oDSGCs, which are only different during light-evoked responses but not during the baseline period. To pursue this one could examine the correlation between EPSC strength and spiking tuning width/direction selectivity across all oDSGCs without current injection. According to the spike thresholding mechanism, oDSGCs receiving stronger EPSCs would show broader tuning and decreased direction selectivity.</p><p>7 â Contrast nonlinearities, Figures 3, 5, and 7: The authors examine the directional tuning of spikes and Vm in different contrast conditions. The differences between spikes and Vm indicate the nonlinearity in thresholding contributes to the tuning changes. However, it is not clear if the contrast modulates synaptic inputs. Specifically, if bipolar cells or starburst cells have a contrast-dependent nonlinearity in the neurotransmitter release, the tuning can be affected by the contrast changes. The authors should examine or discuss the possible modulation in synaptic inputs by stimulus contrast.</p><p>8 â Contribution of inhibition: In Line 194, the authors report that &quot;inhibitory inputs failed to account for the differences between superior and inferior oDSGCs&quot;. However, in Figure 3, it appears that compared to inferior oDSGCs, IPSCs of superior oDSGCs are more narrowly tuned (Figures3C and 3D), while EPSCs are more broadly tuned (with two local peaks just like the spiking activity in Figures3H-I). The more narrowly tuned inhibition could contribute to the broader tuning of superior oDSGCs. Similarly, the difference in excitation between the two cell types appears to go beyond a simple &quot;untuned&quot; excitation because their excitatory tuning curves show bimodal vs unimodal distributions that match their spike tuning curves. These points are worth more discussion.</p><p>9 â Relative importance of gain and tuning width: Much of the manuscript elaborates on two superior-inferior differences: the absolute firing rate of the response and the width of the tuning curve. The final Figure 8 relating physiology to behavior seems to be based solely on firing rate differences. Is there a functional consequence to the difference in tuning width between the two cell types as it relates to the behavior? If not, the manuscript might be simplified by focusing on the gain.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81780.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>General recommendations:</p><p>1 â There are too many figures.

We have also addressed some sources of variance within cell types, for example by examining metrics across retinal topography (Figure 2 - figure supplement 4-5). In some cases, different metrics and axis scales may make effect sizes appear visually more similar than they are (.g. Figure 3I, J [previously 3K, L]). Where possible, we have matched the scale of axes across conditions (e.g. Figure 3C, G) so that the effect size is illustrated more clearly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major concerns:</p><p>3 â Relation of physiology to behavior: The OKR responses for uni-directional gratings (Figure 1C) and oscillating gratings (Figures1G-H) look strikingly different, with more reliable responses in both directions to the oscillating gratings.

The revised manuscript includes cell-attached spike recordings from Superior and Inferior oDSGCs in response to oscillating gratings (Figure 8, Figure 8 - figure supplement 2). The data show that Superior oDSGCs respond preferentially to the upward movement of the grating, whereas Inferior oDSGCs respond preferentially to the downward movement (Figure 8E, Figure 8 - figure supplement 2C-D). Moreover their responses are asymmetric, with larger responses in Superior compared to Inferior oDSGCs. These results qualitatively match our findings from the drifting bar stimulus. We have also used these data to make an additional linear prediction of OKR behavior by subtracting the instantaneous firing rates of Superior and Inferior oDSGCs over the course of a single oscillation cycle (Figure 8F, Figure 8 - figure supplement 2E-H). These linear predictions closely match those made from responses to drifting bars, as well as OKR measured from behaving animals. This analysis is featured in the revised version of Figure 8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4 â Morphology and space clamp, Line 247-252: The authors found that the spike-to-EPSC ratio (Figure S4P) and input resistance were lower in superior oDSGCs, and claimed that superior oDSGCs are less excitable.

Overall, Superior oDSGCs have a lower input resistance than Inferior oDSGCs, indicating that they are indeed less excitable (p = 0.002 by rank sum test). These data are reported in the manuscript (p8, Â¶4, lines 240-253) and shown in Figure 4 - figure supplement 1.</p><p>To further validate this finding, we injected square current steps into Superior and Inferior oDSGCs, as suggested by the reviewers. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> Panel B shows the resulting mean Â± SEM impulse response functions for each oDSGC type. Superior oDSGCs have lower voltage-to-current ratios, indicating that they are less excitable.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> panel C, we have calculated input resistances separately for the ramp and step experiments. These metrics were tightly correlated (Spearman R=0.87, p&lt;0.001, n=11 oDSGCs), indicating that both manipulations probe the intrinsic excitability of oDSGCs similarly well. For this reason, and because of the comparatively low sample size in the current step experiment, we have elected not to include the current step data in the manuscript.</p><p>Finally, while space clamp problems may account for differences in EPSC direction tuning between Superior and Inferior oDSGCs, they are unlikely to explain the greater amount of excitatory input to Superior oDSGCs as shown in Figure 3G. All else equal, space clamp errors are expected to increase with the dendritic field size of a neuron(Spuston et al, J. Neurophysiol, 1993). Our data show that Superior oDSGCs have larger dendritic fields than Inferior oDSGCs (Figure 4B), and therefore likely suffer from greater space clamp errors. However, space clamp errors <italic>decrease</italic> EPSC magnitudes recorded at the soma. Therefore, space clamp errors are unlikely to explain the observation that EPSCs are greater in Superior oDSGCs than in Inferior oDSGCs, and instead suggest that the difference in EPSC magnitude between Superior and Inferior oDSGCs could be even larger than we measured.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Superior oDSGCs are less excitable than Inferior oDSGCs.</title><p>(A) Input resistance in Superior (magenta) and Inferior (gray) oDSGCs calculated from current injection ramps in which current increases linearly from 0 to 50 pA over 0.25 seconds.

However, there may be subthreshold biophysical effects of this depolarization, such as inactivation of LVA ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, known to exist in certain RGCs (Henderson and Miller, Vis Neurosci, 2003; Huang and Li, J Neurosci Res, 2006). Steady hyperpolarization may de-inactivate Na<sup>+</sup> channels (Hodgkin and Huxley, J. Physiol. 1952; Armstrong and Bezanilla, J. Gen. Physiol. 1974). The authors should consider contribution of such sub-threshold mechanisms to visual excitability.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out these subthreshold effects of current injection. To determine the effects of currents on the intrinsic properties of oDSGCs, we measured the peak rate of voltage change (dV/dt) during spikes while injecting either depolarizing or hyperpolarizing current. We found a slight increase in this rate of change in the hyperpolarizing condition, consistent with an increase in NaV channel availability. In agreement, the spike threshold potential was more negative during hyperpolarizing injections than during depolarizing injections. These data are shown in Figure 5 - figure supplement 2. We emphasize that these observations do not detract from the thresholding mechanism that is revealed by current injection experiments (Figure 5). The reason is that changes to NaV channel availability caused by current injection increased the excitability of neurons comparatively more during the <italic>hyperpolarizing</italic> condition. However, our experimental data show that oDSGCs were more excitable (i.e., produced more spikes and had broader tuning curves) during the <italic>depolarizing</italic> condition. This discrepancy is explained by the observation that, despite the change in NaV availability, all recorded cellsâ resting membrane potential sat further away from their spike threshold during the hyperpolarizing condition compared to the depolarizing condition (Figure 5 - figure supplement 2D). Thus, changes in NaV availability are masked, and canceled to an extent, by the direct influence of current injections on the resting membrane potential.</p><p>To our knowledge, T-type calcium channel expression has not yet been reported in mouse oDSGCs. Previous reports of low voltage-activated calcium channels in RGCs of other species have indicated that activation of T-type channels may change by ~10-30% within the range that our current injections span (appx. -48 to -65 mV, Huang and Li, J Neurosci Res, 2006). It is difficult to speculate about the effects that such changes may have on our measurements, but we suggest that the most parsimonious explanation of the data shown in Figure 5 is given by the thresholding mechanism. Nonetheless, we have included a brief discussion of the impact of current injections on intrinsic properties of oDSGCs in the legend of Figure 5 âfigure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6 â Interpretation of current injection, Figure 5: The steady current injection experiments in Figure 5 are informative for exploring spike thresholding. However, this manipulation is different from the actual difference of EPSCs between superior and inferior oDSGCs, which are only different during light-evoked responses but not during the baseline period. To pursue this one could examine the correlation between EPSC strength and spiking tuning width/direction selectivity across all oDSGCs without current injection. According to the spike thresholding mechanism, oDSGCs receiving stronger EPSCs would show broader tuning and decreased direction selectivity.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this observation and agree that the current injection experiments do not replicate the stimulus dependence of the difference in EPSC magnitudes. We further agree that comparing EPSC magnitude with the spike tuning curve width should also reveal the effects of thresholding. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>, panels A and B plot the EPSC tuning curve area against the DSI (A) and normalized area (B) of the spike tuning curve. The dashed lines show least squares linear regressions. The reviewersâ predictions are correct: for both metrics, tuning curves tend to be wider (i.e., lower DSI and larger normalized area) when EPSCs are greater. These trends are not significant in the existing dataset, likely because there is sizeable variance in other metrics that contribute to spike tuning curve shape (e.g., IPSC magnitude and tuning, threshold potential, etc.). However, none of these other contributors to tuning curve shape can explain the <italic>differences between</italic> the spike tuning curves of Superior and Inferior oDSGCs, as they are either similar across cell types (Figure 3C, J, Figure 3 - figure supplement 1A; Figure 4 - figure supplement 1C-D), or promote sharper, rather than broader, spike tuning curves in Superior oDSGCs (Figure 3D). Thus, the data demonstrate that EPSC magnitude is the dominant contributor to differences between Superior and Inferior oDSGC tuning (see response to point 8 below for a discussion of differences in EPSC and IPSC tuning between oDSGC types).</p><p>An additional way of addressing the reviewersâ predictions is to examine the spike tuning curve width as a function of the peak EPSP magnitude from current clamp recordings in which no current was injected. This relationship is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref> panels C and D for the EPSP magnitude in each cellâs null direction. Inhibition tunes EPSPs, and we chose to examine the null direction because the relatively small EPSP magnitude in this direction means that this is the response for which thresholding should have its greatest influence on the shape of the spike tuning curve. EPSP magnitude is more strongly correlated with both spike DSI (C) and normalized area (D) than is EPSC magnitude (A, B) because the variance in a multitude of contributors to direction selectivity, including inhibition and cell-intrinsic properties, is already accounted for in the EPSP magnitude. Regardless, as suggested in panels A and B, larger EPSPs yield wider spike tuning curves. Together, these data agree with our previous analyses indicating that EPSC magnitude and thresholding are important contributors to oDSGC tuning curve shape. We have decided to not include the plots shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref> the revised manuscript because the data is limited and the results do not change our main points about thresholding.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Strength of excitatory input and spike tuning curve properties.</title><p>(A-B) Relationships between excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) tuning curve area and (A) direction selectivity index or (B) normalized area of the spike tuning curve.

The differences between spikes and Vm indicate the nonlinearity in thresholding contributes to the tuning changes. However, it is not clear if the contrast modulates synaptic inputs. Specifically, if bipolar cells or starburst cells have a contrast-dependent nonlinearity in the neurotransmitter release, the tuning can be affected by the contrast changes. The authors should examine or discuss the possible modulation in synaptic inputs by stimulus contrast.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the opportunity to clarify this point. We agree that we have not directly measured whether contrast modulates the tuning of excitatory or inhibitory synaptic inputs to oDSGCs. However, if bipolar cell or starburst amacrine cell direction tuning changed across contrasts, we would expect to see a corresponding change to the shape of the membrane potential tuning curve. Instead, our data show that Vm tuning curves do not change shape across contrasts (Figure 7E, Figure 7 - figure supplement 1B). Thus, it is unlikely that the tuning of excitatory or inhibitory inputs changes across contrasts, though we cannot rule out the possibility that they do so in a way that precisely counteract each other. In further support of the idea that contrast does not modulate the tuning curves of synaptic inputs to oDSGCs, we show that E/I in the preferred and null directions is contrast invariant (Figure 7 - figure supplement 1D-E). In addition, oDSGCs share many of their presynaptic partners with ON-OFF DSGCs</p><p>(ooDSGCs), including starburst amacrine cells and bipolar cell types. If contrast modulates the tuning of these presynaptic neurons, this effect would likely produce contrast sensitivity in ooDSGC tuning curves. However, multiple groups have demonstrated that direction selectivity in ooDSGCs is contrast invariant (Poleg-Polsky and Diamond, J Neurosci 2016; Sethuramanujam et al., Neuron 2016; Sethuramanujam et al., Neuron 2017). For these reasons, we find it unlikely that presynaptic neurons change their direction tuning properties across contrasts.</p><p>More directly, however, even if synaptic inputs to oDSGCs are contrast-sensitive, this likely cannot account for the contrast-sensitivity of oDSGC spiking since the Vm tuning curves are contrast-invariant (Figure 7E, Figure 7 - figure supplement 1B). Thus, spike thresholding remains the only plausible mechanism to explain this phenomenon.</p><p>Poleg-Polsky, A., and Diamond, J.S. (2016).

However, in Figure 3, it appears that compared to inferior oDSGCs, IPSCs of superior oDSGCs are more narrowly tuned (Figures3C and 3D), while EPSCs are more broadly tuned (with two local peaks just like the spiking activity in Figures3H-I). The more narrowly tuned inhibition could contribute to the broader tuning of superior oDSGCs. Similarly, the difference in excitation between the two cell types appears to go beyond a simple &quot;untuned&quot; excitation because their excitatory tuning curves show bimodal vs unimodal distributions that match their spike tuning curves. These points are worth more discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the suggestion to clarify the contributions of excitatory and inhibitory inputs on tuning curve shape. The intuition that more narrowly tuned inhibition can contribute to broader spike tuning is correct in some regimes. However, in other regimes, more narrowly tuned inhibition can also contribute to <italic>sharper</italic> spike tuning. The relationship between the direction selectivity index (DSI) of inhibition and the DSI of spikes is highly nuanced and varies according to the particular shape of the inhibitory tuning curve. Rather than attempt to explore this relationship exhaustively, we have compiled specific analyses that indicate that sharper inhibitory tuning in Superior oDSGCs is unlikely to contribute to their broader spike tuning curves.</p><p>Panel A in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref> shows that there is no significant correlation between inhibitory DSI and spike DSI in our dataset. This result may indicate that inhibition does not explain differences in the spike tuning curves of Superior and Inferior oDSGCs. However, the lack of correlation may also be attributable to the multitude of other factors that contribute to an oDSGCâs spike tuning ( e.g., magnitude of inhibition, magnitude and tuning of excitation, threshold potential, input resistance, etc.), each of which adds noise to this relationship. Thus, additional analyses are needed to parse the relationship between inhibitory tuning and spike tuning in oDSGCs:</p><p>In panels B and C we use our parallel conductance model to isolate the contribution of inhibition to oDSGC direction tuning. Panel B shows the DSI of a model oDSGCâs subthreshold membrane potential (Vm) and spikes as the DSI of the inhibitory conductance is progressively increased along the x-axis (excitation is held constant in this version of the model). The model predicts that, all else equal, narrower inhibitory tuning in oDSGCs yields narrower Vm and spike tuning curves. Panel C shows the output of two separate instantiations of the parallel conductance model for which inhibitory conductances were derived either only from Superior oDSGCs (Figure 3C, magenta line), or only from Inferior oDSGCs (Figure 3C, gray line). The model predicts that, all else equal, inhibitory conductances in Superior oDSGCs yield narrower Vm and spike tuning curves than those in Inferior oDSGCs. These modeling results indicate that inhibitory tuning is unlikely to account for the empirical finding that Superior oDSGCs have broader spike tuning curves.</p><p>Panel D shows that empirically measured Vm tuning curves (from current-clamp recordings) were more sharply tuned in Superior oDSGCs. Thus, as predicted by the model, narrower inhibitory inputs to Superior oDSGCs result in <italic>narrower,</italic> not wider, Vm tuning curves. In contrast, the finding that Superior oDSGCs have empirically broader spike tuning curves than Inferior oDSGCs can be accounted for by differences in excitation gain: excitation is greater in Superior oDSGCs (Figure 3G), resulting in larger Vm tuning curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref> panel E), and broader spike tuning curves via, among other mechanisms, thresholding. The data in panels D and E are replotted from Figure 5K-J and collapsed across conditions; the same statistics are marked by the arrowheads in those figures.</p><p>Collectively, these analyses all indicate that the narrower inhibitory tuning in Superior oDSGCs is unlikely to account for their broader spike tuning curves. The oDSGCs in our dataset likely reside in a particular regime of the inhibition DSI-spike DSI relationship where the two metrics are positively correlated.</p><p>With regard to the tuning of excitation, we agree with the reviewers that both the broader spike tuning of Superior oDSGCs and their bimodal tuning curves could be associated with the tuning properties of excitatory inputs. However, we also point out that bimodality of the spike tuning curve was observed in both Superior and Inferior oDSGCs following injection of directionally untuned depolarizing currents (Figure 5C-D). Thus, we are cautious in our interpretation, as it seems possible that this characteristic is also associated with excitation gain.</p><p>To address these points, we have indicated in the Discussion the likely contribution of narrower inhibitory tuning in Superior oDSGCs, though we have decided that the analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref> are too involved to be included in the current manuscript and deserve further exploration in additional studies. We have also added an examination of the potential contributions of tuned excitatory inputs.
