sensors in cephalic eye photoreceptors, but also function in additional sensory organs. This has prompted questions on the evolutionary relationship of these cell types, and if ancient r-opsins were non-photosensory. A molecular profiling approach in the marine bristleworm <italic>Platynereis dumerilii</italic> revealed shared and distinct features of cephalic and non-cephalic <italic>r-opsin1</italic>-expressing cells. Non-cephalic cells possess a full set of phototransduction components, but also a mechanosensory signature. Prompted by the latter, we investigated <italic>Platynereis</italic> putative mechanotransducer and found that <italic>nompc</italic> and <italic>pkd2.1</italic> co-expressed with <italic>r-opsin1</italic> in TRE cells by HCR RNA-FISH. To further assess the role of r-Opsin1 in these cells, we studied its signaling properties and unraveled that r-Opsin1 is a Gαq-coupled blue light receptor. Profiling of cells from <italic>r-opsin1</italic> mutants versus wild-types, and a comparison under different light conditions reveals that in the non-cephalic cells light – mediated by r-Opsin1 – adjusts the expression level of a calcium transporter relevant for auditory mechanosensation in vertebrates. We establish a deep-learning-based quantitative behavioral analysis for animal trunk movements and identify a light– and r-Opsin-1–dependent fine-tuning of the worm's undulatory movements in headless trunks, which are known to require mechanosensory feedback. Our results provide new data on peripheral cell types of likely light sensory/mechanosensory nature. These results point towards a concept in which such a multisensory cell type evolved to allow for fine-tuning of mechanosensation by light. This implies that light-independent mechanosensory roles of r-opsins may have evolved secondarily.</p></abstract><kwd-group

transmembrane receptors (GPCRs), serve as the main light sensors in animal photoreceptor cells. Rhabdomeric opsins (r-opsins) are an ancient class of opsins particularly widespread among invertebrates, typically expressed in larval photoreceptor cells and cephalic eyes that rely on rhabdomeric photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arendt et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arendt and Wittbrodt, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ramirez et al., 2016</xref>). The role of r-opsins in light perception has been best studied in the model of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye photoreceptor (EP) cells. Stimulation of a light-sensitive chromophore (retinaldehyde) covalently bound to the Gα<sub>q</sub>-coupled r-opsin apoprotein initiates an intracellular cascade (with 12 key components of the phototransduction cascade) that leads to an increase in intracellular calcium (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hardie and Juusola, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Whereas most of our knowledge about the function of r-opsins in animal photoreception stems from studies on cephalic EPs, non-cephalic <italic>r-opsin</italic>-expressing cells are found in representatives of various animal groups. For instance, <italic>r-opsin</italic> homologs demarcate putative photoreceptor cells at the tube feet of sea urchins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Raible et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Ullrich-Luter et al., 2011</xref>), and in Joseph cells and photoreceptors of the dorsal ocelli of the basal chordate amphioxus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Koyanagi et al., 2005</xref>). In the case of the brittle star, such non-cephalic photoreceptor cells have been implicated in a form of vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sumner-Rooney et al., 2020</xref>). Yet the diverse locations of <italic>r-opsin</italic>-positive cells, and the fact that they are not strictly associated with pigment cells, have raised the question whether <italic>r-opsin</italic>-positive cells outside the eye might have different functional roles.</p><p>This implies an evolutionary question: to what extent do non-cephalic <italic>r-opsin</italic>-positive cells share an evolutionary history with cephalic EPs or represent independent evolutionary inventions? A biological context in which this question is particularly interesting to address are animals that exhibit segmented body axes, featuring sensory organs in some or all of these segments. Analyses of the early Cambrian Lobopodian fossil <italic>Microdictyon sinicum</italic> suggested that this putative ancestor of arthropods possessed compound eye structures above each pair of legs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dzik, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gehring, 2011</xref>). This is in line with the idea that segmental photoreceptive organs could have been an ancestral feature, which might have been secondarily modified to allow for a more efficient division of labor between head and trunk. A similar hypothesis could be drawn for ancestors of annelids, a segmented clade of lophotrochozoans: various recent annelid groups, including opheliids, sabellids, and syllids, feature segmental eye spots with rhabdomeric photoreceptors (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Purschke et al., 2006</xref>). This would be consistent with the ancient presence of r-opsins and photoreceptive organs in a homonomously segmented annelid ancestor. Given the possible ancestry of segmentation in bilaterians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Couso, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dray et al., 2010</xref>), the outlined scenarios of segmental photoreceptive organs might even date back to the dawn of bilaterian animal evolution.</p><p>However, <italic>r-opsin</italic> genes have also started to be implied in functions that are unrelated to photoreception. Most notably, <italic>r-opsin</italic> genes are expressed in certain classes of mechanosensory cell types, such as the Johnston organ (JO) neurons and the larval Chordotonal organ (ChO) of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Senthilan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zanini et al., 2018</xref>), or the neuromasts of the lateral line of zebrafish and frog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Backfisch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Baker et al., 2015</xref>). Experiments assessing functionality of mechanosensation in both JO and ChO neurons have revealed that several <italic>r-opsins</italic> expressed in these receptors are required for proper mechanosensation and suggest that this function is light-independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Senthilan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zanini et al., 2018</xref>). These functional findings add new perspectives to older observations that a subset of mechanosensory cells (to which JO and ChO cells belong) exhibit significant similarities in their molecular specification cascade with EPs, comprising analogous use of Pax, Atonal, or Pou4f3 transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fritzsch, 2005</xref>). If r-opsins are to be considered as part of a shared molecular signature in photosensory and mechanosensory cells, this raises divergent possibilities for the evolution of r-Opsin-positive sensory cells: (i) Could r-opsins have evolved as ancient ‘protosensory’ molecules that were primarily engaged in mechanosensation, only to secondarily evolve to become light receptive? (ii) Conversely, does the canonical function of r-opsins in light reception reflect their ancestral role, with r-opsin-dependent mechanoreception representing a secondary evolutionary modification? Or (iii) are there ways in which photosensory functions of r-opsins could have played an ancient role in mechanoreception, even if this role might not be present any more in the investigated <italic>Drosophila</italic> mechanoreceptors?</p><p>In order to gain insight into these questions of r-opsin function, and into the evolution of sensory systems from an independent branch of animal evolution, we characterized <italic>r-opsin</italic>-expressing cells in a lophotrochozoan model system, the marine annelid <italic>Platynereis dumerilii</italic> that is amenable to functional genetic analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bannister et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bezares-Calderón et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Gühmann et al., 2015</xref>). After its pelagic larval stage, <italic>P. dumerilii</italic> inhabits benthic zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fischer and Dorresteijn, 2004</xref>). These are characterized by a complex light environment, making it likely that light sensory systems have been evolutionarily preserved in this model, rather than being secondarily reduced. In line with this, <italic>Platynereis</italic> has retained an evolutionarily representative set of <italic>r-opsins</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arendt et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Randel et al., 2013</xref>) and other photoreceptor genes. The <italic>Platynereis r-opsin1</italic> gene is not only expressed in EPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arendt et al., 2002</xref>), but also in peripheral cells along the trunk of the animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Backfisch et al., 2013</xref>) (cells referred to in this study as trunk <italic>r-opsin1</italic> expressing [TRE] cells), making the worm an attractive species for a comparative assessment of r-opsin function between cephalic and non-cephalic cell types. While both EP and TRE cells express the <italic>gaq</italic> gene that encodes a G<sub>αq</sub> subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Backfisch et al., 2013</xref>), it has remained elusive whether the TRE cells represent a segmental repetition of the EP cell type along the body plan or represent a distinct sensory modality. Likewise, it is unclear whether r-Opsin1 in TRE cells has a light sensory role, as in the EPs, or serves a light-independent function, as has been suggested for <italic>Drosophila</italic> JO or ChO neurons.</p><p>Here, we established a dissociation and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) protocol for the <italic>Platynereis</italic> pMos{rops::egfp}<sup>vbci2</sup> strain that expresses enhanced GFP (EGFP) under the regulatory control of the <italic>Platynereis r-opsin1</italic> gene in both EP and TRE cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Backfisch et al., 2013</xref>). Molecular profiling of both EP and TRE cells revealed that TRE cells, but not EP cells, possess a mechanosensory signature.

Targeted mutagenesis of the endogenous <italic>r-opsin1</italic> locus and an experimental characterization of the r-Opsin1 action spectrum allowed us to uncover that, specifically in the TRE cells, light – mediated by r-Opsin1 – adjusts the expression level of a plasma membrane calcium transporter relevant for auditory mechanosensation in vertebrates. Our data, therefore, suggest that TRE cells represent a distinct mechanoreceptive cell type, in which r-Opsin1, in difference to the current <italic>Drosophila</italic>-based paradigms, elicits light-dependent functional changes. In line with this, a newly established deep-learning-based approach revealed light-dependent behavioral differences between wildtype and <italic>r-opsin1</italic> mutant trunks.

In order to compensate for this lack of functional information, we also performed a comparison with mouse, where the largest number of genes involved in mechanosensation is known. We systematically determined putative <italic>P. dumerilii</italic> homologs of all mouse genes assigned to the gene ontology (GO) category ‘sensory perception of mechanical stimulus’ (GO:0050954), and then assessed their overlap with EP- or TRE-expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F, G</xref>).

We thus assessed expression of selected mechanical transducing molecules in posterior regenerates, considering that expression levels might be higher in developing cells that rapidly reform.</p><p>We first identified, from available transcript sequences, <italic>Platynereis</italic> orthologs of the four main gene families previously shown to function as mechanical transducing molecules in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fritzsch et al., 2020</xref>), omitting the class of MscS-like factors so far only implicated as animal mechanical transducing molecules in the cnidarian <italic>Nematostella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fritzsch et al., 2020</xref>). Besides Pkd2.1 – previously shown to function as a mechanical transducing molecule in <italic>Platynereis</italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bezares-Calderón et al., 2018</xref>) – our analysis included <italic>Platynereis</italic> orthologs of the TRP<italic>-</italic>family member NOMPC (Pdu-NOMPC; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), the PIEZO-family (Pdu-Piezo; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and of the TMC-family (Pdu-TMC1/2/3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Except for TMC1/2/3, the presence of the respective coding sequences in posterior regenerates was validated by cloning. To assess (co-) expression of the validated genes in the regenerate, we adapted the new technique of in situ hybridization chain reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Choi et al., 2018</xref>) that has already been successfully used on <italic>Platynereis</italic> germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kuehn et al., 2021</xref>). To benchmark the procedure for regenerates, we performed a side-by-side detection of <italic>Platynereis r-opsin1</italic> by conventional in situ hybridization and in situ HCR in regenerates. This confirmed the reliability of the technique (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). We next analyzed the staining of <italic>Pdu-nompc, Pdu-piezo,</italic> and <italic>Pdu-pkd2.1</italic> via in situ HCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). Whereas the negative control was devoid of staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A, E</xref>), all three genes showed cellular staining in the regenerate, with <italic>Pdu-nompc</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4B, F</xref>) and <italic>Pdu-pkd2.1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4D, H</xref>) being much more restricted than <italic>Pdu-piezo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4C, G</xref>). <italic>Pdu-piezo</italic> showed an almost ubiquitous expression, with some cells exhibiting slightly stronger staining than others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4C, G</xref>). Although this gene therefore likely co-expressed with <italic>Pdu-r-opsin1</italic>, we reasoned that it did not add much to a specific cell-type signature, and hence did not proceed with a more detailed analysis. Instead, we focused on co-expression analyses of <italic>r-opsin1</italic> and <italic>nompc</italic>, as well as of <italic>r-</italic>opsin1 and <italic>pkd2.1</italic>, respectively. The negative control for the HCR amplifiers showed no detectable staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–F</xref>). By contrast, both <italic>Pdu-nompc</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–L</xref>) and <italic>Pdu-pkd2.1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M–R</xref>) co-expressed with <italic>Pdu-r-opsin1</italic> in individual TRE cells (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–I, M–O</xref>). In both cases, we also detected cells that do not co-express <italic>Pdu-r-opsin1</italic>, indicative of a diversity of putative mechanosensory cells in <italic>Platynereis</italic> trunks.

We therefore set out to test the impact of changed light conditions as well as different genotypes on worm behavior. Classical studies have provided evidence for the existence of several classes of mechanosensory cells in parapodia of annelids. These include stretch-sensitive flap receptors, bristle receptors, and acicular receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dorsett, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Horridge, 1963</xref>). A plausible function of these receptors is to fine-tune motor patterns associated with directional (crawling) or stationary (undulation) movements that require coordinated activity by individual segments.</p><p>In a first experiment to assess the possible requirement of <italic>r-opsin1</italic> for coordinated segmental movements, we assessed the crawling movement exhibited by decapitated trunks when stimulated by a focal bright light stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Backfisch et al., 2013</xref>). Trans-heterozygous <italic>r-opsin1<sup>Δ1/Δ17</sup></italic> individuals clearly responded to such stimuli, but exhibited a significantly reduced net distance when compared to wild-type animals (p=0.02; Wilcoxon rank-sum test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Whereas this result is consistent with the notion that r-Opsin1 is involved in the correct execution of motor movements, the experiment does not discriminate between r-Opsin1 triggering the response and/or modulating its motor execution.</p><p>We therefore decided to investigate a very regularly performed behavior that does not require light as a stimulus. Annelids from the <italic>Platynereis</italic> genus exhibit a stereotypical undulatory behavior that is thought to increase water flow and oxygenation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schneider et al., 1992</xref>). The presence of this behavior in <italic>P. dumerilii</italic> is seemingly independent of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zantke et al., 2013</xref>) and requires a tight coordination between segments. Thus, we reasoned that if r-Opsin1 in the segmentally arranged TRE cells plays a role in the modulation of motor movements, this behavior presents a good test. We recorded the movement of <italic>r-opsin1</italic> mutant and wild-type trunks of de-capitated worms for five consecutive days using a previously established infrared video system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Veedin Rajan et al., 2021</xref>). Concerning visible light conditions, during the first 1.5 days, recorded worms were kept under a light/dark (LD) regime of 16:8 hr, followed by constant darkness (DD, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). We then established a deep-learning-based quantitative behavioral approach to analyze the resulting movies. We trained a neural network to detect seven different body positions: <italic>jaws, body1-body5</italic>, <italic>tail</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A</xref>) across the total length of each movie.

This automated analytical setup was benchmarked against human observations of a portion of the movies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B, C</xref>). It allowed us to systematically determine the ratio of time that specimens spent undulating compared to the overall time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F, G</xref>). In turn, this permitted us to compare both the effect of <italic>r-opsin1</italic> mutation (red graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F, G</xref>) to wild-types (black graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F, G</xref>) and the effect of illumination (day, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>) compared to darkness (subjective day, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>) in equivalent windows of circadian time (CT).</p><p>Analyses on a total of 64 trunks revealed that wild-type (black graphs) exhibited a light-dependent modulation of the undulatory movements, which were higher during darkness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F–H</xref>).

Here, we uncover a serially repeated cell type in the bristleworm trunk that combines r-opsin-dependent photoreception with mechanoreceptive properties. The discovery of this likely multimodal cell type not only represents an interesting example of cellular signal integration, but – as outlined below – also provides fresh thoughts for possible concepts on photo- and mechanosensory cell-type evolution in animals.</p><p>Whereas small evolutionary steps can occasionally be experimentally validated, reconstructing evolution across large time scales – as relevant for inferring cell-type evolution since the last common ancestor of vertebrates, flies, and polychaetes – can only be argued based on parsimony. However, which specific scenario in any given case is more parsimonious can be debatable, even among evolutionary biologists.</p><p>We thus acknowledge that, even though the statistics of our homology assessments clearly demonstrate that both the photo- and mechanosensory signatures of TRE cells are unlikely to be caused by chance, it remains possible that such a coupling occurred only later in evolution, by co-option of one of these sensory modalities in a cell of the other modality. In such a scenario, the apparent molecular parallels between bristleworm TRE cells, fruitfly JO cells, and zebrafish lateral line neuromasts would then reflect convergent evolution in different branches of animals.</p><p>On the other hand, the idea that early animals already possessed complex multifunctional cell types, which later diversified into distinct cells with more restricted and specialized functions, is not unusual for cell-type evolution. Cell types that might reflect such complex ancient states include, for example, the central spinal fluid-contacting neurons of vertebrates that combine sensory processes and hormone/neuropeptide secretion, thereby providing a model for a minimal unit from which multicellular sensory-neurosecretory circuits might have evolved (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arendt, 2008</xref>). Likewise, the eye cells of cnidarian planula larvae have been pointed out as a model of how pigment shading and light reception could have co-existed in a single cell, before cell-type diversification separated photoreceptors from distinct pigment cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arendt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nordström et al., 2003</xref>). An implicit argument in this view of functional segregation of cell types is that it is easier for evolution to take complex cellular functions apart, or eliminate subfunctions by genetic loss, than to generate complex cell types anew. Likewise, where such functional segregation was accompanied/enabled by the duplication of genes, the resulting homologs may well reflect diverse and specialized functions, while non-duplicated correlates of these genes would be more multifunctional.</p><p>In the case of <italic>Platynereis</italic> TRE cells, one plausible explanation for the co-occurrence of mechano- and photosensory features is that such multi-sensory cell type arose early in bilaterian animal evolution. This would predict that molecular similarities are likely to still exist between photoreceptive and mechanoreceptive cells in animals, even if those cell types are nowadays typically distinct.</p><p>Indeed, such similarities were previously already noted for shared specification factors such as <italic>atonal/Atonal2/5</italic> and <italic>pou4f3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Fritzsch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fritzsch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Piatigorsky and Kozmik, 2004</xref>). Moreover, in line with a model of secondary cell-type diversification, several of the involved distinct regulators arose by gene duplication, such the Pax genes <italic>pax6/ey</italic> – primarily associated with EPs– and <italic>pax2/5/8/spa</italic> – primarily associated with mechanoreceptive cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fritzsch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Niwa et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Piatigorsky and Kozmik, 2004</xref>), albeit this pattern is not fully consistent across bilaterian phylogeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dobiášovská, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schlosser, 2018</xref>).</p><p>In accordance with this notion, development of the worm’s TRE cells, found here to exhibit a mechanosensory signature, has been linked to <italic>brn3/pou4f3</italic> and <italic>pax2/5/8</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Backfisch et al., 2013</xref>).

Further, cnidarian PaxB, a transcription factor that combines features of both Pax6/Ey and Pax2/5/8/Spa, has been shown to be involved in the formation of the rhopalia in the Cubozoan jellyfish <italic>Tripedalia cystophora</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Piatigorsky and Kozmik, 2004</xref>). The rhopalia are sensory structures that combine photo- and mechanosensory functions.</p><p>Our hypothesis of the existence of a photo-mechanosensory cell type that predates the split of deuterostomes and protostomes would not only help to explain the close molecular relationships between mechanosensory cells of the lateral line and ear and photosensory cell types present during vertebrate development (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schlosser, 2018</xref>), but also the uncovered genetic links between ear- and eye defects revealed in human conditions such as the Usher syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cosgrove and Zallocchi, 2014</xref>), which, without such an evolutionary context, are rather enigmatic.</p><p>In contrast to the rather canonical nature of photoreceptor cascades, different animal mechanosensory cells employ different mechanical transducing molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fritzsch et al., 2020</xref>). As we demonstrate, orthologs of all four main classes of animal mechanical transducing molecules are present in the worm. Three of these are co-expressed with <italic>r-opsin1</italic> in regenerating TRE cells. While <italic>piezo</italic> gene expression is present in most, if not all, (neuro)ectodermal cells of the trunk, including the TREs, <italic>nompc</italic> and <italic>pkd2.1</italic> expression is restricted to few cells. These results support the idea that TREs can indeed function as mechanoreceptive cells. Why different mechanical transducing molecules are co-expressed with <italic>r-opsin1</italic> is not clear. This might indicate heterogeneity among TRE cells. Alternatively, parallel expression of such genes might represent a transient expression feature during regeneration, possibly indicative of cells in the process of specialization. It should be noted, however, that even a transient expression can be evolutionarily meaningful. An example for this is the transient presence of serotonin in substance P-positive neurons in the developing mouse hypothalamus. Whereas such expression does not persist to adulthood in mammals, hypothalamic serotonergic neurons are well-conserved in lower vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tessmar-Raible, 2007</xref>). Future work will be required to further disentangle the diversity of <italic>Platynereis</italic> TRE cells.</p><p>Beyond these aspects of cell-type evolution, our results also help to inform the functional evolution of Opsin proteins. The observation that rhabdomeric opsins appear to serve light-independent structural roles in the fly’s mechanosensory cells of the JO and ChO has led to the suggestion that such light-independent, cell-mechanical roles are the ancestral function of animal r-opsins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Katana et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zanini et al., 2018</xref>), which contrasts with our hypothesis. We would argue, however, that r-opsins only constitute one of nine opsin families that already existed at the dawn of bilaterian evolution, and light sensitivity is a common feature of its extant members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ramirez et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the evolutionary hypothesis of an ancestral primary non-light sensory function of one bilaterian subgroup either implies that light sensitivity evolved independently in distinct opsin groups or that r-opsins would have undergone a loss of light sensitivity prior to evolving this feature again. A more plausible explanation is that light sensitivity is an ancient feature of r-opsins, and that the close association of r-opsins and certain mechanosensors reflects an ancestral role of light in such cells.</p><p>Indeed, our data are consistent with a concept in which opsins endow mechanoreceptors with the ability to tune their responses in response to environmental light conditions, on at least two levels: a first level are light- and <italic>r-opsin1-</italic>dependent changes in transcript levels of <italic>atp2b/c7424</italic>. As ATP2B2 is an ion transport ATPase, which removes Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the cytoplasm, different expression levels of this enzyme can impact on the time after which a neuron will return to its resting state. Thereby, changing <italic>atp2b</italic> levels likely modulates signal transduction and/or refractory period of cells, resulting in overall changes in receptor sensitivity. This model is consistent with both the relevance of <italic>r-opsin1</italic> for tuning the undulatory behavior of trunks to ambient light conditions in the bristleworm and the differential effects of different genetic dosages of <italic>atp2b2</italic> (homozygous vs. heterozygous state) in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kozel et al., 2002</xref>). While we have not directly assessed the speed by which <italic>atp2b/c7424</italic> transcript levels are modulated, such changes would be expected to take place on the scale of minutes to hours, thus providing a slow adjustment of signaling potential.</p><p>A second mechanism by which r-opsins could modulate mechanosensation more acutely is provided by the photomechanical response that was uncovered by the study of <italic>Drosophila</italic> EP function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hardie and Franze, 2012</xref>). Specifically, this model proposes that opsin-induced, phospholipase C-mediated PIP<sub>2</sub> cleavage results in a fast-propagating change in photoreceptor bilayer curvature that then triggers stretch-sensitive TRP-C channels. Thereby, photon absorption (light reception) is effectively translated into a local stretch signal as it is at the core of various mechanosensory cell types. Given that this mechanism seems to account for a canonical photoreceptive function of r-opsin in EP cells, the conservation of <italic>r-opsin</italic> expression along with the respective signaling machinery suggests that opsin activation in mechanoreceptive cells may well acutely tune the membrane curvature and thus the ability of stretch receptors to be activated.</p><p>From an ecological perspective, a light-modulatory function could effectively serve to adjust mechanosensory functions in species exposed to varying light conditions, allowing them to tune mechanoreceptive responses to ambient light. Whereas our functional results are restricted to the bristleworm model, we reason that a modulatory function as proposed here might plausibly also reflect the functionality of an ancestral ‘protosensory’ cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Niwa et al., 2004</xref>), which could subsequently have been subfunctionalized into dedicated light sensory and mechanoreceptive cell types. From this perspective, the absence of apparent light sensitivity in <italic>Drosophila</italic> JO or ChO neurons likely represents secondary evolutionary processes rather than ancestral conditions. Likewise, similar principles might apply to the apparent light-independent functions of r-opsins in chemosensory cells suggested by recent experiments in the fruitfly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Leung et al., 2020</xref>) as chemosensory cells were also noted to share molecular signature with r-opsin light sensors before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fritzsch, 2005</xref>). Furthermore, we note that in specific neurons of the cnidarian <italic>Hydra magnipapillata</italic>, the signaling pathway downstream of a distinct opsin class (Cnidops) has been suggested to modulate the discharge of neighboring cnidocytes, a complex cell type also exhibiting sensory functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Plachetzki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Plachetzki et al., 2010</xref>). It remains unclear if this link reflects parallel evolution or, alternatively, an even more ancient link between opsins and mechanosensory cells. In either setting, however, this finding strengthens the notion that light modulation of animal mechanosensation is a fundamental principle.</p><p>Finally, our study also advances technology establishment for a ‘non-conventional model system’ at multiples levels. First, the FACS-based protocol for cell-type profiling employed here will be useful in the context of other non-conventional marine model organisms. Second, we extend the use of in situ HCR as a sensitive tool for RNA detection in the bristleworm. Third, we anticipate that the automatic analyses of behavioral types by deep-learning-based software tools will provide new opportunities to identify and quantify behavioral paradigms under different environmental and genetic conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal culture and handling</title><p>All animal research and husbandry was conducted according to the Austrian and European guidelines for animal research (fish maintenance and care approved under BMWFW-66.006/0012-WF/II/3b/2014, experiments approved under BMWFW-66.006/0003-WF/V/3b/2016, which is cross-checked by Geschäftsstelle der Kommission für Tierversuchsangelegenheiten gemäß § 36 TVG 2012 p.

Cells were then incubated with 10 µM coelenterazine (for Gαq) or 0.1 M luciferin (for Gαs or Gαi/o, respectively) in the dark for 2 hr and were subsequently exposed to a 2 s (for Gαq and Gαi/o) or 30 s (for Gαs) pulse of white light. The white light pulse was generated by an Arc lamp, spectrum in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>. Raw luminescence was measured from each single well on a Fluostar Optima plate reader (BMG Labtech, Germany). While the well under recording was exposed to the light pulse, all other wells were protected from light with a black sheet. To assess activation of Gαq signaling, luminescence was measured with a resolution of 0.5 s and cycle of 2 s. To assess activation of Gαs signaling, increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels was assessed by measuring luminescence with a resolution of 1 s and cycle of 30 s. To assess activation of Gαi/o signaling, cells were treated with 2 µM Forskolin (Sigma-Aldrich) prior to the light pulse, and decrease in cAMP levels was assessed by measuring luminescence with a resolution of 1 s and cycle of 30 s. The time between the light exposure to the well and the recording of raw luminescence measurements was approximately 3 s. Measurements taken during the dark incubation preceding the light pulse were used as baseline.

For the retained individuals, any missing XY values were inferred linearly from nonmissing data. To identify undulation, power spectral density was estimated on 10 s intervals for the position of each body point excluding the jaw and the tail by means of a periodogram. For every point, the dominant frequency within the given time window was determined. A movement was defined as undulation if any of the five body points showed a total movement of 0.5–10 pixels and had a dominant frequency within a range of 0.5–1.5 Hz.

The work examines the transcriptome of opsin-positive cells in a marine annelid and analyzes their behavior. It suggests that these receptors show signatures of both photo- and mechanosensation. This work adds to a growing and surprising realization that single cell types in many different animals may have multi-sensory functionality and this leads to speculation about the evolution of these cell types.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your very interesting article &quot;Analyses of cephalic and non-cephalic sensory cell types provide insight into joint photo- and mechanoreceptor evolution&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 4 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Todd Oakley (Reviewer #1); Gerhard Schlosser (Reviewer #4).</p><p>The reviewers had a very lively discussion with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers found the paper to be potentially of significant interest. However the discussion among reviewers led to two conclusions that must absolutely be addressed before the paper can be considered for <italic>eLife</italic>:</p><p>– The first one might be difficult to address: It concerns your argument that the sensory receptors that you describe are also mechanosensory. The reviewers are not convinced by your arguments that are based on the expression of genes that are found in mechanoreceptors. However, the reviewers argue that most (all?) of these genes are also found in other receptors, and in particular in photoreceptors, for instance Glass. Therefore, you absolutely need to provide functional, anatomical or molecular demonstration that these receptors are mechanoreceptors.</p><p>We suggest that one of the following unambiguous arguments must be presented:</p><p>1) Cell responds to mechanosensory stimulation (e.g., by ephys or calcium imaging).</p><p>2) Cell (and possibly associated cells) exhibit one of the highly characteristic morphologies associated with known mechanosensors.</p><p>3) Cell expresses known mechanotransducers like Piezos or NompC.</p><p>4) Cell mediates behavioral response to mechanosensory stimulation although this would be weaker and indirect evidence.</p><p>– The second is the evolutionary argument that must be seriously dimmed and alternative views must be presented as again, there are other possibilities than the one you present.</p><p>If you were able to answer the first point (I am sure that you can revise the text to address the second one) we will be able to consider the paper for <italic>eLife.Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Recommendations for authors. My main recommendation is to be more balanced in the evolutionary interpretations. The authors do explain in quite a bit of detail the possibility of an ancestral hybrid cell type. But they seem to almost be assuming that, rather than discussing any alternative. I do believe that a strong alternative is multiple co-option events that merge phototransduction and mechanosensation multiple times during bilaterian evolution. In cell type evolution, this has been called &quot;fusion&quot;. I do not mean to imply I think the authors are wrong in suggesting ancestral multi-functionality. They may well be correct. However, I suspect that going through all the logic in detail would indicate that a similarly convincing case could be made for separate fusion of sensory modalities in flies, annelids, and fish – and perhaps in a case not mentioned here of r-opsin expressed in presumptive mechanoreceptors of Octopus skin.

That is because broader conclusions about the roles of r-Opsins outside the visual system are difficult to draw from the data presented, as the data lack detailed functional, physiological or anatomical analysis of the TREs. Broad conclusions about the properties of a protosensory cell are not particularly informed by the data either, given the limited evolutionary scope of the comparisons made.</p><p>In terms of suggestions, it would be suggested that the authors present their data for what they are (transcriptomes of r-opsin expressing cells from the marine worm, evidence that the r-ospin is a photosensor and that light alters undulation of a headless worm) and limit the speculations about function and evolution.</p><p>Another suggestion is that the authors need to be more sophisticated in interpreting what the patterns of gene expression they observe might mean. For example, the authors cite the expression of Glass as being indicative of &quot;a mechanosensory signature&quot;. But Glass is also a widely studied transcription factor important for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> photosystem, so it makes sense it would be co-expressed with an opsin.

For instance, if a majority of these genes were single-copy between mice and Platyneris then this would suggest that the light-dependent mechanosensory hypothesis is correct. But, if a majority of these genes are members of gene family members who are turning over, then the interpretation of independent recruitment for a more derived function cannot be overruled. The authors seem to acknowledge the strength of this independent line of evidence when they mention orthology of transcription factors involved in producing TRE cells/JO neurons and IEH cells in line 300-308.</p><p>9. General comment of Figure 3 and Methods 933-953: GO terms and top blast hits are fine for summary figures but in general, when we are talking about comparisons between animals that are this distantly related (Platyneris and <italic>Drosophila</italic> or Platyneris and Danio) I would like to see phylogenetic trees for the 12 (or more) gene families of interest. This is because over evolutionary time, one gene family member may very well be swopped for another and since the authors are making a case that an ancient light-sensitive function of opsin was tied to mechanosensation, these trees need to be shown. As an example: in Figure 5 figure supplement 1A it appears that there are six <italic>Danio rerio</italic> genes that are homologues of the Platyneris Atp2b2 gene but only the function of DrAtp2b2 is mentioned in the manuscript. Are all of these genes in Danio involved in mechanosensation?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– 103 ff: I think the wording here unnecessarily conflates sensory functions and cell types.

However the discussion among reviewers led to two conclusions that must absolutely be addressed before the paper can be considered for eLife:</p><p>– The first one might be difficult to address: It concerns your argument that the sensory receptors that you describe are also mechanosensory. The reviewers are not convinced by your arguments that are based on the expression of genes that are found in mechanoreceptors. However, the reviewers argue that most (all?) of these genes are also found in other receptors, and in particular in photoreceptors, for instance Glass. Therefore, you absolutely need to provide functional, anatomical or molecular demonstration that these receptors are mechanoreceptors.</p><p>We suggest that one of the following unambiguous arguments must be presented:</p><p>1) Cell responds to mechanosensory stimulation (e.g., by ephys or calcium imaging).</p><p>2) Cell (and possibly associated cells) exhibit one of the highly characteristic morphologies associated with known mechanosensors.</p><p>3) Cell expresses known mechanotransducers like Piezos or NompC.</p><p>4) Cell mediates behavioral response to mechanosensory stimulation although this would be weaker and indirect evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>Upon this request, we screened for the orthologs of all four main types of mechanical transducing factors identified in animals, i.e. NompC, Piezo, TMC1/2/3 and Pkd. Of those, members of the Pkd family had already previously been identified in <italic>Platynereis</italic> and shown to be required for mechanosensation in the <italic>Platynereis</italic> larval head (Bezares-Calderón LA et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2018;7:e36262 doi: 10.7554/<italic>eLife</italic>.36262), at a stage when <italic>r-opsin1</italic> is not yet expressed in the periphery. In short, one member, <italic>pkd2.1</italic> caught our specific attention, because of its already existing peripheral expression, and we selected it for detailed investigation. We also identified orthologs for all the other mentioned genes. The phylogenetic trees are included as Supplementary Figures to Figure 4.</p><p>We next reasoned that if our hypothesis of a shared mechano-photosensory cell type is correct, the transcript levels of any mechanical transducing factor in these cells must be low, as we did not detect it by unbiased sequencing. Such low levels are not uncommon for mechanical transducing molecules (see text). We thus decided to investigate the expression in trunk regenerates and with a technique (in situ hybridization chain reaction (HCR)) that is more sensitive than the conventional whole mount in situ hybridization. As HCR in situ hybridization is relatively new for <italic>Platynereis</italic> (at present only a single bioRxiv manuscript exists, describing the usage of this technique on germ cells), we also performed appropriate controls to validate the specificity of the technique. We only included the essential controls in the manuscript for the sake of streamlining, but performed many more.</p><p>The combination of regenerates and HCR in situ hybridization then clearly showed that at least two mechanical transducing factors, <italic>pkd2.1</italic> and <italic>nompc</italic>, are highly specifically co-expressed with <italic>r-opsin1</italic> in TRE cells. We think that this is very strong support for our hypothesis of a combined mechano/photosensory nature of the TRE cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The second is the evolutionary argument that must be seriously dimmed and alternative views must be presented as again, there are other possibilities than the one you present.</p></disp-quote><p>We carefully considered our colleagues’ comments on this aspect and adapted our text accordingly. Besides a less strong phrasing across the manuscript, we now start the discussion specifically with a paragraph that explicitly acknowledges the possibility of convergent evolution. We also addressed additional points raised by the individual reviewers, see below. We think that this now presents a well-balanced presentation of our hypothesis and the discussions in the evo-devo field.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If you were able to answer the first point (I am sure that you can revise the text to address the second one) we will be able to consider the paper for eLife.</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>My main recommendation is to be more balanced in the evolutionary interpretations. The authors do explain in quite a bit of detail the possibility of an ancestral hybrid cell type. But they seem to almost be assuming that, rather than discussing any alternative. I do believe that a strong alternative is multiple co-option events that merge phototransduction and mechanosensation multiple times during bilaterian evolution. In cell type evolution, this has been called &quot;fusion&quot;. I do not mean to imply I think the authors are wrong in suggesting ancestral multi-functionality. They may well be correct. However, I suspect that going through all the logic in detail would indicate that a similarly convincing case could be made for separate fusion of sensory modalities in flies, annelids, and fish – and perhaps in a case not mentioned here of r-opsin expressed in presumptive mechanoreceptors of Octopus skin. In any event, even if the authors conclude that multiple co-option/fusion events is less logical; I think the manuscript would be stronger in considering alternatives more explicitly.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this aspect out to us. In response to the comment, we carefully revised the discussion, and now start it with a paragraph that more explicitly discusses alternatives to the idea of an ancient cell type. This also allows us to refer more explicitly to other cases of early multifunctional cell types. Together, this should orient the reader better in the field of cell type evolution and allow a more balanced view.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The transcriptomes generated are of likely to be of interest to those working on sensory biology in marine annelids, but of limited interest to the broader community.

In the editorial letter, this request was picked up with a specific set of possible experiments that could provide such additional evidence. In compliance with this list, we now added the clear co-expression of <italic>nompc</italic> and <italic>pkd2.1</italic> with <italic>r-opsin1</italic> to the manuscript. Given that <italic>pkd2.1</italic> has been demonstrated to function as a mechanical transducing factor in larval worms, these data present very strong support for our hypothesis of a dual mechano-/photosensory nature of the TRE cells.</p><p>As to the insinuation that we did not read well enough about the functions of the cited genes and only regarded GO-term annotations, the reviewer probably misunderstood our use of the GO-term annotations in the study. We are well aware that hardly any gene has a single biological function. Nonetheless, the involvement in mechanotransduction or mechanosensory cell specification is a specific function assigned to a limited set of genes. Therefore, the significant enrichment for this function in genes matching the specific transcriptome of TRE cells must be interpreted as meaningful, even if the respective genes have additional functions. For the very reason, we also performed analogous comparisons using gene sets for different sensory functions, which did not turn up significant matches (see Figure 3 H, I). To put more emphasis on the statistical assessment, we have now mentioned it in the beginning of the revised discussion. Moreover, the identification of mechanical transducing factors specifically expressed in the TREs (see first part of the comment) now provides independent and specific evidence for the mechanosensory functionality of TRE cells, going beyond the GO term analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>There is really an impressive amount of innovative and careful work in this paper.

In light of this, we decided to focus on the explicitly requested tasks. Furthermore, there are two aspects we would also ask to consider:</p><p>– Phylogenetic trees are included for several key molecules, like for the newly added mechanical transducing molecules.</p><p>– One of the evolutionary consequences of vertebrate whole genome duplications are subfunctionalisations among the gene duplicates. Evidences of such subfunctionalisations exist multifold (e.g. pax2/5/8 versus its respective pax2, pax5, pax8 orthologs in vertebrates). In such scenarios, even individual matches of gene functions in one-to-many orthology relationships are evolutionarily meaningful.</p><p>Especially on gene level, we consider evolutionary loss (e.g. via the mentioned subfunctionalisation) more parsimonious than de novo gain, as in principle a single mutation is sufficient to destroy the function of a gene, but likely more changes are required to gain a new function.</p><p>In any case, we would like to argue that our statistical analyses of enrichment, including tests of other sensory categories, control for biases. Only ‘mechanical stimulation” and “sound” showed statistical significant enrichments for worm versus mouse functionally meaningful orthologs expressed in TRE cells versus mouse mechanoreceptors. If the functional similarities between one-to-many orthologs were just by chance there should not be a higher-than-chance enrichment detectable. We have inserted a brief note on this statistical enrichment at the beginning of the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– 103 ff: I think the wording here unnecessarily conflates sensory functions and cell types.

Also, we noticed that the eGFP fluorescence of the construct – while faithfully reproducing the spatial expression- is slightly delayed in regenerating worm tails, compared to the moment when the first <italic>r-opsin1</italic> transcripts become visible by whole mount in situ hybridization. This suggests that while the enhancer is pretty complete, it is slightly delayed in its temporal dynamics.
