disease with a poor prognosis and frequent lymphatic metastases. Nevertheless, reliable biomarkers for EC diagnosis are currently unavailable. Accordingly, we have performed a comparative proteomics analysis on cancer and paracancer tissue-derived exosomes from eight pairs of EC patients using label-free quantification proteomics profiling and have analyzed the differentially expressed proteins through bioinformatics. Furthermore, nano-flow cytometry (NanoFCM) was used to validate the candidate proteins from plasma-derived exosomes in 122 EC patients. Of the 803 differentially expressed proteins discovered in cancer and paracancer tissue-derived exosomes, 686 were up-regulated and 117 were down-regulated. Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (CD54) was identified as an up-regulated candidate for further investigation, and its high expression in cancer tissues of EC patients was validated using immunohistochemistry, real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), and western blot analyses. In addition, plasma-derived exosome NanoFCM data from 122 EC patients concurred with our proteomic analysis. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis demonstrated that the AUC, sensitivity, and specificity values for CD54 were 0.702, 66.13%, and 71.31%, respectively, for EC diagnosis. Small interference (si)RNA was employed to silence the CD54 gene in EC cells. A series of assays, including cell counting kit-8, adhesion, wound healing, and Matrigel invasion, were performed to investigate EC viability, adhesive, migratory, and invasive abilities, respectively. The results showed that CD54 promoted EC proliferation, migration, and invasion. Collectively, tissue-derived exosomal proteomics strongly demonstrates that CD54 is a promising biomarker for EC diagnosis and a key molecule for EC development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>esophageal cancer</kwd><kwd>exosomes</kwd><kwd>CD54</kwd><kwd>diagnosis</kwd><kwd>biomarkers</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010857</institution-id><institution>Jiangxi Provincial Department of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>No. GJJ2201445</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lai</surname><given-names>Zhonghong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Exosomal CD54 can be used as an effective biomarker for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and CD54 promotes the proliferation and migration of tumor cells in vitro.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Esophageal cancer (EC) is the seventh most prevalent malignancy and the sixth leading cause of cancer-related death globally, accounting for 509,000 deaths yearly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bray et al., 2018</xref>). Despite fast advances in medical technology, EC incidence is expected to rise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Napier et al., 2014</xref>). The 5-year survival rate for EC patients has seen very modest improvement over the last five decades. Specifically, it has increased from a mere 4% in the 1950s to 17% in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baiu and Backhus, 2020</xref>). The significance of early detection and immediate symptomatic intervention in enhancing EC survival rates necessitates developing a straightforward, effective, and non-invasive method for diagnosing the disease, consequently facilitating its screening process. Imaging techniques, tissue biopsies, and serum tumor markers, including carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA-199, are now the primary tools for identifying esophageal malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Siegel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kosugi et al., 2004</xref>). Despite their limited sensitivity in detecting small lesions, imaging techniques remain the prevailing method for cancer diagnosis and surveillance, posing challenges in the early detection of recurrent locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Becker et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, serum biomarkers, including CEA and squamous cell carcinoma antigen, have low sensitivity and specificity for early diagnosis or recurrence detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, more potent diagnostic markers for EC are urgently required to enhance diagnosis and non-invasive approaches.</p><p>Exosomes, which are small vesicles enclosed by a double membrane and measuring between 40 and 200 nm in diameter, were initially discovered in sheep reticulocytes by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Pan and Johnstone, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kalluri and LeBleu, 2020</xref>. These vesicles are produced through the endosomal pathway and are expelled into the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Latifkar et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Harding et al., 2013</xref>). Exosomes, extracellular vesicles, are produced by many cells, such as blood, immune, cancer, and stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kimiz-Gebologlu and Oncel, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wei et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Xu et al., 2022</xref>). These exosomes can be secreted into different physiological fluids, including blood, urine, breast milk, ascites, amniotic fluid, saliva, and cerebrospinal fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ha et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lässer et al., 2011</xref>). The tumor cell molecular markers are enriched in exosomes transferred between the tumor and normal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Attaran and Bissell, 2022</xref>). Protein expression in tumor patient-derived small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) differs significantly from healthy donors (HD). Accordingly, these differentially expressed sEVs proteins emerge as potential tumor diagnosis biomarkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Huang and Deng, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), also known as CD54, is a transmembrane glycoprotein in the immunoglobulin superfamily that is present in a wide range of cell types and is up-regulated in response to a variety of inflammatory mediators. Recent research on acute myeloid leukemia discovered a correlation between CD54 expression and other differentiation-related molecules (e.g., CD34 and HLA-DR) and a significant correlation to French-American-British Cooperative Group (FAB) morphological classification. Moreover, high CD54 expression was associated with germinal center lymphoma in lymphoproliferative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Maio and Del Vecchio, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). CD54 is also believed to play an important role in several malignancies. In breast, gastric, and colorectal cancers, increased CD54 expression in the cancer cells has been correlated with more favorable prognosis, suggesting a role of CD54 in enhancement of immune surveillance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ogawa et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fujihara et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Tachimori et al., 2005</xref>). Previous studies have shown that CD54 can predict the progression and metastasis of gastric cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gómez-Gallegos et al., 2023</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fang et al., 2016</xref> identified circulating tumor cells as a biomarker of treatment selection and liver metastasis in patients with colorectal cancer. However, exosomal CD54 has not been reported in EC.</p><p>Herein, the candidate molecule CD54 in EC tissue-derived exosomes was identified using proteomics and validated in plasma exosomes from 122 EC patients.

EC is a malignant tumor with a high propensity for metastasis and recurrence. It is commonly diagnosed at later stages, resulting in a poor prognosis. This is mostly due to the delayed onset of clinical symptoms and the absence of early biomarkers for the disease. When distant metastases are detected at the time of diagnosis, the overall 5-year survival rate of EC decreases to less than 5%, as opposed to the 18% survival rate observed in cases where distant metastases are absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jamel et al., 2019</xref>). Endoscopy is widely regarded as the preferred method for detecting and diagnosing BE and EC. However, it is important to note that this approach is not considered cost-effective, practical, or non-invasive for screening purposes. Therefore, it is imperative to implement screening measures that facilitate early detection and diagnosis to mitigate the death rate among EC patients.</p><p>Herein, of the eight pairs of EC and paracancer tissues exosomes collected for proteomic analysis, we discovered 803 differentially expressed proteins; 686 were up-regulated, and 117 were down-regulated. CD54, intracellular adhesion molecule-1, is an Ig superfamily surface receptor found in leukocytes, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">van de Stolpe, 1996</xref>); it is an adhesive and co-stimulatory molecule with five extracellular Ig-like domains. Proteomics indicated a substantial increase in CD54 expression in EC-derived exosomes. CD54 was identified as an up-regulated candidate for subsequent investigation. Immunohistochemistry, RT-qPCR, and western blot assessment of C54 expression in EC-derived exosomes yielded comparable results to proteomics. Moreover, NanoFCM evaluation of plasma-derived exosomes demonstrated higher CD54 expression in 122 EC patients than in HDs and increased with disease progression. Notably, low CD54 expression was detected in 12 tumor-resected patients. Further analysis of the relationship between plasma exosome CD54 levels and clinical characteristics of EC patients revealed that CD54 expression was independent of patient gender and age but was associated with tumor size, distant metastasis, smoking history, drinking history, and clinical stage. Evaluation of the diagnostic performance of exosomal CD54 in EC yielded the following results: sensitivity, 66.13%; specificity, 71.31; AUC value, 0.702. Nevertheless, the efficacy of CD54 in the early diagnosis of EC was insignificant. These specific characteristics of patient cohorts in different regions, sample sizes, and potential confounders affect diagnostic accuracy. Therefore, it is necessary to expand the sample size for further study. Additionally, we conducted a functional study of CD54 on EC cells, revealing that CD54 expression of TE-1 and KYSE-510 in EC cells was higher than that in normal HEEC. CD54 knocked down significantly reduced EC proliferation and migration. These results indicate that CD54 plays a key role in EC development.</p><p>Through proteomics, we discovered high CD54 expression in EC tissue-derived exosomes; this finding was subsequently validated using patient tissue samples and multiple plasma samples. The presented data indicate that exosomal CD54 holds promise as a potential diagnostic marker for EC. However, the sample size in this study was limited, and further investigation with a larger number of samples is necessary to establish the effectiveness of exosomal CD54 in EC diagnosing. Furthermore, experimental investigations on cellular function have demonstrated that CD54 plays a crucial part in EC development. This study offers a foundation for identifying novel targets for EC diagnosis and therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Sample collection</title><p>This study investigated EC patients in the First Affiliated Hospital of Gannan Medical College between February 2021 and July 2021.

The wound distance was quantified using ImageJ software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Cell migration assay</title><p>Cell migration assay was performed using 24-well transwell plates with 8 µm pore filters (FALCON) at 37°C for 24 hr following the manufacturer’s protocols. Briefly, 1×10<sup>5</sup> cells were suspended in 100 µL of serum-free medium and added to the upper chamber, and 600 µL DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS was loaded into the lower chamber. After 24 hr of incubation, the non-invaded cells in the top chamber were removed with a cotton swab, and the cells were fixed with 100% methanol for 20 min at room temperature and stained with 0.1% crystal violet (Solarbio Science &amp; Technology Co., Ltd.) for 30 min at room temperature. The stained cells were imaged under an inverted light microscope (Nikon; magnification, ×100) and analyzed using ImageJ software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>GraphPad Prism 8.0 software was employed for statistical analysis, and all quantitative data were presented as the mean±SE. The t-test was used for statistical analysis between the two groups while using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for multiple groups. Nano-flow scatter plot was processed using Flowjo 10.6.

biomarkers for esophageal cancer. The evidence supporting the conclusions is solid. However, there are a few areas in which the article may be improved through further analysis and validation of the clinical usefulness of CD54 as diagnostic biomarkers for esophageal cancer. The work will be of broad interest to clinicians, medical researchers and scientists working in esophageal cancer.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86209.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Yongliang</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00g2ypp58</institution-id><institution>Dalian University of Technology</institution></institution-wrap><country>China</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Tissue-derived exosome proteomics identifies promising diagnostic biomarkers for esophageal cancer&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.
