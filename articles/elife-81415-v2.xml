To date, only one domain of the extracellular region of the TSHR has been crystallized. We have run a 1000 ns molecular dynamic simulation on a model of the entire TSHR generated by merging the extracellular region of the receptor, obtained using artificial intelligence, with our recent homology model of the transmembrane domain, embedded it in a lipid membrane and solvated it with water and counterions. The simulations showed that the structure of the transmembrane and leucine-rich domains were remarkably constant while the linker region (LR), known more commonly as the ‘hinge region,’ showed significant flexibility, forming several transient secondary structural elements. Furthermore, the relative orientation of the leucine-rich domain with the rest of the receptor was also seen to be variable. These data suggest that this LR is an intrinsically disordered protein. Furthermore, preliminary data simulating the full TSHR model complexed with its ligand (TSH) showed that (a) there is a strong affinity between the LR and TSH ligand and (b) the association of the LR and the TSH ligand reduces the structural fluctuations in the LR. This full-length model illustrates the importance of the LR in responding to ligand binding and lays the foundation for studies of pathologic TSHR autoantibodies complexed with the TSHR to give further insight into their interaction with the flexible LR.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>TSHR</kwd><kwd>transmembrane domain</kwd><kwd>molecular dynamics</kwd><kwd>hinge region</kwd><kwd>linker region</kwd><kwd>TSH</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK069713</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davies</surname><given-names>Terry F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Veterans Administration merit award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BX000800</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davies</surname><given-names>Terry F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Segal Family Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>00000000</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davies</surname><given-names>Terry F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Molecular dynamics simulation of the full-length TSH receptor, a major human autoantigen whose full structure remains uncertain, showed that its linker region is an intrinsically disordered protein, explaining the difficulty of obtaining an experimental structure.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The TSH receptor (TSHR) on the surface of thyrocytes is an important regulator of thyroid growth, development, hormone synthesis, and secretion. It is also the primary target of autoantibodies in Graves’ disease (autoimmune hyperthyroidism; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davies et al., 2020</xref>). From cloning, sequence analysis, partial crystallization, and biochemical studies, this GPCR has been deduced to be made of a large ectodomain (ECD) and membrane-bound signal transducing transmembrane domain (TMD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rapoport et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Davies et al., 2005</xref>). The ECD is further divided into a leucine-rich domain (LRD) forming a curved structure which is linked to the TMD by a 130 amino acid (AA) linker region (LR) known commonly as the ‘hinge region’” (AA280-410). Unique to the TSHR is a large 50 AA cleavage region (AA316-366) located within the LR that is proteolytically degraded leaving a cleaved ECD thought to be tethered to the TMD via three cysteine bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tanaka et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tanaka et al., 2001</xref>) and sometimes referred to as the C peptide.</p><p>Stimulating TSHR antibodies only recognize the TSHR in its native form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Latif et al., 2012</xref>) indicating that the receptor-epitope must be in a conformation that the antibody can recognize. Crystallization studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sanders et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sanders et al., 2011</xref>), besides producing crystal structures for the LRD, have also shown that antibodies, which either stimulate or block TSHR signaling, only bind to the LRD when the receptor is conformationally correct and can compete for TSH binding. In contrast, ‘neutral’ antibodies to the TSHR which do not initiate a traditional signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morshed et al., 2018</xref>) nor inhibit TSH binding, predominantly, but not exclusively, bind to linear epitopes in the LR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sun, 2018</xref>). Although the partial LRD structure has been determined with x-ray crystallography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miller-Gallacher et al., 2019</xref>), no experimental structure has been found for the LR, and until recently, only partial models have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kleinau et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kleinau et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Morshed et al., 2009</xref>). On the basis of the immune response to the TSHR we, and others, have suggested that the LR is not an inert scaffold but rather an important ligand-specific structural and functional entity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schaarschmidt et al., 2014</xref>), but its structure has not been examined in the context of the full-length receptor. However, the recent success of the artificial intelligence (AI)-based Alphafold2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>) program led us to believe that it might be possible to generate a full-length receptor structure by combining the LRD-LR structure generated by Alphafold2 (that includes a structural model of the LR region but no TMD and for which neither experimental nor homology models are available) with our recently published model of the TSHR TMD (named TRIO; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mezei et al., 2021</xref>). Note, that Alphafold2 provided a separate model for the TMD and did not provide a fully assembled structure. Therefore, we decided to use our own model as it was already equilibrated in the membrane environment and partially based on experimental validation. This full-length model could then be enhanced and verified with molecular dynamics (MDs) simulation. We can now report a successful computer-based approach to obtain insight into the LR allowing us to complete a full-length model of the TSHR. We have examined the behavior of this TSHR in a lipid-embedded, electro-neutral, aqueous environment by MD simulation studies and showed that the LR is indeed an intrinsically disordered protein but can be stabilized by TSH ligand binding to the LRD.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Initial full-length TSHR model and its clashes</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows the structure of the full-length receptor that was obtained by combining the LRD-LR structure generated by the Alphafold2 AI system with the TMD structure from the TRIO model as detailed in Materials and methods section.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The initial model of the full-length TSH receptor (TSHR) (leucine-rich domain [LRD]: blue, linker region [LR:] red, and transmembrane domain [TMD]: yellow) derived from combination of the LRD and LR of the Alphafold2 program and the TMD of our earlier ‘TRIO’ model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mezei et al., 2021</xref>).</title><p>Helix 3 of the TMD is shown in purple.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-81415-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>However, this assembled full-length TSHR structure showed significant LR clashes with TSH ligand and with TSHR antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>).

The largest change was observed in helix 3 that became more curved, resulting in significant shortening (defined as the end-to-end distance).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Changes in helix length and radius.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Helix #</th><th align="left" valign="top">1</th><th align="left" valign="top"/><th align="left" valign="top">2</th><th align="left" valign="top"/><th align="left" valign="top">3</th><th align="left" valign="top"/><th align="left" valign="top">4</th><th align="left" valign="top"/><th align="left" valign="top">5</th><th align="left" valign="top"/><th align="left" valign="top">6.1</th><th align="left" valign="top"/><th align="left" valign="top">6.2</th><th align="left" valign="top"/><th align="left" valign="top">7.1</th><th align="left" valign="top"/><th align="left" valign="top">7.2</th><th align="left" valign="top"/><th align="left" valign="top">8</th><th align="left" valign="top"/></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Length:</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">–0.6</td><td align="left" valign="top">S</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">–1.3</td><td align="left" valign="top">S</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">–4.4</td><td align="left" valign="top">S</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">1.2</td><td align="left" valign="top">S</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.1</td><td align="left" valign="top">n</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.0</td><td align="left" valign="top">n</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.5</td><td align="left" valign="top">S</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.5</td><td align="left" valign="top">n</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">–1.4</td><td align="left" valign="top">S</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">–1.6</td><td align="left" valign="top">S</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Radius:</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">–0.5</td><td align="left" valign="top">S</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">–0.5</td><td align="left" valign="top">S</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">–3.7</td><td align="left" valign="top">S</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.4</td><td align="left" valign="top">n</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.2</td><td align="left" valign="top">n</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.0</td><td align="left" valign="top">n</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.2</td><td align="left" valign="top">S</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.5</td><td align="left" valign="top">S</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">–0.4</td><td align="left" valign="top">S</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">–0.4</td><td align="left" valign="top">S</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Changes in the distance between the helix centers and the change in the closest approach of the helix axes are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>.

The DSSP plot of the simulation is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>. The SSEs were remarkably more stable, indicating that the presence of TSH indeed stabilized the LR. The conformations of the complex at the start, middle, and end of the 1000 ns simulation are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>. It clearly shows that the LR is attached to the TSH at several places. The hydrogen-bond analysis analogous to the one shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> showed that there are seven residues which are hydrogen bonded to the α subunit of TSH and three LR residues hydrogen bonded to the β subunit, and there is even one LR residue that is hydrogen bonded to the LRD. It also shows that 6 of the 10 LR-TSH contacts were formed with the LR residues which are not part of the 50 AA cleaved segment. In addition, new contacts formed between the LR and the LRD with time.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>The conformations of the TSH receptor (TSHR)-TSH complex at the start, middle, and end of the simulation.</title><p>TSH is shown as spheres, the linker region (LR) backbone is red, and the leucine-rich domain (LRD) and transmembrane domain (TMD) are gray/blue.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-81415-fig10-v2.tif"/></fig><p>It should be noted that the large number of contacts between TSH and TSHR may look surprising since the FSH-FSH receptor (FSHR) crystal structure (PDB id 4ay9) showed few, if any, contacts. However, that structure lacks precisely the region of the LR that is seen to be in contact with the ligand in the case of the TSHR. Also, the sequence alignment of the LR of TSHR and FSHR shows only 39.3% sequence identity. Furthermore, the large conformational fluctuations displayed by the LR exclude the possibility that the LR-TSH contacts are due to the bias of the initial conformation.</p><p>On the other hand, the LR moved significantly away from the TMD (more at 500 ns than at 1000 ns) indicating that to be able to transmit the signal induced by binding of TSH the cysteine bonds have to be present in the LR. While such analyses remain preliminary and subject to more and possibly longer simulations, the structure-inducing effect of the TSH appears to be very clear.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The TSHR, similar to the FSH and LH/hCG receptors, consists of LRD, a large extracellular ligand binding domain incorporating 11 repeats, and a TMD, linked via a 130 AA LR. The TMD is made up of eight helices joined by extracellular and intracellular loops and a long C-terminal cytoplasmic tail. The TMD is embedded in a phospholipid bilayer and transduces a cascade of signals by engaging several different G proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Laugwitz et al., 1996</xref>) and β arrestins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boutin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Frenzel et al., 2006</xref>). The interest in the TSHR has been largely fueled by its role as a major human autoantigen in autoimmune thyroid disease, especially Graves’ disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davies et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Detailed mapping of binding sites and interaction partners for the TSHR ligand, TSH, and for stimulating and blocking monoclonal autoantibodies to the TSHR, have been revealed by homology modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Núñez Miguel et al., 2004</xref>) and crystallization of the partial ECD bound to these autoantibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sanders et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sanders et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, homology modeling has suggested possible mechanisms by which activation of the receptor by TSH and a stimulating antibody might occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kleinau and Krause, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Krause et al., 2012</xref>). However, all these tripartite models have remained incomplete due to the lack of a reasonable structure for the large TSHR LR/hinge region. Here, we present a full-length model of the TSHR which became possible because of the recent availability of models of the human proteome generated by the AI-based protein folding program Alphafold2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>). We combined the Aplhafold2-generated structure of the LRD-LR complex with our recent MD-refined homology model of the TSHR TMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mezei et al., 2021</xref>) and further refined the structure with MDs in a DPCC membrane environment. Given that the structures of the LRD and the TMD of the TSHR have been described in earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Latif et al., 2015</xref>), our analysis in this report was firstly focused on the structure of the LR, its intramolecular and molecular bonding dynamics, and its structural variations in lieu with LRD and TMD structures.</p><p>It is notable that in the initial structure obtained with our heuristic process by the combination of the two parts using the relative orientation of the LRD (residues 22–280) and the TMD (residues 409–694) resulted in a full-length receptor model that retained the relative orientation of the ECD and the TMD in spite of the large conformational fluctuation of the LR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and the large fluctuation on the angle between the LR and the LRD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) supporting the overall correctness of our initial model. Further support can be seen in the fact that the relative orientation of the ECD and the TMD allows the formation of TMD dimers in a conformation predicted and experimentally verified by our earlier work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Latif et al., 2015</xref>) and which would still leave the LRD-binding surface free for ligand or autoantibody binding. However, in the Alphafold2-predicted conformation presented here, the concave surface of the LRD where autoantibodies bind, is partly occluded by the LR and thus would clash with a bound TSHR antibody whose binding sites on the LRD are known (PDB id 3g04). This conundrum was resolved by the observations that (a) the structure of the LR cluster is highly flexible and (b) the relative orientation of the LRD with the rest of the structure is also highly variable resulting in a significant population of conformations where stimulating and blocking TSHR autoantibodies could access the receptor to activate or block signaling. Thus, we can say that the Alphafold2 structure of the LR, while useful in providing a starting point for the MD simulation, was not correct in the sense that it missed the large conformational freedom of the LR needed for ligand binding. Given the low reliability score assigned to the LR part of the Alphafold2 structure, this observation was not a surprise. We also submitted the LR sequence to the PONDR (Predictors of Natural Disordered Regions) server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pondr.com/">http://www.pondr.com/</ext-link>) – using the methods VLXT (the default), VL3 NNP, and VL2 NNP, and it predicted that 28.91%, 64.81, and 62.5%, respectively, of the LR is disordered. Furthermore, these conclusions could be further verified by obtaining, if possible, cryo electron microscopy (CEM) or a crystal structure of the native full-length TSHR perhaps stabilized by an autoantibody to the LR.</p><p>Based on this study, we can conclude that the LR in the TSHR is remarkably flexible, sampling vastly different overall conformations without settling on a well-defined tertiary structure. While different SSEs formed during the simulation (mostly helices), they were transient, as seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>. On the other hand, contacts between the LR and the LRD persisted throughout the simulation. The conclusion is that the LR is an IDP. This conclusion is consistent both with the fact that so far no one has succeeded in obtaining its crystal structure and with the suggestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>) that low reliability scores indicate that the protein is intrinsically disordered. However, from these studies, we speculate that the highly flexible nature of the LR is what allows it to accommodate both the ligand and the autoantibodies to the LRD.</p><p>The fact that the two pairs of cysteines stayed close with their putative partners for disulfide bonding indicated that these cysteines should form a disulfide bond. Furthermore, the fact that when the TSH was added to this model, these cysteines moved apart also suggested that they could be part of the signal-transduction mechanism.</p><p>The convergence of the simulation is always an open question. However, there are important indicators that suggest that our sampling was adequate. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, the history of hydrogen bonds involving the LR, showed that most of the bonds had formed during the first half of the simulation; no new ones formed in the last quarter. Hydrogen bonds also kept forming and reforming. Similarly, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> shows that most SSEs formed and broke several times during the simulation. Taken together, these indicators allow us to conclude that the simulation involved adequate sampling.</p><p>In addition to our examination of the LR structure, we compared the changes seen in the TMD helix bundle, from the respective reference structure in the TMD-only simulation, versus the full-length model. It was of great interest that the change in the curvature (and, as a consequence, in the end-to-end distance) of helix 3 was significantly greater in the new full-length model than in the TMD-only model. Comparing the range of values sampled in the representative structures (data not shown), we found similar differences. This observation supported the hypothesis put forward earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Davies and Latif, 2015</xref>) that helix 3 is highly important for the signal transduction of the TSHR and consistent with a variety of small molecule activators which all interact with helix 3 (not illustrated). We also examined the LR cysteines. Much has been discussed concerning the role of cysteine bonds in anchoring the LR to the LRD following post-receptor processing which involves cleavage of the unique 55 AA insert in the LR (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). The analysis of the cysteines in the LR showed the remarkable affinity of one pair to each other (C283-C398) and to a lesser degree for the second pair (C384-C408). However, the third pair (C301-C390) showed poor affinity, leading to the suggestion that in the fully formed TSHR, only two of the cysteine bonds were formed.</p><p>Recently, structures of the luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) in complex with different proteins and in its inactive state, a total of five structures, obtained by CEM have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Duan et al., 2021</xref>). In accordance with our simulation, the relative orientation of the LRD with the TMD was quite variable. The LR in the LHR, however, while significantly shorter than the LR in the TSHR, was missing more than 40 residues in the CEM structures, thus preventing detailed comparison with the TSHR LR. It is notable that the short helix at the N-terminal end of the LR was present in all five CEM structures and during the 1000 ns MD run described here. Also, the LR conformations in the CEM structures were very different from each other, reflecting the conformational variations observed during our TSHR MD run. Interestingly, our simulation of 1000 ns with the heterodimeric TSH showed stabilization of SSEs, which was clearly absent without TSH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), further suggesting that the LR plays an important part in TSH action and that TSH is able to stabilize the flexible LR region after transitioning through various dynamic structural changes. Furthermore, the separation of the LR and the TMD during the simulation suggests that for the proper action of the TSHR on binding of the TSH, then at least one cysteine bond has to be formed.</p><p>Our simulation of the full-length TSHR embedded in a lipid membrane, solvated with water-containing counterions, i.e., in a biologically relevant environment suggested (a) the LRD and the TMD continue to maintain their fold; (b) the LR is flexible, but maintains protein-like behavior forming secondary structure elements that are, however, transient; and (c) the relative orientation of the LRD is also variable. Both the orientation of the LRD and the structural flexibility of the LR suggests that these features are likely to be important for the TSHR to accommodate the diverse ligands such as TSH and autoantibodies that are known to bind to the extracellular region of TSHR.</p><p>Our preliminary results from a simulation of the TSHR complexed with its ligand TSH showed that TSH formed strong interactions with both the LRD and the LR. Furthermore, it appeared to increase the longevity of the secondary structure elements in the LR. In addition, the breakup of the LR-TMD interface points to the importance of the disulfide bonds in the LR.</p><p>In conclusion, we performed the first MDs simulation of the full-length TSHR that includes the characterization of a flexible LR and concluded that the LR is constitutively unstable in the native state of and receptor thus can be considered an IDP. The earlier generated models (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Núñez Miguel et al., 2004</xref>) only represented one conformation of the many LR structures as well as missing the 50 AA insert unique to the TSHR and also highlights the importance of considering conformational ensembles as the most accurate model of the LR. In addition, our preliminary results indicate that TSH is able to stabilize this disordered protein, which suggests that stabilization of the LR is important for signaling to ensue.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>AI model of the LRD and LR</title><p>The coordinates of the structure of the LRD and LR domains of the human TSHR, residues 24–408, were downloaded from the Swissprot database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bairoch and Apweiler, 2000</xref>); Uniprot #: P16473 and Swissprot file /P1/64/73.

First, the LRD-LR model was translated so that the C<sub>α</sub> of the LRD-LR cysteine is at the position of the TRIO cysteine’s C<sub>α</sub> position. As both models were already oriented along the membrane normal (the Z axis), the only degree of freedom left was rotation around the Z axis. In the next step, a scan by 45° steps selected the angle region that minimized the volume of the enclosing rectangle, followed by generating conformations in 5° steps and obtaining the list of contact distances between the LR and the TMD. Pairs of atoms, e.g., <italic>i<sub>A</sub></italic> of domain <italic>A</italic> and <italic>j<sub>B</sub></italic> of domain <italic>B</italic>, are defined to be in contact if they are mutually proximal. This means that atom <italic>i<sub>A</sub></italic> is the nearest atom in domain <italic>A</italic> to atom <italic>j<sub>B</sub></italic>, and atom <italic>j<sub>B</sub></italic> is the nearest atom in domain <italic>B</italic> to atom <italic>i<sub>A</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mezei and Zhou, 2010</xref>).

simulation of the full-length membrane-bound Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Receptor (TSHR). This paper will be of interest to researchers working on thyroid biology and autoimmune disorders. This important set of new results also highlights dynamic conformational changes in the linker region (LR) and its interaction with the leucine-rich domain (LRD). While most claims are convincingly supported by the data and advance the understanding of TSHR, the experimental validation is currently incomplete.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81415.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Gupta</surname><given-names>Yogesh K</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02f6dcw23</institution-id><institution>The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.07.13.499955">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.13.499955v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Carlos Isales as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewers' comments are appended. Please address all comments raised by the reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Major weaknesses:</p><p>– Page 29 line 508: The authors claim that this is the first model of full-length TSHR, but citation 39 appears to be a full-length TSHR homology model (with noted differences in LR conformation). This manuscript does appear to be the first simulation of full-length TSHR, however. The manuscript would benefit from stating more clearly what is in this model that previous models are lacking and why that is significant.</p><p>– Page 7 line 88: This paragraph describes the choice of orientation for the starting model. This model was selected first by rotating the LRD-LR around the z-axis and selecting an orientation that minimizes the volume of the box necessary for running the simulation and maximizes the number of contacts between LR and TMD (which the authors acknowledge as inexact). While this choice of starting model is computationally efficient, it is not sufficiently rigorous. The initial model appears to contain the interdomain hydrogen bonds that the authors track in Figure 7, and it is unclear that these bonds would be found and maintained if the starting conformation of the model were different.

This manuscript does appear to be the first simulation of full-length TSHR, however.</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that in the literature there are partial models of the TSHR based on homology of the linker (hinge) region but with an inability to model the 50 amino acid insert unique to the TSHR.

We present here the first complete, physics-based model of the TSHR, especially the linker region, which provides details of the ectodomain conformations and orientation as well as a conformational ensemble generated by molecular dynamics. The significance of the results lies in our ability to obtain a structure of the LR using AF2 from its sequence, which allowed for the full length MD simulation model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Page 7 line 88: This paragraph describes the choice of orientation for the starting model. This model was selected first by rotating the LRD-LR around the z-axis and selecting an orientation that minimizes the volume of the box necessary for running the simulation and maximizes the number of contacts between LR and TMD (which the authors acknowledge as inexact). While this choice of starting model is computationally efficient, it is not sufficiently rigorous. The initial model appears to contain the interdomain hydrogen bonds that the authors track in Figure 7, and it is unclear that these bonds would be found and maintained if the starting conformation of the model were different. It is also unclear whether the TSHR-TSH interactions reported in Figure 10 would hold with a different starting conformation. To address this concern, the paper would benefit from another set of calculations where this arbitrary orientation is changed to be outside of the 45{degree sign} window that is presented to validate that these results are not dependent on initial orientation. It may also be valuable to report the orientation that AF2 produces (see next comment).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the heuristic process we used to arrive at the starting model lacks the simplicity and clarity of a simple optimization task. However, every optimization approach is dependent on the choice of the objective function, so there is always an arbitrariness in the choice of that objective function. On the other hand, the fact that during 1000ns the relative orientation/position of the LR and the TMD remained essentially the same in spite of the large conformational fluctuations of the LR and the movement of the LRD with respect to the rest of the TSHR indicates that whatever bias the initial model may have been affected by its effect was eliminated as the LR conformations developed. Further confirmation of the overall correctness of our initial model, noted in the Discussion section, is the fact that the starting model allowed the dimerization of the TSHR in such a way that the TSH binding surface remained free after dimerization. This, in our opinion made it unnecessary to pursue different starting orientations.</p><p>Note, also, that the interdomain hydrogen bonds (red lines in Figure 7) are bonds between the LR and the LRD, not between the LR and the TMD and they were present in the Alphafold2 structure. We added a note about this in the description of Figure 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors used AF2 to determine the structure of the whole protein except for the Transmembrane domain (TMD), for which they had generated a model previously.
