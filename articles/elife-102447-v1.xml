Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was employed to explore gene-related aspects associated with significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) detected in MR analysis. The associations between the age of menarche, childbirth, and the number of childbirths with several age-related outcomes were validated in the UK Biobank by conducting regression analysis of nearly 200,000 subjects.</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Results:</title><p>Using MR, we demonstrated that later ages of menarche or first childbirth were genetically associated with longer parental lifespan, decreased frailty index, slower epigenetic aging, later menopause, and reduced facial aging. Moreover, later menarche or first childbirth was also genetically associated with a lower risk of several age-related diseases, including late-onset Alzheimer’s disease, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, essential hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We identified 158 significant SNPs that influenced age-related outcomes, some of which were involved in known longevity pathways, including insulin-like growth factor 1, growth hormone, AMP-activated protein kinase, and mTOR signaling. Our study also identified higher body mass index as a mediating factor in causing the increased risk of certain diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and heart failure, in women with early menarche or early pregnancy. We validated the associations between the age of menarche, childbirth, and the number of childbirths with several age-related outcomes in the UK Biobank by conducting regression analysis of nearly 200,000 subjects. Our results demonstrated that menarche before the age of 11 and childbirth before 21 significantly accelerated the risk of several diseases and almost doubled the risk for diabetes, heart failure, and quadrupled the risk of obesity, supporting the antagonistic pleiotropy theory.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our study highlights the complex relationship between genetic legacies and modern diseases, emphasizing the need for gender-sensitive healthcare strategies that consider the unique connections between female reproductive health and aging.</p></sec><sec id="abs5"><title>Funding:</title><p>Hevolution Foundation (PK).

The theory of antagonistic pleiotropy suggests that natural selection involves inherent trade-offs, where genes that are advantageous for early survival and reproduction may have detrimental effects later in life, contributing to the aging process and the development of age-related diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Medawer, 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Byars and Voskarides, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wang and Cong, 2021</xref>). Though evidence for antagonistic pleiotropy has been observed in invertebrate models, evidence for causal relationships in mammals, especially humans, is largely lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kumar et al., 2016</xref>). The timing of reproductive events, such as menarche and childbirth, has long been recognized as a crucial aspect of human life history and evolution. However, accumulating evidence suggests that these reproductive milestones may have far-reaching implications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Grundy and Tomassini, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Day et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Considering reproductive events are partly regulated by genetic factors that can manifest the physiological outcome later in life, we hypothesized that earlier or later onset of menarche and first childbirth could reflect broader genetic influences on longevity and disease susceptibility, serving as proxies for biological aging processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). Mendelian randomization (MR) is a term that applies to the use of genetic variation to address causal questions about how modifiable exposures influence different outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sanderson et al., 2022</xref>). Two-sample and two-step MR analyses were adopted in our research to explore the genetic causal associations using the inverse variance weighted (IVW) model. We leveraged recent studies that have identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with early menarche or birth in humans to examine their role in antagonistic pleiotropy. After preprocessing, there were 209 and 33 SNPs included in MR analyses for the two exposures, age at menarche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Loh et al., 2018</xref>) and age at first birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mills et al., 2021</xref>), respectively.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Research pipeline.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) All the traits for exposures and outcomes included in the analysis.

In this case, 249 SNPs and 67 SNPs were selected as eligible instrumental variables (IVs) for exposures of age at menarche and age at first birth, respectively. All selected SNPs for every exposure would be clumped to avoid the linkage disequilibrium (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.001 and kb  = 10,000). Then we identified whether there were potential confounders of IVs associated with the outcomes based on a database of human genotype–phenotype associations, PhenoScanner V2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Staley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kamat et al., 2019</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phenoscanner.medschl.cam.ac.uk/">http://www.phenoscanner.medschl.cam.ac.uk/</ext-link>), with a threshold of p &lt; 1 × 10<sup>–5</sup>. IVs associated with education, smoking, alcohol, activity, and other confounders related to outcomes would be excluded. During the harmonization process, we aligned the alleles to the human genome reference sequence and removed incompatible SNPs. Subsequent analyses were based on the merged exposure–outcome dataset. We calculated the <italic>F</italic> statistics to quantify the strength of IVs for each exposure with a threshold of <italic>F</italic> &gt; 10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Burgess et al., 2017</xref>). If the effect allele frequency (EAF) was missing in the primary dataset, EAF would be collected from dsSNP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/</ext-link>) based on the population to calculate the F value. As osteoporosis GWAS was processed by BOLT-LMM, we recalculated the beta value for MR analysis. To adjust the beta values (<italic>β</italic><sub>𝐵𝑂𝐿𝑇</sub>) estimated by BOLT-LMM for dichotomous, we applied the following formula to each SNP:<disp-formula id="equ1"><alternatives><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>O</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msqrt><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msqrt></mml:mfrac></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math><tex-math id="t1">\begin{document}$$\displaystyle  Adjusted\ beta=\frac{\beta _{BOLT}}{\sqrt{P\left (1-P\right)}}$$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></disp-formula></p><p>The prevalence (<italic>P</italic>) of the binary outcome in the population is the proportion of individuals with the outcomes. For example, the p-value for osteoporosis was calculated based on the GWAS sample size (484,598) and disease cases (7751). The adjusted beta values for essential hypertension, osteoporosis, GAD, and cervical cancer were calculated in MR analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>MR analysis</title><p>All analysis was performed using R software (version 4.3.1, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) and RStudio software (version 2023.09.0 Posit, PBC, Boston, USA) with TwoSampleMR (version 0.5.7) and MRPRESSO (version 1.0) packages.</p><p>Five two-sample MR methods were applied for analysis, including IVW model, MR Egger regression model, weighted median model (WMM), simple mode, and weighted mode. A pleiotropy test was used to check if the IVs influence the outcome through pathways other than the exposure of interest. A heterogeneity test was applied to ensure whether there is a variation in the causal effect estimates across different IVs. Significant heterogeneity test results indicate that some instruments are invalid or that the causal effect varies depending on the IVs used. MRPRESSO was applied to detect and correct potential outliers of IVs with NbDistribution = 10,000 and threshold p = 0.05. Outliers would be excluded for repeated analysis. The causal estimates were given as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals. A leave-one-out analysis was conducted to ensure the robustness of the results by sequentially excluding each IV and confirming the direction and statistical significance of the remaining SNPs.</p><p>In two-step MR, we mainly use IVW to assess the causal associations between exposure and outcome, exposure and mediator, and mediator and outcome.

IPA is a widely used bioinformatics tool for interpreting high-throughput data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ghosh et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, the SNPs/genes from MR analysis were uploaded into QIAGEN’s IPA system for core analysis and then the outcome was overlaid with the global molecular network in the Ingenuity Pathway Knowledge Base (IPKB). IPA was performed to identify canonical pathways, diseases, and functions, and to investigate gene networks. Additionally, the Chemical Biology Database (ChEMBL) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/</ext-link>), a large-scale database of bioactive molecules for drug discovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gaulton et al., 2012</xref>), and the DrugBank database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wishart et al., 2018</xref>), a comprehensive database on FDA-approved drugs, drug targets, mechanisms of action, and interactions (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://go.drugbank.com/">https://go.drugbank.com/</ext-link>), were used to identify candidate genes targeted by approved drugs in clinical trials or under current development phases.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Population validation</title><p>The MR results were further validated based on the UK Biobank with package stats (version 4.3.1). In addition to age at menarche and first live birth, the number of births is listed as an independent variable for the validation analysis. Based on the significant associations, regression analysis was adopted to explore the effect of independent variables and related confounders on outcomes. Ages at menarche were divided into five age groups, &lt;11, 11–12, 13–14, 15–16, and &gt;16 years. Ages at first live birth were divided into five age groups, &lt;21, 21–25, 26–30, 31–35, and &gt;35 years. Females with the number of births from 0 to 4 were included. Education was divided into seven levels based on the degrees. Smoking was divided into two categories, ever smoking or not. Drinking was divided into three categories: never, previous, and current drinking. BMI was divided into four categories: &lt;18.5, 18.5–24.9, 25–29.9, and ≥30 based on the average value of four records. The outcome results were preprocessed based on the baseline information collection, follow-up outcome, surgical history, and ICD-10 diagnosis summary. Logistic regression was used for the analysis of disease risks (categorical variables). The coefficients (<italic>β</italic>) in logistic regression were log-odds ratios. Although the continuous variables exhibited mild to moderate skewed distributions, considering the large sample size, linear regression was used for the analysis of age at death, menopause age, and BMI in the first step. Then logistic regression was applied to confirm the robustness of the results with the outcome of death age ≥80, menopause age ≥50, and BMI ≥30. Confounders for regression analysis I include education, smoking, and drinking. Confounders for regression analysis II include education, smoking, drinking, and BMI. Variance Inflation Factors (VIF) were calculated for each predictor in regression analysis to avoid multicollinearity. Values of VIF were less than 1.5 for each predictor. For outcomes of diabetes, high blood pressure (HBP), heart failure, and BMI ≥30, the combined effect of age at menarche and first birth was analyzed. 179,821 participants were divided into 25 groups according to the menarche and first live birth age groups. All other groups were compared to the group with menarche of ‘13–14 years’ and the first birth of ‘26–30 years’ in logistic regression (confounders including education, smoking, drinking, and BMI for diabetes, HBP, and heart failure; including education, smoking, and drinking for BMI ≥30).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Later menarche was genetically associated with later aging outcomes</title><p>Since parental ages at death may reflect the genetic heritability of lifespan, parental ages at death were used as general aging outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ng and Schooling, 2023</xref>).

To estimate the effect of BMI as the mediator, we further conducted two-step MR. Exposures of age of menarche and age at first birth, and outcomes of frailty index, type 2 diabetes, and CHF, were included in the two-step MR analysis.

Our study finds support for antagonistic pleiotropy by demonstrating that genetic variants that drive early menarche or early pregnancy accelerate several aging outcomes, including parental age, frailty index, and several age-related diseases such as diabetes and dementia. These results were validated in a cohort from the UK Biobank, showing that women with early menarche or early pregnancy were associated with accelerated aging outcomes and increased risk of several age-related diseases. These results are also consistent with the disposable soma theory that suggests aging as an outcome trade-off between an organism’s investment in reproduction and somatic maintenance and repair. Both antagonistic pleiotropy theory and the disposable soma theory provide valuable evolutionary frameworks for interpreting how reproductive traits influence long-term health, yet they emphasize distinct biological mechanisms. Antagonistic pleiotropy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Byars and Voskarides, 2020</xref>) highlights the temporal trade-off of gene function, proposing that alleles promoting fertility or reproductive success early in life may have detrimental effects in later life. In contrast, the disposable soma theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">van den Heuvel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Douglas and Dillin, 2014</xref>) emphasizes a resource allocation trade-off, where investment in reproduction occurs at the cost of somatic maintenance and repair, ultimately accelerating aging and increasing susceptibility to disease. Future research could aim to explore these mechanisms by integrating genetic, metabolic, and longitudinal data, which help understand the interaction between gene-driven effects and resource-driven physiological trade-offs.</p><p>Consistent with a recent study suggesting the relation of early first birth with a higher likelihood of frailty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Guo et al., 2024</xref>), our MR analysis provided a strong association between early age of first birth and GrimAge, a DNA methylation-based marker to predict epigenetic age. Our findings align with the observed negative genetic correlation between reproductive traits and lifespan that individuals with higher polygenic scores for reproduction have lower survivorships to age 76 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Long and Zhang, 2023</xref>). Prior studies linking the female reproductive factors with aging are either limited to results obtained from observational studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chen et al., 2021</xref>) or are limited to few outcomes such as brain disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barth and de Lange, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sherwin and Henry, 2008</xref>). Besides, emerging evidence suggests that early puberty in males is linked to adverse health outcomes, such as an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension in later life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Day et al., 2015</xref>). An MR study also reported a genetic association between the timing of male puberty and reduced lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hollis et al., 2020</xref>). These findings support the hypothesis that genetic variants associated with delayed reproductive timing in males might similarly confer health benefits or improved longevity, akin to the patterns observed in females. This would suggest that similar mechanisms of antagonistic pleiotropy could operate in males as well.</p><p>Using MR, we identified 158 SNPs associated with early menarche or first birth that significantly influence age-related outcomes. Among the top 25 enriched canonical signaling pathways, those involved in developmental and cellular processes are particularly significant in determining the timing of menarche and first childbirth, with nearly one third of these pathways (8 out of 25) falling into this category. These developmental and cellular signaling pathways work together to regulate continuous growth and involution from puberty through menopause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jorge et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, known longevity pathways such as IGF-1, growth hormone signaling, melatonin signaling, and BMP signaling seem to play a crucial role in regulating the timing of these reproductive events. IGF-1 signaling promotes the growth and development of reproductive organs and tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Baumgarten et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bøtkjær et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stubbs et al., 2013</xref>), but is also a conserved modulator of longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Papaconstantinou, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kalman, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">van Heemst, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Junnila et al., 2013</xref>). Melatonin, known for regulating circadian rhythms, influences the timing of menarche through its effects on the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aleandri et al., 1997</xref>) and is postulated to modulate oxidative, inflammatory, and autophagy states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Olcese, 2020</xref>). Furthermore, different processes in early life such as cell proliferation or differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2004</xref>), ovarian function, and follicular development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Magro-Lopez and Muñoz-Fernández, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Childs et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Cunha da de et al., 2017</xref>) are dependent on BMP signaling. However, increased BMP signaling also contributes significantly to AD pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>) and impairments in neurogenesis and cognitive decline associated with aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Meyers et al., 2016</xref>). Aberrant BMP signaling is also shown to be associated with age-related metabolic and cardiovascular diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Ye et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baboota et al., 2021</xref>). Additionally, growth hormone signaling is not only vital for development during childhood and puberty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Saenger, 2003</xref>) but also impacts longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bartke, 2021</xref>). Besides signaling pathways, genes in age at menarche and first childbirth were connected in gene–gene interaction networks. IPA network 1 revealed strong connections of our input genes to regulators involved in chromatin remodeling, immune signaling, and proteostasis. Notably, NF-κB, TGF-β, and IL-12—central players in inflammation and immune modulation—emerged as key hubs. While tightly regulated during early life to support immunity and tissue repair, chronic activation of these pathways is associated with inflammaging and immune dysfunction in later life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fülöp et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Franceschi and Campisi, 2014</xref>). Similarly, links to histone H3/H4 and modifiers like USP10 and USP49 suggest that dysregulation of chromatin and ubiquitin-mediated protein turnover may underlie both developmental gene expression programs and age-related epigenetic drift and proteotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vilchez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Benayoun et al., 2015</xref>). The enrichment of E3 ligase-associated nodes (e.g., E3:K48-ubiquitinated substrate, ubiquitin) further supports a central role for proteostasis networks in aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vilchez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ciechanover and Kwon, 2015</xref>). These associations reflect the principle of antagonistic pleiotropy—where genes and pathways essential for early-life growth, stress resilience, and immune function become liabilities later in life, contributing to aging and age-related diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Austad and Hoffman, 2018</xref>). In the IPA network 2, most genes were connected with either <italic>AKT</italic> or genes encoding for follicle-stimulating hormone (<italic>FSH</italic>), luteinizing hormone (<italic>LH</italic>), leptin receptor (<italic>LEPR</italic>), and inhibin subunit beta A (<italic>INHBA</italic>). AKT signaling is implicated in oocyte maturation and embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kalous et al., 2023</xref>) and mediates pregnancy-induced cardiac adaptive responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chung et al., 2012</xref>). AKT signaling also mediates age-related disease pathologies, such as AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). Major ovarian functions are controlled by FSH (follicular growth, cellular proliferation, and estrogen production) and LH (oocyte maturation, ovulation, and terminal differentiation of follicles), which in turn are modulated by other ovarian factors such as INHBA (a subunit of activin and inhibin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Howard, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bhartiya et al., 2012</xref>). Endocrine alterations at advanced aging or reproductive aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Danilovich et al., 2002</xref>) are marked by changes in FSH and LH due to altered feedback resulting from the ovarian decline in sex steroids, inhibin A, and inhibin B production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hale et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Santoro and Randolph, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vanden Brink et al., 2015</xref>). These studies underscore the importance of considering that dysregulation or abnormal activation of any of these pathways could contribute to the onset of late-life diseases consistent with antagonistic pleiotropy in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Byars and Voskarides, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdellatif et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The thrifty gene hypothesis provides a compelling framework to explain antagonistic pleiotropy, particularly in the context of modern health challenges. The thrifty gene hypothesis suggests that genes favoring efficient energy storage were advantageous in historical periods of food scarcity, helping individuals survive through famines. However, in today’s environment of abundant food, the same genes contribute to obesity and metabolic diseases like diabetes. Similarly, in the context of antagonistic pleiotropy, we hypothesize that genes that enhance early-life reproductive success favor efficient energy storage to support reproductive health. This is supported by our observation that early pregnancy is associated with increasing BMI, a recognized key factor in systemic aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lundgren et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Quach et al., 2017</xref>). In support of this, we found a lack of significant association between early menarche or age at first birth for CHF and cervical cancer after removal of BMI as a confounder in MR analysis. Based on regression analysis at the population level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), higher BMI was associated with higher risks of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Thus, an increase in BMI is one of the factors that explains the increased risk of age-related disease seen due to the exposure of early pregnancy or the prevalence of genes that enhance early reproductive success. These results are also consistent with calorie restriction being a robust way to extend healthspan and lifespan in many species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wilson et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Several limitations of our study need to be considered. First, all the associations are explored at the genetic level with MR and population level with the UK Biobank. However, to confirm causal relationships, further validation through in vitro and in vivo research is essential. Second, though we excluded confounder-related SNPs and addressed potential pleiotropic effects, there may also be potential bias which could be addressed by extending these findings to other populations. Third, significant heterogeneity and pleiotropy remained in some association analyses, which need further exploration. Fourth, research regarding male-specific reproductive traits and their relationship to aging and health outcomes is needed to compare the difference between male and female aging. Given the increasing age of first childbirth in modern times, the ideal period of first childbirth for both slowing down female aging and benefiting fetal development needs more research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Balasch, 2010</xref>). In summary, our study underscores the complex relationship between genetic legacies and modern diseases. Understanding these genetic predispositions can inform public health strategies and their relevance to age-related disease outcomes in women of various ethnic groups. For example, interventions could be tailored not only to mitigate the risks associated with early reproductive timing but also to address lifestyle factors exacerbating conditions linked to thrifty genes, like diet and physical activity.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group

Based on this theory they hypothesize that genetic variants associated with later onset of age at menarche and age at first birth have a positive causal effect on a multitude of health outcomes later in life, such as epigenetic aging and prevalence of chronic diseases. Using a mendelian randomization and colocalization approach, the authors show that SNPs associated with later age at menarche are associated with delayed aging measurements, such as slower epigenetic aging and reduced facial aging and a lower risk of chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Moreover, they identify 128 fertility-related SNPs that associate with age-related outcomes and they identified BMI as a mediating factor for disease risk, discussing this finding in the context of evolutionary theory.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The major strength of this manuscript is that it addresses the antagonistic pleiotropy theory in aging. Aging theories are not frequently empirically tested although this is highly necessary. The work is therefore relevant for the aging field as well as beyond this field, as the antagonistic pleiotropy theory addresses the link between fitness (early life health and reproduction) and aging.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The authors report evidence in support of the antagonistic pleiotropy theory in aging and discuss the discuss the disposable soma theory. Although both theories describe distinct mechanisms, separating them in empirical research is complicated and needs further studies in future research.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.102447.4.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Xiang</surname><given-names>Yifan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Buck Institute for Research on Aging</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Novato</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Tanwar</surname><given-names>Vineeta</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Buck Institute for Research on Aging</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Novato</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>Parminder</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Buck Institute for Research on Aging</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Novato</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>La Follette</surname><given-names>Lizellen</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Buck Institute for Research on Aging</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Novato</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Narayan</surname><given-names>Vikram Pratap</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Buck Institute for Research on Aging</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Novato</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kapahi</surname><given-names>Pankaj</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Buck Institute for Research on Aging</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Novato</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The present study aims to associate reproduction with age-related disease as support of the antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis of ageing predominantly using Mendelian Randomization.

Many analyses.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Still a number of doubts with regard to some of the results and their interpretation.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Thank you for the opportunity to review a revised version.</p><p>I still have serious doubts with regard to a number of datasets presented. For example, the results on essential hypertension and cervical cancer show very small effect sizes, but according to the authors still reach the level of statistical significance. This is unlikely to be accurate. For MR analyses, this is nearly impossible. The analyses of these data and the statistical analysis need to be checked for errors and repeated. While BOLT-LLM might not be relevant here, there might be other things happening here. The authors should therefore always interpret the results also with regard to the observed effect sizes instead of only looking at the p-values (0.999 means that there is a 0.1% lower risk).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestions. We have updated the results for essential hypertension, GAD, and cervical cancer in results, figures, and supplemental tables (lines 65-89, Figure 1, Tables S3-S4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors present an interesting paper where they test the antagonistic pleiotropy theory. Based on this theory they hypothesize that genetic variants associated with later onset of age at menarche and age at first birth may have a positive effect on a multitude of health outcomes later in life, such as epigenetic aging and prevalence of chronic diseases. Using a mendelian randomization and colocalization approach, the authors show that SNPs associated with later age at menarche are associated with delayed aging measurements, such as slower epigenetic aging and reduced facial aging and a lower risk of chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Moreover, they identify 128 fertility-related SNPs that associate with age-related outcomes and they identified BMI as a mediating factor for disease risk, discussing this finding in the context of evolutionary theory.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The major strength of this manuscript is that it addresses the antagonistic pleiotropy theory in aging. Aging theories are not frequently empirically tested although this is highly necessary. The work is therefore relevant for the aging field as well as beyond this field, as the antagonistic pleiotropy theory addresses the link between fitness (early life health and reproduction) and aging.</p><p>The authors addressed the remarks on the previous version very well. Addressing the two points below would further increase the quality of the manuscript.</p><p>(1) In the previous version the authors mentioned that their results are also consistent with the disposable soma theory: &quot;These results are also consistent with the disposable soma theory that suggests aging as an outcome tradeoff between an organism's investment in reproduction and somatic maintenance and repair.&quot;</p><p>Although the antagonistic pleiotropy and disposable soma theories describe different mechanisms, both provide frameworks for understanding how genes linked to fertility influence health. The antagonistic pleiotropy theory posits that genes enhancing fertility early in life may have detrimental effects later. In contrast, the disposable soma theory suggests that energy allocation involves a trade-off, where investment in fertility comes at the expense of somatic maintenance, potentially leading to poorer health in later life.</p><p>To strengthen the manuscript, a discussion section should be added to clarify the overlap and distinctions between these two evolutionary theories and suggest directions for future research in disentangling their specific mechanisms.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestions to clarify the overlap and distinctions between the antagonistic pleiotropy and disposable soma theories. While our primary focus is on the antagonistic pleiotropy framework, we acknowledge that the disposable soma theory also provides a relevant perspective on the trade-offs between reproduction and somatic maintenance.</p><p>To address this, we have expanded the discussion section to highlight how both theories contribute to our understanding of the relationship between fertility-related traits and aging-related health outcomes. We also suggested potential future research directions, such as integrating genetic data with biomarkers of somatic to further explore the mechanisms underlying these trade-offs (lines 213-223).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In response to the question why the authors did not include age at menopause in addition to the already included age at first child and age at menarche the following explanation was provided: &quot;Our manuscript focuses on the antagonistic pleiotropy theory, which posits that inherent trade-off in natural selection, where genes beneficial for early survival and reproduction (like menarche and childbirth) may have costly consequences later. So, we only included age at menarche and age at first childbirth as exposures in our research.&quot;</p><p>It remains, however, unclear why genes beneficial for early survival and reproduction would be reflected only in age at menarche and age at first childbirth, but not in age at menopause. While age at menarche marks the onset of fertility, age at menopause signifies its end. Since evolutionary selection acts directly until reproduction is no longer possible (though indirect evolutionary pressures persist beyond this point), the inclusion of additional fertility-related measures could have strengthened the analysis. A more detailed justification for focusing exclusively on age at menarche and first childbirth would enhance the clarity and rigor of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your question regarding the age at menopause in our analysis. Our decision was based on the theoretical framework of antagonistic pleiotropy, which emphasizes early-life reproductive advantages that may have trade-offs later in life. Age at menarche and age at first childbirth are direct markers of early reproductive investment, which align closely with this framework.</p><p>While age at menopause marks the cessation of reproductive capability, its evolutionary role is distinct. The selective pressures acting on menopause are complex and may involve post-reproductive contributions rather than direct reproductive fitness benefits. Moreover, the genetic architecture of menopause may be influenced by different biological pathways compared to early reproductive traits.</p><p>Nonetheless, we acknowledge that including age at menopause could provide additional insights into reproductive aging. Several papers1,2 were already published regarding age at menopause and age-related outcomes, including diabetes, AD, osteoporosis, cancers, and cardiovascular diseases.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewing Editor (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Above/below you will find the remaining comments from the reviewers. One of the main issues remaining is that some of the data seems to be incorrectly analysed and some of the findings may not be correct. To clarify this a lot more, I asked the reviewer for some details and received the following:</p><p>- In Figure 1B one of their main outcomes is &quot;age of menopause&quot;, but they report the data as an odds ratio. This is not correct and should be fixed (it seems the authors can run the right analysis, but just reported it with the wrong heading in the figure). This likely also applies to the outcome &quot;facial aging&quot;. Also the heading in Figure 1A should be Beta instead of OR.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated the figures to ensure that the beta values of continuous outcomes and odds ratio values of categorical outcomes are presented in Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- With essential hypertension, GAD and cervical cancer, the estimates are so small that they need to re-review their results. The current MR analysis is not sufficiently powered to have such small confidence intervals. Essential hypertension was based on data from UK biobank, although I was also unable to find what program was used to generate the GWAS results, I have strong thoughts this was also BOLT-LLM. Same for cervical cancer. Both datasets used familial-related samples, so they are very likely derived with BOLT-LLM.</p><p>I hope this will help to solve this issue.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on published paper, gastrointestinal or abdominal disease (GAD) (GWAS ID: ebi-a-GCST90038597) is after BOLT-LLM. Based on MRC IEU UK Biobank GWAS pipeline, version 1 and 2, essential hypertension (GWAS ID: ukb-b-12493) and cervical cancer (GWAS ID: ukb-b-8777) are after BOLT-LLM. We have updated the MR analysis results and figures (lines 65-89, Figure 1, Tables S3-S4) as well as the following IPA analysis (lines 106-162 and 255-280, Figures 2-3).</p><p>(1) Magnus, M.
