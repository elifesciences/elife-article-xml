While active in all species tested so far, editing efficiencies still leave room for improvement. The bacterial Cas9 needs to be efficiently shuttled into the nucleus as attempted by fusion with nuclear localization signals (NLSs). Additional peptide tags such as FLAG- or myc-tags are usually added for immediate detection or straightforward purification. Immediate activity is usually granted by administration of preassembled protein/RNA complexes. We present the ‘hei-tag (<underline>h</underline>igh <underline>e</underline>ff<underline>i</underline>ciency-tag)’ which boosts the activity of CRISPR/Cas genome editing tools already when supplied as mRNA. The addition of the hei-tag, a myc-tag coupled to an optimized NLS via a flexible linker, to Cas9 or a C-to-T (cytosine-to-thymine) base editor dramatically enhances the respective targeting efficiency. This results in an increase in bi-allelic editing, yet reduction of allele variance, indicating an immediate activity even at early developmental stages. The hei-tag boost is active in model systems ranging from fish to mammals, including tissue culture applications. The simple addition of the hei-tag allows to instantly upgrade existing and potentially highly adapted systems as well as to establish novel highly efficient tools immediately applicable at the mRNA level.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The genetic code stored within DNA provides cells with the instructions they need to carry out their role in the body. Any changes to these genes, or the DNA sequence around them, has the potential to completely alter how a cell behaves.</p><p>Scientists have developed various tools that allow them to experimentally modify the genome of cells or even entire living organisms. This includes the popular Cas9 enzyme which cuts DNA at specific sites, and base editors which can precisely change bits of genetic code without cutting DNA. While there are lots of Cas9 enzymes and base editors currently available, these often differ greatly in their activity depending on which cell type or organism they are applied to.</p><p>Finding a tool that can effectively modify the genome of an organism at the right time during development also poses a challenge. All the cells in an organism arise from a single fertilized cell. If this cell is genetically edited, all its subsequent daughter cells (which make up the entire organism) will contain the genetic modification. However, most genome editing tools only work efficiently later in development, resulting in an undesirable mosaic organism composed of both edited and non-edited cells.</p><p>Here, Thumberger et al. have developed a new ‘high efficiency-tag’ (also known as hei-tag for short) that can enhance the activity of gene editing tools and overcome this barrier. The tag improves the efficiency of gene editing by immediately shuttling a Cas9 enzyme to the nucleus, the cellular compartment that stores DNA. In all cases, gene editing tools with hei-tag worked better than those without in fish embryos and mouse cells grown in the laboratory. When Cas9 enzymes connected to a hei-tag were injected into the first fertilized cell of a fish embryo, this resulted in an even distribution of edited genes spread throughout the whole organism.</p><p>To understand how a gene affects an organism, researchers need to be able to edit it as early in development as possible. Attaching the ‘hei-tag’ to already available tools could help boost their activity and make them more efficient. It could also allow advances in medical research aimed at replacing faulty genes with fully functioning ones.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Oryzias latipes</italic></kwd><kwd>CRISPR</kwd><kwd>Cas</kwd><kwd>targeted genome editing</kwd><kwd>nuclear localization</kwd><kwd>base editing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd><kwd>Oryzias latipes</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRC873 project A3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wittbrodt</surname><given-names>Joachim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FOR2509 P10 WI 1824/9-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wittbrodt</surname><given-names>Joachim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRC1118 project S03</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Freichel</surname><given-names>Marc</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>810172</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wittbrodt</surname><given-names>Joachim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>3DMM2O, EXC 2082/1 Wittbrodt C3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wittbrodt</surname><given-names>Joachim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Increased efficiency of targeted genome editing by simple addition of a bipartite-optimized tag at the N- and C-termini of effector proteins (Cas9 and cytosine-to-thymine base editor) is applicable in organismo and cell culture.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the last decade, the CRISPR/Cas9 system and its derivatives facilitated and revolutionized genome editing across all phyla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nidhi et al., 2021</xref>). The efficiency of editing crucially depends on the on-site activity of the particular Cas9 enzymes used (usually <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9</italic>, <italic>SpCas9</italic>) in the nucleus. State-of-the-art Cas9 variants differ by peptide tags added to the N- and C-termini of the respective endonuclease resulting in reported different activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Employed tags usually comprise diverse nuclear localization signals (NLSs) and epitope tags (e.g. FLAG, Myc, HA) for potential protein purification or visualization. To achieve nuclear localization of the Cas9 enzyme, the monopartite NLS originating from the SV40 large T-antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kalderon et al., 1984</xref>) or a bipartite NLS discovered in <italic>Xenopus</italic> nucleoplasmin is routinely employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dingwall et al., 1988</xref>). However, the nuclear localization activity of commonly used NLSs is tightly controlled during early development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Poon and Jans, 2005</xref>) and is first detectable during gastrulation. In fish embryos, an optimized artificial NLS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Inoue et al., 2016</xref>) (oNLS) facilitates prominent nuclear localization already immediately after fertilization, while the SV40 NLS acts most prominently much later and facilitates nuclear localization approximately at the 1000-cell stage. For high targeting efficiency with low mosaicism, a peak activity should be achieved in the zygote or at early cleavage stages. Here, we present the hei-tag, a short bipartite tag composed of a myc-tag and optimized NLSs at the N- and C-termini, that boosts Cas9 or cytosine-to-thymine (C-to-T) base editor-mediated targeted genome editing <italic>in organismo</italic> and cell culture.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Assessing the genome editing efficiency requires a reliable and quantitative readout based on an apparent phenotype. We established a quantitative assay for loss-of-eye pigmentation to address the activity of different Cas9 variants in two teleost model systems, medaka (<italic>Oryzias latipes</italic>) and zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) covering a wide evolutionary distance of 200 million years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Furutani-Seiki and Wittbrodt, 2004</xref>). Our assay on retinal pigmentation provides a highly reproducible quantitative readout for the loss of the conserved transporter protein <italic>oculocutaneous albinism type 2</italic> (<italic>oca2</italic>), required for melanin biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Only its bi-allelic inactivation results in the loss of pigmentation of eyes and skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lischik et al., 2019</xref>). A prominent knock-out phenotype thus can either result from a single to few early events, or from many events at subsequent developmental stages. Although phenotypically indifferent, the allele variance (genetic mosaicism) reflects the time point of action.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>heiCas9 exhibits outstanding bi-allelic targeting activity in fish.</title><p>Phenotypic range and quantification of <italic>OlOca2 T1</italic>, <italic>T2,</italic> and <italic>DrOca2 T1, T2</italic> sgRNAs/<italic>Cas9 variant</italic> and sgRNA/Cas9 protein complex (ribonucleoprotein [RNP])-mediated loss of pigmentation in medaka (<bold>a–d</bold>) and zebrafish (<bold>e–g</bold>) at high concentrations.

To address whether different peptide domains (NLSs, Myc-tag, amino acid linkers) flanking the Cas9 enzyme enhance the targeting efficiency, we performed a permutation screen with Cas9 variants carrying these domains at different positions, which resulted in the identification of the ‘hei-tag’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The hei-tag comprises a myc-tag connected via a flexible linker to an oNLS at the N-terminus complemented by a second oNLS fused to the C-terminus of a mammalian codon-optimized <italic>Cas9</italic> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for sequence) and in this conformation displayed highest editing activity. Any alteration of those domains in relative order or sequence negatively impacted on editing efficiency compared to the hei-tag (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><p>When assessing the activity of the resulting heiCas9 at high molar excess (standard conditions, 150 ng/µl), heiCas9 displayed a 70% increase in bi-allelic targeting efficiency vs. the reference zCas9 (median zCas9 = 134.5, heiCas9 = 225.3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>) in medaka. Embryos co-injected with <italic>heiCas9</italic> mRNA and sgRNAs against <italic>oca2</italic> essentially lost pigmentation. The observed absence of pigmentation argues for an early time point of action due to high activity and efficient nuclear translocation of the tagged heiCas9 variant already at the earliest cleavage stages. In developing organisms, the time point of genome editing essentially impacts on the allele variance, that is, the number of alleles established by the targeting attempt. To immediately provide a functional editing machinery, preassembled ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) containing Cas9 protein and guide RNA are popular, employing high molar excess/high concentrations of Cas9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kroll et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). Strikingly, the editing efficiency of injected <italic>heiCas9</italic> mRNA was fully comparable to such RNP approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>To address whether the enhancement by hei-tag fusion to Cas9 is applicable to different models, we next compared the activities of the zCas9 and heiCas9 in a second, evolutionarily distant fish species <italic>D. rerio</italic> (zebrafish) targeting the orthologous <italic>oca2</italic> gene (sgRNAs <italic>DrOca2 T1, T2</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hammouda et al., 2019</xref>). Injected and control embryos were fixed well after the onset of pigmentation at 2.5 dpf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kimmel et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e–f</xref>) and subjected to the quantitative assay for eye pigmentation described above. Taking the activity of zCas9 as base level (median = 14.7), heiCas9 delivered an outstanding targeting efficiency (median = 254.6), reflecting a 17-fold increase (p = 2.1e-56) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Similar to the results in medaka, yet even more pronounced, nearly unpigmented embryos were obtained with the heiCas9, arguing for highly efficient, early targeting. Taken together, addition of the hei-tag to a mammalian codon-optimized Cas9 resulted in the highly efficient heiCas9, which boosted the targeting efficiency 17-fold, even when used at saturating concentrations. It prominently inactivated both alleles of the targeted <italic>oca2</italic> locus, with a putatively early onset of action upon injection of <italic>heiCas9</italic> mRNA and the respective sgRNAs at the one-cell stage.</p><p>To address whether the high targeting efficiency of heiCas9 was conveyed by the high molar excess employed or was possibly restricted to the <italic>oca2</italic> locus, we turned to a multiplexing regime at 10-fold reduced concentrations of the Cas9 variants employed. We targeted four different genomic loci with four different sgRNAs: exonic targeting of <italic>oca2</italic> (<italic>OlOca2 T2</italic>), targeting of the start codon of the <italic>retina-specific transcription factor 2</italic> (<italic>rx2</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Stemmer et al., 2015</xref>), and the <italic>crystallin alpha a</italic> (<italic>cryaa</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Stemmer et al., 2015</xref>) as well as intronic targeting of <italic>rx3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zilova et al., 2021</xref>). Medaka one-cell stage embryos were co-injected with a mix of 12.5 ng/µl per sgRNA, the 10-fold reduced (15 ng/µl) <italic>zCas9</italic> or <italic>heiCas9</italic> mRNA and 20 ng/µl <italic>mCherry</italic> mRNA as injection tracer.</p><p>For each multiplexing experiment, the genomic DNA of three pools each containing eight randomly picked crispants was extracted at 4 dpf and subjected to allele-specific genotyping via Illumina sequencing. In the multiplexing approaches, a total of 823,898 reads for the zCas9 and 824,817 reads for the heiCas9, compared to 711,739 control reads, were analyzed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In all cases, heiCas9 performed dramatically better than the reference zCas9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>; mean percentage of modified alleles zCas9 [black dots] vs. heiCas9 [red dots]: <italic>OlOca2</italic>: 3.38% vs. 54.59%, p = 0.026; <italic>OlRx2</italic>: 20.82% vs. 95.85%, p = 3.2e-06; <italic>OlRx3</italic>: 16.61% vs. 49.36%, p = 0.0041; <italic>OlCryaa</italic>: 83.50% vs. 98.44%, p = 0.039). Strikingly, although the overall targeting efficiency was consistently higher as reflected by the high percentage of edited alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), at the same time the allele variance was reduced in all cases when using heiCas9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>; mean percentage of allele variance: zCas9 [black hollow dots] vs. heiCas9 [red hollow dots]: <italic>OlOca2</italic>: 20.71% vs. 12.87%, p = 0.025; <italic>OlRx2</italic>: 15.63% vs. 7.86%, p = 7.6e-06; <italic>OlRx3</italic>: 17.91% vs. 12.75%, p = 0.00021; <italic>OlCryaa</italic>: 10.17% vs. 8.74%, p = 0.22). This reduced allele variance for all multiplexed loci indicates an early editing by heiCas9. Given this and the overall higher targeting efficiency in all loci analyzed in the multiplexing approach, heiCas9 outperformed zCas9. It resulted in a massive performance boost, which was partially masked at saturating conditions, and now became fully apparent. The high efficiency of heiCas9 thus allows efficient editing at low concentrations with the potential to reduce off-target effects. Whether this putative reduction of off-targets is (over-)compensated by the efficient nuclear localization needs to be assessed by whole-genome sequencing approaches in the future.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Increased knock-out activity and reduced allele variance in heiCas9 crispants.</title><p>Multiplexed injections with 15ng/µl mRNA of <italic>zCas9</italic> or <italic>heiCas9</italic> (red) mRNA and 12.5ng/µl per sgRNA targeting exonic sequences in <italic>oculocutaneous albinism type 2</italic> (<italic>oca2; OlOca2 T2</italic>), the start codons of the <italic>retina-specific homeobox transcription factor 2</italic> (<italic>rx2; OlRx2</italic>) and of the <italic>alpha a crystallin</italic> (<italic>cryaa; OlCryaa</italic>), as well as an intronic sequence in <italic>rx3</italic> (<italic>OlRx3</italic>).

Base editing is an increasingly applied method with a potential for therapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antoniou et al., 2021</xref>). Base editors are composed of a modified Cas9 that only nicks one DNA strand and does not introduce a double-strand break (Cas9 nickase or Cas9n) and a nucleotide deaminase for precisely targeted nucleotide editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anzalone et al., 2020</xref>). To increase the efficiency of base editors, several iterative rounds of optimization of the employed deaminases and linkers have been undertaken, yielding optimal performance with the newest variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carrington et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cornean et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rosello et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>). To investigate if the addition of the hei-tag provides an easy and straightforward alternative route for increasing the activity of a nuclear protein of interest, we selected a C-to-T base editor version with intermediate efficiency (BE4-Gam <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Komor et al., 2017</xref>) to introduce non-sense or severe miss-sense mutations into the pigmentation gene <italic>oca2</italic>. We employed our tool ACEofBASEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cornean et al., 2022</xref>) to design and evaluate sgRNA target sites that introduce non-synonymous codon mutations and/or pre-mature STOP codons upon editing of the respective open reading frame (ORF). We compared three different sgRNAs (<italic>OlOca2 T1</italic>, <italic>T3,</italic> and <italic>T4</italic>) employing the original BE4-Gam and the hei-tag fused variant (heiBE4-Gam). In the <italic>oca2</italic> ORF, the transition of cytosines 766, 922, and 997 to thymine all convert the respective codon to a pre-mature STOP (<italic>OlOca2 T3</italic>: C766T, leading to Q256*; <italic>OlOca2 T4</italic>: C922T, leading to Q308*; <italic>OlOca2 T1</italic>: C995-997T, leading to T332I and Q333*).

For each sgRNA employed, heiBE4-Gam resulted in more pronounced loss of pigmentation in comparison to BE4-Gam (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>; control median = 0.0; medians BE4-Gam vs. heiBE4-Gam: <italic>OlOca2 T1</italic>, 0.6 vs. 28.0, p = 1.737e-20; <italic>OlOca2 T3</italic>, 0.0 vs. 0.8, p = 0.0471; <italic>OlOca2 T4</italic>, 93.8 vs. 170.1, p = 5.215e-12).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Zacharias Kontarakis as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Benchmark hei-tag activity against the state-of-art genome engineering tool in each experiment (see reviewer comments – also comparison to RNP use in fish is highly desirable).</p><p>2) Provide heiCas9 editing data across multiple targets/gRNAs, ideally showing diverse characteristics (e.g. genomic location, sequence, activity).</p><p>3) Edit manuscript to clearly describe the strengths and weaknesses of the &quot;hei-tagging&quot; method.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have a few concerns regarding the way the authors structure and present their claims:</p><p>1) One of the main take home messages (based on the Abstract) is that the hei-tag boosts the activity of a &quot;wide variety&quot; of genome editing tools. Even though the BE data are promising, the manuscript could use more examples (e.g. prime editors, that have been used in zebrafish – Petri et al., 2021). Can the hei-tag make editing possible in cases where it is undetectable with the state of the art tools?</p><p>2) Throughout the manuscript, the authors use only a handful of guides. Adding more examples, especially using guides that show a range of efficiencies with the non-hei-tag Cas9 would provide a better description of the strengths and limitations of the hei-tag.</p><p>3) What is the rationale of using the Cas9 from Hwang et al., and not the zebrafish codon optimised Cas9 from Jao et al?</p><p>4) Why do the authors use the GeneArt nuclease as a &quot;state of the art&quot; for the cell culture? What other tags are included in this nuclease? We can see that the worse score in Fig1d comes from JDS246. Not having the hei-tag is only one difference between JDS246 and heiCas9. One other is that heiCas9 lacks the FLAG (Myc-Cas performs already pretty well, however zebrafish data are not shown). How does GeneArt Cas9 compare in that respect? Such information should be presented to readers.</p><p>5) In Figure 1, what do the single guide results look like? Boosting deletion outcomes using two guides is not the same as boosting activity of single guide editing. Is the activity of both guides improved? Are they just being brought at the same level? Did the authors use sequencing to analyse what happened at the DNA level?</p><p>6) The hei-tag could be affecting editing outcomes, rather than ON target activity. In Figure S1, it is clear that the frequency of the in frame -15 allele is reduced, while overall efficiency in not dramatically affected. Changing the editing profile by using different nucleases (variants) is not the same as boosting efficiency in KO. The in-frame indels could be favored in other sites, thus reducing KO-score (if out of frame are regarded as desired outcome).</p><p>7) Generally, it is advised to use NGS data for strong claims about editing efficiency.</p><p>8) If ON-target activity is boosted, increased OFF-target activity is of concern, especially in cell culture when editing accuracy and precision are key. Since the main focus of the authors is not mammalian cell culture or therapeutic applications, they should at least be clear about this limitation.</p><p>Generally, the manuscript would be strengthened by including more examples of editing tools (desirable, but not absolutely required), include analyses of more guides (required), add sequencing data wherever possible (highly advised), adequately discussing strengths and limitations of the hei-tag (required), presenting some NGS data (recommended), toning down some &quot;generalised&quot; claims (unless more supporting data are provided).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Several reports in zebrafish have shown that Cas9/gRNA complexes injections can reach gene editing up to 100% in F0 embryos including when targeting multiple loci at the same time (See for instance Wu et al., 2018 and Kroll et al., 2021). In light of these impressive results the utility of the present method for the fish community is overstated at best without mentioning these points anywhere in the discussion.</p><p>The authors should attempt to compare the injection of heiCAS9 protein as this is the current preferred and most efficient method in the fish community.</p><p>In the present manuscript is not clear what is the purpose of the Myc tag in the construct. This is not used at all to visualize protein localization or purification. Do the authors believe that the addition of Myc increases Cas9 activity? If not giving that this is a method paper they should demonstrate the utility in this specific contest.</p><p>The zebrafish experiment lacks the comparison of the heicas9 with the most efficient myc-Cas9 leading to an overestimation to the improved efficiency of the construct.</p><p>Finally methodological papers based on a single locus are difficult to appreciate as they may be influenced by &quot;the gambler's luck&quot; (i.e. the chosen locus cold be a fortunate pick). These results should be extended to other genes as it's standard in the field (see the two publications above).</p><p>Finally the base editor experiment are equally strongly biased. The comparison with BE4-Gam is not representative of the current state of the art were several reports using ancBE4Max (See for instance Carrington et al., 2020, Zao et al., 2020 and Rosello et al., 2021) show highly improved results. In lights of these papers the statement &quot;Notably, in heiBE4-Gam injections, for each of the three cytosines in the base editing window, the C-to-T transition rate was higher than 60%, a level never observed in BE4-Gam injected embryos&quot; is not true as similar or higher level of C to T conversion have been reported. Again this a comparison with ancBE4Max should be extended to multiple loci.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. In the abstract, the authors introduced factors that leave room for the improvement of gene editing efficiency in CRISPR/Cas9 tools: (1) nuclear localization signal -citing Cong et al., 2013; and (2) protein tags for &quot;immediate detection or straight-forward purification&quot; and linkers to &quot;avoid steric hinderance impacting on activity&quot; -citing Zhang et al., 2014. However, such conclusions were never made in either of the originally cited papers. Cong et al., did not compare the editing activity with and without a NLS signal. On the contrary, there are partial evidence indicating that Cas9 protein may not require an NLS to assist import into the nucleus (Hu et al., G3, 2018). In Zhang et al., it was suspected that the addition of a flag or myc tag changed the charge distribution of the Cas9 protein, thus increasing its specificity and efficacy. No statement was made about the purification or the linker. It is OK to introduce the relevant background, but I find it problematic to misinterpret the cited literature to show conclusions they did not make.</p><p>2. The authors used modified version of NLS in the hei-tag construct to facilitate early nuclear targeting, while a straight-forward way to make nuclear-targeted Cas9 available in the cell is to directly inject the (nuclear-targeting) Cas9 protein. The authors should either provide this control experiment, or clarify why they only chose to build RNA-based systems.</p><p>3. It is widely known that the gRNA design is a critical factor affecting the gene editing efficiency. While hei-tag shows an increased bi-allelic editing efficiency than the control constructs, it is not clear whether this boost is universal with different targeted genes and different sgRNA designs.</p><p>4. JDS246-Cas9 was chosen as the baseline construct to evaluate the boost of editing efficiency. Given this was a construct originally made for mammalian cells, it is not clear whether it represents the state-of-art editing techniques, especially in zebrafish. While it is unrealistic to test all the available tools, other systems have been reported with high bi-allelic editing efficiency specifically in zebrafish should be introduced as a control (e.g. Jao et al., 2013, PNAS -disclaimer: the reviewer was not a maker of this tool).</p><p>5. In the base-editing experiments, the injected fish showed various level of eye-pigmentation colors, in contrast to the knockout experiment where cells devoid of pigment appear in patches on the eye. The authors should provide an explanation of why this is the case and justify why the pigmentation level has to be quantified differently in Figure 3 than Figure 1.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70558.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Benchmark hei-tag activity against the state-of-art genome engineering tool in each experiment (see reviewer comments – also comparison to RNP use in fish is highly desirable).</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised version of the manuscript we now extensively compare the hei-tagged Cas9 (heiCas9) against state-of-the-art Cas variants, including RNPs.</p><p>Strikingly, heiCas9 clearly outperforms the state-of-the-art Cas variants and RNPs. Only when applied at highest concentrations (highly viscous injection mix) RNPs show a slightly increased activity. Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we now use the zebrafish codon optimized nls-zCas9-nls from Jao et al., 2013 as reference in both, medaka and zebrafish. heiCas9 mRNA in both cases massively outperforms the reference. This is now presented in the new Figure 1.</p><p>Given that all those comparisons were performed at saturating conditions in the plateau of Cas activity, we subsequently diluted the concentrations of the respective Cas variants by a factor of 10 and compared their activity in the exponential phase for four different target loci in a multiplexing approach. Here, the massive performance boost provided by the hei-tag becomes fully apparent, which was partially masked at saturating conditions.</p><p>We quantified the results by Illumina sequencing of the respective multiplexed loci and show a high specific activity of the heiCas9 in contrast to the zCas9. Strikingly, the allele variance per locus is clearly reduced in the heiCas9 experiment (even under multiplexing conditions) in comparison to the state-of-the-art Cas9 variant. This argues for an early (in development) and precise activity of heiCas9.</p><p>Those findings are now presented in the all new Figure 2 in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Provide heiCas9 editing data across multiple targets/gRNAs, ideally showing diverse characteristics (e.g. genomic location, sequence, activity).</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point, we have been comparing the activity of the state-of-the-art Cas9 variant (zCas9) with heiCas9 on four different genomic loci (<italic>oca2</italic>, <italic>rx2</italic>, <italic>rx3</italic>, <italic>cryaa</italic>) employing sgRNAs with different activities in a multiplexing approach.</p><p>Editing efficiency on the respective loci in this multiplexing experiment was quantified by Illumina sequencing.</p><p>This analysis revealed a different editing efficiency for the different loci of both, the nls-zCas9-nls (Jao et al., 2013) as well as the heiCas9. In all cases, however, heiCas9 performed better than the state-of-the-art Cas9 variant. Interestingly, besides a massive increase in editing events, heiCas9 editing resulted in a clear drop of the allele variance. This indicates that heiCas9 edited more efficiently and acted earlier in development (than the zCas9) resulting in a lower number of different alleles. This is now presented in a new Figure 2 in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Edit manuscript to clearly describe the strengths and weaknesses of the &quot;hei-tagging&quot; method.</p></disp-quote><p>We followed this advice and have included a paragraph in the discussion to clearly describe the strengths and weaknesses of “hei-tagging”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I have a few concerns regarding the way the authors structure and present their claims:</p><p>1) One of the main take home messages (based on the Abstract) is that the hei-tag boosts the activity of a &quot;wide variety&quot; of genome editing tools. Even though the BE data are promising, the manuscript could use more examples (e.g. prime editors, that have been used in zebrafish – Petri et al., 2021). Can the hei-tag make editing possible in cases where it is undetectable with the state of the art tools?</p></disp-quote><p>We toned down this statement in the abstract. In our new Figure 2 we now show multiplexed editing by using sgRNAs of different efficiencies. In all cases, the heiCas9 performed better (more overall editing, fewer different alleles) compared to the reference zCas9 (Jao et al., 2013).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Throughout the manuscript, the authors use only a handful of guides. Adding more examples, especially using guides that show a range of efficiencies with the non-hei-tag Cas9 would provide a better description of the strengths and limitations of the hei-tag.</p></disp-quote><p>We followed the referee’s suggestion and have chosen additional sgRNAs of which one targets an intron (<italic>rx3</italic>) and three sgRNAs with different editing activity targeting exonic sequences (<italic>oca2</italic>, <italic>rx2</italic> and <italic>cryaa</italic>). The respective Illumina sequencing analysis is now included as new main Figure 2 and Supplementary file 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) What is the rationale of using the Cas9 from Hwang et al., and not the zebrafish codon optimised Cas9 from Jao et al?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referee for the suggestion and now use the zCas9 from Jao et al., as reference in our <italic>oca2</italic> analysis pipeline (Figure 1d, g) for which we performed an entirely new set of experiments (transcription, injection and analysis) in medaka and zebrafish. We also use the zCas9 from Jao et al., 2013 as reference in the multiplexing approach in new Figure 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Why do the authors use the GeneArt nuclease as a &quot;state of the art&quot; for the cell culture? What other tags are included in this nuclease? We can see that the worse score in Fig1d comes from JDS246. Not having the hei-tag is only one difference between JDS246 and heiCas9. One other is that heiCas9 lacks the FLAG (Myc-Cas performs already pretty well, however zebrafish data are not shown). How does GeneArt Cas9 compare in that respect? Such information should be presented to readers.</p></disp-quote><p>For cell culture assays, there is only a limited number of commercially available Cas9 nuclease mRNAs to choose from. The exact sequence composition of tags/NLSs of the GeneArt Cas9 mRNA is not further specified by the manufacturer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In Figure 1, what do the single guide results look like? Boosting deletion outcomes using two guides is not the same as boosting activity of single guide editing. Is the activity of both guides improved? Are they just being brought at the same level? Did the authors use sequencing to analyse what happened at the DNA level?</p></disp-quote><p>We now analyze the edited alleles with Illumina sequencing (new Figure 2). Since in this approach we followed other suggestions by the referee, we multiplexed different sgRNAs. Therefore, we decided to pick only one sgRNA for <italic>oca2</italic> (T2). We can show that targeting efficiency using heiCas9 clearly improves over the zCas9 from Jao et al., 2013 not only in <italic>oca2</italic> but all targeted loci.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The hei-tag could be affecting editing outcomes, rather than ON target activity. In Figure S1, it is clear that the frequency of the in frame -15 allele is reduced, while overall efficiency in not dramatically affected. Changing the editing profile by using different nucleases (variants) is not the same as boosting efficiency in KO. The in-frame indels could be favored in other sites, thus reducing KO-score (if out of frame are regarded as desired outcome).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the referee that the increased out-of frame repair seen with the heiCas9 may be locus specific. Nevertheless, the induction of indels using the heiCas9 was dramatically higher compared to the other nucleases employed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Generally, it is advised to use NGS data for strong claims about editing efficiency.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referee and include Illumina sequencing data now in new Figure 2 and Supplementary file 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) If ON-target activity is boosted, increased OFF-target activity is of concern, especially in cell culture when editing accuracy and precision are key. Since the main focus of the authors is not mammalian cell culture or therapeutic applications, they should at least be clear about this limitation.</p></disp-quote><p>We discuss this important point now in the main text where we clearly state this potential limitation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Several reports in zebrafish have shown that Cas9/gRNA complexes injections can reach gene editing up to 100% in F0 embryos including when targeting multiple loci at the same time (See for instance Wu et al., 2018 and Kroll et al., 2021). In light of these impressive results the utility of the present method for the fish community is overstated at best without mentioning these points anywhere in the discussion.</p><p>The authors should attempt to compare the injection of heiCAS9 protein as this is the current preferred and most efficient method in the fish community.</p></disp-quote><p>We want to kindly point out that especially in the medaka community, protein injection of effectors of most kinds is not the common protocol. In case of targeted genome editing, also Cas9 and BaseEditors are usually provided as mRNA.</p><p>Following the referees suggestion, we have now compared the most recent variant of the IDT Cas9 protein (Alt-R S.p.Cas9 V3) in similar concentrations as used by Wu et al., 2018, Dev Cell (5µM) and Kroll et al., 2021, <italic>eLife</italic> (24µM) and equimolar to the mRNA molecule concentration we use (1.765µM) to heiCas9 mRNA injections (new Figure 1d). This clearly demonstrates that in medaka, mRNA injection with the heiCas9 variant is equally effective compared to protein injections.</p><p>The benefits of using mRNA over protein injections are: cost-efficiency, flexibility in generating variants, easier handling of the injection mix (24µM and 5µM protein concentrations are very viscous, often leading to needle clogging and hence affecting injection throughput and success).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the present manuscript is not clear what is the purpose of the Myc tag in the construct. This is not used at all to visualize protein localization or purification. Do the authors believe that the addition of Myc increases Cas9 activity? If not giving that this is a method paper they should demonstrate the utility in this specific contest.</p></disp-quote><p>The Myc-tag was initially included to facilitate straight forward protein purification. Strikingly, the injection of mRNA of this construct already dramatically increased knock-out efficiencies eliminating the need for protein purification.</p><p>We performed a permutation screen of NLSs, Myc-tag and linkers and addressed the impact on knock-out efficiency. This resulted in the identification of the hei-tag (myc, flexilinker, oNLS) described here. To provide this information to the community, we now include this screen in Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The zebrafish experiment lacks the comparison of the heicas9 with the most efficient myc-Cas9 leading to an overestimation to the improved efficiency of the construct.</p></disp-quote><p>By suggestion of referee #1 we now have changed the reference Cas9 to “the zebrafish codon optimised Cas9 from Jao et al., 2013” in the oca2 knock-out screen and have adapted the medaka injections as well. Interestingly in zebrafish, zCas9 was not significantly better than the earliest Cas9 version (“JDS246”) – see updated Figure 1. In medaka however, the zCas9 performed well but clearly less efficient than the heiCas9.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally methodological papers based on a single locus are difficult to appreciate as they may be influenced by &quot;the gambler's luck&quot; (i.e. the chosen locus cold be a fortunate pick). These results should be extended to other genes as it's standard in the field (see the two publications above).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referee for the point raised here and now included 3 more sgRNAs with different activity and position (intronic/exonic). In all cases, heiCas9 not only performed more efficiently compared to the zCas9 from Jao et al., but also generated fewer different alleles over all modified alleles detected in the Illumina sequencing (see new Figure 2 and Supplementary file 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally the base editor experiment are equally strongly biased. The comparison with BE4-Gam is not representative of the current state of the art were several reports using ancBE4Max (See for instance Carrington et al., 2020, Zao et al., 2020 and Rosello et al., 2021) show highly improved results. In lights of these papers the statement &quot;Notably, in heiBE4-Gam injections, for each of the three cytosines in the base editing window, the C-to-T transition rate was higher than 60%, a level never observed in BE4-Gam injected embryos&quot; is not true as similar or higher level of C to T conversion have been reported. Again this a comparison with ancBE4Max should be extended to multiple loci.</p></disp-quote><p>The referee is right and we changed the indicated sentence. We feel that we need to clarify our rationale here (as we did in the amended main text): it was not our intention to generate “the best editor”. The activity of most recent editors clearly plateaus at the standard concentrations. Our intention rather was to show that a little tag can boost activity, which is easier detected in the exponential phase. We therefore used a version of the BaseEditor that has not reached its activity plateau to address this point. We now clearly state this in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. In the abstract, the authors introduced factors that leave room for the improvement of gene editing efficiency in CRISPR/Cas9 tools: (1) nuclear localization signal -citing Cong et al., 2013; and (2) protein tags for &quot;immediate detection or straight-forward purification&quot; and linkers to &quot;avoid steric hinderance impacting on activity&quot; -citing Zhang et al., 2014. However, such conclusions were never made in either of the originally cited papers. Cong et al., did not compare the editing activity with and without a NLS signal. On the contrary, there are partial evidence indicating that Cas9 protein may not require an NLS to assist import into the nucleus (Hu et al., G3, 2018). In Zhang et al., it was suspected that the addition of a flag or myc tag changed the charge distribution of the Cas9 protein, thus increasing its specificity and efficacy. No statement was made about the purification or the linker. It is OK to introduce the relevant background, but I find it problematic to misinterpret the cited literature to show conclusions they did not make.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referee for the comment and have carefully revised the manuscript to avoid the problems indicated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors used modified version of NLS in the hei-tag construct to facilitate early nuclear targeting, while a straight-forward way to make nuclear-targeted Cas9 available in the cell is to directly inject the (nuclear-targeting) Cas9 protein. The authors should either provide this control experiment, or clarify why they only chose to build RNA-based systems.</p></disp-quote><p>We now have included a comparison to protein/sgRNA complex injections in Figure 1. Following the referees suggestion, we have now compared the most recent variant of the IDT Cas9 protein (Alt-R S.p.Cas9 V3) in similar concentrations as used by Wu et al., 2018, Dev Cell (5µM) and Kroll et al., 2021, <italic>eLife</italic> (24µM) and equimolar to the mRNA molecule concentration we use (1.765µM) to heiCas9 mRNA injections (new figure 1d).

It is widely known that the gRNA design is a critical factor affecting the gene editing efficiency. While hei-tag shows an increased bi-allelic editing efficiency than the control constructs, it is not clear whether this boost is universal with different targeted genes and different sgRNA designs.</p></disp-quote><p>We followed the referee’s suggestion and have chosen additional sgRNAs of which one targets an intron (rx3) and three sgRNAs with different editing activity targeting exonic sequences (oca2, rx2 and cryaa). The respective Illumina sequencing analysis is now included as new main figure 2 (and Supplementary file 3). In all cases, heiCas9 outperformed the reference.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. JDS246-Cas9 was chosen as the baseline construct to evaluate the boost of editing efficiency. Given this was a construct originally made for mammalian cells, it is not clear whether it represents the state-of-art editing techniques, especially in zebrafish. While it is unrealistic to test all the available tools, other systems have been reported with high bi-allelic editing efficiency specifically in zebrafish should be introduced as a control (e.g. Jao et al., 2013, PNAS -disclaimer: the reviewer was not a maker of this tool).</p></disp-quote><p>We now have included the comparison to “the zebrafish codon optimised Cas9 from Jao et al.” and have adapted the medaka injections as well (Figure 1).

In medaka however, the zCas9 performed very well but clearly less efficient than the heiCas9. The Cas9 we use in our constructs is mammalian codon optimized, and stellar also in zebrafish.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.
