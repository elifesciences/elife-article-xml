cortex, has been proposed as a potential target for artificial vision. At present, it is unknown whether optogenetic LGN stimulation is sufficient to elicit behaviorally relevant percepts, and the properties of LGN neural responses relevant for artificial vision have not been thoroughly characterized. Here, we demonstrate that tree shrews pretrained on a visual detection task can detect optogenetic LGN activation using an AAV2-CamKIIα-ChR2 construct and readily generalize from visual to optogenetic detection. Simultaneous recordings of LGN spiking activity and primary visual cortex (V1) local field potentials (LFPs) during optogenetic LGN stimulation show that LGN neurons reliably follow optogenetic stimulation at frequencies up to 60 Hz and uncovered a striking phase locking between the V1 LFP and the evoked spiking activity in LGN. These phase relationships were maintained over a broad range of LGN stimulation frequencies, up to 80 Hz, with spike field coherence values favoring higher frequencies, indicating the ability to relay temporally precise information to V1 using light activation of the LGN. Finally, V1 LFP responses showed sensitivity values to LGN optogenetic activation that were similar to the animal’s behavioral performance. Taken together, our findings confirm the LGN as a potential target for visual prosthetics in a highly visual mammal closely related to primates.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>visual prosthetics</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>tree shrew</kwd><kwd><italic>T. belangeri</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>182504</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rainer</surname><given-names>Gregor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005869</institution-id><institution>University of Fribourg</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rainer</surname><given-names>Gregor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The visual thalamus is a promising target for neural prosthetic intervention aimed at the restoration of visual function.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Vision loss is widespread and rapidly progressing worldwide due to an aging population, with over 45 million people suffering from blindness in 2020 and over 55 million cases forecast for 2050 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bourne et al., 2021</xref>). For many eye diseases, including glaucoma, macular degeneration, and retinitis pigmentosa, there are no available treatments, and they progressively lead to complete loss of vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Roska and Sahel, 2018</xref>). It has been shown that prosthetic electrical stimulation in visual structures can produce visual percepts, in the form of phosphenes, and at least partially restore visual function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mills et al., 2017</xref>). To date, the most advanced of these approaches are retinal implants, with sub- and epiretinal approaches that have both been extensively tested in human patients. Despite considerable progress, the percepts generated by these prostheses remain far from natural vision, and many patients stop using their implants and often report limited improvements in quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ho et al., 2015</xref>). It is interesting to note that phosphenes tend to vary substantially in terms of their appearance between patients, but they do not change much with time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Erickson-Davis and Korzybska, 2021</xref>). This suggests that differences in percept may result not from neural plasticity but rather from variations in device implantation such that slightly different parts of the retinal circuitry are activated by the implant in each individual. Indeed, the retina is a highly complex computational engine containing dozens of distinct, specialized cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Masland, 2012</xref>), and electrical stimulation is not cell-type specific and can trigger activation in any neurons within a defined volume around the electrode tip. Another pertinent limitation relates to the size of the retinal implants, which can cover only up to about 20° of visual angle such that patients must make head movements to repeatedly scan the environment during locomotion to detect obstacles, walls or doors. The interpretation of phosphenes generated by retinal prosthetic devices generally does not becomes effortless or intuitive, but continues to require considerable cognitive resources and effort. Nevertheless, technical advances under development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chenais et al., 2021</xref>) may certainly enhance the usefulness of retinal implants in the future.</p><p>The primary visual cortex (V1) has also been investigated as a target for electrical visual prosthetics due to attractive features such as its large surface area and could enable highly precise representations of the visual environment using suitable stimulation arrays. Early work in this area has demonstrated proof of principle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brindley, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dobelle et al., 1976</xref>) that electrical activation of V1 can elicit phosphene percepts, and there has been resurgent interest in cortical visual prostheses in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lewis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bosking et al., 2017</xref>). For example, it was recently shown that monkeys could detect, and make saccades to, V1 stimulation at particular retinotopic sites, as well as interpret multielectrode stimulation in the context of a learned visuomotor association task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). This work relied on the implantation of over 1000 penetrating electrodes in multiple arrays in visual cortex, highlighting the technical challenge of achieving broad coverage for optimizing visual prosthetic stimulation. In another recent study, blind human subjects readily identified sequential electrical activation on a rectangular grid of flexible electrodes spaced 1 cm apart that represented letter symbols, whereas simultaneous electrical activation was much harder to comprehend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beauchamp et al., 2020</xref>). This latter finding suggests more generally that sequential patterned activation across multiple sites could be highly useful in producing more coherent percepts. Numerous issues remain however in relation to cortical electrical visual prostheses, including problematic surgical access to the large part of V1 that is buried in the calcarine sulcus and particularly for penetrating electrodes, potential damage caused by the electrodes during implantation, long-term stability of the electrode-neural interface, and risk of triggering seizures due to the highly recurrently connected nature of the cortex. An advantage of V1 prosthetics is that they are more general and can be applied also in eye disorders where the retinal ganglion cells are damaged, such as glaucoma. This same advantage would also apply to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus, where the ganglion cell axons synapse onto the thalamocortical neurons whose axons deliver visual information to cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meikle and Wong, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pezaris and Eskandar, 2009</xref>). Indeed, electrical activation of LGN has been shown to activate V1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Panetsos et al., 2011</xref>), and LGN activation can be detected by monkeys, who are able to saccade reliably to the corresponding visual field location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pezaris and Reid, 2007</xref>). In terms of prosthetics, the LGN has another advantage in that it is a six layered retinotopically organized nucleus where information pathways are segregated and could therefore be specifically targeted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Conway and Schiller, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sherman et al., 1975</xref>). However, the LGN is a deep brain structure far from the cortical surface and has to date not been much studied in terms of prosthetic applications.</p><p>Gene therapy and optogenetics have also brought novel approaches for combating eye diseases. For example, the light-sensitive channel-rhodopsin protein was expressed in retinal ganglion cells of a patient suffering from photoreceptor loss due to retinitis pigmentosa, leading to recovery of some visual function using suitable illumination via goggles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sahel et al., 2021</xref>). Optogenetics also opens another avenue for vision restoration, combining viral delivery to activate elements of the visual pathway with patterned laser or LED light stimulation to produce visual percepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">van Wyk et al., 2015</xref>). The cell-type specificity of optogenetics is likely to confer advantages compared to electrical stimulation as only cell types of interest can be activated. Both cortex and LGN, for example, contain numerous inhibitory interneurons, whose activation may hamper the efficacy of prosthetic stimulation.</p><p>In this study, we focus on the LGN as a potential target of optogenetic restoration of vision using optogenetic activation of thalamocortical projecting neurons. We employ ChR2 coupled to the CamKIIα promotor as it is known to induce activation as well as plasticity in excitatory neurons in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shibata et al., 2021</xref>). We characterize opsin expression in LGN and V1 and assess the impact of opsin activation on both LGN circuit activity, and behavioral detection task performance linked to optogenetic activation. We use tree shrews as an animal model in this study, as they are a diurnal mammalian species closely related to primates that have multiple advantages for the translational study of visual prosthetics. For example, tree shrew V1 has a large surface area of 4000 mm<sup>2</sup> and exhibits orientation columns and shares many other aspects of functional organization with primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fitzpatrick, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khani et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mohan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Veit et al., 2011</xref>). Their retina is composed largely of cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Muller et al., 1989</xref>), which is useful for prosthetic work as humans tend to illuminate their environments; they are a diurnal mammal that is highly reliant on vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Emmons, 2000</xref>) and can readily be trained on cognitive visually based behavioral tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mustafar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schumacher et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Anatomical and functional validation of viral transfection</title><p>We performed immunohistochemistry for CaMKIIα and show robust staining of cell bodies in all LGN layers (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> for an example animal and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> for additional animals), which indicates that this promotor could be a useful target for optogenetic activation of tree shrew LGN neurons. We complemented this with parvalbumin (PV) immunohistochemistry, which is useful for delineating LGN laminar structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, center panel). We observed that PV expression varied somewhat across LGN layers, with particularly strong expression in layer 4 and weaker expression in layers 3 and 6. These observations are consistent with previous reports in the tree shrew documenting paler parvalbumin staining in layers 3 and 6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Diamond et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Usrey et al., 1992</xref>), and support the notion that laminar LGN structure is more readily discernible using PV rather than CamKIIα immunohistochemistry. We injected adeno-associated (AAV2) virus that contained a construct for the light-sensitive ion channel ChR2 and the enhanced red fluorescent protein mCherry under the control of the CamKIIα promotor into the tree shrew LGN of animals used for behavioral or electrophysiological studies. We found robust expression of CamKIIα-ChR2 within LGN layers in the vicinity of the injection site including on cell bodies, for example, targeting inner LGN layers 1, 2, and 3 for a medial LGN injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> for additional animals). We also observed clear labeling of thalamocortical axons in layers 2/3 and 4 of V1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> for an example animal and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> for additional animals). In fact, both V1 cortical recipient layers contain axons expressing CamKIIα-ChR2, which highlights that neurons in both LGN layer groups 3/6 as well as 1/2/4/5 robustly express the light-sensitive ion channel as these project respectively to V1 layers 3 and 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Van Hooser et al., 2013</xref>). Note that in macaques, CamKIIα is expressed mostly in interlaminar LGN layers, which are composed of konio-type relay neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benson et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Klein et al., 2016</xref>), such that the CamKIIα-positive population activates a more restricted group of thalamocortical projections in macaques compared to tree shrews.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Validation of CaMKIIα and ChR2 expression in tree shrew lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Confocal images of tree shrew LGN immunostained for both <italic>CaMKIIα</italic> (left) and parvalbumin (center), with the merge shown at right.

Results for an example recording site are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, illustrating entrainment of LGN spiking activity to light transients at several frequencies of stimulation. Frequency analysis of the evoked spike trains reveals clear peaks at the stimulation frequency, as well as harmonics. Note that at the 80 Hz stimulation frequency, the neural response adapts rapidly, and the neuron tends to respond only to the onset of stimulation; a finding that is expected due to ChR2 channel dynamics, but indeed also resembles the activation profile to high-frequency visual flicker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Veit et al., 2011</xref>). The LGN can be activated in tonic or burst mode, which favors either stimulus fidelity or detectability respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2002</xref>). Action potentials in both cases, however, convey stimulus-specific information to the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ortuño et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Reinagel et al., 1999</xref>). We therefore examined to what degree the optogenetic activation triggered bursts in our recordings. We recorded from 120 single units in the LGN and defined a burst as two or more action potentials with inter-spike intervals of &lt;4 ms, and preceded by at least 50 ms without spiking activity. For the example neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), bursts were rarely triggered and burst percentage of total spikes amounted to 0.7 ± 0.3%, with other recorded neurons also in this range (n = 7, range: 0.03–3.0%). Optogenetic LGN activation thus elicited mostly tonic spikes, consistent with reports of a moderate propensity for bursting in tree shrew LGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wei et al., 2011</xref>). In order to assess to what degree LGN neurons were phase-locked to the optogenetic stimulation, we calculated phase-locking vector strength (see ‘Materials and methods’). We found 12 LGN neurons in two animals that were significantly phase-locked (Rayleigh test p&lt;0.05) at least at one of the flicker frequencies and across this population the magnitude of phase locking did not differ significantly over the four frequencies tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Tree shrew LGN layers are specialized for ON- and OFF-type visual inputs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Conway and Schiller, 1983</xref>), responding to onset of bright and dark targets with respect to background illumination, respectively. Local recordings of LGN neural activity at the site of light stimulation can thus be used to functionally identify the stimulated layer, as illustrated for 1 Hz and 5 Hz full-field bright visual stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

Animals were thus in a defined position before and during visual target presentation, allowing us to assess their visual capacities in different parts of the visual field without the requirement of head fixation. We used a 2° visual stimulus composed of a cloud of moving white dots to facilitate the subsequent transition to the optogenetic stimulation detection task. Although artificial visual percepts can take on a variety of forms, they correspond better to moving clouds of dots rather than oriented bars or grating stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fernández et al., 2021</xref>). Behavioral data for an example tree shrew is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> for a daily session consisting of 200 trials. It is evident that the animals’ response times are narrowly distributed and largely follow the target onset time marked by the thick oblique line with a median response time of 290 ms and an overall correct performance of 76%. Our task did not contain any signal absent trials to avoid compromising animals’ motivation for task performance, but we nevertheless used signal detection theory to estimate sensitivity and bias (see ‘Materials and methods’). Briefly, trials where animals responded within 500 ms of target onset were designated as ‘hits,’ whereas responses made during an identical time window where no targets occurred were assigned as ‘false alarms,’ with corresponding ‘miss’ and ‘correct rejection’ assignments.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Detection of a visual moving dot stimulus.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Illustration of the experimental setup.

Positive and negative bias values signal preponderance of ‘miss’ and ‘false alarm’ type errors, respectively.

As tree shrews have a wide visual field, we investigated eccentricities of up to 150° in four tree shrews, studying a single eccentricity in a single behavioral session. All animals readily generalized detection performance up to 120° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>), with performance declining at 150°, the highest eccentricity tested, in all except one animal (959), which detected these peripheral moving dot stimuli without apparent problems. Note that slight differences in head position, estimated at ± 15°, cannot be ruled out in the nose poke task, so eccentricity values are not exact as they would be with head fixation. Eccentricity effects were studied in only a single session per eccentricity value; however, all tree shrews generalized significantly from the center position to eccentric stimulus presentation (<italic>t</italic>-tests comparing d' at four studied eccentricities against zero, p&lt;0.01). Bias tended to increase with eccentricity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>) as animals increasingly missed targets. Taken together, behavioral data on the visual detection task indicates that tree shrews can acquire this task and generalize across the visual field in a freely moving unrestrained behavioral setting, achieving d' values of up to 2.5 within a week of training.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Detecting optogenetic activation of CaMKIIα neurons in the LGN</title><p>We next moved on to study if tree shrews pretrained on visual detection of a moving dot visual stimulus could also detect optogenetic activation in the LGN in the context of the same nose poke task. We initially performed some preliminary tests for detection of optogenetic activation using several frequencies (4, 10, 20, and 50 Hz) and amplitudes (3, 6.5 and 10 mW) in five tree shrews. We used a single combination of frequency and amplitude in each session, presented in randomized order using a wireless, subdermal radiofrequency-powered stimulation probe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shin et al., 2017</xref>). An example of behavioral performance for a tree shrew implanted in the LGN (animal 1111) during a single session is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, corresponding to a behavioral performance of 63% correct trials with a median response time of 260 ms and a somewhat broader distribution compared to the visual detection task. Using the same procedure as above, we used signal detection theory to compute sensitivity (d') and bias for the optogenetic stimulation trials. Results for three tree shrews with AAV2 injections and LED implanted in the LGN (tree shrew 959, 1111, and 1409) and two tree shrews injected and implanted in control areas outside of the LGN (globus pallidus and zona incerta brain areas for tree shrews 2009, 6244) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref> for sensitivity and bias. We note that LGN-implanted animals achieved d' sensitivity values around ≥1.0, whereas d' did not surpass 0.5 in control animals implanted outside the LGN (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> for a comparison of maximum d’ values in visual and optogenetic detection tasks). This suggests that tree shrews can readily detect optogenetic activation of the visual thalamocortical pathway. Generally, higher amplitudes of stimulation tended to be detected most readily, as would be expected. In terms of light stimulation frequency, two animals (1111, 1409) appeared to respond best to 10 Hz stimulation while for one animal (959) the preferred frequency was 50 Hz. While it is possible that these results might be related to individual animal strategy toward interpreting the optogenetic stimulation, as has been reported also for humans in work using electrical stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Erickson-Davis and Korzybska, 2021</xref>), they may well result from slight differences in spatial placement of the optic fiber relative to the transfected LGN neurons that can lead to hyperstimulation and reduced responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kittelmann et al., 2013</xref>). Importantly, tree shrews showed evidence for rapid generalization from the visual to the optogenetic stimulation. This is demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>, where the d' values are shown for sessions with different amplitude and frequency combinations in serial order of occurrence; the same order was used in each animal. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref> shows the performance during the first day of optogenetic LGN activation (10 Hz frequency at 10 mW) for the three tree shrews, illustrating best generalization from the visual detection task (tree shrew 1111) already early during the session, as well as a trend for within-session behavioral improvement particularly in the other two tree shrews (animals 959 and 1409). To examine variability and reproducibility of optogenetic stimulus detection across sessions in individual tree shrews, we performed multiple sessions in each of the three animals using the preferred stimulation frequency for each animal at 10 mW amplitude, as well as an additional animal (1806) for which we used 10 Hz stimulation. The results, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, highlight that tree shrews reliably detected optogenetic stimulation as evidenced by significant d' values (two-way ANOVA main effect, p&lt;0.01). A significant effect of bias between animals is apparent (one-way ANOVA, p&lt;0.05), suggestive of differences in strategy during the optogenetic detection task, with tree shrew 1409 showing significantly negative bias.

To achieve this, we first determined the receptive field location of the LGN at the site of virus injection, and then performed a V1 electrode penetration at a position that corresponded to the retinotopic position of LGN activation. We then analyzed neural spiking in terms of multi-unit activity (MUA) in LGN and V1, focusing on the sustained response during the 40 Hz 50% duty cycle optogenetic activation period. We observed significant activation in 22 out of 111 LGN MUA sites, but only in 5 of 111 V1 MUA sites (paired <italic>t</italic>-tests: p&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Many of the activated LGN sites showed a robust, short latency response motif to stimulation (see example unit in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), while our recordings contained only relatively weakly modulated V1 MUA sites at short latency. We observed that the MUA at some LGN and V1 sites exhibited offset responses following the termination of the light stimulation (LGN: n = 16, V1: n = 8, paired <italic>t</italic>-tests: p&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Robust offset responses were evident in both LGN and V1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) and had response latencies of around 50 ms following the cessation of stimulation in both areas, consistent with a neural circuit origin of these effects involving recurrent processing and inhibitory modulations. The unit data highlights that LGN optogenetic stimulation robustly drives local units, and while it was more difficult to isolate V1 units directly modulated by optogenetic stimulation, possibly due to incomplete overlap of the stimulated thalamocortical recipient zone with the receptive field of the V1 MUA activity.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Two response motifs in lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and V1 following optogenetic excitation of LGN CaMKIIα neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) and (<bold>B</bold>) show, respectively, sustained, low latency-type responses and those showing only ‘OFF’-type responses in LGN (blue) and V1 (red).

While the success rate of finding V1 units whose activity was modulated by LGN activation was low (see above), V1 LFPs were strongly modulated by stimulation in the LGN, as is shown by comparing the peak in the Fourier spectrum during the 40 Hz stimulation condition to the pre-stimulation baseline period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Indeed, 29/111 V1 sites showed significant 40 Hz entrainment (paired <italic>t</italic>-test: p&lt;0.01), and traces from an example site illustrate high-amplitude 40 Hz oscillations during stimulation on two single trials as well as the average across repetitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). These V1 sites were thus clearly within the thalamocortical recipient zone with significant receptive field overlap between LGN and V1 sites. The thalamic LFPs were by comparison rather insensitive to light stimulation, with only 11/111 sites showing significant modulations (paired <italic>t</italic>-test: p&lt;0.01; χ<sup>2</sup>-test comparing LGN and V1; p&lt;0.01, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). This is also evident in single trial and averaged LGN LFP traces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), where, although significant, the oscillations are quite modest in amplitude, similar to reports in macaque (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bastos et al., 2014</xref>). Endogenously generated LFPs during the baseline period in LGN were much lower in magnitude than in V1 (for 40 Hz unpaired <italic>t</italic>-tests: p&lt;&lt;0.001) since unlike V1 the LGN does not possess systematically aligned dendritic structures that underlie LFP activations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rainer, 2019</xref>).

An example trace of the V1 LFP from a single trial during LGN activation is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, with LGN spike times denoted by red vertical lines on the trace. From this example, it is apparent that LGN spikes were shortly followed by sharp negative deflections in the cortical LFP consistent with triggering activation of thalamocortical projections. This can be seen in the average STA, where a strong phase-locked relationship was present at the stimulation frequency of 40 Hz (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), which is recapitulated in a different measure of functional neural coupling, the spike field coherence (SFC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>), showing clear peaks at both the fundamental and the first harmonic of the 40 Hz stimulation frequency. Indeed, out of a population of 22 V1 sites that showed significant increases in 40 Hz power following optogenetic activation, 9 of these sites also exhibited significant coherence with LGN spiking at 40 Hz (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Note that V1 sites lacking oscillatory entrainment are most likely explained by only partial receptive field overlap between LGN and V1 sites. We took the time of first negative peak of the STA as the response latency to the thalamic spikes, M = 3.8 ± 1.5 ms (n = 9), with no significant difference across stimulation frequencies (p&gt;0.05, one-way ANOVA), which suggests that the LGN is capable of monosynaptically driving V1 oscillatory activity at least up to 80 Hz without significant degradation of the entrainment. These functional coupling results thus support the notion that CaMKIIα thalamocortical projections can activate V1 circuits.</p><p>For a limited set of recordings, we explored the impact of variations in light stimulation frequency on V1 LFPs while maintaining 50% duty cycle and thus keeping overall light illumination constant across conditions. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref> we show trial-averaged evoked LFPs for 30, 40, 60 and 80 Hz optogenetic stimulation, revealing notable frequency-specific modulations whose amplitude is inversely correlated with frequency, as is indeed generally the case for brain potentials. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, the evoked Fourier spectral peak is compared to the control condition, for a set of 16 sites. At 30 Hz frequency, only 3/16 sites were significantly modulated in spite of the high overall amplitude of the induced modulations, likely because endogenously generated activations were already relatively prominent at this frequency. With increasing frequency, we found that a number of sites exhibited pronounced and significantly elevated spectral peaks at the stimulation frequency, consistent with direct thalamocortical drive reaching the V1 site (e.g. nine sites at 80 Hz stimulation, paired <italic>t</italic>-test: p&lt;0.01). At 80 Hz, four additional sites showed more moderate, but still significant evoked spectral peaks, likely due to the V1 site being somewhat distant to the thalamocortical recipient zone. We used the Fourier results to compute hit and false alarm rates assessing the capacity of V1 sites to detect optogenetic stimulation by comparing the spectral peak at stimulation frequency (f<sub>stim</sub>) to a control frequency at f<sub>stim</sub>-3 Hz (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, ‘Materials and mmethods’). We found higher frequency stimulation tended to result in enhanced hit rates and reduced false alarm rates. Converting these data to d' values, we found that indeed the sensitivity of V1 sites increased significantly with light stimulation frequency, reaching values of d' ≈ 2.0 at 80 Hz. Note that for the frequencies used in the behavioral studies up to 50 Hz, the sensitivity of V1 LFPs appears to generally correspond to the sensitivity of the tree shrews at the behavioral level, that is, values in the range of 1–1.5. A caveat is that V1 LFPs were recorded during general anesthesia, such that in the awake state additional endogenous activations might possibly reduce or enhance the d' sensitivity. Previous data suggests that membrane depolarization triggered by ChR2 light stimulation are attenuated with increasing stimulation frequencies upward of 10 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Erofeev et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tchumatchenko et al., 2013</xref>). While robust transmembrane currents remain at 100 Hz light stimulation, these are attenuated by a factor of around 70-fold relative to 10 Hz stimulation compared to a 10-fold attenuation for 50 Hz light stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Malyshev et al., 2015</xref>), and attenuation can be dependent on cell type and choice of AAV delivery system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jackman et al., 2014</xref>). The entrainment observed in this study nevertheless indicates that CamKIIα-ChR2 expression in LGN neurons permits efficient activation of thalamocortical projections up to at least 80 Hz stimulation frequency, and that V1 LFPs are sufficiently sensitive to permit accurate single-trial detection of LGN optogenetic stimulation.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Sensitivity of V1 local field potentials (LFPs) are frequency dependent.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) V1 LFPs averaged over 20 trials at the four stimulation frequencies, 30, 40, 60, and 80 Hz, from bottom to top.

This previous study used a visually guided saccade task instead of the nose-poke detection paradigm in our study, but essentially both tasks permit the characterization of behavioral responses to natural and artificial visual percepts across the visual field. As did the macaques in the previous study, tree shrews quickly generalized from the visual to the optogenetic task, suggestive of a visual nature of the evoked artificial percept. The overall task performance we observed for optogenetic stimulation remained somewhat lower than the values observed during visual stimulation, suggesting that artificially induced percepts were overall less readily detectable than visually induced percepts at the high contrast employed in this study. Since V1 responses scale with stimulus contrast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bhattacharyya et al., 2013</xref>), artificial stimulation detectability thus matches visual detectability at low to intermediate contrast values. We observed some interindividual variability between tree shrews in terms of initial acquisition of the optogenetic stimulation detection task, as well as in terms of behavioral strategy after learning as demonstrated by differences in bias. Indeed, it has been shown that for macaques, extensive training on detection of electrical microstimulation in V1 can be detrimental for detection of visual stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ni and Maunsell, 2010</xref>), consistent with an important role of behavioral strategy during optogenetic stimulus processing. We found some variability in terms of optimal stimulation frequency between animals, probably related to variations in factors such as virus expression and LED probe placement. Indeed, computational modeling work relating to V1 suggests that the spatiotemporal configuration of light delivery and virus transfected neural elements including dendrites plays a crucial role in how optogenetic activation is translated into cortical activity and ultimately perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antolik et al., 2021</xref>). Further work extending computational modeling of electrical activations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jawwad et al., 2017</xref>) to optogenetics in the LGN is necessary toward ideally refining the models to integrate available experimental data. Our present results suggest that optogenetic LGN stimulation, up to the light intensities tested here, produces robust artificial percepts that tree shrews can reliably detect in a suitable behavioral paradigm. Increasing stimulation intensity further may be one option to further enhance performance as long as this does not cause tissue damage, nonspecific activation due to heating or undesirable loss of spatial selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stujenske et al., 2015</xref>). Note that overly strong LGN stimulation is in any case undesirable as it has been shown to deactivate visual brain areas downstream of V1 for electrical stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Logothetis et al., 2010</xref>), which would certainly compromise goal-directed behaviors based on artificial visual percepts.</p><p>There are other more principled factors that might limit the detectability of optogenetic or electrical stimulation since these methods will activate populations of nearby neurons that might not be coactivated during natural vision, triggering comparatively diffuse and weak phosphene percepts and complicating behavioral decision-making based upon artificial stimulation. For example, since visually responsive ON- and OFF pathways are intermingled in LGN and layer 4 of V1 in most species including primates, artificial stimulation necessarily co-activates both contrast channels, which never occurs in natural vision since a part of the visual field can be bright or dark but not both at the same time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beyeler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nguyen et al., 2016</xref>). Such coactivation will thus produce cortical activation patterns not encountered during natural vision, potentially explaining the perceptual performance decrement for artificial vision. In the tree shrew LGN, ON- and OFF neurons tend to be segregated in separate layers, with layers 1 and 2 containing ON cells, layers 4–5 containing OFF cells, layer 3 containing a mixed population, and layer 6 containing ON/OFF cells with an inhibitory surround <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Conway and Schiller, 1983</xref>; note that we have adopted the conventional labeling of the LGN layers as 1–6 from medial to lateral, whereas in Conway this ordering is reversed. Since our viral injections spanned the LGN layers, we did not specifically target ON- or OFF pathways as our focus was obtaining proof of feasibility related to the perception of LGN activation. Future experiments, targeting, for example, exclusively ON layers 4–5 of tree shrew LGN, could, however, address the issue of specific contribution of ON/OFF activation in artificial vision. We predict that such stimulation might trigger artificial percepts to which animals exhibit elevated d' sensitivity values more similar to those for natural visual stimuli, and that detection performance under these conditions will be more sensitive to a visual masking stimulus containing dark structure rather than bright structure on a gray background. The functional anatomy of the tree shrew visual pathway permits a systematic investigation of this issue, providing an intermediate step before the issue can be addressed in macaques where LGN layers are not segregated into ON and OFF pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schiller and Malpeli, 1978</xref>), in a translational neuroscience context toward eventual human clinical application development.</p><p>Our simultaneous recordings in LGN and V1 provide a number of interesting insights into the circuit activations triggered by optogenetic LGN stimulation. We found neural spiking activations linked to optogenetic stimulation particularly in LGN and for a small number of neurons also in V1. While most neurons were activated by the onset of LGN optogenetic stimulation (ON-type response), a minority of neurons interestingly exhibited significant OFF-type responses and were thus activated when the optogenetic stimulation ceased. OFF-type responses are commonly observed to visual stimulation, for example, in the macaque (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bair et al., 2002</xref>), where they tend to occur with shorter latencies than ON-type responses in both LGN and V1. In our study, we found the opposite effect for optogenetic stimulation in that the OFF responses were delayed compared to ON responses with longer latencies of about 50 ms in both LGN and V1. Bair and colleagues argue that due to the shorter latency and lower stimulus-linked variability, OFF responses might in fact serve as a reference signal for temporal segregation of information by the visual system. Altered OFF responses following optogenetic stimulation might thus complicate perception and behavioral stimulus interpretation in artificial vision. The apparently inverted dynamics between natural and artificial visual stimulation is therefore of interest and will need to be investigated further, for example, in terms of dependence of activated cell type, as it reveals a divergence in dynamic neural circuit activation between these two stimulation conditions.</p><p>In order to further understand the impact of optogenetic activation of CaMKIIα LGN neurons on V1 activity we examined the STA and SFC of the V1 LFP using optogenetically triggered LGN spiking as the reference. We found that laser-induced spikes in the LGN were reliably followed by depth negative potentials in V1 at a latency of ≈3 ms, which is similar to the latency of the V1 excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) triggered by monosynaptic input from LGN neurons reported in the cat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sedigh-Sarvestani et al., 2017</xref>). As the LFP is thought to primarily reflect synchronized synaptic inputs, this indicates that activation of CaMKIIα LGN neurons is capable of modulating V1 responses at the earliest stages of cortical processing. Additionally, the V1 LFP was spectrally coherent with evoked LGN spiking across the gamma frequency range (30–80 Hz). As discussed above, oscillatory activity in the gamma band has been associated with a number of visual processes, and it is becoming increasingly clear that different frequencies of gamma activity are associated with different stimulus parameters. Here we were capable of tuning the frequency of V1 gamma activity through LGN optogenetic activation, a potentially important step in the development of visual prosthetics. The relationship between LGN spiking and narrow band gamma activity in V1 has previously been shown to be coherent at both the level of V1 EPSC’s, as well as the cortical LFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Saleem et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schneider et al., 2021</xref>). Importantly this coherence is thought to be mitigated strictly by thalamocortical inputs, suggesting that a cortically driven neural prosthetic would be insufficient to generate thalamocortical coherence, which may be critical to the generation of organized visual percepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ribary, 2005</xref>).</p><p>We show that optogenetic stimulation frequency has a profound effect on the detectability of V1 LFP oscillations, such that V1 LFP sensitivity parameter d' is enhanced with increasing stimulation frequency. For example, 80 Hz stimulation triggers much more reliable neural circuit activation than 30 Hz stimulation, suggesting that based on this criterion alone higher stimulation frequencies might be preferable for use in artificial vision. Note that the relationship between LFP gamma oscillations and spiking activity is complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ray and Maunsell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ray and Maunsell, 2010</xref>), but for the purposes of artificial vision we consider that reliable gamma oscillations will generally be accompanied by robust neural spiking activity in V1 circuits. Insight into the potential nature of the evoked percept comes from a recent study that has examined how drift rate of a visually presented stimulus impacts V1 gamma oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Salelkar et al., 2018</xref>). The authors present a dissociation between low (under 40 Hz), narrow-band (50–80 Hz), and high gamma (above 140 Hz) in terms of which drift rate elicited highest oscillatory activity. While low gamma responded optimally to high drift rates, narrow-band gamma had a preference for low drift rates and high gamma tended to prefer intermediate drift rates. Importantly, the most reliable oscillations were evoked in the narrow-band gamma range, as highlighted by the tuning fit quality parameter. Translated to our study, this suggests that 30 Hz optogenetic stimulation, falling in the low gamma range, might trigger fast-drifting phosphene-like percepts, whereas 60–80 Hz stimulation should by contrast trigger intermediate drift-speed phosphenes. Related to this, distinct sensitivity in different gamma bands to spatial frequency (SF) of visual stimuli has also been demonstrated, such that low gamma (25–40 Hz) exhibits preference for high SF, medium gamma (45–60 Hz) prefers medium SF, and high gamma (65–90 Hz) responds best to low SF. Note that while low and medium gamma appear to be generated in V1, high gamma appears to have its origin in the LGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Han et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting that optogenetic stimulation upward of 65 Hz might trigger visual circuit activations more closely resembling endogenous activations caused by visual stimulation. Future studies combining optogenetic and natural visual stimulation are necessary to test these hypotheses and offer an avenue for detailed characterization and optimization of artificially induced percepts.</p><p>In summary, our findings reinforce the idea that the LGN might be a particularly promising target for artificial vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nguyen et al., 2016</xref>). Our findings suggest that the tree shrew, as a small diurnal highly visual mammalian species, appears well suited for translational animal work in the area of visual prosthetics before the validated approaches are tested in macaques and eventually humans. We have started here with optogenetics using the CamKIIα promotor and shown that tree shrews can readily detect light stimulation delivered within the LGN. Expanding the scope to additional promotors, for example, targeting other classes of thalamocortical relay cells, as well as multiple light sources that allow dynamic, sequential activation of neural circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beauchamp et al., 2020</xref>) are highly promising avenues toward a future generation of prosthetic devices. For example, intermittent optogenetic inhibition of LGN inhibitory cells could provide an efficient way to trigger coordinated activation in nearby relay neurons. Our findings show robust expression of light-sensitive opsins in layer 2/3 as well as layer 4 of cortex, opening the possibility of illuminating the thalamocortical axon terminals by light arrays overlying the cortical surface. Such devices can be manufactured as flexible implants, which could eventually deliver stimulation in a significantly less invasive manner compared to implanted electrodes, highlighting a potential advantage of the LGN as a target for artificial vision.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The local ethical committee on animal experimentation (canton of Fribourg) approved all experimental procedures (license number: 33056).</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Ten male and female tree shrews (<italic>Tupaia belangeri</italic>) weighing 235 ± 10 g (0.6–2 years old) participated in the experiments, six in the behavioral studies and four in the neurophysiological studies.

All visual stimuli were presented on a uniform gray background, 2.5 cd/m<sup>2</sup> at a distance of 35 cm. For the visual detection task, animals were trained to wait in the nose poke until a 10° × 10°, 45 cd/m<sup>2</sup> luminance square was projected onto the globe directly ahead of the animal. The target onset times were gradually increased from fixed 250 ms to fixed 250 ms + randomized (0–1500 ms) duration, while concurrently the response window for obtaining a reward was decreased from 1200 ms to 500 ms. Once animals achieved good performance on this task, a cloud of 50 bright dots 0.25° in diameter, moving at 0.3°/s in random directions with a total luminance of 39.4 cd/m<sup>2</sup>, were presented. The moving dot stimulus had a random onset time between 250 and 1750 ms.

We thus partitioned the trials into two halves depending on target onset time, each of 750 ms duration. For onset times from 250 to 1000 ms, responses that occurred after target onset and before the 500 ms response window were assigned as ‘hits,’ and responses occurring after the response window were assigned as ‘misses.’ We then constructed a time window identical to the ‘hit’ window for the second half of the trials with onset times 1000–1750 ms and used this to estimate ‘false alarms.’ In terms of timing, ‘hit’ and ‘false alarm’ windows are indistinguishable to the animal as these windows cover identical time periods, the only difference being that no target occurs in the ‘false alarm’ window. If animals do not respond during the ‘false alarm’ window, the trial is assigned as ‘correct rejection.’ This procedure permits the computation of sensitivity (d') and bias (b) parameters according to signal detection theory for response times generated in a simple detection task.

The optic fiber was connected to a 473 nm blue laser (Changchun New Industries Optoelectronics, China). Laser intensity was set to 3.5 mW using an optical power meter (PM 100D, Thorlabs Newton, NJ). Stimulation was delivered using a duty cycle of 50% controlled by a pulse generator (Rigol, Beaverton, OR).

We generally employed 40 Hz light stimulation frequency, and a subset of recordings were made using a range of frequencies (30, 40, 60, and 80 Hz). Details regarding the number of recordings obtained in each animal are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>. For V1 LFP spectral signal detection analysis, we extract for each single trial the Fourier spectral amplitude (SA) at the stimulation frequency (f<sub>stim</sub> Hz) and control values at f<sub>stim</sub>-3 Hz during baseline and opto-stimulation conditions. We then computed hit rate as the fraction of trials for which SA<sub>opto</sub>(f<sub>stim</sub>) &gt; SA<sub>opto</sub>(f<sub>stim</sub>-3), that is, hits/(hits +misses) during opto-stimulation, and the false alarm rate as the fraction of trials for the spectral peak at stimulation frequency during baseline exceeded the corresponding value during optical stimulation, that is, SA<sub>baseline</sub>(f<sub>stim</sub>) &gt; SA<sub>opto</sub>(f<sub>stim</sub>).</p><table-wrap id="table3" position="float"><label>Table 3.</label><caption><title>Summary of electrophysiological recordings.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Tree shrew</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Total MUA and LFP recordings LGN 40 Hz</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Significant MUA entrainment at 30/40/60/80 Hz LGN</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Significant 40 Hz ‘ON’ and ‘OFF’ responses in LGN</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Significant 40 Hz LFP entrainment in V1</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Significant LFP entrainment at 30/40/60/80 Hz in V1</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Figure panel</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A/B</xref></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">207</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">17</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Not studied</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">8/5</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Not studied</td></tr><tr><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1503</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">47</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Not studied</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">4/2</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">3</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Not studied</td></tr><tr><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1903</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">30</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">2/1 / 1/0</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1/2</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">12</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1/0/2/3</td></tr><tr><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">111</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">17</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">7/9 / 9/10</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">9/7</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">13</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">2/9/9/10</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Total</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">111</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">9/10 / 10/10</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">22/16</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">29</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">3/9/11/13</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>LFP, local field potential; LGN, lateral geniculate nucleus; MUA, multi-unit activity.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Spike-triggered average and spike field coherence</title><p>In order to calculate the STA, we averaged 200 ms epochs of V1 LFPs centered on the LGN spikes.

Whole brains were placed in the same fixative overnight at 4°C, then rinsed three times for 20 min in cold 0.1 M PBS and cryoprotected by immersion in a sucrose gradient (15 and 30% w/v sucrose) until it sank. Brains were blocked and fast frozen in dry-ice chilled isopentane and stored at least overnight at –20°C before proceeding with the cryosectioning. At that point, brains were sectioned into 40-μm-thick coronal sections using a sliding microtome (MICROM HM 440E, Microm International GmbH, Walldorf, Germany). Every third section was preserved in a storage solution (30% ethylene glycol and 30% glycerol in 0.1 M phosphate buffer) at –20°C. To visualize the virus-mediated expression of CaMKIIα-Chr2-mCherry by fluorescence, sections were mounted on Superfrost Plus Adhesion slides (Fisher Scientific AG, Reinach, CH), and cover-slipped using an aqueous Vectashield antifade mounting media with Dapi (Vector Laboratories, Inc, Burlingare, CA, H-1200). Virus expression was imaged using a NanoZoomer 2.0-HT slide scanner (Hamamatsu Photonics), with a 2 × 20 0.75 NA air objective and at a resolution of 0.23 µm/pixel. Visualization and analysis were executed with the NDP.view 2 freeware (Hamamatsu Photonics).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>We performed immunohistochemistry for the specific neuronal markers parvalbumin (PV) and CaMKIIα in the LGN. Cryopreserved free-floating sections were previously washed by rinsing in 0.1 M PBS five times for 20 min. Then sections were subjected to heat-induced antigen retrieval (HIER) in a Tris-EDTA-based solution at pH 9.0. Sections were then permeabilized for 110 min with 0.1 M PBS +0.3% Triton X-100, followed by incubation in blocking solution for 2 hr at room temperature, containing 0.1 M PBS-0.05% Triton X-10, 0.3 M glycine, and 15% normal donkey serum (NDS) (Abcam, AB 7475). Next, sections were incubated with goat anti-CamKIIα polyclonal antibody (3.3 µg/ml; Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc, Regensburg, DE, PAS-19128) and mouse anti-PV (1:5000; Swant, Switzerland; 235Pur) in 0.05% Tween 20, 7% NDS, and 0.02% NaN<sub>3</sub> in 0.1 M PBS for 48 hr at 4°C. Sections were washed in 0.1 M PBS + 0.05% Tween 20 + 1% NDS five times, 20 min each, and then incubated with the different fluorescent secondary antibodies diluted in 0.05% Tween-20, 1% NDS, and 0.1 M PBS for 16 hr at 4°C. The secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (1:500; Jackson ImmunoResearch, Europe Ltd, UK; Cat# 715-545-151), Alexa Fluor 647 AffiniPure donkey anti-goat IgG (H+L) (1:500; Jackson ImmunoResearch, Cat# 705-605-147).

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the paper &quot;Optogenetic activation of visual thalamus generates artificial visual percepts&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Kristine Krug as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor.</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>While the reviewers found that the demonstration in the first part of the manuscript that optogenetic stimulation in the LGN of tree shrews can be detected is interesting and novel, they agreed that both parts of the study suffer from significant limitations. The critical link between the two parts also seems to be missing – with the investigation of the discrimination of the visual flicker frequencies being valuable but not really connected to the optogenetic experiment.</p><p>All three reviewers felt that the manuscript would be decidedly stronger if their concerns about the main optogenetic experiment (part 1) were addressed either as a self-contained study or with all concerns addressed plus the clearly missing link of an optogenetic frequency discrimination study included in part 2. But we appreciate that in both cases this would be a different manuscript and is beyond a major revision.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>(1) The two parts of the manuscript – detection/optogenetics and flicker discrimination/recordings – seem not well connected and rather seem to belong to two different studies. Different optogenetic stimulation frequencies were clearly employed in the behavioural assessment of optogenetics (Figure 4B) and they are also encoded by LGN neurons (Figure 2). But the link is not addressed here, so the manuscript appears to contain two separate studies.</p><p>(2) There seems to be some experimental detail missing or unclear in the results (and methods), importantly the number of animals used for each part, for individual animals an ID (so different parts can be connected more easily), and in some parts summary statistics across all experiments carried.</p><p>For example:</p><p>p5/6: how many animals were injected, on how many of these were immunohistochemistry done, and how many cells were counted across how many animals and sections? Please add from how many animals, you recorded how many neurons.</p><p>Figure 1: provide section plane and give animal ID – which of your behavioural study animals is this from, please?</p><p>Figure 2: give animal ID, which of your behavioural study animals is this from, please?</p><p>Line 140-142: how many neurons did your record in total and how did you define a burst</p><p>Figure 3: in D, there seem to be 5 animals, in E-G only 4. Can you add the green animals in or if not, why not. Please provide animal IDs for the 5 colour-coded animals in Figures 3+4, so they can be linked to specific animal data in the previous section.</p><p>Line 228 and methods: Please explain somewhere what a VI-30 schedule is.</p><p>Methods: please add how many animals in total were used and what were the histology protocols.</p><p>A table in the methods would be helpful: for each animal, it should show what training and experiments, it took part in and in what order.</p><p>(3) Since single combinations of strength and frequency of stimulation were used in each session and session order randomised, it would be helpful to show (i) for each animal in the methods, the sequence of experiments, (ii) for each animal in parallel d' over sessions in order of experiments. To exclude effects of training and/or &quot;wearing out&quot; of stimulation sites over time.</p><p>4) Flicker results – line 268 onwards.</p><p>Please specify how many animals were involved and that these were anaesthetised experiments.</p><p>Please distinguish between encoding in firing rate or temporal pattern of spiking.</p><p>I might be missing something but in 7B, there is a clear peak for 40 Hz visual stimulation in the evoked pattern, however, in the third panel on the right, no peaks are shown for 40 Hz. Please explain.</p><p>Lines 299-302: How many cells from how many animals were recorded in total, and what fraction does that constitute for each animal?</p><p>(5) Can you provide a direct comparison (in a figure perhaps) of the best d' during optogenetics and the best d' in the visual detection task, animal-by-animal?</p><p>(6) Lines 437-438: Please provide details on which regulations and which authorities.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I believe that the study can be significantly strengthened by reporting whether animals that were trained in the visual flicker frequency discrimination task are able to transfer to optogenetic frequency discrimination. How is this information encoded among LGN and the downstream V1 neurons (similar to Figures7 and 8)? What are the similarities and differences between visual flicker frequency representation and optogenetic frequency representation?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1. What is the rationale for testing for co-expression of ChR2/mCherry and PV? What fraction of the thalamocortical neurons in tree shrew LGN express PV and what fraction of PV cells also express CaMKIIs? Was histology done in more than one animal? Are there additional regions beyond the example in Figure 1 where immunostaining had been performed? As it stands, this portion of the paper is anecdotal and its significance is unclear.</p><p>2. How many animals have been studied with electrophysiology and optogenetics and how many single units have been recorded? A summary analysis beyond the three example cells in Figure 2 would be helpful. It would be nice to include PSTHs in Figure 2A in addition to the power spectrum. Can the authors demonstrate optogenetic stimulation and characterization of ON/OFF visual responses in the same cells? How were bursts defined?</p><p>3. The way that the detection task is analyzed is confusing, and while this approach may be justifiable, it needs to be explained more clearly. The visual/optogenetic target appears on every trial but some hits and some false alarms are assigned as correct rejects depending on when the target appeared (Figure 3B). It is unclear whether these somewhat arbitrary categories also impacted the reward delivery to the animals. The day-to-day variability in behavioral performance appears to be quite high so analyses such as the assessment of the effect of eccentricity on detectability require multiple sessions per eccentricity per animal. This is true throughout this manuscript. A single behavioral session per animal may not be sufficient for making meaningful inferences. Quantitative analysis of the distribution of response times would be beneficial. The results could then be compared with the response times during the optogenetic stimulation.</p><p>4. Demonstration of the detection of optogenetic stimulation in the LGN in Figure 4 is the central finding in this paper but the results are quite anecdotal. Is each data point in 4B a single session? If so, these results may not be interpretable and additional sessions/animals are needed in order to make inferences about the effect of the optogenetic stimulation parameters. It is unclear why there are 5 animals in Figure 4 and only 4 in Figure 3. Were all animals tested in optogenetic detection previously trained in visual detection? Where were the off-LGN injections done in the control animals? Demonstrating the effect in more than three animals could strengthen the paper. As in visual detection, it would be helpful to see quantitative analysis of the distribution of response times with comparison across animals and stimulation parameters.</p><p>5. It would be interesting to analyze performance as a function of time during the first optogenetic stimulation session per animal; does the probability of reporting the stimulation increase during the first session?</p><p>6. The description of the flicker frequency discrimination task is unclear. Many readers will not know what operant schedules and VI30 are. What is the relation between nose pokes, lever presses, and rewards? Are the blue tick marks in Figure 5A-B rewards or lever presses? It is not clear how the four behavioral categories were defined.</p><p>7. It would be nice to show data from all 6 animals in Figure 6A since summary data from all 6 is shown in panels B-D. How can mean response latency in S+ be between 25 and 45 sec (Figure 6C) but response frequency between 0.1 and 0.2 pokes/sec (Figure 6D)?</p><p>8. Were the data for the analysis of flicker frequency discrimination sensitivity by LGN and V1 neurons collected from anesthetized animals? Were these acute experiments? How many animals have been studied? How many of the neurons were ON vs. OFF dominated? The analysis of the frequency decoder based on the peak of the FFT is suboptimal. A decoder can rely on power at all frequencies to discriminate stimulus flicker frequency.</p><p>9. I may have missed these details but I did not see a description of the immunostaining methods.

Different optogenetic stimulation frequencies were clearly employed in the behavioural assessment of optogenetics (Figure 4B) and they are also encoded by LGN neurons (Figure 2). But the link is not addressed here, so the manuscript appears to contain two separate studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment, which was also brought up by an additional reviewer. We have now completely revised the manuscript, such that the flicker discrimination is no longer included and we focus entirely on the optogenetic detection. We have added substantial additional behavioral data, histological analyses and neural circuit studies related to information processing in LGN and V1; all of which support our results in the first part of the original manuscript. We feel this has made the manuscript far more cohesive.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) There seems to be some experimental detail missing or unclear in the results (and methods), importantly the number of animals used for each part, for individual animals an ID (so different parts can be connected more easily), and in some parts summary statistics across all experiments carried.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now provided 2 additional tables detailing the animals, and their IDs, used in each part of the experiments.

Please add from how many animals, you recorded how many neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide animal numbers where appropriate in each section. We have also completely restructured the immunohistochemistry. We now demonstrate virus expression in the LGN in 2 additional animals (supp.Figure 2) for a total of 3 animals. We have added completely novel histology for PV and CamKIIα (Figure 1A: 1 animal, supp.Figure 1: 2 animals), demonstrating robust CaMKIIexpression across LGN layers. The PV staining is added as it is useful for layer delineation. For the functional validation neurophysiology (Figure 2), we analyzed data from 120 single neurons obtained in the LGN, focusing on single neuron activity as this is necessary for burst analysis. For the functional interaction neurophysiology (Figure 6‐8), we recorded from 111 sites in LGN and V1, focusing on multi‐unit‐activity (MUA) here to optimize the probability of detecting functional relationships between remote regions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1: provide section plane and give animal ID – which of your behavioural study animals is this from, please?</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided the plane of the section in the new figure 1 as well as the related supplementary figure 2.

How is this information encoded among LGN and the downstream V1 neurons (similar to Figures7 and 8)? What are the similarities and differences between visual flicker frequency representation and optogenetic frequency representation?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now removed everything related to visual flicker frequency discrimination from the manuscript, as was suggested also by the other reviewers. As suggested by this reviewer, we have included analyses related to the transfer between visual and optogenetic paradigms, focusing on the detection task. The remaining comments of the reviewer are highly appreciated; we are indeed planning to follow up the visual flicker experiment with an optogenetic flicker detection variant, that will allow us to examine the similarities and differences in terms of temporally structured stimulation. For the revised manuscript, we focus on the initial proof of principle demonstration using a detection paradigm. We have however added substantial neurophysiology results, that make a strong neural circuit case for optogenetically induced functional activations in LGN and (more importantly) V1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1. What is the rationale for testing for co-expression of ChR2/mCherry and PV? What fraction of the thalamocortical neurons in tree shrew LGN express PV and what fraction of PV cells also express CaMKIIs? Was histology done in more than one animal? Are there additional regions beyond the example in Figure 1 where immunostaining had been performed? As it stands, this portion of the paper is anecdotal and its significance is unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. We have now performed dual immunostaining for CaMKII and parvalbumin in the LGN of 3 tree shrews, see the new figure 1 and supplementary figure 1. While in the monkey CaMKIIexpression is restricted to the interlaminar regions of the LGN, we show here that in the tree shrew, it expressed throughout the entire extent of LGN including the laminae proper. With this finding, the cell counting and relation to PV projection system becomes less important, so we have in fact removed cell counting related to co‐expression of PV and CaMKII We have however done PV staining also for the new animals, as this permits a particularly clear delineation of the LGN layers. The co‐expression analysis can be done, but we feel that it is not crucial to the scientific message of this particular paper and will be important when more specific LGN populations are targeted for optogenetics in future studies. In addition, we also show thalamocortical axons in V1 in two additional animals (suppl. Figure 2), corroborating therefore both points (robust CaMKII expression in LGN and thalamocortical fibers) in a total of 3 animals each.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. How many animals have been studied with electrophysiology and optogenetics and how many single units have been recorded? A summary analysis beyond the three example cells in Figure 2 would be helpful. It would be nice to include PSTHs in Figure 2A in addition to the power spectrum. Can the authors demonstrate optogenetic stimulation and characterization of ON/OFF visual responses in the same cells? How were bursts defined?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included the number of animals in the <italic>Subjects</italic> subsection of the methods. We have stated the number of units and the definition of a burst. “<italic>We recorded from 120 single units in the LGN, and defined a burst as two or more action potentials with inter‐spike intervals &lt;4ms, and preceded by at least 50 ms without spiking activity.”</italic> The new figures 6,7&amp;8 now provide summaries of the recorded neurons. We have included PSTHs in figure 2A. We do not however have sufficient data at this point for a thorough characterization of ON‐ and OFF‐response optogenetics, and have included this aspect as a validation of previously published findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The way that the detection task is analyzed is confusing, and while this approach may be justifiable, it needs to be explained more clearly. The visual/optogenetic target appears on every trial but some hits and some false alarms are assigned as correct rejects depending on when the target appeared (Figure 3B). It is unclear whether these somewhat arbitrary categories also impacted the reward delivery to the animals. The day-to-day variability in behavioral performance appears to be quite high so analyses such as the assessment of the effect of eccentricity on detectability require multiple sessions per eccentricity per animal. This is true throughout this manuscript. A single behavioral session per animal may not be sufficient for making meaningful inferences. Quantitative analysis of the distribution of response times would be beneficial. The results could then be compared with the response times during the optogenetic stimulation.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer makes important points. We have added some more information on the detection task analysis using signal detection framework (methods section). The advantage of this approach is that a single value (d’ sensitivity) can be computed for each behavioral session, which takes into account errors of both categories (false alarm and misses). Our approach has the key advantage that we do not require any signal absent trials, which would be problematic for animal motivation particularly in tree shrews. Rewards are delivered only after detected targets, and the analysis framework had no impact on the reward schedule. The reviewer is correct that such an effect would be problematic, but our analysis is designed to expressly avoid this.</p><p>Relating to variability, it is true that there is considerable day‐to‐day variability and statistical reproducibility is key to solid inference. We have therefore conducted 30 sessions of optogenetic detection experiments in animals 959, 1111, 1409 to corroborate our findings and added an additional animal 1806 (Figure 5), and these now we feel unequivocally show that for the optimal stimulation parameters (determined in pilot experiments see Figure 4), tree shrews can detect the optogenetic stimulation. We have also added statistical analysis on the visual detection task, showing that detection performance (d’) for all animals was significantly different from zero.</p><p>For the eccentricity effects, we have added a statistical test comparing d’ across the studied eccentricities against zero; a test that is significant for all four animals studied. We have added this information to the manuscript. Please note that d’ sensitivity is itself a summary statistic based on 200 trials of various types, and in this setting, we consider estimates on single session to be meaningful.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Demonstration of the detection of optogenetic stimulation in the LGN in Figure 4 is the central finding in this paper but the results are quite anecdotal. Is each data point in 4B a single session? If so, these results may not be interpretable and additional sessions/animals are needed in order to make inferences about the effect of the optogenetic stimulation parameters. It is unclear why there are 5 animals in Figure 4 and only 4 in Figure 3. Were all animals tested in optogenetic detection previously trained in visual detection? Where were the off-LGN injections done in the control animals? Demonstrating the effect in more than three animals could strengthen the paper. As in visual detection, it would be helpful to see quantitative analysis of the distribution of response times with comparison across animals and stimulation parameters.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment, and now report data from multiple session for each of the animals using the optimal frequency and (high) amplitude (Figure 5). We feel that these data now unequivocally demonstrate that optogenetic stimulation is detected by the tree shrews. The experiments with multiple frequency and amplitudes have the character of pilot data used for selecting stimulation parameters for the study on repeatability of the effects. This type of pilot phase is typically done in this type of experiment for parameter selection; but often not reported in detail. Due to considerations including animal motivation, implant lifetime and efficacy, 3R considerations we limited the total number of behavioral sessions during which we were able to study each animal. We also now report the results of the amplitude/frequency combination experiment in each animal in the serial order that they were done, providing a full characterization of the experimental findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. It would be interesting to analyze performance as a function of time during the first optogenetic stimulation session per animal; does the probability of reporting the stimulation increase during the first session?</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 3, 6 animals learned the initial task (panels C,D); as we have added an additional animal since the initial submission. For (visual) spatial generalization was tested in only four of these animals. We felt that four animals are sufficient to demonstrate spatial generalization, and now provide a statistical test demonstrating significance of the generalization performance.</p><p>The control injections were performed in 2 animals in the regions of the globus pallidus and zone incerta. The coordinates were: anterior posterior from the interaural line = 6.11; medial lateral = 4; dorsal ventral = 8.5. Of the 6 animals tested on visual detection, 4 were implanted in the LGN and 2 outside the LGN.</p><p>We have done the response time analysis for the visual detection task over the course of training as requested by the reviewer (supplementary Figure 7); the findings suggest that improved d’ sensitivity is accompanied by trends towards speeded (animal 959) or slowed (animal 1111) reaction times, with some apparent variability between individual tree shrews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The description of the flicker frequency discrimination task is unclear. Many readers will not know what operant schedules and VI30 are. What is the relation between nose pokes, lever presses, and rewards? Are the blue tick marks in Figure 5A-B rewards or lever presses? It is not clear how the four behavioral categories were defined.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this information in supplementary figure 6. The data shows that animal 1111 already correctly reported at high performance on the initial trials (data in figure is smoothed by convolution across 10 trials), and tree shrews tended to show an increasing performance within the session consistent with a within‐session learning effect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. It would be nice to show data from all 6 animals in Figure 6A since summary data from all 6 is shown in panels B-D.

We have added a sentence related to this point in the Results section when describing Figure 6, p.13, ll. 288-289.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Figure 2B figure legend: add that this is visual stimulation, please.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) From which animal is the performance shown in Figures 3A and 4B? Please add to the figure or figure legend.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) sFigure 6: For animal 1409, it would be helpful to explain to the reader how a performance of that is generally below 50% correct leads to a d' &gt;1 on the first day of optogenetic stimulation. Unless I am misunderstanding the two graphs?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for identifying this issue, which was due to an analysis error on our part. The correct data is now shown in supplementary Figure 6, and reveals elevated %correct results that underlie the d’ value &gt; 1 on the first day. This error affected two of the three animals; and indeed now the learning curves reveal transfer task acquisition during the first tens of trials in these animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The paper is much improved, and the focus on the behavioral effects of LGN optogenetic stimulation strengthens the paper. While the basic finding seems to be robust, some details are not described adequately, several aspects of the presentation can be improved, and the manuscript could benefit from more careful editing.</p><p>Specific comments</p><p>– Figure 2 is nice but this is only one example. It is important to include a summary figure to follow up on Figure 2 that shows quantitatively how key findings from Figure 2 generalize to all recorded cells. For example, do most cells phase lock up to 60 Hz? What is the overall firing rate as function of stimulation frequency?</p></disp-quote><p>In the original submission this data was merely illustrative; we have now expanded figure 2 to include a quantitative analysis of spike entrainment to the optogenetic stimulation, and also amended the text, p.7, ll.165-168, and the methods, p.25, ll.624-628. The information related to which animals exhibited entrainment has been included in the newly added table 3, p.24, l. 616.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Please change y–axis of PSTHs in Figures2 and 6 to firing rate.</p></disp-quote><p>Done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 4B – should be mW and not W in the key.</p></disp-quote><p>Done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In Figure 4 it would be helpful to add an icon or text in B to indicate which animals are controls.</p></disp-quote><p>Done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In Figure 5A, it would be helpful to add a panel that shows d' per session as a function of session # for each animal. The session–to–session variability is important to assess in order to interpret the effects of power and frequency in Figure S6 since each combination was only used once per animal.</p></disp-quote><p>We feel that the variability is already captured by the SEM in this figure and additional panels would clutter the figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 6 is missing panel labels.</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected this omission.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– 5 units in V1 showing significant change in firing rate during optostim at p&lt;0.05 out of 111 is expected by chance and the modulation according to Figure 6A is very modest; a more appropriate description of these results is that the authors failed to see V1 effects in the single/multi–unit level.</p></disp-quote><p>Technically the reviewer is correct; however looking at the histograms and raster plots these responses, although infrequent in LGN and rare in V1, do not appear to result from random statistical fluctuations. It is not a main point of the paper, but we prefer to keep this finding in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In Figure 8B, each set of connected symbols is a different site. If so, can you comment on why the effect is so bimodal? Are filled symbols significant optostimulation effect?</p></disp-quote><p>We already discuss this in the Results section; this apparent bimodality is most likely related to RF overlap.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Why compute STA of LFP in V1 based on LGN spikes rather than on based LGN optogenetic stimulation? Is there a significant difference between these two?</p></disp-quote><p>We compute the STA using LGN spikes as the optogenetic induced LGN spiking activity will have a more direct effect on cortical processing that the optogenetic LGN stimulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Was there any indication to the animal of a miss other than withdrawal of the reward? Was the intertrial interval fixed? Was the ITI affected by misses?</p></disp-quote><p>There was no explicit cue delivered upon a missed stimulus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The text discussing &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot; cells is a little confusing. It would be better to say explicitly that &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot; visually responsive cells are segregated in the tree shrew LGN layers and refer to the supplementary figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added “visually responsive” to the paragraph in the discussion as suggested by this reviewer, p.17, l. 398.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The terminology may be confusing to the readers. Instead of &quot;light stimulation&quot;, perhaps say &quot;visual stimulation&quot; to better contrast with optogenetic stimulation?</p></disp-quote><p>We indeed use the term visual stimulation to refer to sensory input through the retina, whereas “light stimulation” and “optogenetic stimulation” refer to activation of neurons by light delivery to the brain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It would be helpful to indicate in the figures which panels show results from optogenetic stimulation and which from visual stimulation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now indicated this in the figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– &quot;as has been reported also for humans (Erickson–Davis and Korzybska, 2021)&quot; may be interpreted by the reader as implying that optogenetic stimulation has been done in humans but this is an electrical stimulation study.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added “in work using electrical stimulation”, p.11, l.249 as suggested by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– &quot;it has been shown that for macaques, extensive training on optogenetic stimulus detection in V1 can be detrimental for detection of visual stimuli (Ni and Maunsell, 2010)&quot; – this paper used microstimulation and not optogenetic stimulation.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right and we have changed this to “detection of electrical microstimulation”, p.16, l.376</p></body></sub-article></article>
