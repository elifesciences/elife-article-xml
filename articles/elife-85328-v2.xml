The [Aurora B/IN-box] complex is activated by autophosphorylation in the Aurora B activation loop and in IN-box, but it is not clear how these phosphorylations activate the enzyme. We used a combination of experimental and computational studies to investigate the effects of phosphorylation on the molecular dynamics and structure of [Aurora B/IN-box]. In addition, we generated partially phosphorylated intermediates to analyze the contribution of each phosphorylation independently. We found that the dynamics of Aurora and IN-box are interconnected, and IN-box plays both positive and negative regulatory roles depending on the phosphorylation status of the enzyme complex. Phosphorylation in the activation loop of Aurora B occurs intramolecularly and prepares the enzyme complex for activation, but two phosphorylated sites are synergistically responsible for full enzyme activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>protein kinase</kwd><kwd>cell division</kwd><kwd>conformational dynamics</kwd><kwd>allostery</kwd><kwd>autoactivation</kwd><kwd>Aurora B</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005416</institution-id><institution>Norges Forskningsråd</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>187615</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Segura-Peña</surname><given-names>Dario</given-names></name><name><surname>Hovet</surname><given-names>Oda</given-names></name><name><surname>Gogoi</surname><given-names>Hemanga</given-names></name><name><surname>Hansen Wøien</surname><given-names>Stine Malene</given-names></name><name><surname>Sekulic</surname><given-names>Nikolina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005416</institution-id><institution>Norges Forskningsråd</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>262695</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hovet</surname><given-names>Oda</given-names></name><name><surname>Carrer</surname><given-names>Manuel</given-names></name><name><surname>Cascella</surname><given-names>Michele</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Norwegian Supercomputing Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NN4654K</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hovet</surname><given-names>Oda</given-names></name><name><surname>Carrer</surname><given-names>Manuel</given-names></name><name><surname>Cascella</surname><given-names>Michele</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005416</institution-id><institution>Norges Forskningsråd</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>325528</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sekulic</surname><given-names>Nikolina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35-GM130302</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dawicki-McKenna</surname><given-names>Jennine</given-names></name><name><surname>Black</surname><given-names>Ben E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM108360</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dawicki-McKenna</surname><given-names>Jennine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An entropy switch controls the Aurora B autoactivation process through two distinct kinetic steps of phosphorylation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The chromosome passenger complex (CPC) is a complex of four proteins involved in the regulation of key mitotic events: correction of chromosome-microtubule attachment errors, assembly and stability of the spindle assembly checkpoint, and assembly and regulation of the contractile apparatus that drives cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carmena et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vader et al., 2006</xref>). The CPC is organized into two modules. The localization module consists of survivin, borealin, and the N-terminal part of INCENP, whereas the enzymatic module comprises Aurora B kinase and the C-terminal part of INCENP, called the IN-box. The enzymatic activity of Aurora B is essential for the regulatory functions of CPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kelly and Funabiki, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krenn and Musacchio, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Meraldi et al., 2004</xref>), so Aurora B has been identified as an attractive target for cancer chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Portella et al., 2011</xref>), with several inhibitors patented in the last decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jing and Chen, 2021</xref>).</p><p>The enzymatic activity of the [Aurora B/IN-box] is tightly regulated by autophosphorylation. The activity of the complex increases by at least two orders of magnitude after the complex phosphorylates itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zaytsev et al., 2016</xref>). There are two well-defined autophosphorylation sites in the [Aurora B/IN-box] enzyme complex. One is a threonine in the Aurora B activation loop, and the second is located at the C-terminus of the IN-box and consists of two consecutive serine residues in the TSS motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bishop and Schumacher, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Honda et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sessa et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Until recently, the molecular understanding of Aurora B autoactivation was based on a model derived from the structure of the partially phosphorylated enzyme, in which the threonine in the Aurora B activation loop was phosphorylated but the TSS motif of INCENP was either absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sessa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sessa and Villa, 2014</xref>) or unstructured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Elkins et al., 2012</xref>). Recently, a structural study of the [Aurora C/IN-box] complex, which is specific for meiosis but otherwise very similar to the [Aurora B/IN-box] complex, provided valuable insight into the conformation the fully phosphorylated enzyme adopts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdul Azeez et al., 2019</xref>). The crystal structure shows that the activation loop of Aurora C and the IN-box TSS motif interact in the phosphorylated state and stabilize the extended (active) conformation of the activation loop. Although the enzyme complex was crystallized with an inhibitor bound to the ATP-binding site, it is likely that the observed interaction between the IN-box and the activation loop represents a conformation corresponding to the active state of the enzyme complex. Crystal structures are extremely valuable as high-resolution snapshots of enzyme complex, but they lack the dynamic information about the enzyme complex that is required for a complete understanding of the autoactivation process. In addition, there is not crystal structure available of the [Aurora B/IN-box] complex in the unphosphorylated state and therefore, there is an important gap in understanding the conformational changes taking place during the activation process.</p><p>Proteins are dynamic macromolecules that exist in multiple conformations in their native state. An organized protein will explore a smaller number of conformations with less structural variability, than a disordered protein that will explore a larger number of conformations in the same time. In addition, there is an increasing evidence that the dynamic properties of an enzyme play a critical role in its catalytic functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahuja et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tzeng and Kalodimos, 2012</xref>). For example, an increase in dynamics or local flexibility may facilitate the adoption of the different conformations required during the catalytic cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boehr et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tzeng and Kalodimos, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Xie et al., 2020</xref>). On the other hand, the transition from a highly dynamic, disordered enzyme to a more structured enzyme has also been documented as a form of regulation of enzyme catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wei et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Xiao et al., 2015</xref>). In particular, an intensive line of research on protein kinases has shown that the internal dynamics associated with the movements of the enzyme’s subdomains regulate enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahuja et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pegram et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Taylor and Kornev, 2011</xref>). While detailed dynamics analyses are available for several eukaryotic protein kinases activated by phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Foda et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2019</xref>), including the closely related Aurora A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cyphers et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dodson and Bayliss, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gilburt et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pitsawong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ruff et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tomlinson et al., 2022</xref>), the effect of phosphorylation on the dynamic properties of the [Aurora B/IN-box] complex is not yet known.</p><p>Here, we use a combination of experimental (hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled to mass-spectrometry [HDX-MS] and enzyme kinetics) and computational (molecular dynamics [MD]) approaches to follow the internal dynamics of the [Aurora B/IN-box] complex in solution - both in the unphosphorylated, inhibited, ([Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>no-P</sup>) and fully phosphorylated, active, ([Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup>) states. We found that in the absence of phosphorylation, there is structural disorder scattered along several regions of the enzyme complex. In contrast, in the fully phosphorylated enzyme complex, both Aurora B and the IN-box are structurally organized, resulting in a fully functional enzyme.</p><p>To investigate the contribution of individual phosphorylation sites to the dynamics and enzymatic activity, we used a protein ligation method to generate partially phosphorylated forms of the enzyme complex in which either only the activation loop of Aurora B ([Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>loop-P</sup>) or only the TSS motif of the IN-box ([Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>IN-P</sup>) is phosphorylated. Phosphorylation of each individual site in isolation has only a minor effect on enzymatic activity and structural stability, whereas simultaneous phosphorylation of the activation loop in Aurora B and the TSS motif in the IN-box synergistically affects the structure and dynamics of the enzyme complex, leading to a dramatic increase in kinase activity. Further, we identify phosphorylation in the activation loop of Aurora B as a rate-limiting intramolecular event in autoactivation. Finally, only when both sites are phosphorylated are the global movements of the N- and C-lobes of the enzyme (opening and closing of the active site and twisting between the lobes) coordinated with the movements of the activation loop, resulting in a fully functional kinase.</p><p>Our combined experimental and theoretical approach has allowed us to study in parallel unphosphorylated, partially phosphorylated, and fully phosphorylated [Aurora B/IN-box] and to provide the missing information necessary to build a more detailed model of [Aurora B/IN-box] autoactivation. Our model is important for understanding the role of protein dynamics in achieving full enzyme activity, and it may also serve as a starting point for the development of new Aurora B-specific inhibitors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Autoactivation of [Aurora B/IN-box] by phosphorylation induces structural organization in multiple regions of the enzyme complex</title><p>The [Aurora B/IN-box] complex is activated by autophosphorylation, resulting in an enzyme with at least 100-fold higher enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zaytsev et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To obtain information on the possible structural and dynamic changes underlying the observed differences in enzymatic activity between unphosphorylated [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>no-P</sup> and the fully phosphorylated enzyme complex, [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup>, we monitored the HDX in the protein backbone of [Aurora B/IN-box] from <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>. HDX is based on the fact that in aqueous solution, the amide protons of the protein main chain are exchanged with protons from the solvent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mayne, 2016</xref>). Thus, by changing the solvent from H<sub>2</sub>O to D<sub>2</sub>O, HDX can be measured. The unstructured protein regions are the fast exchangers, while well-ordered regions where the amide backbone hydrogen atoms are involved in hydrogen bonds are exchanged more slowly. HDX analysis of proteins has proven useful in determining the activation mechanisms of numerous enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dawicki-McKenna et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Habibi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lorenzen and Pawson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sours and Ahn, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). By comparing the differences in deuterium uptake in the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of the enzyme complex, we identified the regions of the enzyme where dynamic changes occur during phosphorylation. HDX measurements were performed using MS (Materials and methods).</p><p>We measured HDX in [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>no-P</sup> and [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup> at four time points (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1 supp2">Supplementary files 1 and 2</xref>). Comparison of HDX measurements for the two phosphorylation states reveals several regions of the enzyme complex with profound HDX differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The unphosphorylated form of the enzyme takes up more deuterium in all regions where HDX differences were detected, indicating greater flexibility and lower structural organization. Consequently, the fully active form, [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup>, has a lower HDX, indicating a more rigid structural organization. A detailed comparison between the two enzyme forms reveals several regions with significant HDX differences in Aurora B and in the IN-box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; also indicated by black lines and corresponding secondary structure elements in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Two additional regions have statistically significant HDX differences, albeit relatively small. One region is at the N-terminus, spanning residues 93–120 and including β1-, β2-strands and the glycine loop, which is important for ATP binding. The other region is on the C-terminus, spanning αH and αI-helices.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>After phosphorylation, the [Aurora B/IN-box] complex becomes more rigid.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Butterfly-difference plot for a comparison of H/D exchange (HDX) differences between [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>no-P</sup> and [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup>, measured over four time points (orange - 3 min; red - 10 min; blue - 30 min; black - 90 min).

It is known from studies of other eukaryotic protein kinases that the αC-helix plays a critical role in the organization of the productive enzyme complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kornev and Taylor, 2015</xref>). This helix contributes to the positioning of the activation segment, which includes the magnesium-binding loop (DFG loop), the activation loop with phosphorylated Aurora B<sup>Thr248</sup>, and the P+1 loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The αC-helix residues also contribute to the formation of the R-spine, a series of hydrophobic interactions extending from the N-lobe to the C-lobe of protein kinases, that are critical for the adoption of an active conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kornev and Taylor, 2015</xref>). In addition, helices αB and αC provide an interacting surface for binding regulators of kinase activity in a variety of protein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Leroux and Biondi, 2020</xref>) and are a site of interaction between the structurally similar Aurora A kinase and its binding partner TPX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bayliss et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The second region spans residues 205–223 and includes the last five amino acids of the αE-helix, a linker region that includes the major catalytic loop (HRD loop) and the β7-strand.

However, upon manual analysis, we did not detect any changes in deuterium uptake between the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms in this region. Deuterium exchange in this part of the protein (which is also observed in the peptides immediately upstream of Aurora B<sup>Thr248</sup>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>) is very rapid, independently of enzyme phosphorylation, so that complete exchange occurs even at the earliest time points. This is in contrast to the second part of the activation loop, which includes the Aurora B<sup>αEF</sup> helix (labeled region 3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; peptide 254–260 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>), where we clearly see HDX protection upon phosphorylation. It is possible that phosphorylation causes dynamic changes on a very fast scale (seconds or faster) in the part of the protein encompassing Aurora B<sup>Thr248</sup>, but we could not detect them due to the limitation of our approach, which operates on the scale of minutes.</p><p>The IN-box is highly dynamic with a very fast HDX rate in both [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>no-P</sup> and [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup> (most peptides are fully exchanged at the early time points, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). The only segment of IN-box where differences in deuteration are detected extends from positions 805 to 825 and contains the only well-defined secondary structure elements: IN-box<sup>αA</sup> helix and the short IN-box<sup>αB</sup> helix connected by a linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>). HDX kinetics for this region shows a strong component of EX1 kinetics and a smaller component of common EX2 kinetics. By definition, EX2 kinetics is common in the native folded state of proteins, while EX1 kinetics are less common in native conditions and is indicative of structural unfolding of local protein regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arrington and Robertson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chitta et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ferraro et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sperry et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Walters et al., 2013</xref>). In the IN-box<sup>805-825</sup> region, we observe the appearance of two clear isotopic envelopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), a hallmark of EX1 kinetics. The lower mass isotopic peak corresponds to the folded state of IN-box<sup>805-825</sup>, where the amide-hydrogen bonds are more protected. The high mass isotope peak is indicative of the unfolded state of the IN-box<sup>805-825</sup> region, where multiple amide-hydrogen bonds break simultaneously and exchange hydrogen for deuterium. The EX1 behavior was observed in both [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>no-P</sup> and [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup>, suggesting that IN-box<sup>805-825</sup> reversibly switches between the unfolded and folded states regardless of the phosphorylation state. However, the higher mass peak appears more rapidly in [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>no-P</sup>, suggesting that this region of IN-box visits the unfolded state more frequently in the unphosphorylated form of the enzyme complex. Overall, this observation is consistent with a more disordered IN-box in the unphosphorylated state.</p><p>A possible explanation for the large deuterium uptake in the unphosphorylated [Aurora B/IN-box] could be the dissociation of the IN-box from Aurora B at the low µM concentration (0.4 µM) used in our HDX experiment. In this scenario, the interacting surfaces of Aurora B and IN-box would be available for HDX. To determine whether the [Aurora B/IN-box] complex remained intact in our HDX experimental conditions, we used mass photometry to measure the molecular weight (MW) of the enzymatic complex, [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>no-P</sup> and [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup> at low nM concentrations. In both samples, we observed a single uniform peak corresponding to MW of ~44 kD (MW<sub>Aurora B</sub>=35.4 kD; MW<sub>IN-box</sub>=8 kD), the measurements were performed at 10 nM enzyme concentration. This clearly confirms that the interactions between Aurora B and IN-box are stable under the HDX experimental conditions in the two states, phosphorylated and unphosphorylated, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>) and that the differences observed by HDX are due to phosphorylation-induced changes in enzyme dynamics rather than dissociation between the two polypeptide chains.</p><p>The higher degree of HDX protection detected in the active site and key regulatory regions of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>) suggests that the structural organization that occurs in the phosphorylated enzyme, [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup>, is important for enzymatic activity. Our results are consistent with similar studies on other protein kinases where phosphorylation of the threonine residue in the activation loop leads to rigidification of the structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lorenzen and Pawson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Steichen et al., 2010</xref>).

At the beginning of the simulation, two phosphates of IN-box (IN-box<sup>pSer849</sup> and IN-box<sup>pSer850</sup>) are immediately stabilized by adjacent positively charged residues, IN-box<sup>Arg843</sup> and IN-box<sup>Lys846</sup>. Moreover, IN-box<sup>Arg847</sup> forms an electrostatic interaction with the phospho-threonine of the activation loop, Aurora B<sup>pThr248</sup>, early in the simulation (0.7 μs), and this interaction remains stable until the end of the simulation (the next 1.8 μs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). In addition to IN-box<sup>Arg847</sup>, Aurora B<sup>pThr248</sup> is stabilized by three arginine residues from Aurora B - two adjacent residues in the activation loop, Aurora B<sup>Arg246</sup> and Aurora B<sup>Arg247</sup>, and Aurora B<sup>Arg215</sup> from the catalytic loop (HRD), closely resembling equivalent interactions in the Aurora C observed in [Aurora C/IN-box] crystal structure. Thus, stabilization of negative phosphate in the [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup> activation loop involves interaction with four arginine residues and is more extensive than phosphate stabilization in the initial structure (PDB 4C2W), in which Aurora B<sup>pThr248</sup> is present but the IN-box TSS motif is absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In the initial structure, Aurora B<sup>pThr248</sup> is stabilized by only two Aurora B arginines, Aurora B<sup>Arg246</sup> and Aurora B<sup>Arg215</sup>, while Aurora B<sup>Arg247</sup> faces the solvent. An important common feature between our [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup> simulation and the [Aurora C/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup> crystal structure is that the IN-box interacts with the kinase activation loop stabilizing the active state of the kinase by reducing dynamics and favoring a more compact enzyme.</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-85328-video2.mp4" id="video2"><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>2.8 μs molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectory of [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup>.</title></caption></media><p>Overall, the structure from our [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup> simulation and the [Aurora C/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup> crystal structure are very similar. However, an important difference exists in the C-terminal IN-box region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In the [Aurora B/IN box]<sup>all-P</sup> simulation, the C-terminal region of the IN-box is extended further toward the C-terminal lobe of the kinase and interacts with the phosphorylated activation segment, whereas in the [Aurora C/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup> crystal structure there are reciprocal interaction in which arginines from the activation loop interact with the phosphorylated TSS motif of the IN-box. The latest interactions are not observed in our simulations. We suggest that the crystal structure of [Aurora C/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup> is more likely to represent the final active conformational state of the enzyme complex and that the [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup> from our simulation is more likely an intermediate state on the autoactivation trajectory. The transition from this intermediate state to the final state observed in the crystal structure could be a relatively slow process that occurs in time spans that we cannot capture with our simulation times. We discuss the possible reason for these differences in more detail in the Discussion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Experimental (HDX) and theoretical (MD) approaches imply that the dynamics of IN-box and Aurora B are interconnected</title><p>Both HDX and MD clearly show that the IN-box is highly disorganized in the unphosphorylated state of the enzyme complex. However, the large differences in the dynamics of the IN-box observed in MD simulations in the C-terminal part of the IN-box are not detectable in our HDX experiments. There could be two reasons for this apparent discrepancy. First, the C-terminal part of the IN-box is anchored to Aurora B only by side-chain interactions, whereas the main-chain hydrogens do not form stable hydrogen networks, leaving this region free for HDX despite a different conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). An alternative explanation is that HDX differences exist in the C-terminal region of the IN-box between two states, but the kinetics of the exchange occur in the millisecond range, which cannot be measured with our experimental setup.</p><p>Further, the N-terminal part, which has well-defined secondary structure elements, shows partial EX1 behavior, indicating partial unfolding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). The N-terminal segment of the IN-box, which surrounds the N-lobe of Aurora B with multiple interactions, is the only part of the IN-box that is always associated with Aurora B. We wondered whether the dynamics of the interacting neighboring regions in Aurora B are coupled to the dynamics of the IN-box in the MD simulation.</p><p>We calculated the root mean square fluctuations (RMSFs) during MS simulations for the N-terminal part of the IN-box, IN-box<sup>807-837</sup>, in the two forms of the enzyme complex (black coil in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Higher RMSF are associated with larger structural deformations. Consistent with the HDX results, the RMSFs for this region are significantly higher in [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>no-P</sup> than in [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, graph). Next, we analyzed the RMSFs for the Aurora B regions interacting with the N-terminal fragment of the IN-box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). These regions include Aurora-B kinase elements essential for catalysis and substrate binding: the Aurora B<sup>αC</sup>, catalytic helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, magenta), and the region forming the ATP-binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, cyan), respectively. In the dephosphorylated state, Aurora B<sup>αC</sup> exhibits a very broad RMSF distribution shifted toward higher values, consistent with strong helix deformations. In contrast, the RMSF values in [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup> show a narrow distribution, clearly indicating a more structured Aurora B<sup>αC</sup>. Although the difference is more subtle in the region of Aurora B that forms the ATP-binding site and is in contact with IN-box<sup>αA</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), it follows the same trend indicating structural stiffening upon phosphorylation and more disorder in the non-phosphorylated state. In summary, the Aurora B regions in contact with the N-terminal IN-box segment are structurally more disordered in the absence of phosphorylation than when the enzyme complex is fully phosphorylated, strongly suggesting that the dynamics of the adjacent regions of Aurora B and IN-box are coupled. In the unphosphorylated form of the enzyme complex the structural disorder spreads from one partner to the other. Therefore, the IN-box could act as a negative regulator of the kinase activity by transferring disorder to the kinase domain. Conversely, structural order is imposed on both Aurora B and the IN-box by phosphorylation.</p><p>However, the [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup> complex is phosphorylated in both Aurora B (activation loop - Aurora B<sup>Thr248</sup>) and the IN-box (TSS motif - IN-box<sup>pSer849</sup> and IN-box<sup>pSer850</sup>), so it is not clear whether the observed changes are the result of phosphorylation of the Aurora B activation loop or the TSS motif in the IN-box, or both. We next wanted to determine the contribution of each of these phosphorylation sites to the dynamics of the enzyme complex and to its enzymatic activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Generation of partially phosphorylated [Aurora B/IN-box] complexes</title><p>Previous attempts to uncouple the effects of the two phosphorylation sites in the [Aurora B/IN-box] enzyme complex were based on the analysis of phospho-null mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdul Azeez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2011a</xref>) in which the TSS motif was changed to TAA. Although the mutational approach to mimic a phospho-null IN-box was possible, phospho-mimetic mutations in which the threonine in the activation loop or the serine residues in the IN-box TSS motif are replaced by glutamic acids to mimic phosphorylation resulted in catalytically dead enzymes, contrary to expectations. Phospho-null mutations in the activation loop also resulted in a dead kinase. Since it was not possible to obtain enzyme complexes with phosphorylation only in the IN-box, the contribution of phosphorylation of the activation loop to enzyme activity could not be understood.</p><p>Because the IN-box is relatively close to the C-terminal end of the construct, this region of the protein is suitable for protein ligation. Therefore, we used a synthetic peptide approach to introduce post-translational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ghosh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We generated a truncated IN-box<sup>790-844</sup> (IN-box<sup>ΔC</sup>) fused to an intein that was co-expressed with Aurora B in a similar manner to the original [Aurora B/IN-box] construct. After purification of the complex and intein cleavage, the resulting [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>IN-ΔC</sup> was ligated with a synthetic peptide containing the IN-box residues IN-box<sup>845-858</sup> including the TSS motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The resulting protein differs from the original construct by a single amino acid that remains as a ‘scar’ of the ligation - IN-box<sup>Phe845</sup> becomes IN-box<sup>Cys845</sup> (indicated by the asterisk in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The enzyme complex containing phosphorylated Aurora B<sup>Thr248</sup> in the activation loop and the unphosphorylated IN-box, [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>loop-P</sup>, was obtained by ligation of the [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>IN-ΔC</sup> with a peptide containing the unphosphorylated IN-box<sup>845-858</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). To ensure that Aurora B<sup>Thr248</sup> was phosphorylated, the [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>IN-ΔC</sup>-intein was incubated with traces of the wild-type [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup> complex (wt) before ligation. The wt enzyme was removed in a purification step before ligation (see Materials and methods for further details). To generate the enzyme complex phosphorylated only in the TSS motif of the IN-box, [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>IN-P</sup>, the truncated [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>IN-ΔC</sup>-intein complex, was incubated with λ-phosphatase to ensure that Aurora B<sup>Thr248</sup> was not phosphorylated. After further purification to remove the λ-phosphatase, the unphosphorylated [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>IN-ΔC</sup> was ligated with an IN-box<sup>845-858</sup> phosphorylated at the two serine residues of the TSS motif. In all cases, size exclusion chromatography was performed as a final purification step to ensure that unligated peptides were removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), whereas the presence or absence of phosphates in the Aurora B<sup>Thr248</sup> or TSS motif in the IN-box was confirmed by MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Design and kinetic analysis of the partially phosphorylated [Aurora B/IN-box] complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sequence overlay of the IN-box, region of INCENP, from <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> and <italic>X. laevis</italic>.

Interestingly, although both partially phosphorylated enzyme complexes showed detectable enzymatic activity, their initial rates were much lower than those of the fully active enzyme, [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup>. [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>loop-P</sup> exhibits only ~10% and [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>IN-P</sup> only ~5% of the maximum initial rate. Although these values are still higher than the 1% activity measured for the unphosphorylated enzyme, [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>no-P</sup>, they are drastically lower than the maximum initial rates measured for the fully phosphorylated enzyme complex, [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup>. Thus, the simple addition of the activities of [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>loop-P</sup> and [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>IN-P</sup> accounts for only ~15% of the full enzyme activity, clearly showing that the phosphorylation of the Aurora B activation loop and the TSS motif of the IN-box act synergistically, rather than independently, to achieve the full activity of the [Aurora B/IN-box] complex.</p><p>For the [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>loop-P</sup> construct, we determined the kinetic constants, v<sub>max</sub> and K<sub>M</sub>, for the peptide substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>).

This result suggests that the absence of phosphates in the IN-box TSS motif has a strong effect on substrate binding and a moderate effect on catalysis of the reaction and supports the role of the IN-box in stabilizing the open conformation of the activation segment that forms the peptide-substrate binding site. Overall, absence of phosphates in IN-box results in a 20-fold decrease in the catalytic efficiency (k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub>) of [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>loop-P</sup> compared to the fully phosphorylated complex.

From now on, [Aurora B/IN-box<sup>Phe845Cys</sup>] in fully phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms will be referred to as [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>all-P*</sup> and [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>no-P*</sup>, respectively. Indeed, [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>all-P*</sup> and [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>no-P*</sup> show similar HDX pattern as the enzyme complex without the mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Each of the phosphorylations alone results in intermediate structuring of the entire enzyme complex compared with the fully phosphorylated enzyme. For example, two Aurora B regions defining the catalytic site, the catalytic helix (Aurora B<sup>αC</sup>) and the catalytic loop (HRD loop), each exhibit partial H/D protection in both partially phosphorylated forms of the enzyme complex, corresponding to approximately half of the full protection observed in the fully phosphorylated active enzyme complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, first two regions). The only exceptions to this rule are two regions that show equal or even greater H/D protection upon partial phosphorylation (black boxes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, last two peptides). In the [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>IN-P</sup> complex, only the IN-box<sup>αA</sup> helix shows high HDX protection. Interestingly, rigidification of the IN-box<sup>αA</sup> only partially affects neighboring Aurora B parts (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>, first region, encompassing Aurora B<sup>αC</sup>), suggesting that structuring of the IN-box is not sufficient to cause complete rigidification of the neighboring Aurora B regions.

Therefore, in [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>lN-P</sup>, the phosphorylated IN-box remains stably associated only with the N-lobe for the duration of the MD simulation. The stabilization of the N-terminal part of IN-box in this intermediate, that we observe with HDX, may be due to the interaction of the C-terminal IN-box with the N-terminal lobe of Aurora B. This interaction results in a more rigid IN-box, albeit in a conformation that is unproductive for enzyme activity.</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-85328-video3.mp4" id="video3"><label>Video 3.</label><caption><title>2.8 μs molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectory of [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>IN-P</sup>.</title></caption></media><p>A very interesting conformational change was observed in [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>loop-P</sup>, where only the activation loop of Aurora B is phosphorylated, the C-terminal region of IN-box is immediately attracted to the Aurora B<sup>pThr248</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>), in a similar manner as in [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup>.

We found that all three complexes can achieve the same activity as [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup> (wt) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>), but the autoactivation proceeds with different kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). As expected, the [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>no-P</sup>, devoid of any phosphorylation, autoactivates slowest. However, the [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>loop-P</sup> is autoactivated much faster than the [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>IN-P</sup>.</p><p>Previously, Aurora B autoactivation by phosphorylation was found to occur in two steps: first a slow intramolecular step followed by a faster intermolecular step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zaytsev et al., 2016</xref>) but the tools to unambiguously correlate the kinetic steps with the specific phosphorylation events during autoactivation were not available. Our autoactivation experiments with partially phosphorylated intermediates clearly show that phosphorylation of the Aurora B activation loop is the slow step, as [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>IN-P</sup> (where Aurora B<sup>Thr248</sup> is not phosphorylated) is slowly autoactivated. On the other hand, phosphorylation of IN-box is the fast step because [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>loop-P</sup> (where IN-box is not phosphorylated) autoactivates quickly. To further confirm that phosphorylation of the Aurora B activation loop occurs intramolecularly (cis) and phosphorylation of IN-box occurs intermolecularly (trans), we used the kinetic test developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dodson et al., 2013</xref>. To this end, we used different concentrations of enzyme complexes with fixed high substrate concentrations and continuously followed the product formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The traces of product formation were normalized to the respective enzyme concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). An overlap of the normalized traces in the lag phase of the curve indicates a concentration-independent, intramolecular, reaction. This profile was observed for [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>IN-P</sup> (pink curves), confirming that phosphorylation of the activation loop occurs in ‘cis’. In the case of [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>loop-P</sup> (green curves), the normalized traces of product formation at different enzyme concentrations show that the rate of product formation is concentration dependent. At higher enzyme concentration, the changes in the slope are more pronounced, confirming that phosphorylation of the TSS motif occurs intermolecularly. Thus, our kinetic analysis with partially phosphorylated intermediates identifies autophosphorylation of the Aurora B activation loop as a cis-acting, rate-limiting step and IN-box TSS phosphorylation as a faster trans-acting event in the autoactivation of [Aurora B/IN-box].</p><p>It is noteworthy that phosphorylation of the activation loop in cis is the first necessary step in the autoactivation process, assuming a completely unphosphorylated enzyme pool. However, a partially active or fully active enzyme can phosphorylate the activation loop in trans. This type of activation mechanism with an initial intramolecular activation step followed by an intermolecular step of activation have been previously reported for PAK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2011b</xref>) and for Aurora B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zaytsev et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>The IN-box plays a crucial role in both organizing the substrate peptide binding site and enabling catalysis of the [Aurora B/IN-box] complex</title><p>According to the MD simulation the arginine residues of IN-box, IN-box<sup>Arg843</sup> and IN-box<sup>Arg847</sup>, interact with Aurora B<sup>pThr248</sup> in the intermediate [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>loop-P</sup> and the fully phosphorylated enzyme complex, respectively. To investigate the role of these arginine residues in kinase activity, we generated point mutants IN-box<sup>Arg843Ala</sup> and IN-box<sup>Arg847Ala</sup> in the context of the [Aurora B/IN-box] complex. Mutation of IN-box<sup>Arg847</sup>, which interacts with Aurora B<sup>pThr248</sup> in the final structure of [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup>, to alanine results in an enzyme complex with four times lower catalytic efficiency (v<sub>max</sub>/K<sub>M</sub>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). This is due to the fivefold increase in K<sub>M</sub> for the substrate peptide compared with the wt complex, while the k<sub>cat</sub> increases only slightly. Thus, kinetic analysis identifies this residue and its interaction with Aurora B<sup>pThr248</sup> as an important organizer of the substrate-peptide binding site. Interestingly, in the [Aurora C/IN-box] crystal structure this residue makes strong salt bridge with Aurora C<sup>Glu98</sup> (corresponding to Aurora B<sup>Glu148</sup>) located in the Aurora B<sup>αC</sup> helix. On the other hand, mutation of the IN-box<sup>Arg843</sup> to alanine results in 2.5-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency. This residue is involved in stabilizing Aurora B<sup>pThr248</sup> in [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>loop-P</sup> and it is stabilizing the IN-box TS<sup>P</sup>S<sup>P</sup> conformation in [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup> simulations, as well as in the [Aurora C/IN-box] crystal structure, albeit the orientation of residues is different. The mutant IN-box<sup>Arg843Ala</sup> is not affected in the K<sub>M</sub> for the substrate peptide, suggesting that the IN-box<sup>Arg843</sup> predominantly supports the catalytic process (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The residue is far from the active site of the enzyme complex but could be involved in stabilizing the enzyme conformations and/or dynamics, favoring efficient catalysis. These results again suggest a dual role of the IN-box residues (which is partially uncoupled in the tested mutants) in both substrate recognition and catalysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Maximal activation by phosphorylation is associated with concerted movement between the [Aurora B/IN-box] subdomains and the activation loop</title><p>Next, we analyzed the changes in global movements of the [Aurora B/IN-box] in MD simulations as a function of the phosphorylation status of the enzyme complex. We performed principal component analysis (PCA) for the MD trajectories of Aurora B in each of the phosphorylation states. The first principal components (eigenvectors) are always associated with the largest conformational changes, and this type of analysis has proven very useful for understanding global movements that govern catalysis in other protein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Masterson et al., 2011</xref>). The dominant eigenvectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>) for all enzyme forms describe the opening and closing of the active site due to the two lobes of the kinase becoming distant or closer respectively, the other dominant motion is the twisting or shearing motion between the kinase lobes, as well as the movements in the activation loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). However, the type of movement defined by the first principal component (PC1, the one corresponding to the largest relative movement) depends on the phosphorylation status of the enzyme complex. This is open-close movement (for [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>no-P</sup>), twisting (for [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>IN-P</sup>), an activation loop movement (for [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>loop-P</sup>), and synchronized opening and closing of lobes and loop movement (for[Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup>) (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>). Importantly, the cosine content evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hess, 2000</xref>) for PC1 in [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup> was only 0.01. In contrast, the first eigenvectors in all other forms had a cosine content between 0.5 and 0.9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, table). The small values of the cosine content indicate that the deformation in [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup> is a truly organized vibrational deformation that coordinates the open-closed/twist motion with the oscillation of the activation loop, whereas the first mode in all other phosphorylation states of the enzyme complex (with high cosine content) is mostly associated with random deformations.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Principal component analysis (PCA) shows that only fully phosphorylated [Aurora B/IN-box] achieves coordinated movements between opening/closing, twisting, and movements in the activation loop.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Protein movements in the different phosphorylation forms of the [Aurora B/IN-box] complex in PC1 are illustrated by porcupine diagrams (opening/closing movement, twisting movement, movement in the activation loop).

The plot shows that the unphosphorylated form of the enzyme complex, [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>no-P</sup> (blue), explores a wider range of conformations, consistent with a highly disorganized, easily deformable structure. Along the ‘open-closed’ axis, this enzyme complex forms two groups of ensembles, clearly indicating the existence of two stabilized populations (one in the open and the other in the closed state; blue circles in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), while intermediate conformations are sparse. Phosphorylation of the activation loop, [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>loop-P</sup> (green), significantly reduces the conformational space examined along both vectors. This reflects a better organized enzyme with closer distance between the lobes, consistent with progressive restriction of movement within the structure. Finally, full phosphorylation, [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup> (red), further increases the degree of order and rigidity within the enzymatic complex, forcing the enzyme into three well-defined regions in the graph that correspond to the occurrence of natural oscillations associated with opening and closing movements and twist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>). Negative twisting is associated with two distinct conformational basins, corresponding to the closed or open conformation of the enzyme. The separation of the two basins indicates that an open-closed transition is unlikely in this twist conformation. On the contrary, when the twist between the lobes is moderately positive, the enzyme can easily transition between the open and closed states. It can be concluded that in [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup>, the transitions between open and closed conformation are regulated and coordinated by the twist, indicating complete synchronization of the global movements of the kinase subdomains when fully phosphorylated.</p><p>In summary, only when the enzyme complex is fully phosphorylated are the opening and closing of the lobes, the shearing motion between the lobes, and the opening and closing of the activation loop fully coordinated, resulting in efficient catalysis. The PCA result is consistent with the kinetic and HDX analysis and highlights that full activity requires a well-structured enzyme complex with a high degree of coordination of movement, which is synergistically achieved by phosphorylation in the Aurora B activation loop and in the IN-box.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Using HDX and MD, we found that phosphorylation has a structuring effect on the [Aurora B/IN-box] complex, with the enzyme exploring fewer conformations and therefore becoming more rigid. Structuring after phosphorylation appears to be a general activation mechanism for the protein kinase family, and similar effects have been reported for protein kinase A and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hsu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Steichen et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>A unique feature of Aurora B is its obligate association with the binding partner INCENP, which is also subject to phosphorylation. The recent crystal structure of [Aurora C/IN-box] showed that the phosphorylated IN-box interacts with the phosphorylated activation loop and stabilizes a more compact conformation, compatible with the active state of kinases. This structure implies a synergistic interaction between the two phosphorylation sites of the enzymatic complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdul Azeez et al., 2019</xref>). We complement and extend these findings by using an experimental approach that is independent of the ability to crystallize the protein complex. Our approach addresses the lack of structural information for the unphosphorylated complex and the lack of information about structural dynamics and its possible role in [Aurora B/IN-box] autoactivation. Using a solution-based and computational approaches, we methodically studied the unphosphorylated, phosphorylated, and partially phosphorylated forms of the enzyme complex under the same conditions. Our enzyme kinetics experiments with the partially phosphorylated forms confirm that the two phosphorylation sites contribute synergistically to the Aurora B kinase activity. Moreover, the HDX experiments together with the MD simulations show a correlation between the dynamics of the two partners (Aurora B and the IN-box) and that phosphorylation of the activation loop in conjunction with phosphorylation in the IN-box is required to coordinate the dynamics between the N-terminal and C-terminal lobes of the kinase.</p><p>The HDX experiment clearly shows that the IN-box is a highly dynamic polypeptide chain, with most of its regions reaching maximal deuteration after only 3 min of D<sub>2</sub>O incubation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>), even in the phosphorylated state. Interestingly, the N-terminal part of the IN-box, which is the only part containing defined secondary structure elements, exhibits EX1-like HDX kinetics, suggesting that the IN-box<sup>αA</sup> and IN-box<sup>αB</sup> helices reversibly undergo folding and unfolding. Despite the reversible unfolding of the helices, the IN-box remains associated with Aurora B, which was confirmed by our mass photometry experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). The EX1 kinetics, and its relation to local unfolding of proteins under native conditions, has been described in detail in the literature.

This observation, together with the MD simulation analysis indicates that the higher unfolding rate in the IN-box N-terminal region of the unphosphorylated state transfers disorder to the adjacent N-lobe of Aurora B and in this way negatively affects kinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and F</xref>). In summary, we provide strong evidence that in the unphosphorylated form of the enzyme complex, the IN-box acts as a negative regulator.</p><p>On the other hand, phosphorylation of the Aurora B activation loop leads to partial structuring within Aurora B and to a substantial conformational change of the IN-box, as well as to the adoption of an enzyme conformation closer to that required for efficient catalysis. However, the absence of phosphate groups on the IN-box continues to interfere with the optimal arrangement of the enzyme complex. Finally, when both Aurora B and the IN-box are phosphorylated, the enzyme complex is structured and coordinated in its global movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Thus, in the fully phosphorylated form of the enzyme complex, the phosphorylated IN-box acts as a positive regulator that stabilizes the productive enzyme conformation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model summarizing the autoactivation mechanism of [Aurora B/IN-box].</title><p>In the absence of phosphorylation, the [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>no-P</sup>, the enzyme complex is very flexible.

To better understand the role of phosphorylation on the IN-box conformation, we performed simulations on [Aurora C/IN-box] in the fully phosphorylated state, [Aurora C/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup>, and in the partially phosphorylated state, [Aurora C/IN-box]<sup>loop-P</sup>, using the [Aurora C/IN-box] crystal structure as a starting model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). These simulations confirmed that the residues following the TSS motif are highly flexible, even in the fully phosphorylated state. In addition, MD simulations on an [Aurora C/IN-box]<sup>loop-P</sup> show that the absence of the IN-box phosphates in the [Aurora C/IN-box] structure results in relaxation of the longer C-terminal segment of the IN-box, which contains the TSS motif. In this simulation, the IN-box is less organized, overall (higher RMSD), than in the [Aurora C/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup> simulation and the IN-box<sup>886-903</sup> rapidly loses association with the phosphorylated activation loop and moves toward the C-lobe of the kinase to adopt a similar, but not identical, conformation to that observed in our original simulation, [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>loop-P</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, inset). The observed behavior confirms that the C-terminal part of the IN-box is a highly entropic unit that follows fast diffusion dynamics directly controlled by the phosphorylation state of the system, with the highest degree of disorder in the unphosphorylated state, partially organized in the [Aurora B(C)/IN-box]<sup>loop-P</sup> state, and better organized, although still highly dynamic, in the [Aurora B(C)/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup>.</p><p>The high dynamics of the IN-box is most likely the main reason for the difficulties in obtaining the crystal structure of [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup>, as reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sessa et al., 2005</xref>. Therefore, according to our analysis, it is likely that there are few equally stable and productive conformations of [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup>. [Aurora C/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup> more likely represents the more stable conformation of the active state while the conformation observed in the [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup> simulation, described here, is probably a productive intermediate along the activation coordinate. Limitations in the simulation time and the very entropic nature of the IN-box C-terminal region may be the reasons our simulation did not reach the IN-box conformation observed in the [Aurora C/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup> crystal structure.</p><p>Overall, the IN-box plays a major role in the structural conformations adopted by Aurora B and in the synchronization of Aurora B subdomain motions observed in the active state of the enzyme complex.

Since only the fully active [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup> exhibits synchronized global motions, we propose that global domain movement is directly linked to the catalytic cycle of this enzyme complex and likely controls substrate binding and product release.</p><p>In the present study, we use the [Aurora B/IN-box] complex containing only the INCENP fragment required for interaction with Aurora B, the IN-box, whereas the full-length INCENP has a long N-terminal part, which raises the question of whether or not the dynamics of the IN-box are different in the context of the full-length INCENP. The IN-box was previously defined as the minimal region of INCENP that binds Aurora B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sessa et al., 2005</xref>), and phosphorylation of [Aurora B/IN-box] results in similar enzymatic activation as [Aurora B/INCENP<sup>full-length</sup>] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zaytsev et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that the IN-box is the only region of INCENP that is important and necessary for the regulation of kinase activity by phosphorylation. This is a strong indication that the dynamic changes observed in the IN-box upon phosphorylation of [Aurora B/IN-box] most likely follow the same trend in the context of full-length INCENP. At the same time, it is noteworthy that the N-terminal region of INCENP is required for the localization of the CPC at the inner centromere, resulting in a high local concentration of the [Aurora B/INCENP] complex, which is crucial for the rapid intermolecular activation of the kinase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zaytsev et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>It has been previously proposed that autoactivation of [Aurora B/IN-box] occurs via a two-step mechanism with a slow cis-step and a fast trans-step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zaytsev et al., 2016</xref>). Following our kinetic and MD analysis with partially phosphorylated enzyme complexes, we can now confirm this model and conclude that phosphorylation of the Aurora B activation loop is the slow intramolecular process followed by rapid trans phosphorylation of the IN-box TSS motif. It is important to emphasize that in the proposed model, the slow intramolecular step is obligatory only when the entire population of [Aurora B/IN-box] is dephosphorylated. The initial intramolecular step is followed by intermolecular propagation of activation, which may also include the activation segment.</p><p>Phosphorylation gradients of Aurora B substrates in the cell have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fuller et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2011a</xref>), and these long-range gradients play a regulatory role in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Afonso et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferreira et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Uehara et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, a strong evidence for the existence of a steep gradient of Aurora B activity at metaphase chromosomes has been reported and it has been suggested that the kinetics of Aurora B activity plays an important role in the formation of this gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zaytsev et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we found that the partially phosphorylated [Aurora B/IN-box] intermediates have very low kinase activity (5–10%) which, together with the two-step Aurora B autoactivation, is consistent with the ability to form a steep phosphorylation gradient. Thus, a small increase in phosphatase concentration in a local cell region such as the kinetochore could cause a sharp decrease in kinase activity in the kinetochore region, whereas in a nearby region, Aurora B kinase activity could remain high.</p><p>The very similar Aurora A (72% identity), which associates with a different binding partner, TPX2, can be activated to an appreciable extent independently, either only by association with TPX2 or only by phosphorylation in the activation loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dodson and Bayliss, 2012</xref>). Two pathways of Aurora A activation are used separately at the physiological level. The pool of Aurora A involved in chromatin-driven microtubule nucleation is regulated exclusively by association with TPX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kufer et al., 2002</xref>) and phosphorylation in the activation loop is not observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Levinson, 2018</xref>). On the other hand, Aurora A activation at the centrosome depends only on phosphorylation of the activation loop and does not involve TPX2 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Joukov et al., 2010</xref>). While Aurora A has evolved to allow two independent activation pathways, activation of Aurora B, which is always in complex with IN-box, follows a single synergistic activation pathway that requires the coincidence of two events: phosphorylation of threonine in the activation loop and phosphorylation of the binding partner (TSS motif in the IN-box).</p><p>The present study demonstrates the important role that dynamics plays in regulating the enzymatic activity of [Aurora B/IN-box]. Our study explains and highlights the importance of IN-box (specific and obligatory Aurora B partner) as a necessary structural and strong regulatory element of the enzyme complex. The new findings suggest that the interface between Aurora B and the IN-box represents a target area for the development of a new type of Aurora B-specific drugs that would disrupt the allosteric changes required for activation. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the biophysical basis for the switch-like transition in Aurora B catalytic activity upon autophosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zaytsev et al., 2016</xref>), a feature that underlies the intracellular spatial pattern of Aurora B substrate phosphorylation essential for proper chromosome segregation and cell division.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Preparation of [Aurora B/IN-box] complex in different phosphorylation states</title><p>The wt enzymatic complex containing Aurora B (60–361 aa) and IN-box (790–856 aa) from <italic>X. laevis</italic> was expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, using a bicistronic construct that was cloned in the pRSF duet vector (Novagen). The GB1 domain from the streptococcal protein G was fused to the N-terminus of Aurora B in order to increase protein expression and solubility.

First, IMAC with nickel column (GE HealthCare) was used to trap the tagged protein complex. After removal of the 6XHisGB1 by TEV cleavage, the enzyme complex was further purified with size exclusion chromatography. The protein was stored at –80°C in a buffer containing 10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM DTT, and 50% glycerol until further use. To obtain the dephosphorylated form, the enzyme complex was incubated with 0.2 μM of GST-λ phage phosphatase (made in-house) during 1 hr at 30°C, followed by incubation with glutathione beads to remove the phosphatase.</p><p>To generate the partially phosphorylated forms of the enzyme, the 6XHis-GB1-Aurora B (59–361 aa) and IN-box (790–844 aa; IN-box<sup>ΔC</sup>) coding regions were introduced in the pTXB1 plasmid (NEB) by in-fusion cloning using the Nde1 and Sap1 cloning site. The resulting construct has two translational cassettes. The upstream cassette contains 6xHis-GB1-(TEV site)-Aurora B and the downstream cassette contains the IN-box<sup>ΔC</sup> fused to the N-terminus of the Mxe intein-chitin binding domain protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Telenti et al., 1997</xref>). The enzyme complex, [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>IN-ΔC</sup>, was expressed using the same parameters as the wt. Furthermore, IMAC was used as the first step of purification. Next, for obtaining the [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>loop-P</sup>, the enzyme complex was incubated with the fully active [Aurora B/IN-box] (10 nM final) in the presence of 5 mM ATP-Mg for 1 hr. This ensured full phosphorylation of Aurora B<sup>Thr248</sup>. Analogously, for obtaining [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>IN-P</sup>, the enzyme complex was incubated with GST-λ-phosphatase (0.2 μM final) for 1 hr. This ensured full dephosphorylation of Aurora B<sup>Thr248</sup>. In parallel with either phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of the enzyme complex, the reaction was incubated with TEV protease for 3 hr to remove the 6xHis-GB1 tag. The enzyme complex was then further purified by incubation with chitin beads (NEB), to remove traces of TEV and fully active kinase or phosphatase. Elution from the chitin beads was done by overnight incubation with 50 mM of 2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid (MESNA) (Sigma-Aldrich) that induces intein-mediated cleavage. The product is a C-terminal thioester on the IN-box<sup>ΔC</sup> which can be ligated to a synthetic peptide with an N-terminal cysteine. At this step, in order to obtain [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>loop-P</sup>, we fully incubated phosphorylated [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>IN-ΔC</sup> with the peptide sequence CKRTSSAVWHSPPL-6xHis. Analogously, in order to obtain [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>IN-P</sup> we incubated dephosphorylated [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>IN-ΔC</sup> with the peptide sequence CKRTS(PO<sub>4</sub>)S(PO<sub>4</sub>)AVWHSPPL-6xHis. The ligation reaction proceeded overnight in a ligation buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM MESNA, 5 mM ascorbic acid, 10 mM TCEP) with 50 μM [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>ΔC</sup> and 600 μM peptide. To remove the excess of unligated peptide, the protein sample was run on Superdex S200 16/60 column. To separate the ligated enzymatic complex from the unligated [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>IN-ΔC</sup>, the sample was run over a Ni column and the pure ligated protein was eluted with imidazole. The protein was stored same as wt until further use.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Enzymatic assay</title><p>The enzymatic activity of Aurora B was measured by monitoring the product (ADP) formation rate using a pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase-coupled spectrophotometric assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roskoski, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wu and Wang, 2003</xref>).

The autophosphorylation reaction was left to proceed and aliquots were taken at different times of preincubation with ATP to determine the initial rates. Each aliquot was diluted to a low nanomolar concentration (10–50 nM in the kinase assay buffer supplemented with 0.6 mM substrate peptide) and initial rates were determined as described above. Since low nanomolar concentrations of Aurora B were used in the assay and the rate is determined in the first minutes of the reaction (2–4 min, where the kinetics of product release are linear), the amount of autophosphorylation of the enzyme is negligible.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Kinetic test to determine cis or trans activation steps</title><p>In difference to the autoactivation assay, where enzyme complex was preincubated with ATP-Mg, here the enzyme complexes at different concentrations (25, 50, and 100 nM) were incubated with 1 mM ATP-Mg and 0.6 mM substrate peptide at the same time, and the formation of ADP was continuously monitored for a prolonged period (450 min).

Nonetheless, the involvement of strongly charged, titratable moieties challenge global transferability for the parameters, opening the ground to future improvement based on more sophisticated treatment of electrostatic interactions, like by polarizable force fields.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) summary table for [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup> and [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>no-P</sup> datasets.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-85328-supp1-v2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Statistics of hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) uptake for all peptides over time in [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup> and [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>no-P</sup> datasets.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-85328-supp2-v2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) summary table for [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>all-P*</sup>, [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>no-P*</sup>, [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>loop-P</sup>, and [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>IN-P</sup> datasets.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-85328-supp3-v2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp4"><label>Supplementary file 4.</label><caption><title>Statistics of hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) uptake for all peptides over time in [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>all-P*</sup>, [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>no-P*</sup>, [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>loop-P</sup>, and [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>IN-P</sup> datasets.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-85328-supp4-v2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp5"><label>Supplementary file 5.</label><caption><title>Full hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) dataset for [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>all-P*</sup> (red), [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>IN-P</sup> (purple), [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>loop-P</sup> (green), and [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>no-P*</sup> (blue).</title><p>All collected peptides are shown with the standard error calculated based on two replicates.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Volker Dötsch as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Richard Bayliss (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, the reviewers feel quite positively about the manuscript and agree that this work advances our understanding of Aurora B activation. The greatest strength is the strategy to prepare and study enzyme complexes with specific phosphorylation sites occupied, either the activation loop or the TSS sites. The emphasis on changing Aurora B/IN-box dynamics is also a valuable addition to the existing structural models. The primary weakness, detailed by Reviewer 2, is in the MD simulations, and these should be the focus of revisions:</p><p>1. It would be instructive to model the interactions of the phosphorylated INCENP with Aurora B using the structure of Aurora C/IN-box (6GR8) as a template. Is it the same or different than the results presented, which start with Aurora B/IN-box (4C2W)?</p><p>2. Please compare and contrast the MD models with the Aurora C/IN-box crystal structure, especially regarding the interactions between the IN-box and the activation loop, and hypothesize what could lead to the observed differences.</p><p>3. Please discuss the challenges of modeling phosphorylated proteins and how these limitations might affect interpretation of the MD results.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Reviewer comments from a previous submission were thoroughly addressed, including important controls for unphosphorylated F845C AURKB, continued binding of INCENP to AURKB during HDX, the kinetic contributions of T248 and TSS phosphorylation, and disruption of the AURKB motif by R847 mutation.</p><p>To expand more specifically on the point about statistical analysis from the public review:</p><p>1. In Figure S1, please indicate the concentration of substrate peptide, the number of replicates, and some measure of experimental variability.</p><p>2. In the RMSF plots in Figure 2 and Figure S6, is there a way to statistically test if the distributions are significantly different? The difference is apparent in Figure 2E, but more subtle in Figure 2F, so it would be more convincing with statistical evidence.</p><p>3. Please add error bars to Figure S9B.</p><p>4. What is the difference between Figure S16B and Figure 5E? Also, please indicate the number of replicates and experimental variability for these figures.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>p.4 EX1 kinetics and EX2 kinetics are technical terms that should be defined and explained.</p><p>p.5 Using the 4C2W as a starting point for simulation is justified, as a model for Aurora-B. However, for modelling the interactions of the phosphorylated INCENP, the structure of Aurora-C/pINCENP (6GR8) would be a better option. Because the sequences of Aurora-B and -C are very similar, it would be straightforward to make an Aurora-B/phos-INCENP starting model, which could be &quot;dephosphorylated&quot; in silico to then probe the roles of the different phosphorylation states.</p><p>p.6 The comparison of the Aurora-B/IN-box model from MD with the crystal structure of Aurora-C/IN-box is incomplete because there are major differences between them in the IN-box interaction with the kinase activation loop. These should be described and an explanation provided for why the MD simulation leads to a different result from the experimental crystal structure. For example;</p><p>– In the Aurora-C/IN-box crystal structure, there are no direct interactions between the IN-box and the phosphate group on the activation loop threonine. In the Aurora-B/IN-box models, either Arg847 or Arg843 forms a direct interaction with the phosphate on the activation loop threonine.</p><p>– In the Aurora-C/IN-box crystal structure, the phosphate groups attached to the TSS motif interact directly with Aurora-C, whereas in the Aurora-B/IN-box model they do not, instead they are pointing out into solvent.</p><p>– The residues equivalent to Aurora-B/IN-box model Arg847 and Arg843 in the Aurora-C/IN-box structure participate in the interface, but have different interactions. This is important for interpreting the results of mutating these residues because they would be expected to affect binding/activity in either model.</p><p>p.9 The rapid formation of very stable salt-bridge interactions between the TSS and adjacent positively charged residues indicates that the modelling parameters may not be optimized for phosphorylated proteins. As these interactions are non-native (i.e. not in the crystal structure of Aurora-C/IN-box), their stability prevents the simulation from reaching the native conformation. Simulation of phosphorylated proteins is challenging, with interactions of the phosphate groups being artificially strong in some standard force field models (e.g. 10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00967, and 10.1021/acs.jcpa.8b04418 for improved polarisable modelling of phosphate). The potential limitations of this aspect of the study should be discussed.</p><p>p.10 The loss of activity of the Lys846Asn-Arg847Gln mutant is difficult to understand, what is the rationale? Is this simply a poorly-behaved protein, or how else do these residues contribute to Aurora-B autophosphorylation? Perhaps the individual residue mutations would shed some light on this?</p><p>p.11 The sentence mid-way through the first paragraph, that starts &quot;For [Aurora B/IN-box]no-P&quot; is very difficult to understand and is structured with too many commas. It should be rewritten.</p><p>p.11 The analysis of global movements is interesting, but the authors should be more cautious about the interpretation because the simulations are of relatively short duration, and the changes may be overly influenced by initial conformational changes as the protein responds to the in silico phosphorylation. The analysis would be improved by including a plot against time/RMSD of the occupancy of the major conformational states.</p><p>p.12 Analysis of the EX1-like kinetics suggesting that the helices in the IN-box might be only partially formed whilst the proteins are interacting is very interesting. It would be helpful to the reader to explain this analysis more clearly for a non-expert, perhaps with reference to previous examples in the literature.</p><p>p.15 Does one biological replicate really mean a single sample, or does it mean two samples (in which case, two replicates/samples would be more accurate).</p><p>p.17 Which software was used for the modelling? Which phosphoryl group model was used (e.g. TP2)?</p><p>Supplementary:</p><p>p.9 (Figure S5) part C, the phosphoserines are mislabelled pT</p><p>p.13 (Figure S8) is there a reason why the quality of one spectrum in each of the spectra sets in Figure S8 is poor?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85328.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Reviewer comments from a previous submission were thoroughly addressed, including important controls for unphosphorylated F845C AURKB, continued binding of INCENP to AURKB during HDX, the kinetic contributions of T248 and TSS phosphorylation, and disruption of the AURKB motif by R847 mutation.</p><p>To expand more specifically on the point about statistical analysis from the public review:</p><p>1.

This measurement was performed several times with high reproducibility. The experimental details of this experiment can now be found in the legend.

In the present manuscript, we have retained Figure 5E in the main set of figures and added two new panels in the supplement (Figure 5—figure supplement 2B and 2C). In Figure 5E, we show normalized point-by-point data from a 450-min experiment for two partially phosphorylated enzyme forms at three different enzyme concentrations. We now add an additional experiment for the [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>IN-P</sup> construct performed in triplicate and with four enzyme concentrations (Figures S16B and C). Figure 5—figure supplement 2B shows the curves with the standard measurement error and Figure 5—figure supplement 2C shows the normalized plots.

Based on the structural evidence from the crystal structure of Aurora B and Aurora C, the previous report by (Zaytsev, Segura-Peña at al, <italic>eLife</italic>.2016) and the kinetics experiment in this manuscript, we also conclude that phosphorylation in the IN-box occurs in <italic>trans</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>p.4 EX1 kinetics and EX2 kinetics are technical terms that should be defined and explained.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that these terms are technical and therefore difficult to explain. We have now clarified the text that refers to this phenomenon to make it more understandable to a wide audience and to avoid a detailed technical explanation that is beyond the scope of this article (page 4, middle of the last paragraph). In the discussion, we have also expanded the references to examples and reviews that an interested reader can use to find more detailed explanations of this phenomenon. See also the response to comment #8 by this reviewer.</p><p>“HDX kinetics for this region shows a strong component of EX1 kinetics and a smaller component of common EX2 kinetics. By definition, EX2 kinetics is common in the native folded state of proteins, while EX1 kinetics are less common in native conditions and is indicative of structural unfolding of local protein regions (Arrington and Robertson, 2000; Chitta et al., 2009; Ferraro et al., 2004; Sperry et al., 2012; Walters et al., 2013). In the IN-box<sup>805-825</sup> region, we observe the appearance of two clear isotopic envelopes (Figure 1—figure supplement 3), a hallmark of EX1 kinetics. The lower mass isotopic peak corresponds to the folded state of IN-box<sup>805-825</sup>, where the amide-hydrogen bonds are more protected. The high mass isotope peak is indicative of the unfolded state of the IN-box<sup>805-825</sup> region, where multiple amide-hydrogen bonds break simultaneously and exchange hydrogen for deuterium. The EX1 behavior was observed in both [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>no-P</sup> and [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup>, suggesting that IN-box<sup>805-825</sup> reversibly switches between the unfolded and folded states regardless of the phosphorylation state. However, the higher mass peak appears more rapidly in [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>no-P</sup>, suggesting that this region of IN-box visits the unfolded state more frequently in the unphosphorylated form of the enzyme complex. Overall, this observation is consistent with a more disordered IN-box in the unphosphorylated state.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>p.5 Using the 4C2W as a starting point for simulation is justified, as a model for Aurora-B. However, for modelling the interactions of the phosphorylated INCENP, the structure of Aurora-C/pINCENP (6GR8) would be a better option. Because the sequences of Aurora-B and -C are very similar, it would be straightforward to make an Aurora-B/phos-INCENP starting model, which could be &quot;dephosphorylated&quot; in silico to then probe the roles of the different phosphorylation states.</p></disp-quote><p>The 4C2W was chosen as the model for our studies because all HDX and kinetic experiments were performed with the same protein, <italic>X. laevis</italic> Aurora B. In addition, one of the monomers in the asymmetric unit was crystallized with the ATP analog, adenosine-5’-[(β,γ)-imido]triphosphate bound in the active site, which we changed only slightly to ATP-Mg before starting the MD simulations. On the other hand, the structure of Aurora C (6GR8) is 75% identical to that of <italic>X. laevis</italic> Aurora B in the structured part and has a bulky inhibitor bound to the active site that is very different from the ATP-Mg. Nevertheless, we created a homology model of <italic>X. laevis</italic> [Aurora B/IN-box] using 6GR8 as template in SwissProt homology modeling software. The model was relaxed in the box of waters and the HADDOCK software was used to dock ATPMg in the active site. As a guide for the final orientation of the ATP-Mg in the active site, we used the highest hits to other Aurora crystals. However, when we ran the MD simulation under the same conditions as before, we found that the ATP-Mg detached from the active site after ~460 ns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref>). This could be due either to slight inaccuracies in the homology model, a well-documented phenomenon reported previously (see CASP competition reports from past decades), or to incompatibility of the Aurora C structure with the ATP-Mg in the active site. To clarify this ambiguity, we performed MD simulations with the &quot;unmutated&quot; original structure of Aurora C, to which ATP-Mg was similarly docked. Indeed, here, ATPMg was stable in the active site during 1 µs simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref>). Since Aurora B and Aurora C are expected to have the same dynamics, we decided to proceed with [Aurora C/IN-box] for further MD analysis. We observe that during 1 µs simulation, [Aurora C/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup> showed no changes in the interactions of the Aurora C<sup>pThr198</sup> and the phosphorylated TSS motif compared to the original model (crystal structure). The only difference was the flexible confirmation of the six very last C-terminal IN-box residues, which were probably secured in the original conformation by crystal contacts. Next, we removed the phosphates from the TSS motif of IN-box to obtain [Aurora C/IN-box]<sup>loop-P</sup>. Dephosphorylation of INbox leads to a dramatic conformational change of the C-terminal segment of IN-box<sup>886-903</sup>, which leaves its initial position and starts exploring a wide range of conformations. We find the results of this simulation insightful and further supporting our findings of the highly dynamic nature of IN-box. Thus, we now include them in the Discussion, where we discuss the possible reason for the differences between the final conformation observed in our [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup> simulation and crystal structure of [Aurora C/INbox]<sup>all-P</sup> (Page 13, last paragraph).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Homology model of X.</title><p>laevis [Aurora B/IN-box] based on the crystal structure of <italic>H. sapiens</italic> [Aurora C/IN-box], [Aurora Bhomology/IN-box]all-P, shows unstable ATP-Mg binding during MD simulation.

However, the C-terminal region of the IN-box adopts a different conformation in our [Aurora B/IN -box]<sup>all-P</sup> simulation than in the [Aurora C/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup> crystal structure, raising the possibility that the observed [Aurora B/IN box]<sup>all-P</sup> structure is either an intermediate on the activation coordinate or an alternative conformation in the fully phosphorylated state. To better understand the role of phosphorylation on the IN-box conformation, we performed simulations on [Aurora C/IN-box] in the fully phosphorylated state, [Aurora C/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup>, and in the partially phosphorylated state, [Aurora C/IN-box]<sup>loop-P</sup>, using the [Aurora C/IN-box] crystal structure as a starting model (Figure 7—figure supplement 1). These simulations confirmed that the residues following the TSS motif are highly flexible, even in the fully phosphorylated state. In addition, MD simulations on an [Aurora C/IN-box]<sup>loop-P</sup> show that the absence of the IN-box phosphates in the [Aurora C/IN-box] structure results in relaxation of the longer C-terminal segment of the IN-box, which contains the TSS-motif. In this simulation, the IN-box is less organized, overall (higher RMSD), than in the [Aurora C/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup> simulation and the IN-box<sup>886-903</sup> rapidly loses association with the phosphorylated activation loop and moves toward the C-lobe of the kinase to adopt a similar, but not identical, conformation to that observed in our original simulation, [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>loop-P</sup> (Figure 7—figure supplement 1, inset). The observed behavior confirms that the C-terminal part of the IN-box is a highly entropic unit that follows fast diffusion dynamics directly controlled by the phosphorylation state of the system, with the highest degree of disorder in the unphosphorylated state, partially organized in the [Aurora B(C)/IN -box]<sup>loop-P</sup> state, and better organized, although still highly dynamic, in the [Aurora B(C)/IN -box]<sup>all-P</sup>.”</p><p>In the Results section, we have also clarified that [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup> is most likely one of the intermediates along the activation trajectory (see response to the comment #3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>p.6 The comparison of the Aurora-B/IN-box model from MD with the crystal structure of Aurora-C/IN-box is incomplete because there are major differences between them in the IN-box interaction with the kinase activation loop. These should be described and an explanation provided for why the MD simulation leads to a different result from the experimental crystal structure. For example;</p><p>– In the Aurora-C/IN-box crystal structure, there are no direct interactions between the IN-box and the phosphate group on the activation loop threonine. In the Aurora-B/IN-box models, either Arg847 or Arg843 forms a direct interaction with the phosphate on the activation loop threonine.</p><p>– In the Aurora-C/IN-box crystal structure, the phosphate groups attached to the TSS motif interact directly with Aurora-C, whereas in the Aurora-B/IN-box model they do not, instead they are pointing out into solvent.</p><p>– The residues equivalent to Aurora-B/IN-box model Arg847 and Arg843 in the Aurora-C/IN-box structure participate in the interface, but have different interactions. This is important for interpreting the results of mutating these residues because they would be expected to affect binding/activity in either model.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the contacts in our [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup> simulations differ from those in the crystallographic [Aurora C/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup> structure, and we have highlighted the differences in the contacts in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 in our original manuscript. As shown in comparable simulations starting with the fully phosphorylated [Aurora C/IN-box] structure, the dynamics of the IN-box are fast and diffusive and responsive to [Aurora B(C)/IN-box] phosphorylation. In our original [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>allP</sup> simulation, that starts from partially phosphorylated structure, the IN-box adopts a conformation that likely represents one of the intermediates along the activation coordinate, just as the IN-box conformation in the crystal structure could be one of the several productive conformations. Since our study is intended to illustrate how phosphorylation affects the dynamics of the enzyme complex, rather than focusing on the specific orientation of residues in the active site observed by MD (which cannot yet be performed on time scales long enough to explore the entire conformational space) we refrain from commenting in detail the differences in phosphate interactions, but we clarify in the updated manuscript (page 6, paragraph 4) that the result of [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup> simulation most likely represents one of the intermediate steps along the activation coordinate.</p><p>“Overall, the structure from our [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup> simulation and the [Aurora C/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup> crystal structure are very similar. However, an important difference exists in the C-terminal IN-box region (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C). In the [Aurora B/IN box]<sup>all-P</sup> simulation, the C-terminal region of the IN-box is extended further toward the C-terminal lobe of the kinase and interacts with the phosphorylated activation segment, whereas in the [Aurora C/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup> crystal structure there are reciprocal interaction in which arginines from the activation loop interact with the phosphorylated TSS-motif of the IN-box. The latest interactions are not observed in our simulations. We suggest that the crystal structure of [Aurora C/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup> is more likely to represent the final active conformational state of the enzyme complex and that the [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup> from our simulation is more likely an intermediate state on the autoactivation trajectory. The transition from this intermediate state to the final state observed in the crystal structure could be a relatively slow process that occurs in time spans that we cannot capture with our simulation times. We discuss the possible reason for these differences in more detail in the Discussion.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>p.9 The rapid formation of very stable salt-bridge interactions between the TSS and adjacent positively charged residues indicates that the modelling parameters may not be optimized for phosphorylated proteins. As these interactions are non-native (i.e. not in the crystal structure of Aurora-C/IN-box), their stability prevents the simulation from reaching the native conformation. Simulation of phosphorylated proteins is challenging, with interactions of the phosphate groups being artificially strong in some standard force field models (e.g. 10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00967, and 10.1021/acs.jcpa.8b04418 for improved polarisable modelling of phosphate). The potential limitations of this aspect of the study should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We are puzzled by the reviewer's initial comment that the rapid interaction between the phosphorylated TSS motif and the neighbouring arginines is an MD artifact, since the equivalent of the salt bridge INbox<sup>pSer850</sup>-IN-box<sup>Arg843</sup> is also observed in the crystal structure of Aurora C (6GR8) (Figure 2—figure supplement 1).</p><p>Since the crystal structure is only one of the many conformations that the enzyme complex can assume, we also disagree with the argument that observing interactions that are not present in a crystal structure means that the force field we use is not reliable. Moreover, the formation of salt bridges between Aurora B<sup>pThr248</sup> and arginine from the IN-box instead of salt bridges within the IN-box should be due solely to the topological accessibility of the competing amino acids, since the exchange between a salt bridge with an arginine from the IN-box and one from Aurora B(C) is isoenergetic and thus not affected by the force field parameters themselves. Indeed, in the [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>loop-P</sup> simulation, we observe an interaction between Aurora B<sup>Arg843</sup> and Aurora B<sup>pThr248</sup>, whereas in the [Aurora B/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup> simulation, a conformational change of the IN-box led to an isoenergetic interaction between Aurora B<sup>Arg847</sup> and Aurora B<sup>pThr248</sup>, although both simulations are starting from the same topology.</p><p>In general, we agree that force fields, like any other scientific method (computational or experimental), are prone to bias. The reference cited by the reviewer (10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00967) is for interactions with alkali and alkaline earth ions. The development of reliable force fields for main-group metal ions is one of the most difficult and problematic open issues in computer modeling, so the problems cited in this reference are largely due to poor representation of cations. We agree that polarizable models could be a possible improvement for the treatment of electrolytic systems in the future, but their cost-effectiveness compared to traditional force fields is far from proven. At the same time, the CHARMM force field used in this work continues to lead the way in developing the most appropriate parameters for protein simulations, including those for phosphorylated moieties. This force field has been used successfully over several decades in a variety of studies of phosphorylated systems, including ATP-bound proteins and kinases, most notably in a very recent study of Aurora A kinase (DOI: 10.1021/jasms.1c00271). We now add a general commentary on the challenges of MD for phosphorylated proteins in Material and Methods (page 19, paragraph 5).</p><p>“Phosphorylation, as one of the most important post-translational modifications, has been thoroughly investigated by computational modelling over the years, in particular with great success for the kinase family (Saladino and Gervasio, 2016). Nonetheless, the involvement of strongly charged, titratable moieties challenge global transferability for the parameters, opening the ground to future improvement based on more sophisticated treatment of electrostatic interactions, like by polarizable force-fields.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>p.10 The loss of activity of the Lys846Asn-Arg847Gln mutant is difficult to understand, what is the rationale?

However, to confirm that we really observe different structural conformers, we followed the reviewer's suggestion and extended Figure 6—figure supplement 1 to show the change in conformational order parameters as a function of time for the last 1.5 µs of simulations (corresponding to the original Figure 6). The graph clearly shows that the fully phosphorylated system is in each of the three identified conformational basins, and the change between conformations occurs through a sharp transition, confirming that each basin represents a true local minimum of free energy.</p><p>Furthermore, the PC analysis of [Aurora C/IN-box]<sup>all-P</sup> confirmed same dominant PC motions, demonstrating that our PCA is not dominated by initial conformational changes as the protein responds to the <italic>in silico</italic> phosphorylation, but rather are hallmark of global dynamical properties of Aurora kinase that depend only on the topological features of the fold, and not on the specific amino acid sequence (DOI: 10.1021/ja044608+).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>p.12 Analysis of the EX1-like kinetics suggesting that the helices in the IN-box might be only partially formed whilst the proteins are interacting is very interesting.
