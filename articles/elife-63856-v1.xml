Transcriptional changes occur to enable the generation and function of the neural circuits underlying sensory perception. To gain insight into these changes, we generated single-cell transcriptomes of <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory- (ORNs), thermo-, and hygro-sensory neurons at an early developmental and adult stage using single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing. We discovered that ORNs maintain expression of the same olfactory receptors across development. Using receptor expression and computational approaches, we matched transcriptomic clusters corresponding to anatomically and physiologically defined neuron types across multiple developmental stages. We found that cell-type-specific transcriptomes partly reflected axon trajectory choices in development and sensory modality in adults. We uncovered stage-specific genes that could regulate the wiring and sensory responses of distinct ORN types. Collectively, our data reveal transcriptomic features of sensory neuron biology and provide a resource for future studies of their development and physiology.</p></abstract><kwd-group

critical for animals to find food, identify mates, recognize suitable habitats, and evade predators and harmful conditions. Specialized sensory neurons have evolved to discriminate and transmit information relating to chemical, thermal, and hygrosensory stimuli. In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> the ~58 types of primary sensory neurons that detect these cues are found in the third segment of the antenna, a branched structure emanating from the antenna called the arista, and the maxillary palp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The majority of neurons in the antenna are olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) that respond to a variety of volatile compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hallem et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hallem and Carlson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Silbering et al., 2011</xref>). A subset of neurons in the antenna and arista respond to temperature and humidity-related stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Yao et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Ni et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barbagallo and Garrity, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Enjin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Knecht et al., 2017</xref>). Each of the ~52 types of antennal sensory neurons expresses a distinct sensory receptor, or a unique combination of 2–3 receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Couto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Fishilevich and Vosshall, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Goldman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Silbering et al., 2011</xref>). Neurons that express the same receptor(s) also project their axons to the same glomerulus of the antennal lobe in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Couto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Fishilevich and Vosshall, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Benton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Silbering et al., 2011</xref>). Here, their axons form one-to-one connections with the dendrites of second-order projection neurons (PNs), thus creating discrete and anatomically stereotyped information-processing channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). For simplicity, we will broadly refer to the neurons within the third antennal segment as ORNs because they are the vast majority of neurons in this structure and their development and function are better studied, even though a small number of hygrosensory and thermosensory neurons are also present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barbagallo and Garrity, 2015</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Single-cell transcriptomic profiling of <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory receptor neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory system.

Concomitant with circuit formation and maturation, all ORN types express their unique olfactory receptor(s). Both the stereotyped development and organization of this system make it an excellent model to study molecular mechanisms of neuronal specification, axon guidance, and sensory physiology.

Recent scRNA-seq studies in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> nervous system have enabled the discovery of new cell types, mechanisms important for development and aging, and genes controlling neural specification and wiring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Croset et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Davie et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brunet Avalos et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Kurmangaliyev et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Özel et al., 2021</xref>). Our recent study at a mid-developmental stage demonstrates that single-cell transcriptomic clusters represent anatomically and functionally distinct ORN types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Li et al., 2020</xref>). Yet, the mechanisms enabling these distinct sensory neuron types to transition through discrete developmental states into functional adult cells remain enigmatic. Furthermore, it has been difficult to obtain single-cell transcriptomic access to adult ORNs as these cells, like many other peripheral tissues in insects, are encapsulated within the hardened cuticle and cannot be isolated without substantial damage.</p><p>Here, we developed a single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) protocol to profile adult ORNs, thermosensory and hygrosensory neurons. We also used single-cell RNA-seq to profile these neurons at an early pupal stage. On a global level, we observed a shift in gene expression as neurons advance through development, from axon guidance-related transcripts to those important for sensory function. At the cell-type level, transcriptomic clusters corresponded to anatomically and functionally defined neuron types, allowing us to assign the cell-type identity to ~60% of developing and ~80% of adult clusters. Cell-type-specific transcriptomes, in part, reflected axon trajectory choice in early development and physiological functions in adults. Finally, we uncovered a large number of genes that could regulate circuit assembly during development and the detection or transmission of sensory information in the adult stage. Altogether, this dataset provides an important foundation for investigating molecular mechanisms controlling sensory neuron development and function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single-cell transcriptomic profiling of <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory receptor neurons</title><p>Recently, we performed scRNA-seq on ORNs at a mid-developmental timepoint, 42–48 hr after puparium formation (APF; hereafter 42 hr APF), as their axons are in the final stage of selecting synaptic partner PNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, middle). We sought to more completely understand how transcriptomic changes underlie the differentiation and function of these cells by profiling them at two additional stages: 24–30 hr APF and 3–10 day old adult (hereafter 24 hr APF and adult, respectively). At 24 hr APF, ORN axons have just begun to circumnavigate the antennal lobe after selecting a specific trajectory, which is necessary for proper glomerular targeting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, left) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Joo et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, we reasoned that scRNA-seq of 24 hr APF neurons would provide us with a more comprehensive picture of their development and axon targeting. Adult single-cell transcriptomes are important for understanding how distinct ORN types detect and transmit sensory information, and adult cell types should be readily distinguishable by the specific sensory receptors they express. However, adult ORNs are emmeshed in the hardened cuticle, making it difficult to isolate them without substantial loss of RNA quality using standard scRNA-seq dissociation methods.</p><p>Therefore, we adapted single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) to profile adult ORNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), as similar methods have been used to gain transcriptomic access to cell types that are resistant to standard dissociation protocols in other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Habib et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Denisenko et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ding et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kebschull et al., 2020</xref>). Our snRNA-seq protocol is comparable to our scRNA-seq method, in which GFP-labeled neurons in the third antennal segment were dissected and dissociated into a single-cell suspension, sorted into 384-well plates via fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), and sequenced using the SMART-seq2 platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Picelli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, top). snRNA-seq differed from scRNA-seq at four steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, bottom).

Second, nuclei were dissociated mechanically rather than enzymatically. Third, nuclei were labeled with Hoechst, a fluorescent DNA stain, prior to being sorted into 384-well plates via FACS. Finally, since nuclei contain less RNA content than whole cells, nuclear cDNA was amplified using three additional PCR cycles and sequencing reads were aligned to both exons and introns, instead of exons alone for scRNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Comparison of single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic depicting ORN axons and PN dendrites in the antennal lobe (left) and summary table of the cell types, cell numbers, genotypes, and stages that were profiled using snRNA-seq and scRNA-seq.

Following quality filtering for cells/nuclei with ≥ 50,000 reads that express at least two out of five neuronal markers (see Materials and methods), we obtained 1,198 and 1,891 high-quality neurons at 24 hr APF and adult, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Together with the 1,016 ORNs from 42 hr APF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Li et al., 2020</xref>), we profiled a total of 4,105 neurons, representing three distinct developmental stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

These data demonstrate the reliability of our single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq protocols and suggest that substantial transcriptomic changes occur as development proceeds.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Comparison of single-nucleus and single-cell RNA-seq</title><p>Prior to examining ORN transcriptomes, we compared our snRNA-seq protocol to scRNA-seq. Since we were unable to directly evaluate adult ORN cells and nuclei, we sequenced 24 hr APF ORN nuclei to compare with cells at the same stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To increase the number of cells analyzed, we combined the transcriptomes of 24 hr APF ORN nuclei labeled by driving nuclear-GFP with either the pan-neuronal <italic>elav-GAL4</italic> or <italic>AM29-GAL4</italic> which labels two ORN types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Endo et al., 2007</xref>). We used pan-neuronal <italic>nSyb-GAL4</italic> to label adult ORNs. To evaluate if this technique was broadly applicable to fly neurons, we also sequenced adult PN nuclei using <italic>VT033006-GAL4</italic> to label the majority of PN types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Tirian and Dickson, 2017</xref>; see the companion manuscript <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Xie et al., 2021</xref> for details) and compared them with stage-matched cells labeled with <italic>GH146-GAL4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p>We began by comparing the number of uniquely mapped reads and genes detected in cells and nuclei. We expected that snRNA-seq reads would be lower than scRNA-seq because nuclear transcripts are only a fraction of those found in the entire cell. When we aligned sequencing reads to exons only, both the number of mapped reads and genes detected in ORN nuclei were reduced compared to cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). We tested if aligning nuclear sequencing reads to exons and introns could increase the gene detection rate, since intronic reads comprised 32.7% and 26.2% of total reads in 24 hr APF and adult ORN nuclei, respectively, compared to 10.5% when included in 24 hr APF cell reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Indeed, inclusion of intronic reads increased average gene detection rate in nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B, C</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Similarly, intronic reads were 27.4% of total PN reads; when they were added into exonic reads, the mean number of genes detected increases from ~1,000 to ~1,150 in nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Thus, including intronic reads in snRNA-seq data provides additional information that is not captured by exonic reads alone.</p><p>We next assessed gene expression variability between cells and nuclei. Changes in gene expression can arise from biological factors, such as differences in transcription rate or cell state, or are the result of technical artifacts leading to missed gene detection or ‘gene dropouts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Li and Xie, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Munsky et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Little et al., 2013</xref>). We evaluated expression of the five neuronal markers used for quality filtering of cells and nuclei (<italic>elav, CadN, Syt1, brp, nSyb</italic>) and additional widely expressed genes (<italic>cpo, Atpα, hsr-ω</italic>) to determine the contribution of gene dropouts to expression variability. The majority of genes we evaluated showed similar expression in both ORN and PN cells and nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–J</xref>). However, some genes, namely <italic>nSyb</italic> and <italic>brp</italic>, had a higher dropout rate in 24 hr nuclei compared to cells at the same stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,G</xref>), a finding that is in line with a previous report in mammalian neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bakken et al., 2018</xref>). Overall, gene dropouts likely do not contribute to considerable expression differences between cell and nuclear transcriptomes.</p><p>Next, we evaluated the extent to which snRNA-seq and scRNA-seq can detect similar genes. We first assayed the 20 genes with highest expression by percentage of total reads and found that stage-matched cells and nuclei shared a subset of the same highly expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F vs. G, I vs. J</xref> in red). As expected, cells showed higher detection of mitochondrial transcripts than nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F,I</xref>). Second, we compared the total genes detected in cells and nuclei. More than 70% of genes detected in ORN or PN cells were found in their nuclear counterparts, and more than 90% of nuclear genes were detected in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K–L</xref>), indicating that snRNA-seq can detect similar genes to scRNA-seq. Finally, we queried the types of genes that were differentially expressed between cells and nuclei by performing Gene Ontology (GO) analysis between stage-matched cell and nuclear transcriptomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashburner et al., 2000</xref>). Based on studies in other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bakken et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Deeke and Gagnon-Bartsch, 2020</xref>), we predicted that cells would be enriched for genes with house-keeping functions, probably resulting from preferential cytoplasmic mRNA stability. Indeed, cellular transcriptomes were enriched for genes in GO categories such as translation, protein folding, and metabolic processes, whereas nuclear transcriptomes contained terms related to stage-specific processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1K,L</xref>). Most of the stage-specific genes were also expressed in ORN cells, albeit at slightly reduced levels relative to nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1N</xref>, last column), indicating that our snRNA-seq and scRNA-seq protocols detect mostly overlapping genes. As expected, RNAs expressed from the mitochondrial genome were enriched in ORN cells, whereas long non-coding RNAs were enriched in nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1M,N</xref>).</p><p>We note two instances where we detect potentially artifactual gene expression in our adult ORN nuclei. First, some mitochondrial transcripts were found in adult nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Mitochondrial transcripts are among the highest detected genes in our single-cell transcriptomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F,I</xref>) but not in 24 hr APF ORN or PN nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G,J</xref>). Second, transcripts encoding odorant-binding proteins (Obps), known to be expressed at extremely high levels in accessory antennal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Menuz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Larter et al., 2016</xref>), were detected in adult ORN nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1O</xref>). Detection of mitochondrial and Obp transcripts in our adult nuclei was likely from contamination during isolation of nuclei from the hardened cuticle.</p><p>Finally, we asked if snRNA-seq could reveal transcriptomic changes associated with neuronal maturation. Thus, we computed the differentially expressed genes between nuclei at 24 hr APF and the adult stage and identified GO terms for each timepoint. Developing (24 hr APF) transcriptomes were enriched for terms that describe axon and tissue development, cell adhesion, and cell recognition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M,N</xref>). Adult specific-genes, on the other hand, were involved in processes like signaling, cell communication, and chemosensory behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M,N</xref>). These results indicate that as ORNs mature, there is a switch in expression from genes important for axon guidance and circuit formation to genes that mediate neuronal signaling and odorant detection. Altogether, our snRNA-seq protocol can robustly and reliably profile developing and adult neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Individual ORNs maintain expression of the same olfactory receptor(s) throughout development</title><p>ORNs use three distinct families of chemoreceptors to detect olfactory stimuli: Ors (odorant receptors), Irs (ionotropic receptors), and Grs (gustatory receptors) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Clyne et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Vosshall et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Scott et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Benton et al., 2009</xref>).

Focusing on the Or family, we found that by 42 hr APF roughly one-third of ORNs expressed Ors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). Of the 298 Or-expressing ORNs at 42 hr APF, 84% expressed only one receptor and 16% express two or three (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Some ORN types are known to express more than one Or (e.g. Or19a/b and Or65a/b/c; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dobritsa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Couto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Fishilevich and Vosshall, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Goldman et al., 2005</xref>). Prior to this study <italic>Or85c</italic> was only reported to be expressed in the larval olfactory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kreher et al., 2005</xref>), but we detect co-expression of <italic>Or85c</italic> with <italic>Or85b</italic> in 4% of Or-expressing ORNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This may be the result of shared regulatory mechanisms controlling the expression of <italic>Or85c</italic> and <italic>Or85b</italic> as these genes are located &lt;1 kb apart, a finding that has been reported for other olfactory receptors separated by a similar genomic distances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Ray et al., 2007</xref>). All other co-expressed Ors appeared to be randomly paired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Low-frequency co-expression could be accidental or the result of doublet sequencing, an infrequent event whereby the transcriptomes of two cells are inadvertently combined during sample processing or sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ilicic et al., 2016</xref>). We conclude that the majority of developing ORNs express only one Or gene.</p><p>Do ORNs maintain expression of the same Or from the pupal to adult stage? To address this question, we employed a permanent genetic labeling strategy. We used an <italic>Or-GAL4</italic> to drive <italic>UAS-FLP</italic> to excise the STOP cassette between the ubiquitous <italic>actin5C</italic> promoter and <italic>GAL4</italic> transcriptional activator, such that any cell that transiently expresses the <italic>Or-GAL4</italic> will be labeled. <italic>Or-GAL4</italic> driving expression of <italic>UAS-mCD8-GFP</italic> served as the ‘standard labeling’ control. We tested <italic>GAL4</italic> lines of three highly expressed Ors at 42 hr APF: <italic>Or42b, Or43b,</italic> and <italic>Or47b</italic> using both labeling methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In fewer than 13% of antennal lobes examined, we observed additional labeling outside of the normally innervated glomerulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B–D'</xref>). However, this additional labeling was partially contributed by GAL4 expression in non-ORN neurons innervating the antennal lobe, such as PNs or local interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E–G</xref>). Thus, in the vast majority of cases, permanently labeled ORN axons projected to the same glomerulus as the standard labeled controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–H</xref>), indicating that these Ors were not expressed in multiple ORN types during development. <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mouse ORNs, therefore, appear to use different strategies for selecting specific olfactory receptor expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>).</p><p>The finding that olfactory receptor expression is stably maintained across development in <italic>Drosophila</italic> enabled us to use cluster-specific receptor expression to match transcriptomic clusters of developing ORNs to their respective ORN types, which also corresponds to the glomerulus their axons innervate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Couto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Fishilevich and Vosshall, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Silbering et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Mapping 24 hr APF transcriptomic clusters to their glomerular types</title><p>We next investigated ORN transcriptomes at 24 hr APF.

For the three stages of ORNs that we profiled, we found that transcriptomes at 42 hr APF exhibited highest diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Thus, we used differentially expressed genes from 42 hr APF ORNs in combination with known ORN type-specific antennal sensory receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Grabe et al., 2016</xref>) as the gene set for dimensionality reduction; this enabled us to obtain clear separation of 24 hr APF transcriptomes when embedded in the UMAP space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">McInnes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

Further, we observed cluster-specific expression of all of the known co-expressed receptors for the following ORN types: V (<italic>Gr21a/Gr63a</italic>), DL3 (<italic>Or65a/b/c</italic>), DC1 (<italic>Or19a/b</italic>), and DM2 (<italic>Or22a/b</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B,C,J</xref>).</p><p>In some instances, we were unable to perform one-to-one annotations of adult clusters to sensory neuron types. This occurred for two reasons. First, sensory receptors from multiple neuron types were intermingled in a single cluster. For instance, both <italic>Or49b</italic> (VA5-projecting ORNs) and <italic>Or9a</italic> (VM3-projecting ORNs) were found in separate populations of cells within the same cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Thus, we annotated this cluster as containing both VM3 and VA5 ORNs. Second, a subset of Irs are expressed in multiple sensory neuron types that project to distinct glomeruli in the antennal lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Grabe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Marin et al., 2020</xref>). As an example, <italic>Ir21a</italic> is expressed in neurons projecting from the antenna and arista to the VP1l and VP3 glomeruli, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Marin et al., 2020</xref>). Because we could not further sub-divide these <italic>Ir21a</italic>-positive cells, we annotated this cluster as representing VP1l- and VP3-projecting neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2P</xref>). Accordingly, we annotated the following neuron types as being found in the same cluster: (1) DM3 (<italic>Or47a</italic>), VA6 (<italic>Or82a</italic>), and DC3 (<italic>Or83c</italic>); (2) VM1 (<italic>Ir92a</italic>) and VL1 (<italic>Ir75d</italic>); (3) DP1l (<italic>Ir75a</italic>), DL2d/v (<italic>Ir75a/b/c</italic>), and VC3l (<italic>Or35a</italic>); (4) DP1m (<italic>Ir64a</italic>) and DC4 (<italic>Ir64a</italic>); and (5) VP4 (<italic>Ir40a</italic>), VP1d (<italic>Ir40a</italic>), and VP2 (<italic>Gr28b</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). In most cases, when we observed multiple ORN types (expressing distinct receptors) in the same cluster, the intermingled ORNs originated from either the same sensillar class (e.g. DL2d/v, DP1l, and VC3l) or the same sensillum (e.g. VM1 and VL1), indicating that the transcriptomes of these cells are very similar at the adult stage. This likely contributed to why we have 26 adult clusters instead of ~50 (see Discussion). Collectively, we used cluster-specific receptor expression to map 31 neuron types to 20 adult transcriptomic clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G–H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Matching transcriptomic clusters across all stages enabled annotation of additional ORN types</title><p>In addition to the annotated ORN types from our prior 42 hr APF study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Li et al., 2020</xref>), we mapped 17 and 31 ORN types to their corresponding 24 hr APF and adult transcriptomic clusters, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5G</xref>).

Since we already employed a manual matching strategy (using marker genes/sensory receptor expression), we asked if an automatic matching approach that uses transcriptomic similarity to link clusters across development could annotate more clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Thus, we identified differentially expressed genes in each cluster at all stages profiled. We then independently compared the transcriptomes of each cluster at one stage to every cluster at the other time points. A similarity score (Jaccard index) was then computed for the proportion of genes shared between each pair of clusters across two stages. If two clusters both had the highest similarity score with each other, we considered these clusters to be two-way matched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). One-way matches occurred when one cluster had the highest similarity with a cluster at a different stage, but the opposite did not hold true (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, see Materials and methods). Due to the difference in sequencing technologies between pupal and adult ORNs, we did not allow one-way matches between these stages.</p><p>We first used this approach to validate our manual matches and found that the results of these two strategies were in complete agreement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Our automatic two-way matching approach linked six more clusters between 24 and 42 hr APF. Two of these clusters corresponded to DM4 and VM3 ORNs and four were unannotated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A,C</xref>). The pupal DL5 clusters were annotated by matching them to the previously annotated adult DL5 cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Lastly, we used one-way automatic matching to annotate DC3 and DM2 ORNs at 24 hr APF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Automatic matching was able to decode an additional five transcriptomic clusters at 24 hr APF and three additional clusters at 42 hr APF.

We identified differentially expressed genes between all annotated ORN types (that mapped to a single cluster) and performed hierarchical clustering of their transcriptomes based on expression of these genes. Overall, ORNs that belong to the same sensillar class share more similar transcriptomes than those from other classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), similar to our previous observations at 42 hr APF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Li et al., 2020</xref>). In some cases (e.g. VA1v and VA1d), the transcriptomes of ORNs within the same sensillum were most similar to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Yet, neither V nor DL4 neurons clustered with their sensillar classes. We considered other factors that could contribute to the clustering of these two ORN types. At 24 hr APF, most ORN axons are taking either a dorsolateral or ventromedial trajectory around the antennal lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Endo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Joo et al., 2013</xref>). Could axon trajectory explain the clustering of DL4 and V transcriptomes? Indeed, DL4 ORNs were more similar to the antennal trichoids that take a dorsolateral trajectory than to the ventromedially-projecting basiconics annotated here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Both V neurons and the coeloconics they clustered with project their axons to more posterior glomeruli than the majority of ORNs in trichoid and basiconic classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Couto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Rybak et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Transcriptomes of posteriorly projecting ORNs further segregated based on axon trajectory, as ORNs whose axons take the ventromedial path were more similar to each other than to those taking the dorsolateral trajectory. Further, V and VL1 ORNs have the most divergent transcriptomes of the posteriorly projecting ORNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), which could reflect the fact that these neurons send their axons ipsilaterally to one antennal lobe and not bilaterally to both lobes, like all the other ORNs in the dendrogram (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Couto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Silbering et al., 2011</xref>). We also note that cell-surface molecules and transcription factors, which are important regulators of axon targeting, constituted 14% and 25% (as opposed to less than 6% each in the genome; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>) of the differentially expressed genes used to cluster ORN transcriptomes, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>).

A closer examination revealed that adult transcriptomes also reflected the type of stimuli they detect. DC1 ORNs from the trichoid at3 sensillum, for instance, sense limonene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Dweck et al., 2013</xref>) and their transcriptomes were more similar to fruit odor-responsive basiconic ORNs than to the pheromone-detecting trichoid ORNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,C</xref>). In fact, DC1 transcriptomes were most similar to D ORNs which can also respond to limonene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Dweck et al., 2013</xref>). Within the Ir-expressing clade, neurons also appeared to group by the stimuli they respond to. For example, acid-sensing neurons in the coeloconic sensilla were more closely related to sacculus neurons detecting the same type of stimulus than to amine-sensing coeloconics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,C</xref>).

We matched 16 annotated ORN types across all three developmental stages. The fact that we observed fewer clusters than the ~50 glomerular types could be because: (1) not enough cells were profiled for some types; (2) closely related types formed a single cluster (e.g. VM5d and VM5v ORNs at 24 hr APF or VA5 and VM3 ORNs in adults; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5G</xref>); or (3) some Ir-positive neuronal types expressed the same receptor and could not be further subdivided transcriptomically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2M,P</xref>). Our analysis of sensory receptor and marker expression within clusters points to the latter two explanations accounting for the majority of the reduction in the number of clusters compared to the number of neuron types. We were also unable to annotate the antennal thermo- and hygrosensory neurons in our pupal data, possibly because these cells both exist in low numbers in the antenna (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Marin et al., 2020</xref>) and did not express cluster-specific receptors in pupal transcriptomes.

Collectively, we demonstrated that snRNA-seq is well-suited for profiling previously inaccessible neurons in the adult fly and this protocol can be easily used by other researchers that want to gain transcriptomic access to their tissue of interest (see a detailed protocol in Materials and methods section).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>ORN transcriptomic similarity reflects multiple biological factors</title><p>Understanding the molecular underpinnings of neural circuit formation, maintenance, and function requires that we can access the transcriptomes of anatomically and functionally distinct neuron types at developmentally-relevant stages. Here, we created a dataset that will enable these types of analyses by profiling <italic>Drosophila</italic> ORNs at stages corresponding to: (1) initial axon pathfinding (24 hr APF); (2) synaptic partner matching (42 hr APF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Li et al., 2020</xref>); and (3) sensory function (adult).</p><p>Cluster-level comparisons within each newly profiled stage lead to the discovery that type-specific transcriptomes reflect multiple biological factors. During development, similarities in 24 hr APF ORN transcriptomes reflect both their sensillar class and axon trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). The abundant differentially expressed transcription factors and cell-surface molecules that we defined in distinct ORN types at both 24 hr and 42 hr APF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s6">6</xref>) are excellent candidates to test as regulators of cell-type-specific axon guidance and target selection.</p><p>In adults, we annotated olfactory, thermosensory, and hygrosensory neurons originating from all of the sensory structures of the antenna. Similarities in adult transcriptomes not only reflect their sensillar classes, but also sensory stimuli they detect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Our data suggests that neurons that detect similar cues may require analogous genes for their function. Interestingly, some of the food odor-detecting basiconic ORNs expressed the sugar receptor <italic>Gr64f</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Jiao et al., 2008</xref>), implying that this receptor may have noncanonical functions in these ORN types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). Furthermore, the differentially expressed neuronal transmission and signaling genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) could provide important insight into the functional properties of distinct ORN types. Together, our developmental and adult analyses underscore that profiling cells at multiple stages can deepen our understanding of their biology.</p><p>The main strength of single-cell transcriptomics is the ability to reveal cell-type specific gene expression patterns. By profiling <italic>Drosophila</italic> ORNs at multiple stages, we have generated a rich dataset that can be used as a foundation to reveal cell-type-specific regulators of neuron differentiation, axon targeting, synapse formation, and sensory function. In conclusion, this work, together our accompanying paper profiling PNs at multiple stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Xie et al., 2021</xref>), should spur novel and important biological discoveries in the fields of sensory system development and function.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

The fewer than 100 cells per time point that did not associate with a cluster (from MARS analysis) were not depicted on the tSNE or UMAP plots to make these plots easier to decipher.

We combined these genes with known antennal sensory receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Grabe et al., 2016</xref>), resulting in a total of 335 genes. We used this set of genes to confirm ORN types at 42 hr APF, and to identify ORN types at 24 hr APF and adult. To cluster each dataset, we applied MARS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brbić et al., 2020</xref>)—a meta-learning approach for cell type discovery. MARS leverages annotations of previously annotated datasets to better separate cell types in an unannotated dataset. We first applied MARS to re-annotate 42 hr APF ORN types. The annotations agreed well with our previously identified types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Li et al., 2020</xref>), and we used them to annotate 24 hr APF. We ran MARS seven times with different random initializations (compared to nine times on 42 hr APF transcriptomes) and neural network architectures to increase our confidence in the discovered clusters, and combined annotations from the different runs. A cluster was approved by calculating differentially expressed genes in that cluster and checking whether genes agree with known markers and/or are expressed uniquely in that cluster compared to other cells not assigned to the cluster. After annotating the 24 hr APF data, we used these annotations in combination with 42 APF annotations to guide the clustering of adult neurons. For adult annotations, we proceeded in the same way as when annotating 24 hr APF and ran MARS ten times followed by validating each cluster using marker genes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Transcriptome similarity analysis</title><p>To compare the transcriptome similarity between 24 hr APF, 42 hr APF, and adult clusters, we computed a set of unbiased 416 differentially expressed genes across all three developmental stages.

We then calculated Pearson correlation coefficient of selected genes between all pairs of MARS clusters at each stage. For the transcriptome similarity analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, we used all clusters discovered by MARS.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Gene ontology and STRING analysis</title><p>Gene Ontology (GO) analysis was used to characterize transcriptome changes in multiple cases. We generated gene lists for GO analysis by comparing the two groups using differential expression analysis (Mann-Whitney U test). We identified roughly equal numbers of differentially expressed genes that reached a significance level of p-value ≤ 10<sup>–5</sup> (after Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing) for each comparison group and uploaded these gene lists into Flymine for GO analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Lyne et al., 2007</xref>). Redundant GO terms were removed using REVIGO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Supek et al., 2011</xref>). We report the p-value of enrichment for each term.

Nodes that did not connect to the network were not displayed, and edges (links between genes) were generated by their reported interactions and corresponding confidence scores and plotted in Cytoscape (v3.7.1). Clusters were created and labeled using the GO terms that they were associated with and colored based on their on their fold change which was calculated by log<sub>2</sub>[(mean<sub>adult</sub> +0.1) / (mean<sub>24h APF</sub> + 0.1)].

Pair-wise comparisons between all annotated clusters at each stage were performed to generate a list of differentially expressed genes. This resulted in 437 differentially expressed genes at 24 hr APF and 936 differentially expressed genes in adult clusters. Average gene expression was then computed for each cluster and differentially expressed genes were used for dimensionality reduction at their respective stages, followed by hierarchical clustering using the cluster map function of seaborn based on the Euclidean distance between each cluster.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Manual (marker-based) matching and annotating of ORN types</title><p>ORN clusters were manually matched using a combination of differentially expressed marker genes and sensory receptor (Ir, Gr, Or) expression. Marker genes were identified using our previously published cluster-specific genes at 42 hr APF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Li et al., 2020</xref>) or via a Mann-Whitney U test to find genes that are highly expressed in one (or a few) clusters compared to the rest. We searched for either a single gene or a set of genes whose expression was unique to a single cluster at both 24 hr APF and 42 hr APF. If these marker genes were expressed in one cluster at both time points, we considered these clusters to be the same ORN type. We used olfactory receptor expression to match some clusters from 24 to 42 hr APF. Sensory receptors were exclusively used to annotate adult clusters and to match them to their corresponding 42 hr cluster. Genes used to annotate, and match clusters are summarized in dot plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Automatic matching of ORN types</title><p>To automatically identify the same ORN types across different developmental stages, we first calculated differentially expressed genes in MARS clusters at each stage. We started by matching clusters between 24 and 42 hr APF, then we matched clusters between 42 hr and adult APF, and finally used matching between adult and 24 hr APF to confirm matches. To match clusters between two stages, we computed the similarity score of differentially expressed genes between all pairs of clusters using Jaccard similarity index, defined as the ratio of the number of elements in the intersection of two gene sets and the number of elements in the union of the gene sets. Two-way matches occurred when cluster X in one stage had the highest similarity to cluster Y in another stage, and the opposite also held true where cluster Y had the highest similarity to cluster X. One-way matches occurred when cluster X at one stage has the highest similarity to cluster Y at another stage, but cluster Y is most similar to another cluster. Since each cluster has a one-way match by design of the approach, we relied on one-way matching exclusively for those clusters whose transcriptomes are intermingled (inseparable) between 24 and 42 hr APF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Differential gene expression analysis</title><p>We identified differentially expressed genes in developing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) and adult clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) by performing a Mann-Whitney U test on each cluster (at each stage) compared to the rest of the clusters within that stage. p-Values were adjusted using via Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. Genes with an adjusted p-value&lt;0.01 were used in follow-up analyses. We used curated lists to identify specific gene categories within differentially expressed gene lists.

comprehensive transcriptional dataset from single OSNs while they develop and defines many of the genes that contribute to sensory, axon projection and connectivity properties. We believe that this will be a great resource for the community.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Single-cell transcriptomes of developing and adult olfactory receptor neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Hugo Bellen as the Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Scott Barish (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The three reviewers feel that novelty is lacking but they all three are in agreement that this will be a useful resource. If you can address most of the issues raised, we will send the paper back to the reviewers for a new assessment. We suggest that you resubmit this as a resource paper unless you have good reasons to object.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>(Also: It is important to cite and compare results to whole antennae transcriptomes published by others (Mohapatra and Menuz, 2019; Li et al., 2016; Barish et al., 2017; Menuz et al., 2014).

In this paper, the authors have expanded on the previous paper's findings, by providing transcriptional profiles from single ORNs from mid-pupal and adult stages as additional developmental time points. They were able to identify majority of the ORN classes based on gene clusters. In addition, building on their previous data on the ORN clusters from pupal stages, they were able to provide developmental trajectories for majority of the ORN classes based on transcriptional profiles and how they change over developmental time. The study identified that each ORN only expresses a single OR during its development. This is in contrast to mammalian ORNs, which initially express multiple OR genes which later consolidate into a single OR genes per ORN class. They also were able to identify class-specific transcriptional signatures for adult ORN classes as well as developmental trajectories of transcriptional profiles within ORN lineages. In general, this paper, together with the group's previous papers on scRNA profiling from developing ORN and PNs as well as adult PNs, provides a comprehensive transcriptional dataset from developing ORNs that highlight the genes that contribute to sensory, functional and morphological properties of different ORN classes. I think the paper is suitable for possible publication in e<italic>Life</italic> if the points below are addressed.</p><p>1) There is a preprint from the Benton lab, which is currently under review, on transcriptional profiling of ORN classes using the DamID-RNA polymerase II occupancy in 7 ORN classes. Did the authors look at this? There seems to be some inconsistencies regarding single OR gene expression, source of odorant binding protein expression (support cell versus ORNs)</p><p>2) The authors were able to identify ORN class specific expression from approximately 80% of the 50 ORN classes. They reason that this might be due to either not enough cells sampled from the remaining ORN classes, co-expression of IR genes in coeloconic ORNs that might interfere with class-specific clustering of these ORNs, or inability to segregate clusters for closely related ORNs. Since this is a follow up study that mainly incorporates adult ORN data, it would be better if it was providing a complete transcriptional profile of all adult ORNs. I am wondering if increasing the total number of cells sequenced would help resolve the problem by providing statistical power. I am not sure how long it would take to do this though.</p><p>3) Since the same group also have access to data from PN populations, are there any genes (cell surface receptors, transcription factors, neurotransmitter versus neurotransmitter receptors) expressed in ORN-PN pairs targeting the same glomerulus? For example, are complementary heterophilic or homophilic cell surface receptors are expressed in the ORN-PN pairs, or neurotransmitters expressed in ORN class and the complementary expression of its receptor in PNs? I think such a cross comparison can yield many important insights into the circuit assembly programs.</p><p>4) A small number of OR genes shows co-expression with other OR genes are expressed in more than one class of ORNs. Is there anything in common among the OR genes that are co-expressed. It is clear that some are recent duplication events where the genes are repeated in a single genomic locus (Or65a/b/c or Or22a/b).But others are not so close on the genome. Is there anything in common among these ORs? For example, is there any amino acid sequence similarity suggestive of more distant duplication and translocation of the gene to another region in the genome that retained some of the same regulatory elements? Or co-expression seen in ORNs found in the same sensilla type, which might indicate regulatory similarities?</p><p>5) The authors make the conclusion that a given OR is expressed in the same ORN from birth until adulthood, in contrast to mammalian ORNs which initially express multiple OR genes but then consolidate to express a single one. They use both their RNAseq data and a permanent genetic labeling to show this. In the text they mention that generally most of the ORN that express a single OR gene innervate a single glomerulus even when they perform the permanent genetic labeling. However, in Figures 3E and the supplement, they show images where permanent labeling leads to innervation of some weak secondary glomeruli by a single OR-GAL4. I could not find an explanation for this in the main text. Can the authors elaborate on these? Is this a GAL4 artifact? Or a real indication that these OR genes initially are also expressed in other ORNs but are later consolidated to a single ORN class?</p><p>6) It would be good to get an expanded clustered heat maps and lists for all ORN classes and the expression of specific gene groups, like cell surface receptors, transcription factors, etc.</p><p>7) Some of the wording on the figures, especially in heatmaps etc. are extremely small. Please make them bigger in addition to providing a separate table with expression levels.</p><p>8) For Figure 1B, can you provide the names of the ORs co-expressed that are shown on the heatmap?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this work, the authors provide a thorough analysis of single cell sequencing from developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> ORN tissue.

In addressing their feedback, we have substantially improved the quality, utility, and scholarship of our manuscript. The number of total figures and supplements has expanded from 20 to 30. We have also substantially streamlined our manuscript to improve the clarity and accessibility to a general audience. We will also take the editors’ and reviewers’ suggestion to resubmit this manuscript as a resource. Below, we first summarize major changes to the manuscript, and then provide a point-by-point response to specific comments from the editors and reviewers.</p><p>Major Additions:</p><p>1) We have added a large amount of new analyses on differential expression of genes in different neuron types across development, with an emphasis on transcription factors and cell-surface molecules during development. These analyses are presented in the new Figure 8 and Figure 8—figure supplements 1–6. We have also expanded on analyses of differentially expressed genes involved in neuronal communication and signaling in adult neurons, summarized in an expanded Figure 10 and Figure 10—figure supplement 1. We described many differentially expressed transcription factors and cell surface proteins in our developing ORNs. These additions have substantially improved the new biological insights that can be obtained from our dataset. For instance, one can now easily identify transcription factors and cell surface molecules that display cell-type specific expression, as well as expression within a specific sensillar class during development. These genes are not only excellent candidate regulators of ORN development and wiring but can also be used to generate driver lines for genetic access to individual ORN types. Our analyses of adult transcriptomes have also revealed type specific expression of neuronal signaling genes and neuromodulators, which could also serve as good candidates for functional investigations.</p><p>2) We have substantially expanded our analysis of co-expression of olfactory coreceptors in Figure 9 and Figure 9—figure supplements 1–2. We quantified the extent of such co-expression from our unique, adult single-cell transcriptome data. Together with two new studies deposited in bioRxiv during the initial review of this manuscript (Task et al., <italic>bioRxiv</italic> https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.07.355651; Younger et al., <italic>bioRxiv</italic> https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.07.368720), these studies reveal that olfactory receptor co-expression in insects (including flies and mosquitos) is much more substantial than previously thought. We have also systematically examined co-expression of specific olfactory receptors, validating previously documented co-expression of receptors (originating closely linked genomic loci). Additionally, we documented cell-type-specific co-expression of three gustatory receptors in specific ORN types, including two sugar receptors Gr64a and Gr64f. These analyses are summarized in the new Figure 9—figure supplement 2.</p><p>3) We have expanded our citations (our reference list expanded from 113 to 126). In particular, we have extensively cited previous bulk RNA-seq studies in multiple relevant places throughout the paper (including lines: 64; 65; 204; 335; 339; 340; 488; 498; 595). We also compared our single-cell transcriptome data with bulk RNA-seq in a number of figures (Figure 2—figure supplement 1O; Figure 5C; Figure 5—figure supplement 1 A; Figure 8; Figure 9; Figure 10).</p><p>4) To make room for addition of new data analyses without excessively lengthening the manuscript, we have removed less essential figure panels and associated text from the original submission. Specifically, previous Figure 1D and E have been moved to supplement; images of antennal lobes with additional permanent labeling have also been moved to supplement and streamlined for clarity; Figure 4B has been moved to supplement; Figure 5D has been removed; Figure 7C–G (and Figure 7—supplement 1A) have been removed; most of the panels in the former Figure 8 (now Figure 9) have been re-worked; and all of the panels in the former Figure 9 (now Figure 10) were replaced.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This paper from McLaaughlin et al., builds upon the previous paper from the Luo lab in Current Biology (2020) on single cell RNA profiling from developing Olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) populations in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory system.

I think the paper is suitable for possible publication in eLife if the points below are addressed.</p><p>1) There is a preprint from the Benton lab, which is currently under review, on transcriptional profiling of ORN classes using the DamID-RNA polymerase II occupancy in 7 ORN classes. Did the authors look at this? There seems to be some inconsistencies regarding single OR gene expression, source of odorant binding protein expression (support cell versus ORNs)</p></disp-quote><p>The Benton lab applied the Targeted DamID (TaDa) method to Ir-expressing ORNs to study molecular mechanisms that control ORN development. The authors showed the feasibility of this TaDa profiling method for rare Ir-expressing ORNs, and identified one transcription factor, Pdm3 (previously was shown to control ORN axon guidance and Or expression by the Carlson’s group, Tichy et al., J Neurosci 28:7121, 2008) and one cell surface protein, fmi, in controlling the ORN cell fate and wiring. Since they are taking a bulk approach, their strength is to detect low-expressed Ir genes or very rare cells. They profiled 7 Ir-expressing ORN types (Ir64a, Ir40a, Ir75a, Ir75b, Ir75c, Ir84a, and Ir31a). Our single-cell approach can profile many more ORN types at one time but cannot recover some rare populations, e.g. Ir84a and Ir31a. We did cover other 5 other Ir-expressing ORNs and did see consistent results. For example, they used Ir64a-GAL4 to label ORNs targeting to DC4 and DP1m glomeruli, and we have mapped Ir64a-positive cells to these two ORN types.</p><p>The DamID paper only focused on adult Ir-expressing neurons, and we have profiled both development and adult ORNs. These two studies will complement each other to provide useful resource for studying both ORN development and physiology. Since these two methods are very different and have focused on largely non-overlapping cells, it is currently difficult to perform detailed comparison of these two datasets. See reviewer 3 point 7 below for odorant binding protein expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors were able to identify ORN class specific expression from approximately 80% of the 50 ORN classes. They reason that this might be due to either not enough cells sampled from the remaining ORN classes, co-expression of IR genes in coeloconic ORNs that might interfere with class-specific clustering of these ORNs, or inability to segregate clusters for closely related ORNs. Since this is a follow up study that mainly incorporates adult ORN data, it would be better if it was providing a complete transcriptional profile of all adult ORNs. I am wondering if increasing the total number of cells sequenced would help resolve the problem by providing statistical power. I am not sure how long it would take to do this though.</p></disp-quote><p>We would first like to clarify that we were able to annotate ~80% of the adult transcriptomic clusters as belonging to 31 receptor neuron types. The reviewer correctly listed several contributing reasons why we were not able to annotate transcriptomes for all ORN types. Other reasons include the large dynamic range of expression levels for type-specific genes, such as <italic>Ors</italic> and <italic>Irs</italic>. For example, Menuz et al. (PLoS Genetics, 10:e1004810, 2014) reported that the levels of canonical <italic>Ors</italic> varied over a 170-fold range from their bulk RNAseq data. There is also a large variation in the number of receptor neurons belonging to each distinct neuron type. For instance, the number of ORNs innervating each glomerulus can vary over a 6-fold range (Grabe et al., Cell Reports 16:3401-3413, 2016). So, neurons that exist in low numbers and have relatively low receptor expression, such as DA3 ORNs (Grabe et al., 2016; Menuz et al., 2014), are challenging to annotate. We expect that our 1,891 single-cell transcriptomes in the adult stage contains the majority of ORN types, but because of the above reasons, we could not detect type-specific markers, or have insufficient number of cells for some of the rare types, to decode more transcriptomes.</p><p>While further increasing the sample size will surely generate more data, there is a diminished return in decoding new types because we will preferentially get more abundant cell types and we will still have difficulty in detecting type-specific genes that have low expression levels. The better approach would be to use GAL4 lines that are specific to rare populations for FAC sorting, so that sequencing can be focused on those rare types. Indeed, we are aware of groups who are doing just that.</p><p>We note that 1,891 single-cell transcriptomes from FACS-SMARTseq2-based approach (sequenced to a depth of 1 million reads per cell) is considered fairly large scale. (For example, the SMARTseq2-based sequencing we published on mouse serotonin neurons in 2019 was based on 999 cells; see Ren et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 8:e49424; another recent study was based on 1,211 cells sequenced by Smart-seq2 for classifying spiny projection neurons in the mouse striatum: Stanley et al., Neuron 105:688, 2000.) We probably need to sequence several fold more cells in order to decode a substantial number of additional ORN types. We also note that while it is true that this is a “follow up” study for ORN singlecell RNAseq to our 42h dataset (by including both 24h and adult), this is the first time type-specific adult sensory neuron transcriptomes has been reported. The adult transcriptomes are much harder to obtain and we had to develop new (single-nucleus RNA-seq) methods to obtain high-quality transcriptomes. (We have sent protocols described here to many laboratories, including those who work on other insects such as mosquitos and have included a detailed protocol for dissociating nuclei in the Materials and methods section of this manuscript.) And decoding single-cell transcriptomes from 80% of adult clusters should be a substantial advance. Beyond ORNs, we were also able to obtain transcriptomes of thermo- and hygro-receptor neurons. Finally, we would like mention that the preprint of this manuscript in <italic>bioRxiv</italic> generated considerable excitement in researchers studying adult sensory neurons, and we have already shared our adult dataset with some of these labs.</p><p>We hope that sequencing more cells will not be a requirement for this paper to be published in <italic>eLife</italic>. Rather, we have focused our revision on analyzing the existing data and comparison with previous literature, following many useful suggestions of the reviewers. Thank you for your understanding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Since the same group also have access to data from PN populations, are there any genes (cell surface receptors, transcription factors, neurotransmitter versus neurotransmitter receptors) expressed in ORN-PN pairs targeting the same glomerulus? For example, are complementary heterophilic or homophilic cell surface receptors are expressed in the ORN-PN pairs, or neurotransmitters expressed in ORN class and the complementary expression of its receptor in PNs? I think such a cross comparison can yield many important insights into the circuit assembly programs.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. Indeed, comparing ORN and PN transcriptomes during development to identify wiring specificity genes is a major incentive for us to carry out these studies. In our revised manuscript, we have listed differentially expressed transcription factors and cell-surface molecules in ORNs, as summarized in Major Addition 1 above. As requested, in the new Figure 8—figure supplement 5 and 6, we listed cell-surface molecules that are differentially expressed by 6 matching pairs of ORNs and PNs at the stage of synaptic partner matching. As can be seen from these figures, there is a large number of differentially expressed cell-surface molecules. We only have limited knowledge about the ligand-receptor pairs among these proteins; in most cases, we don’t know these interactions are attractive or repulsive. It will take substantial amount of additional work to test the functional significance of these expression data. Nevertheless, these expression data have provided a critical first step to tackle this important problem in developmental neurobiology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) A small number of OR genes shows co-expression with other OR genes are expressed in more than one class of ORNs. Is there anything in common among the OR genes that are co-expressed. It is clear that some are recent duplication events where the genes are repeated in a single genomic locus (Or65a/b/c or Or22a/b).But others are not so close on the genome. Is there anything in common among these ORs? For example, is there any amino acid sequence similarity suggestive of more distant duplication and translocation of the gene to another region in the genome that retained some of the same regulatory elements? Or co-expression seen in ORNs found in the same sensilla type, which might indicate regulatory similarities?</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to clarify a few different cases regarding co-expression. (a) It has been well documented in the literature that certain <italic>Or</italic> genes, such as <italic>Or22a</italic> and <italic>Or22b</italic>, are co-expressed, likely because of common regulatory elements. (b) Our transcriptome data have supported previous documented co-expression of <italic>Ors</italic>. (c) While our paper is in review, two preprints came out showing substantially more widespread co-expression of sensory receptors in the olfactory system of flies and mosquitos based on co-receptors (Orco, Ir25a, etc.). We did not draw a lot of attention to this co-expression in the original manuscript, and in light of the reviewer’s comments and the preprints, we have expanded this analysis, including citing previous studies in (a) and our support for those; document systematically new co-expression from our own data (b), and refer to the two new studies. Please see Major Addition 2 above for more details.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors make the conclusion that a given OR is expressed in the same ORN from birth until adulthood, in contrast to mammalian ORNs which initially express multiple OR genes but then consolidate to express a single one. They use both their RNAseq data and a permanent genetic labeling to show this. In the text they mention that generally most of the ORN that express a single OR gene innervate a single glomerulus even when they perform the permanent genetic labeling.

Or a real indication that these OR genes initially are also expressed in other ORNs but are later consolidated to a single ORN class?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point and we should have clarified this better in the text. There are ~10% examined antennal lobes showing weak additional expression using permanent labeling, meaning that in ~90% cases each <italic>Or</italic> is only expressed in one ORN type from early development. (By contrast, in the mouse olfactory system, almost all immature ORNs expresses multiple olfactory receptor genes.) Even in the antennal lobes with additional labeling, the labeling can originate from a combination of ORNs, olfactory projection neurons (PNs), and local interneurons. We also notice that these additional labeling are mostly asymmetric, further suggesting they are not from ORNs because most ORNs targeting their axons to both antenna lobes in the brain while PNs are mostly targeting to one side. Thus, our data suggest in vast majority of cases, individual <italic>Or</italic> genes only express in a single ORN types. We have clarified this in the text and have provided additional supplemental images depicting this (Figure 3—figure supplement 1 E–G).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) It would be good to get an expanded clustered heat maps and lists for all ORN classes and the expression of specific gene groups, like cell surface receptors, transcription factors, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this great suggestion.

Please Major Addition 3 above for details. Single-cell RNA-seq studies provide additional value over bulk RNA-seq of the entire third antennal segment: we are identifying genes that are expressed in receptor neurons, and more importantly, those that are differentially expressed in distinct types of receptor neurons. We regret that such significance did not come out in our original manuscript. We hope that the reviewer will agree that by including more extensive analyses of differentially expressed genes described in Major Point 1 described above, and comparisons with the bulk RNAseq data in Major Point 3 described above, we have made these advances more apparent.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There are very few new conclusions to be drawn from this paper that haven't been identified in other studies.

We respectively disagree with the notion that “It was already well known that ORNs only express one receptor in their lifetime unlike mice.” Perhaps it is a widely held belief, but we are not aware of previous experiments that rigorously demonstrate this. Indeed, in the mouse, a previously widely held belief had been that each ORN expresses a single odorant receptor throughout development also, until single-cell RNA-seq study demonstrated that transient expression of multiple Or genes occurs during development (Hanchate et al., 2015; Tan et al., 2015).

In our adult data, there are a few instances where we observe 2–3 ORN types comprising one transcriptomic cluster. Some of these examples are cases where these ORN types are from the same sensillum, indicating that their transcriptomes are very similar to each other’s. For example, VL1 and VM1 ORNs derived from the ac1 sensillum are found in the same cluster and so are DM3- and VA6-projecting ORNs (ab5 sensillum). The fact that we cannot separate these ORN types at the cluster level indicates that their transcriptomes are very similar at this stage. We have clarified this in the text.</p><p>In Figure 7 (panels B and C), we have specifically looked at transcriptome similarity of all annotated ORNs at each stage. We initially had multiple other panels in this figure, but we removed some as to not overwhelm the reader and to more clearly state our findings. Specifically, we found that while some ORNs found in the same sensillum, like VA1v- and VA1d-projecting ORNs at 24h APF, have the most similar transcriptomes to each other, this is not the case for all ORNs at both stages. For instance, at both 24h APF and the adult stage, V ORNs are not most similar to other ORNs (VA2/DM1) within the ab1 sensillum. Similarly, at 24h APF, ORNs from the ac4 sensillum (VM4 and VL2a) do not share more similar transcriptomes with each other but rather are more similar to ORNs taking the same axonal trajectory. We have clarified this in the text as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It would be helpful to compare the results of snRNAseq with results from previous RNAseq of the entire antenna. This comparison might reveal if there is any bias imposed by the snRNAseq methods used here. Are fewer Ors identified in the present study? If so, are there any commonalities among those that are missing from the snRNA seq? Are there striking differences in the relative abundances between the two methods? Was Or85c observed in whole antennal RNAseq?</p></disp-quote><p>Great point. See Major Addition 3 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 1M: Why does the gene ontology analysis identify &quot;chemotaxis&quot; as a top term at 24h but not at the adult stage?</p></disp-quote><p>We assume that the reviewer meant Figure 2M. In Gene Ontology term, “chemotaxis” refers to “The directed movement of a motile cell or organism, or the directed growth of a cell guided by a specific chemical concentration gradient. Movement may be towards a higher concentration (positive chemotaxis) or towards a lower concentration (negative chemotaxis).” In principle, it should include cell migration, axon guidance, as well as organismal chemotaxis. Perhaps in multicellular organisms, this term is dominated by cellular rather than organismal chemotaxis. Additionally, organismal chemotaxis in response to a chemical cue would likely fall into the GO category “chemosensory behavior”, which is displayed in the adult GO terms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors should clarify here the limitations of the analysis. &quot;Cluster-specific Or and Gr expression allowed us to match 13 transcriptomic clusters with their glomerular types.&quot; There should be a clearer explanation here for why the number is not higher. Likewise, the authors should explain more explicitly why transcriptomes of some ORNs are indistinguishable at the adult stage – they should express different receptors. It would be helpful to provide a list of clusters containing multiple neurons, indicating for each cluster which neurons map to it.</p></disp-quote><p>Our first paragraph of Discussion gave three explanations for this phenomenon. We have referred to Discussion so readers know that explanation is forthcoming.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The studies of the requirements for G proteins (for example Kain et al.) need to be stated more accurately.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for drawing our attention to this. We have completely removed this section from the paper and replaced it with a section evaluating co-receptor expression in our data (new Figure 9). Instead of comparing Or and Ir transcriptomes as we had previously done, we compared all of the annotated adult transcriptomes and identified type-specific neuronal signaling genes in Figure 10.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 3C. The chord plot shows co-expression of Or85c and Or85b, which are located near each other in the genome. Is there a tendency for other genes that are near each other to be co-expressed?</p></disp-quote><p>See reviewer 1 point 4 and Major Addition 3 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The detection of mitochondrial transcripts in ORN nuclei is said to result from dissociation artifacts. Obps are found here to be broadly detected in ORN nuclei. Obps are expressed at extremely high levels in accessory cells. Could their detection in ORN nuclei be artifactual as well?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this excellent point! To address the reviewer’s point, we have compared expression of <italic>Obps</italic> in ORNs to the published <italic>Obp</italic> expression in whole antennal bulk RNA-seq (Menuz et al., 2014), and noticed that many of the highest expressed <italic>Obps</italic> in the whole antenna sequencing were also the highest expressed in our dataset. The plot below shows Obp expression in our dataset [color scale: log<sub>2</sub>(1 + transcript counts per million)] rank ordered by the expression levels reported by Menuz et al. (2014) from high to low (y-axis). It is apparent that the higher the bulk RNA-seq levels, the more expression we detected in our dataset. Thus, we think that because <italic>Obps</italic> are so highly expressed in accessory cells (at least one order of magnitude higher than the abundant <italic>Orco</italic> gene in bulk RNA-seq data), it is likely that the <italic>Obp</italic> detection in our nuclei is the result of artifacts caused by ambient RNA associated with nuclei during the dissociation process. We have included a new panel (Figure 2—figure supplement 1O) and discussed this caveat in the legend and in the text associated with Figure 2. We also re-did the GO and STRING analysis for Figure 2 after removing Obp expression from the adult transcriptomes. We are grateful to reviewer 3 for pointing this out.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Please state more explicitly how many single nuclei, and how many single cells, are discarded from the analysis, and the reasons for discarding them.</p></disp-quote><p>We have described the parameters for including a cell/nucleus in our analysis in the text associated with Figure 1 and the Materials and methods section. The parameters are also highlighted in Figure 1—figure supplement 1. We have now also added the total number of cells sequenced to the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) There is some concern about the use of intronic reads. In Figure 5C, for example, Ir41a is reported to be expressed in many neurons. Ir41a is a very long gene. Could its apparent expression represent noise resulting from using intronic reads?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for drawing our attention to this. Since nuclei only contain a fraction of the total transcripts (many are pre-mRNA with introns) in cells, the inclusion of intronic reads to increase gene detection is standard for single-nucleus RNA sequencing and aids in high-resolution cell type identification from snRNA-seq data in a large number of studies published in the past few years (Bakken et al., 2018, https://doi.org/10.1371/journal. pone.0209648; Thrupp et al., 2020, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108189; Cui et al., 2020, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2020.02.019; Kebschull et al., 2020, https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abd5059; Slyper et al., 2020, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-020-0844-1). And we have adopted this standard in our own analysis and showed the advantages of including introns in our side-by-side comparisons detailed in Figure 2.</p><p>In general, longer genes have a higher chance of creating the appearance of “noise” in the data, whether it is long introns or long exons. The appearance of “noise” in singlecell/single-nucleus RNA sequencing data can occur for several reasons. First, other annotated genes fall within the intronic/exonic region(s) of the gene of interest. The settings on our current sequencing reads alignment/counting method should not count reads that contain portions of multiple annotated genes. Specifically, for the <italic>Ir41a</italic> genomic locus, our analysis did not reveal any annotated genes within it. Thus, this is unlikely to be the source of noise in our data. Second, our current normalization method, which uses counts per million reads (CPM) and is a standard normalization method in single-cell sequencing, can lead to more sequencing read counts of a single copy of a longer gene’s transcript than a shorter gene. (Unlike bulk RNA sequencing, reads are not typically normalized to a gene’s length in single-cell/single-nucleus RNA-seq protocols because normalization to a gene’s length can introduce other artifacts.) Third, we used an oligo-dT based primer to generate cDNA from poly-adenylated mRNA during library preparation. If a gene has long poly(A) stretches, non-specific internal poly(A) priming can occur which may lead to more copies of cDNA being generated for that gene. The Smart-seq2 platform (the platform we used in this study) does not use unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) to tag individual mRNA molecules and, hence, enable the discrimination between original mRNA molecules and duplicates generated during cDNA amplification (Ziegenhain et al., 2017, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2017.01.023). Thus, since <italic>Ir41a</italic> is much longer than other antennal sensory receptors it is possible that the very low-level detection of this transcript in multiple cell-types could have originated from one of the latter two explanations. Since we wanted to adhere to standard practices in Smart-seq2based single-nucleus sequencing, we avoided both normalizing <italic>Ir41a</italic> (or any of the other genes in this study) to its length and removing “noisy” reads from the <italic>Ir41a</italic> counts. Instead, we added an explanation for the low-level expression of <italic>Ir41a</italic> (and <italic>Ir93a,</italic> which is also longer than many other antennal sensory receptors and displays broad low-level expression) in many cells to the legend associated with Figure 5.</p></body></sub-article></article>
