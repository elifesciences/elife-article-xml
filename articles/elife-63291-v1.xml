neuronal network of brain regions including the cerebellum. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms of the cerebellar cortex modulating the fear memory network are unclear. Here, we illustrate that synaptic signaling in cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) <italic>via</italic> STAT3 regulates long-term fear memory. Transcriptome analyses revealed that PC-specific STAT3 knockout (STAT3<sup>PKO</sup>) results in transcriptional changes that lead to an increase in the expression of glutamate receptors. The amplitude of AMPA receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents at parallel fiber (PF) to PC synapses was larger in STAT3<sup>PKO</sup> mice than in wild-type (WT) littermates. Fear conditioning induced long-term depression of PF–PC synapses in STAT3<sup>PKO</sup> mice while the same manipulation induced long-term potentiation in WT littermates. STAT3<sup>PKO</sup> mice showed an aberrantly enhanced long-term fear memory. Neuronal activity in fear-related regions increased in fear-conditioned STAT3<sup>PKO</sup> mice. Our data suggest that STAT3-dependent molecular regulation in PCs is indispensable for proper expression of fear memory.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>STAT3</kwd><kwd>Purkinje cells</kwd><kwd>AMPA receptors</kwd><kwd>fear memory network</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2018R1A5A2025964</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Sang Jeong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003625</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Health and Welfare</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2014R1A2A1A11053203</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ye</surname><given-names>Sang-Kyu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cerebellar STAT3 is indispensable for proper expression of fear memory network processing.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Emotional memory processing, such as fear memory, has long been known to engage a large network of brain regions including the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wager et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tovote et al., 2015</xref>). Neuroimaging studies have identified significant neural activity in the midline cerebellum during mental recall of emotional episodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Damasio et al., 2000</xref>). The meta-analysis of patients with posttraumatic stress disorders (PTSD) has implicated the cerebellum as one of the activated regions during recall of traumatic memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). In rodents, the inactivation of the cerebellar vermis with tetrodotoxin disrupted fear memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sacchetti et al., 2002</xref>). Recent research argued that the cerebellum may be involved in the processing of aversive predictions and prediction errors, which has to be added to the neural network underlying emotional domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ernst et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The cerebellum integrates multisensory information <italic>via</italic> Purkinje cells (PCs), the sole output of cerebellar cortex, and transfers the information to the cerebral cortex, brain stem, basal ganglia, and spinal cords (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamaszek et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Reeber et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Frey et al., 2011</xref>). Parallel fibers (PFs) to PC synapses in the vermis lobule V/VI have been reported as a primary site for fear memory formation in the cerebellar cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sacchetti et al., 2004</xref>). Auditory fear conditioning increased synaptic strength at PFs to PC synapses in the vermis lobule V/VI, and electrically induced long-term potentiation (LTP) in ex vivo slices was occluded after fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhu et al., 2007</xref>). It has also been known that GABAergic activity increases at molecular layer interneuron to PC synapses after fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Scelfo et al., 2008</xref>). These studies suggest that the balance of inhibitory-excitatory (I/E) synapses may be necessary for fear memory formation. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms of the cerebellar cortex modulating the fear memory network are largely unknown.</p><p>Here, we focused on the role of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in the cerebellum, in order to test the hypothesis that STAT3 in PCs might regulate fear memory network. STAT3 has recently been known to be involved in regulating synaptic plasticity. For example, STAT3 regulates long-term depression (LTD) dependent on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDA-Rs) in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nicolas et al., 2012</xref>). Genomics research supported the involvement of JAK (Janus kinase)/STAT signaling pathway in the synthesis of the brain's major ion channels and neurotransmitters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hixson et al., 2019</xref>). JAK/STAT signaling is also involved in LTD at hippocampal temporoammonic-CA1 synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McGregor et al., 2017</xref>). At the inhibitory synapses, the JAKs can regulate the expression or function of γ-amino-butyric acid receptors (GABA-Rs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lund et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Raible et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, activation of interleukin-6 receptors which is an upstream regulator of STAT3 in the amygdala impaired auditory fear learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hao et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we investigated the impacts of specific deletion of STAT3 in PCs on the cerebellar synaptic plasticity and long-term fear memory network. We generated a mutant mouse in which STAT3 was selectively deleted in PCs (STAT3<sup>PKO</sup>) and found that STAT3<sup>PKO</sup> mice showed enhanced α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid type glutamate receptor (AMPA-R) expressions, and impaired LTP at the PF–PC synapses. Lastly, STAT3<sup>PKO</sup> mice showed aberrantly enhanced long-term fear memory after fear conditioning, indicating that the deletion of STAT3 in PCs might have implication for PTSD research in future.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of PC-specific STAT3 knockout mice</title><p>To examine whether cerebellar STAT3 is critically involved in cerebellar synaptic plasticity and fear memory, we generated a PC-specific STAT3 knockout (STAT3<sup>PKO</sup>) mice by crossing STAT3 floxed mice and Pcp<italic>2</italic>-Cre mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). First, we verified whether STAT3 protein was exclusively deleted in PCs of STAT3<sup>PKO</sup> mice. In the immunostaining assays, STAT3 expression in PCs was completely depleted in the lobule V/VI of STAT3<sup>PKO</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). We also confirmed that STAT3<sup>PKO</sup> mice showed comparable expression levels of STAT3 to wild-type (WT) mice in other brain regions critical for fear memory such as the amygdala (BLA and CeA), hippocampus (CA3), and paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sanders et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ressler and Maren, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Penzo et al., 2015</xref>). Since STAT3 has a wide range of functions such as neuronal cell growth, survival, and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Levy and Darnell, 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Di Domenico et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yadav et al., 2005</xref>), we further examined whether the ablation of STAT3 impaired cerebellar development. In vitro live cell structural imaging with a calcium indicator revealed that the gross morphology of PCs in mutant mice was similar to that in WT littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The quantitative analysis of cerebellar dendritic arborization indicated that deleting STAT3 did not affect dendritic branching processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). Furthermore, the number of dendritic spines showed no significant difference between WT and STAT3<sup>PKO</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Generation of Purkinje cell (PC)-specific STAT3 knockout mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunohistochemistry analysis for STAT3 in cerebellar slices from wild-type (WT) and STAT3<sup>PKO</sup> mice.

By using laser capture microdissection technique, we isolated PC somas from both WT and STAT3<sup>PKO</sup> mice, followed by RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The principal component analysis showed that the samples were distinctly separated into WT and STAT3<sup>PKO</sup> groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis indicated that among 34541 genes, STAT3 depletion upregulated 1987 genes (5%) and downregulated 5039 genes (15%) in STAT3<sup>PKO</sup> mice compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway has been applied to RNA-seq differential expression analyses to be more compatible with the reality of biological pathways.

First, we used the Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigm to examine how STAT3 contributed to fear memory processing. PC-specific STAT3 deletion did not impair the acquisition phase of auditory fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In contextual and cued fear conditioning, STAT3<sup>PKO</sup> mice displayed a comparable level of short-term fear memory to WT mice as assessed by freezing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Interestingly, the long-term fear memory of STAT3<sup>PKO</sup> mice was significantly enhanced compared to the WT mice only in the auditory cue test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). But both WT and STAT3<sup>PKO</sup> mice did not show significant difference in the contextual memory test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Next, we performed passive avoidance, fear-potentiated startle, and pre-pulse inhibition (PPI) tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E,F,G,H</xref>), and found that the avoidance memory significantly increased in the STAT3<sup>PKO</sup> group after fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The STAT3<sup>PKO</sup> mice showed comparable startle reflex, including the auditory startle response and PPI, to the WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,G</xref>). However, 24 hr after fear conditioning, the STAT3<sup>PKO</sup> mice showed more exaggerated startle responses compared to the WT group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). It is possible that STAT3 deletion may have sensitized their perceptual experience of painful stimuli, which ultimately led to improve retention of fear memory and its expression. By monitoring the video recordings, however, we analyzed the number of jumps was not significantly different between WT and STAT3<sup>PKO</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). In addition, STAT3<sup>PKO</sup> mice showed no significant difference in anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus-maze tests compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). Since the cerebellum is known to be important for motor learning and coordination, we further examined whether the STAT3<sup>PKO</sup> mice showed any motor deficits.

We found that PC-specific STAT3 controls the transcriptional regulation of AMPA-Rs, cerebellar synaptic plasticity, and consequently long-term memory of fear behavior. Ablation of STAT3 in the cerebellum affected fear memory network in the whole brain.</p><p>Our transcriptomic analyses provide the first evidence that STAT3 is involved in regulating synaptic transmission and plasticity through a genomic mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We found that the expression of transcriptional repressors, HES1 and REST, decreased in the STAT3<sup>PKO</sup> mice. Both HES1 and REST constitutively repress GluA1 and GluA2 expressions thus increasing GluA1/2 expression increased in the STAT3<sup>PKO</sup> groups. A series of changes in the transcriptional regulation in STAT3<sup>PKO</sup> mice subsequently altered the polarity of synaptic plasticity and fear memory, implicating STAT3 as a gatekeeper for optimal AMPA-R expression. It is noteworthy that negative regulators play a functionally important role in synaptic plasticity and memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lee and Silva, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schoch and Abel, 2014</xref>). Suppressing the expression of memory-suppressing genes such as calcineurin was shown to enhance memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baumgärtel et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Given the above results that entail the STAT3 deletion in PCs, enhanced AMPA-R expression and increased excitatory synaptic transmission may underlie the change in the polarity of synaptic plasticity. The enhanced expression of AMPA-Rs strengthens excitatory synaptic inputs to PCs and depolarizes the membrane potential to activate the voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ito, 2002</xref>). Opening of VGCCs results in calcium influx, giving rise to an increase in the dendritic calcium concentration, which may lead to LTD induction rather than LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ito, 2002</xref>). A previous study has shown that the enhanced activity of AMPA-R could cause the polarity change in synaptic plasticity, which accords well with our current data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">van Beugen et al., 2014</xref>). Together, stimulation of PF–PC synapses may induce higher calcium concentration in the STAT3<sup>PKO</sup> mice, resulting in LTD, although this remains to be investigated.</p><p>To explain the functional consequence of the change in the polarity of synaptic plasticity, it is worth noting that both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic plasticity are involved in freezing behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sacchetti et al., 2009</xref>). After fear conditioning, LTP at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses occurred in naïve mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sacchetti et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Scelfo et al., 2008</xref>). However, since STAT3<sup>PKO</sup> mice showed LTD-like plasticity at the excitatory synapses after fear conditioning, the decreased strength of excitatory synapses would affect aberrant freezing behavior. In the case of eye blink conditioning, the activity of PCs is reported to be suppressed during a conditioned stimulus after conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">ten Brinke et al., 2015</xref>). Although the conditioned response of PCs after fear conditioning has not been reported, the decreased output of PCs in STAT3<sup>PKO</sup> mice may disinhibit the activity of deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN), and DCN may send neural signals to other fear-related regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Recently, it has been identified that the cerebellum has pathways to sensorimotor, associative, and modulatory forebrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pisano et al., 2020</xref>). As previous studies showed, fear memory network is distributed in the forebrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wager et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tovote et al., 2015</xref>). This implicates that cerebello-cerebral connectivity may contribute to fear memory processing. In addition, cerebellar fastigial nucleus (FN)-ventrolateral periaqueductal grey (vlPAG) pathway is involved in the fear learning process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Frontera et al., 2020</xref>). It has been suggested that the suppression of DCN output facilitates freezing <italic>via</italic> reduction of activity in the vlPAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vaaga et al., 2020</xref>). The cerebellar outputs to the PAG negatively regulate freezing behavior. As our c-fos expression data suggested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), the cerebellum may also positively regulate fear memory formation or retrieval <italic>via</italic> projecting to the other brain regions than the PAG such as thalamus either directly or indirectly. Therefore, the cerebellum may have distinct pathways to regulate freezing responses and fear memory. In the future, it may be necessary to identify how PCs regulate fear memory and fear-evoked freezing behavior through distinct connections.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model of current hypothesis: Purkinje cell (PC) output regulation in fear-conditioned wild-type (WT) and fear-conditioned STAT3<sup>PKO</sup> mice.</title><p>In fear conditioning, long-term potentiation (LTP) occurs at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses (E: excitatory, I: inhibitory).

Although previous researches excluded the cerebellum, there has been emerging evidence that the cerebellum-cortical/subcortical connections are involved in emotional processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ernst et al., 2019</xref>). Our behavioral results showed increased long-term fear memory in the STAT3<sup>PKO</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D,E,F</xref>). In tandem, neural activity in the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus, basolateral amygdala, and prelimbic cortex increased in the fear-conditioned STAT3<sup>PKO</sup> mice, 24 hr after fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These data imply that the whole brain fear network could be altered by the deletion of STAT3 in the PCs. Recent research suggests that inactivation of a single region disrupted the subcortical–cortical communication on global network organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grayson et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, we checked the possibility that physical connections exist among the fear-related areas. Guided by the Allen brain atlas database, we reconstructed the three-dimensional images for tracts between the cerebellum and the thalamus, the prelimbic cortex and the thalamus, and the basolateral amygdala and the thalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Although more experiments still remain to be conducted, these experimental data could be further analyzed using realistic computational models of the cerebellum–cortical/subcortical connectivity.</p><p>The cerebellum is progressively recognized for its cognitive role such as emotion, as shown in previous human brain imaging and clinical reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stoodley and Schmahmann, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Moberget et al., 2018</xref>). Multiple animal studies also report that psychiatric disorders may result from cerebellar dysfunctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tsai et al., 2012</xref>). However, a well-characterized animal model for investigating the cerebellar role in fear memory is rare. PTSD-related genes and signaling molecules have long been predicted to act as memory enhancers or suppressors, particularly in the JAK2-STAT3 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mynard et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hauger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Daskalakis et al., 2014</xref>). Our findings suggest that STAT3 may act as a molecular switch to control fear behavior on the molecular and cellular basis of long-term fear memory storage. STAT3<sup>PKO</sup> mice showed the enhancement of long-term memory not only in Pavlovian fear conditioning but also in avoidance memories and fear-potentiated responses, which were less relevant to purely motor-related behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Interestingly, STAT3<sup>PKO</sup> mice was shown to be normal on cerebellum-dependent motor learning. One possible explanation is that deletion of STAT3 in flocculus might not affect the induction of synaptic plasticity for motor learning. <italic>Rest,</italic> one of the target genes of <italic>Stat3</italic>, is expressed in vermis lobule V/VI, but rarely expressed in the flocculus (Allen brain atlas database). Lack of <italic>Rest</italic> expression may limit the effect of STAT3 deletion on the induction of synaptic plasticity in the flocculus and VOR learning. <italic>Stat3</italic>, and <italic>Stat3</italic>-targeting gene, <italic>Hes-1</italic>, are similarly expressed in the two cerebellar regions. Thus, the STAT3<sup>PKO</sup> mice can be proposed as the suitable genetic model to study cerebellar synaptic plasticity in relation to traumatic event-related psychiatric disorders.</p><p>In conclusion, we found that altered synaptic input strength in the STAT3<sup>PKO</sup> mice enhanced long-term fear memory. These results imply that STAT3 physiologically maintains the fear memory network by controlling the cerebellar synaptic plasticity, preventing aberrant fear behavior. This study furthers the evidence that output strength in the PCs modulates the neural activity of highly interconnected areas that consist of fear memory network.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Stat3</italic></td><td>GeneCards</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus, male</italic>)</td><td>C57BL/6J</td><td>Jackson Laboratory</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus, male</italic>)</td><td>Pcp2-Cre</td><td>Jackson Laboratory</td><td>#004146;

STAT3 floxed (<italic>Stat3</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>) mice were kindly gifted from Dr. S Akira (Osaka University, Japan) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kwon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Takeda et al., 1998</xref>). Mice with a STAT3 deletion in PCs were generated by crossing mice with the floxed STAT3 allele with mice expressing Cre under the control of the Pcp2 promoter. The genetic backgrounds for both the Cre and floxed STAT lines were C57BL/6J. Genotyping was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kwon et al., 2017</xref>). The primers were specific for exons 22 and 23 of <italic>Stat3</italic>. All experiments were performed with male mice aged 8–10 weeks. Experimental animals were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions and 22 ± 1°C with a reversed 12 hr light–dark cycle (lights on at 07:00 hr). All experimental procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the College of Medicine, Seoul National University.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Immunohistochemical staining was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kwon et al., 2017</xref>). In brief, brains of mice were perfused with buffer containing 4% paraformaldehyde, and each brain region (cerebellum, thalamus, amygdala, prelimbic cortex, and hippocampus) embedded in paraffin. The paraffin blocks were cut using a microtome (4 μm, Finesse E+, Thermo Shandon, Runcom, UK). Paraffin slices were mounted on the silane-coated micro slides (Muto Pure Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan) and then allowed to air dry. Before immunostaining, the slides were deparaffinized in xylene, dehydrated through graded alcohols, and heated in citrate buffer. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) in PBS. The immunostaining was performed with primary antibodies for STAT3 (#8768, Cell Signaling Technology, MA, USA) and visualized using biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (BA-1000, Vector Laboratories, CA, USA). Signals were developed with the Vectastain ABC kit (PK-4001, Vector Laboratories, CA, USA), DAB reagents (K5007, Dako, CA, USA), and counterstained with hematoxylin (S3309, Dako, CA, USA). The slides were dehydrated through graded alcohols and mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (H-1000, Vector Laboratories, CA, USA). Images were obtained using the Leopard program on a microscope (BX53; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). For immunofluorescence, brain sections (thalamus, amygdala, and prelimbic cortex) were stained with the primary antibodies for c-fos (9F6) (#2250, Cell Signaling, MA, USA) and visualized using Cy3 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (#406402, BioLegend, CA). The slides were mounted with 4',6-diamidino-2- phenylindole (DAPI), and images were collected using the LSM510 program on a confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, München, Germany). The c-fos protein levels were quantified using ImageJ by measuring the integrated density of the c-fos fluorescence intensity, and the relative fluorescence intensity was measured by calculating the relative value of the integrated density of the WT control.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Cellular imaging and dendritic arborization analysis</title><p>Each PC dendrite was three-dimensionally imaged with Oregon Green BAPTA 488 fluorescence dye (Molecular Probes, O6807, USA) by using a whole cell recording method. Then, 50–100 slice images were merged onto a single image. Dendrites were traced with the aid of Zen software (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, München, Germany) for quantitative analysis using ImageJ. Branch lines were defined by a branch point and the branch points or dendritic tips were terminated by each of the daughter segments. All lengths were measured manually. The number of dendritic spines was also counted from the same images.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Laser capture microdissection</title><p>Laser capture microdissection (LCM, Molecular Machines and Industries) was used to isolate the group of cells from cerebellar slice tissues, with the aid of a laser beam under direct microscopic visualization. PC layers were isolated directly by cutting target regions away from unwanted cell layers. The obtained cell populations were used to generate cDNA libraries and to analyze RNA-seq transcriptome. Tissue was frozen on specialized coated membrane slides.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>RNA sequencing analysis</title><p>RNA was isolated using NucleoSpin RNA XS (Macherey-Nagel, Germany), and the sequencing library was prepared with SMARTer Stranded Total RNA-Seq Kit v2-Pico Input (Takara, Shiga, Japan) and sequenced with Illumina HiSeq 2500. Fastq was aligned to GRCm38 using STAR-2.4.2b, and estimated read count and TPM were calculated with RSEM-1.3.0. DEG was calculated by DESeq2 with expected read count generated from RSEM. Low expressed genes with total read count less than one among all samples were filtered. DEG was defined as Benjamini–Hochberg corrected p-value ≤0.05, absolute expression difference over 1.5-fold, and baseMean value ≥1. Upregulated and downregulated genes were queried for pathway analysis with g: Profiler. Normalization was performed with DESeq2 via regularized log (rlog) transformation method. Values were gene/sample centered and normalized. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was performed with Cluster 3.0. Heatmap was plotted with Java Treeview.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Slice preparation and electrophysiology</title><p>Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and decapitated, and the brains were immediately removed and placed in ice-cold slicing solution (0–4°C) containing the following artificial cerebrospinal fluid: 124 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 26.2 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, and 20 mM D-glucose, bubbled with a gas mixture of 5% CO<sub>2</sub>/95% O<sub>2</sub> to maintain a pH of 7.4. Sagittal slices of the cerebellar vermis (250–300 μm thick) were obtained using a Vibratome (Leica VT1200S; Leica, Nussloch, Germany). For recovery, slices were incubated at 28°C for 30 min. All recordings were performed within 6–8 hr from recovery. Whole-cell recordings in the cerebellar PCs were performed in the voltage/current-clamp mode using an amplifier (HEKA Instruments, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany). The signal was low-pass filtered at 5 kHz, and acquired at 10 kHz. For recording the miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), the recording electrodes (resistance 2–4 MΩ) were filled with a solution containing 135 mM Cs-methanesulfonate, 10 mM CsCl, 10 mM HEPES, 4 mM Mg<sub>2</sub>ATP, 0.4 mM Na<sub>3</sub>GTP, and 0.2 mM EGTA (pH 7.25). For miniature IPSC (mIPSC) recording, 135 mM Cs-methanesulfonate was replaced by 140 mM CsCl. We used recording pipettes (3–4 MΩ) filled with the following: 9 mM KCl, 10 mM KOH, 120 mM K-gluconate, 3.48 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM HEPES, 4 mM NaCl, 4 mM Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, 0.4 mM Na<sub>3</sub>GTP, and 17.5 mM sucrose, pH 7.25, for testing synaptic plasticity. Data were acquired using an EPC8 patch-clamp amplifier (HEKA Elektronik) and PatchMaster software (HEKA Elektronik). All electrophysiological traces were acquired in lobule V–VI of cerebellar vermis.

After 3 min of free exploration in the conditioning chamber, a series of conditioned stimuli (3000 Hz tones amplified to 85–90 dB lasting 30 s) was administered five times at 30 s intervals. The last 1 s of each CS was paired with the US consisting of an electric foot shock (0.7 mA). The mice were left there for an additional few minutes and were returned to their home cages.</p><p>Fear memory retrieval was tested at 10 min and 24 hr after the acquisition session in the independent groups of mice. The subjects were placed inside the conditioning box and left there for 3 min. After the acquisition session, we tested short-term memory fear retention by presenting to the mice the same context in which they were trained (contextual fear conditioning). A few minutes later, the subjects were placed in a novel environment (cylindrical container) for an additional 3 min, and two acoustic stimuli (CS) were administered, identical to those used during the acquisition session (cued fear conditioning). Long-term memory was tested in the same way 24 hr after the training session. In all experiments, the freezing response was recorded and its duration was taken as a fear index. Freezing was defined as the complete absence of somatic motility, except for respiratory movements. All animals were used exclusively for the fear conditioning test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Avoidance test</title><p>During the acquisition session, animals were placed in the light compartment of the apparatus (Gemini, San Diego Ins.). When the animal innately crossed to the dark compartment, it received one-foot shock (1 mA for 1 s). During the retention test, each animal was placed in the light compartment, and a few seconds later a guillotine door was opened, allowing them to enter the dark compartment. The latency crossing into the dark compartment was recorded. The test session finished either when the animals went into the dark compartment or remained in the light compartment for 300 s. During the test session, no electric shock was applied. All animals were used exclusively for the avoidance test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Acoustic startle response and prepulse inhibition</title><p>For testing, animals were placed into the startle apparatus (SR-LAB-Startle Response System, San Diego Instruments, USA) and allowed a 5 min acclimation period. The startle session started with three successive startle stimuli of 30 ms duration (75–120 dB). Within each block, individual trials were randomly distributed. Four different intensities of acoustic prepulse stimuli (80, 90, 100, and 120 dB) were used, each prepulse being 30 ms in duration. Movement of the animal within the cylinder was measured by a piezoelectric accelerometer. The representation of the acoustic stimulus and piezoelectric response of the accelerometer was controlled and digitized by the SR-LAB software and interface system. In all experiments, the variable interval between trials averaged 10 s; hence, each session lasted approximately 15 min. All animals were used exclusively for the startle response and prepulse inhibition test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Open field test</title><p>The open field consisted of 40 × 40 cm polyvinyl chloride square with 40 cm walls. Mice were placed in the center of an open field box, and their movements were recorded with a video camera for 30 min. The total distance traveled and time spent in the central zone (20 × 20 cm) were calculated using video tracking software (EthoVision XT 8.5, Noldus). All animals were used exclusively for the open field test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Elevated plus maze test</title><p>The elevated plus maze consisted of two open arms (30 × 5 cm) and two closed arms (30 × 5 × 15 cm) connected by a central square (5 × 5 cm). The whole maze was raised 50 cm above the ground. Mice were placed in the central square of the maze facing the open arms. The movements of the mice were recorded during a 5 min test period. The number of entries and time spent in the open and closed arms were calculated using video tracking software (EthoVision XT 8.5, Noldus). All animals were used exclusively for the elevated plus maze test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Rotarod test</title><p>The rotarod test was performed by a coordination test system (Rotamex 5, Columbus). All animals were pre-trained (for 5 min) on the rotarod in order to reach a stable performance and the rotarod test was performed for five consecutive days. The mice were placed on a rotating rod (3 cm in diameter) that accelerated from 3 to 50 rpm for 6 min and the latency to fall was recorded. All animals were used exclusively for the rotarod test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>VOR test</title><p>Two basal ocular–motor responses, which are VOR in dark (dVOR), and VOR in light (lVOR), were measured. For dVOR and lVOR, turntable stimulation was applied in sinusoidal rotation with ±5° of rotation amplitude. The dVOR and lVOR were conducted under light off and on conditions, respectively. Each response was recorded at four different rotating frequencies (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 Hz). All animals were used exclusively for the VOR test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>An appropriate sample size was computed when the study was being designed. Before we started the statistical tests, such as two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test, and ANOVA, we confirmed that data we obtained were passed the normality test. If not, we carried out the Mann–Whitney test. Two independent group comparisons of immunohistochemical staining, RT-PCR, western blotting, electrophysiological experiments, and behavioral experiments such as contextual and cued fear memory, avoidance, open field, and elevated plus maze tests were analyzed by two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test or Mann–Whitney test. Two-way ANOVA was applied to evaluate behavioral experiments such as fear acquisition, acoustic startle response, rotarod, and VOR tests, and to analyze synaptic transmission, plasticity, and intrinsic excitability with time or stimulus strength or injected currents. Bonferroni’s <italic>post hoc</italic> test was performed if applicable. All data are presented as mean ± SEM. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software Inc).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was supported by grants from the NRF funded by the Korea government (MISP; 2014R1A2A1A11053203 to S-K.Y. and NRF-2018R1A5A2025964 to S.J.K.); S-H.K. received a scholarship from the BK21-plus education program provided by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF).

The authors show that ablation of STAT3 in Purkinje cells leads to genomic changes, such as upregulating pathways important for synaptic signaling. There is also enhanced AMPA-R expression, increased basal excitatory synaptic transmission, and impaired LTP of the parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses. These changes in cerebellar function are associated with enhanced long-term memory of cued-fear conditioning as well as enhanced neural activity in brain regions that are thought to be important for cued conditioning--the thalamus, amygdala and prelimbic cortex. Interestingly, this enhancement of fear learning is specific to cued conditioning as there were no differences in contextual fear conditioning. The results add to the growing body of evidence for a contribution of the cerebellum to functions previously ascribed to the forebrain, and provide major new insights about cellular and circuit level mechanisms for this contribution. These studies are needed to understand the contribution of the cerebellum to emotional control, which has been studied primarily in humans</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The specificity of the effects of manipulating STAT3 in the Purkinje cells on cued fear conditioning and not contextual fear conditioning or motor learning tasks such as the rotorod or VOR learning is striking and surprising. On the one hand, the selective effect on cued fear conditioning, and not contextual fear conditioning helps to rule out an indirect effect of motor deficits on the freezing behavioral readout of fear conditioning. On the other hand, the reviewers wondered whether STAT3/cerebellar LTP plays a role in other forms of aversive conditioning, and why there was no effect of STAT3 knockout on motor performance or motor learning, given the well-established contribution of the cerebellum to those functions. At the very least, the authors should discuss how the specificity might arise, addressing the specific points below. Additional data that provide insights about the specificity would be welcomed, but were not deemed necessary.</p><p>– Why was there no effect on contextual conditioning? If the authors have results of c-fos in hippocampus (presumably no activity increase?) and could show them, this would help to explain the specific effects on cued memory, but not on contextual memory.</p><p>– Is STAT3 in Purkinge cells expected to alter other types of aversive learning?</p><p>– LTD and LTP at PF-PC synapses have been implicated in motor learning. Considering a current theory of VOR learning that gain-up learning relies on LTD and gain-down learning relies on LTP (e.g. Titley and Hansel, Cerebellum, 2016), one might have expected abnormal gain-down learning in STAT3-PKO mice, because of impaired LTP. However, VOR learning was shown to be normal in STAT3-PKO mice (Figure 4M). To avoid confusion, some reasonable explanations would be necessary. One possibility is that, unlike lobe V/VI, the induction of synaptic plasticity would not be affected by deletion of STAT3 in flocculus, a cerebellar lobe responsible for VOR learning. Is there a difference in expression of STAT3 or other molecules having similar functions between cerebellar regions?</p><p>– The rotarod test may not have been sensitive enough to detect motor deficits. Even wild-type mice could stay on the rod for about 80 seconds out of 360 seconds after 5 days of learning. Might the testing conditions be too difficult to detect any difference in motor coordination between wild-type and STAT3-PKO mice?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63291.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The specificity of the effects of manipulating STAT3 in the Purkinje cells on cued fear conditioning and not contextual fear conditioning or motor learning tasks such as the rotorod or VOR learning is striking and surprising.

Followed by this comment, c-fos expression was checked in hippocampus. The c-fos expressions were increased in both WT and STAT3-PKO mice after tone stimulation, while we did not find any difference between WT and STAT3-PKO. We added the result in Figure 6—figure supplement 1, and described in the last part of the Results section. This result suggests that altered cerebellar synaptic plasticity may not affect hippocampal-dependent fear memory.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Is STAT3 in Purkinge cells expected to alter other types of aversive learning?</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer commented, STAT3-PKO mice showed enhanced learning in passive avoidance test and enhanced fear potentiated startle response, suggesting that STAT3 deletion in Purkinje cells affected other types of aversive learning in addition to classical fear conditioning.

The apparatus was accelerated from 3~4 to 40~50 rpm. This is a commonly used protocol in numerous previous studies using mutant mice. The latency to fall was measured with a cutoff time of 2~6 min. This method allows us to reveal subtle phenotype in motor learning, because it tests several sessions for learning curve. Our own data is based on the same protocol described above. And we found no significant difference in locomotion test between wild-type and STAT3-PKO mice, as well as VOR learning. All things considered, we would like to address that the testing conditions above are likely to make difference in motor learning and coordination.</p></body></sub-article></article>
