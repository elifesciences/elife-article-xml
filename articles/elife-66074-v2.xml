Evidence accumulates that leukocytes use preferred exit sites, alhough it is not yet clear how these hotspots in the endothelium are defined and how they are recognized by the leukocyte. Using lattice light sheet microscopy, we discovered that leukocytes prefer endothelial membrane protrusions at cell junctions for transmigration. Phenotypically, these junctional membrane protrusions are present in an asymmetric manner, meaning that one endothelial cell shows the protrusion and the adjacent one does not. Consequently, leukocytes cross the junction by migrating underneath the protruding endothelial cell. These protrusions depend on Rac1 activity and by using a photo-activatable Rac1 probe, we could artificially generate local exit-sites for leukocytes. Overall, we have discovered a new mechanism that uses local induced junctional membrane protrusions to facilitate/steer the leukocyte escape/exit from inflamed vessel walls.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>endothelium</kwd><kwd>Transmigration</kwd><kwd>protrusions</kwd><kwd>GTPase</kwd><kwd>actin</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009425</institution-id><institution>Landsteiner Foundation for Blood Transfusion Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1649</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van Steen</surname><given-names>Abraham CI</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>NWO</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>91819632</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grönloh</surname><given-names>Max LB</given-names></name><name><surname>van Buul</surname><given-names>Jaap D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006280</institution-id><institution>Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PID2019-108902GB-I00</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Montanez</surname><given-names>Eloi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>NWO</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALWOP.306</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mahlandt</surname><given-names>Eike K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 914/A02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Walzog</surname><given-names>Barbara</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Neutrophils use dorsal membrane protrusions of endothelial cells to cross the vascular wall.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The current paradigm of leukocyte transendothelial migration (TEM) comprises leukocyte rolling, arrest, crawling, firm adhesion, and diapedesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alon and van Buul, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Butcher, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Muller, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nourshargh and Alon, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Springer, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vestweber, 2015</xref>). The latter step occurs either through the endothelial junctions, known as the paracellular route or through the endothelial cell body, called the transcellular route (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wittchen, 2009</xref>). Interestingly, some locations seem to favor the migration of multiple leukocytes that breech the endothelium in rapid succession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abtin et al., 2014</xref>). Prior to exiting the circulation, leukocytes change their crawling morphology to a round appearance, indicating that at exit-sites differential and local regulation is required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shulman et al., 2009</xref>). However, what determines where leukocytes take the exit remains elusive.</p><p>When leukocytes crawl on the endothelial monolayer, it seems they are looking for the perfect spot to leave the circulation. As if there would be a preferred ‘hotspot’ for these leukocytes to cross the endothelium. So far, several key principles have been suggested that may define local endothelial exit-sites for leukocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Muller, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schimmel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vestweber, 2015</xref>). First, leukocytes are attracted toward an optimal concentration of chemokines (<italic>chemotaxis</italic>), density of adhesion molecules (<italic>haptotaxis</italic>) or cellular stiffness (<italic>durotaxis</italic>). Recently, it has been shown that perivascular macrophages can secrete chemokines that may cause local queues for neutrophil diapedesis in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abtin et al., 2014</xref>). Similar ideas have been suggested for <italic>haplotaxis</italic>: integrin ligands presented at the apical surface of the endothelium that regulate leukocyte behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shulman et al., 2009</xref>). For example, high surface levels of ICAM-1 induce a transition from paracellular to robust transcellular migration, while intermediate levels favor the paracellular route (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abadier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yang et al., 2005</xref>), although the underlying mechanism is unclear. Data from our lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heemskerk et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Timmerman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">van Buul et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">van Buul et al., 2010</xref>) and that of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adamson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barreiro et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barreiro et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carman and Springer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lyck and Enzmann, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Muller, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vestweber, 2015</xref>) indicate a dynamic role for the endothelial actin cytoskeleton in controlling the factors described above. Recently, Hyun and colleagues showed the existence of two different hotspots during extravasation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hyun et al., 2019</xref>), one of which is located on the endothelium.</p><p>Perturbation of the endothelial actin cytoskeleton drastically influences the phenotype of the adherent leukocyte: blocking actin polymerization of the endothelium prevents the leukocyte to properly adhere and spread and consequently, leukocyte TEM is critically impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barreiro et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carman and Springer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schimmel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">van Buul et al., 2010</xref>). On the other hand, once a leukocyte has adhered to the endothelium, F-actin is locally (i.e. underneath the adherent leukocyte) depolymerized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Isac et al., 2011</xref>) These findings suggest that the endothelium can orchestrate local leukocyte diapedesis by remodeling its actin cytoskeleton at the subcellular level. Thus, understanding how actin-regulatory protein complexes orchestrate TEM under inflammation may thus be key to discover the mechanisms of the endothelium that drive local leukocyte exit.</p><p>Our observations underscore that leukocyte diapedesis is not a random event but occurs at predefined exit-sites. As TEM is a very rapid process (leukocytes cross the endothelium within 120 s), we used lattice light sheet microcopy, allowing high-speed imaging in three dimensions in time with high resolution but low toxicity to monitor TEM in detail. We discovered a novel mechanism how the endothelium generates local exit-sites for leukocytes to leave the vasculature. By asymmetrically inducing Rac1- and Arp3-dependent apical membrane protrusions at cell-cell junction regions that express ACKR1, ICAM-1, and PECAM-1, the endothelium guides leukocytes to the exit-side. Additionally, these protrusions are also found in vivo, and local activation of Rac1, using a photo-activatable Rac1 probe drives leukocyte exit on demand. Our work identified so-called endothelial junctional membrane protrusions (JMPs), a novel molecular mechanism that allows local steering of leukocyte TEM at the vascular level and offers new therapeutic targets to locally inhibit or enhance leukocyte extravasation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Endothelial cells display junctional membrane protrusions</title><p>When neutrophils crawl on an endothelial surface under inflammatory conditions, they are searching for an exit-point. Although most of the neutrophils seems to transmigrate at the first junction, their migratory behavior is more complex, and consists of walks along a junction and turns after crossing a junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schenkel et al., 2004</xref>). Using transendothelial migration (TEM) under flow assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heemskerk et al., 2016</xref>), we observed that although most neutrophils transmigrated at the first cell-cell junction they encounter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), only half of them transmigrated immediately upon arrival to that junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The other half migrated laterally along this junction for at least 20 s before crossing. In fact, approximately 40% of these neutrophils changed direction upon diapedesis, meaning that once arrived at the cell-cell junction, these neutrophils migrated on top of that junction, turned around and exited by migrating underneath the endothelial cell that they previously crawled on (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schenkel et al., 2004</xref>.

This technique allows for extremely fast imaging in 3D in time with high resolution and low phototoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). Membranes of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were labeled with a fluorescently tagged membrane marker (mNeonGreen-CAAX). 3D reconstructions revealed that the endothelium extended membrane protrusions apically into the lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These protrusions showed a highly dynamic appearance and various morphological shapes, ranging from finger-like to flap-like structures and are not restricted to one junction (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">Figure 1—video 2</xref>). As these protrusions appeared at junction regions, we termed them junctional membrane protrusions (JMPs). To study if JMPs are evoked by inflammation, we developed a robust and unbiased algorithm that allowed us to follow JMPs in 3D in time and quantify JMP volume, dynamics, and area over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video3">Figure 1—videos 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video4">4</xref>). These data revealed that short-term, that is, 4 hr (not shown), and long-term TNFα treatment, that is, 20 hr, to the same extend increased the overall volume of the JMPs as well as the dynamics of these JMPs, as well as the area of the JMP on the endothelium, although the latter one was not significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>).</p><p>The LLSM data provided highly detailed images of protrusion structures but is not suitable for large number of samples and testing of multiple experimental conditions. Therefore, to simplify the observation of JMP dynamics, we developed a method that enables the quantification of JMP dynamics with widefield microscopy imaging data of HUVECs with a fluorescent membrane marker. The rational of the image analysis was that highly dynamic membranes will display larger fluctuations in fluorescence intensity as compared to static membranes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> shows an example of such a JMP dynamics in time map and showed that JMPs colocalized with VE-cadherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).</p><p>We additionally checked if other inflammatory stimuli, that is, LPS, INFγ, and IL1β, changed the dynamic rate of JMPs compared to TNFα. Using the simplified algorithm to generate a membrane dynamics map, we quantified JMPs by simply taking the mean value of this image (for details see Materials and methods section). We found that all inflammatory stimuli tested showed the same JMP dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Also, when we tested JMP dynamics in endothelial cells that were isolated from different origin, we did not find differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). As transmigration events occurred under flow conditions, we tested if flow altered JMP dynamics. Indeed, short-term flow for 5 or 20 min did increase JMP activity, whereas exposure of the endothelial cells to longer periods of flow, that is, 30–60 min, reduced JMP dynamics back to basal levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We did not find any preference of JMP dynamics at the upstream or downstream side of the flow direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Thus, these data show that inflammatory stimuli promote the dynamics but not the actual appearance or size of JMPs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Neutrophils prefer local exit-sites</title><p>Given the spatial heterogeneity of the membrane protrusions, we wondered how JMPs are related to the neutrophil exit sites. To investigate this, mNeonGreen-CAAX transduced HUVECs were used to study neutrophil TEM under flow conditions. We found that most neutrophils preferred exit-sites with high-membrane activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). As about 50% of the neutrophils showed prolonged crawling time prior to diapedesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), we compared JMP dynamics of the first junctional region that a crawling neutrophil encountered to the JMP dynamics at sites where the neutrophil underwent diapedesis. In line with the idea that neutrophils preferred JMPs, we found that JMP dynamics were increased at sites where neutrophils transmigrated compared to sites where neutrophils migrated along the junction but did not exit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Moreover, we found that neutrophils preferred to initiate diapedesis by crawling towards a JMP of the neighboring endothelial cell. Consequently, the neutrophil used this JMP to exit and continued crawling underneath the endothelial cell that generated the JMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E–F</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that once a neutrophil used a JMP to cross the endothelium, other neutrophils followed this path and used the same exit-site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This was in line with an increase in endothelial JMP dynamics at exit-sites after the first neutrophil crossed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), in line with a recent publication by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hyun et al., 2019</xref>.

Additional immunofluorescence imaging revealed that Tiam1 localized at junctions as determined by a perpendicular line scan across the cell-cell junction indicated by VE-cadherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E–F</xref>). Similar line scan analysis showed that Tiam-C1199 recruited F-actin to these sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G</xref>), in line with previous work by Lampugnani and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lampugnani et al., 2002</xref>). Where endothelial cells that expressed only control plasmids showed low levels of F-actin at junction regions, endothelial cells that showed asymmetric expression of Tiam1 (meaning one cell expressed Tiam1 and the adjacent cell did not) or both endothelial cells expressed Tiam1 showed increased F-actin content at junction regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1H–I</xref>). Tiam1-C1199-induced junctional protrusions were approximately 2.5 µm in height, as was determined by 3D imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) and were reduced in height upon treatment with the Rac1 inhibitor EHT1864 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). When measuring the direction of migrating neutrophils that crossed the endothelium, we observed that neutrophils preferred to migrate underneath a Tiam1-C1199 cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video1">Figure 6—video 1</xref>). Similar results were found when expressing the constitutive active variant of Rac1, Rac1-Q61L, in a mosaic manner with control cells expressing LifeAct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video2">Figure 6—video 2</xref>). These data show that neutrophils prefer to transmigrate across junctions that display an asymmetric protrusion on one of the two neighboring endothelial cells. As a result, neutrophils migrate from the top of an ‘inactive’ cell to underneath the ‘active’ protruding endothelial cell.</p><p>Based on these results, we hypothesized that local activation of Rac1, that is, one endothelial cell but not the neighboring one, triggers asymmetric JMPs that function as a local recognition site to drive diapedesis for neutrophils. To test this hypothesis, we used a genetically encoded photoactivatable Rac1 probe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wu et al., 2009</xref>). By exciting the Lov2 domain, active Rac1 is released and induced local membrane protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B–D</xref>). We found that neutrophils preferred to transmigrate in the direction from the non-transfected cell underneath the PA-Rac1 expressing cell, in line with data presented above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video3">Figure 6—video 3</xref>). Moreover, local activation of the Rac1 probe increased the number of neutrophils that crossed the endothelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2E</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our data indicate that neutrophils preferred to exit the endothelium through junctions that display JMPs in an asymmetric manner, meaning that one endothelial cell exposes an apical protrusion and the other one does not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). These sites can be recognized as local endothelial TEM hotspots.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Upon acute inflammation, neutrophils start to adhere to the inflamed inner layer of the vessel wall, the endothelium, followed by crawling behavior. When crawling, neutrophils appear to search for an optimal spot to cross the endothelium. Although there is consensus that so-called TEM hotspots exist, and are in particularly recognized in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Proebstl et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hyun et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schimmel et al., 2017</xref>), it is unclear how such specific exit-spots are defined and regulated. We found that neutrophils prefer specific, apical membrane structures generated by endothelial cells, serving as exit-sites on inflamed endothelial monolayers.</p><p>As leukocytes cross the endothelial barrier within minutes, one requires high resolution and high-speed imaging technology to be able to capture all details in three spatial dimensions in time. To achieve this, we used lattice light sheet microscopy and discovered the existence of endothelial membrane structures that protrude apically at junction regions and serve as local recognition sites for crawling neutrophils. This discovery explains why neutrophils prefer one junction over the other, namely the junction that displays an apical lamella that functionally guides the crawling neutrophil through the junctional cleft underneath the endothelial layer. Hence, such recognition sites may be considered as TEM hotspots. As the membrane protrusion localizes at the junctions, we decided to name this structure the junctional membrane protrusion (JMP). Our data suggest that the JMPs open the junctional cleft and serve as a trap for the crawling neutrophil. JMPs are induced on one endothelial cell whereas the adjacent one shows low lamella activity. Consequently, a local asymmetric protrusion at junction regions appears that intercepts crawling neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). Thus, we have identified a unique mechanism that is used by crawling immune cells to efficiently cross the inflamed endothelial barrier in a paracellular manner.</p><p>There is ample evidence in the literature indicating that TEM ‘hotspots’ exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hyun et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Proebstl et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rigby et al., 2015</xref>). However, it has been a longstanding question in the field how such endothelial hotspots are regulated or what would characterize such hotspots. Many options have been proposed to mediate hotspots. For example, local stiffness has been proposed to control this, either induced by the substrate underneath the endothelium or by the endothelium itself by expressing local stiff actin-based structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martinelli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schaefer et al., 2014</xref>). Also local expression of adhesion molecules has been suggested as one of the key elements for such TEM hotspots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yang et al., 2005</xref>). And recently, the display of chemokines at junctions has been an attractive hypothesis for the induction of local exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Girbl et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pruenster et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Thiriot et al., 2017</xref>). The work by Girbl and colleagues showed that during TEM, endothelial-derived chemokines followed by neutrophil-derived chemokines are presented on the endothelial surface, at junction regions with the help of ACKR1, to guide the neutrophils through. Our data add to this study by showing that JMPs express ACKR1, as well as ICAM-1 and PECAM-1. We propose that these guiding molecules need JMPs for optimal exposure to the crawling leukocytes to initiate diapedesis.</p><p>Many different types of membrane structures have been described to emerge in endothelial cells. Breslin and colleagues described local lamellipodia to be involved in controlling the endothelial barrier function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Breslin et al., 2015</xref>). These structures depend on Rac1 signaling and myosin-mediated local tension and show great similarities to JMPs. JMPs are also regulated by the actin cytoskeleton to the same extent as regular protrusions are induced. We show a prominent role for actin polymerization, Arp2/3-mediated branching and involvement of the small Rho GTPase Rac1. When measuring Rac1 activity locally using a FRET-based biosensor, we find Rac1 to be activated at junction regions of inflamed endothelial cells, and to co-localize with JMPs. When locally activating Rac1, using a photo-activatable Rac1 probe, we can drive leukocyte exit on demand. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first time that leukocyte extravasation can be triggered on command. Membrane protrusions have also been detected in vivo. Such protrusions were found to be positive for PECAM-1 and surrounded adhering and transmigrating leukocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Petri et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Phillipson et al., 2008</xref>). These studies argued that the protrusions may function to prevent vascular leakage. Although we did not study if JMPs contribute to the limitation of vascyular leakge during leukocyte emigration, this is an attractive hypothesis. For therapeutic potential, not only can this mechanism now function as a target and pharmacological blockers can be developed, but more importantly, it may lead to novel strategies to initiate leukocyte traffic to parts of the body where we wish to have more immune cells present, for example for immune cell therapies.</p><p>For the regulation aspect: it is important to note that JMPs do not seem to be induced by leukocytes themselves, but rather through an intrinsic mechanism within the endothelium triggered by inflammation signals. Indeed, TNFα results in long-term activation of Rac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Van Rijssel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wójciak-Stothard et al., 1998</xref>). Our data does not support a model in which crawling leukocytes trigger the activity or dynamics of JMPs. When measuring JMP dynamics in the presence or absence of crawling leukocytes, we did not detect any difference in JMP activity. Also, the localization of the JMPs did not change when neutrophils were added, and Rac1 activity did not change when leukocytes crawled on top of an endothelial cells. In addition, we noticed that neutrophils did not per se choose the site of highest Rac1 activation in an endothelial cell, presumably because the Rac1 activation itself cannot be sensed from a distance. We hypothesize that a neutrophil continues to crawl over the endothelium until it encounters a local JMP, which is associated with high Rac1 activity, which is then used for diapedesis. We postulate that the regulation of JMPs happens in a stochastic manner, in line with previous reports showing the stochastic behavior of endothelial cell monolayers in early immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lipniacki et al., 2006</xref>) and expression of for example von Willebrand factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yuan et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>As endothelial cells are constantly exposed to flow conditions, we expected JMPs to be influenced by flow as well. To our surprise, we did not measure any differences in JMP dynamics or distribution in the absence or presence of long-term flow. This was somewhat surprising, as it is well known that endothelial cells drastically adjust their morphology to long-term flow conditions by polarizing in the direction of the flow with increased Rac1 activity at the upstream side of the endothelial cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kroon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tzima et al., 2002</xref>). However, the stochastic regulation of JMPs under inflammatory conditions is independent of any flow direction. Furthermore, as JMPs localize specifically at intact junction regions, we believe that these structures are therefore per definition different from junction-associated intermittent lamellipodia (JAILs) that have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cao et al., 2017</xref>).

To discriminate from the rolling phase, a neutrophil was crawling when migration speed was below 10 µm/5 s. Implying that its location in two subsequent frames is overlapping. We quantified the number of neutrophils that undergo diapedesis at the first junction they encounter during the crawling phase. We also distinguished between neutrophils that transmigrate at the first region they arrive at a junction and neutrophils that crawled along the junction to their diapedesis site which was defined as being more than 10 µm from the region they initially encountered that junction. Neutrophils that turn around during diapedesis were scored as ‘turn’ when they were located on top of an endothelial cell adjacent to the endothelial cell they arrived from the frame before diapedesis. To determine whether neutrophils transmigrate at JMPs, we set a threshold at the JMP dynamics map to 2x of the mean. The data to calculate this mean are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2F</xref>. When the diapedesis site had a value above this threshold, it was considered as a diapedesis event at a JMP. These JMP maps were generated from the frames that were collected before the neutrophil arrived at the diapedesis event, to exclude membrane dynamics because of the interaction between the neutrophil and the endothelium. To measure the JMP value at the diapedesis site, a region of interest around the diapedesis site was taken (region 1). To measure the JMP value at junction region a neutrophil first encounters, a region of interest of 10 um was used (region 2). To get the relative MD increase, the difference between these two values was divided by the value of region 2. To measure the relative JMP increase before and after TEM, a region of interest around the diapedesis site was selected. Then the frames before the neutrophils arrived at this site were used for calculating the JMP value (value 1) before TEM. To exclude influences of subendothelial crawling of neutrophils, the 30 frames after a neutrophil left from the diapedesis site were used for calculating the JMP value after TEM (value 2). The difference between these two values was divided by value one to calculate the relative JMP increase upon diapedesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Expression of fluorescent proteins in HUVEC</title><p>HUVECs were transduced with lentiviral particles at passage three and seeded in fibronectin-coated Ibidi slides for flow experiments or on coverslips for static experiments.

Fluorescence images were acquired every 2–7 s, depending on the experiment and the need for DIC recordings. We developed an image-based method for quantifying the dynamics in time series. It is based on the notion that highly dynamic regions will show large fluctuations in intensity. This results in a high standard deviation in the intensity over time. To extract this information, we generated a macro to calculate, for each pixel, the standard deviation in the intensity over time. The standard deviation is normalized by the average intensity and the image essentially depicts the coefficient of variation. Since the intensity fluctuations may arise from sources other than membrane dynamics, we implemented corrections for (i) bleaching and (ii) image drift, resulting in a membrane dynamic map that shows the membrane dynamics of a typical time lapse image of endothelial cells. To focus only on the junctions, the cytoplasm of each cell was selected as being 3 µm from the junctions and set to NaN.

For each frame cell membranes are identified automatically using an Otsu global threshold, and a triangular mesh is created from the volumetric image data using marching cubes iso-surfacing. Local surface variation is measured in the neighborhood of each vertex. JMPs are identified by a global threshold of surface variation. Vertices with high surface variation are considered a JMP region. The threshold was empirically determined and is the same across all datasets. This approach is effective in flat regions of the cells, but is sensitive to the thinner membrane around the nucleus of the cell. Therefore, the nuclear regions were manually marked and ignored for JMP analysis. After identification, JMP regions are separated from the cell mesh and capped to create a closed volume. Area and total region volume are measured in every frame and collected for each dataset. A coverage estimate of the JMP by PECAM or VE-Cadherin stains is also computed by considering the distribution of staining across the JMP regions (details in the supplemental methods). This pipeline was written in MATLAB R2019b (source code can be found on Zenodo at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5494546">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5494546</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arts et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Identification of cell membrane surface</title><p>The lattice lightsheet used at the Advanced Imaging Center, collects images at a 31.8° angle relative to the coverslip. The images are then ‘deskewed’ to align each z-slice with one another. In doing so, each z-slice is padded with zeros which can easily throw off any automated segmentation algorithm. To overcome this challenge, a mask is created to determine a valid image region for both the deskewed and deconvolved data. The mask is generated by keeping all non-zero pixels that are identified across the first 50 frames of each dataset. Each z-slice of the mask has hole-filling applied to make sure there are no internal holes.</p><p>Within the masked region, a global threshold is estimated for each cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Otsu, 1979</xref>). Threshold regions smaller than 0.1% of the masked region are discarded. Regions with convex volume larger than 50% of the mask volume are also discarded. These constraints avoid falsely identifying cell surfaces in highly noisy frames. Following thresholding, a marching cubes isosurface algorithm generates a triangle mesh of the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lorensen and Cline, 1987</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Quantification of JMP regions</title><p>JMP regions are found in areas of high surface variation. A cylinder is computed for each vertex in the mesh. The cylinder is oriented along the normal of the current vertex with the height and radius of the cylinder such that it contains all vertices in the <italic>n</italic>-neighborhood of the current vertex (for this work <italic>n</italic>=20). Surface variation for each vertex is defined as the volume of the cylinder centered at that vertex. The cell surface mesh is smoothed before computing surface variation, with four iterations of mean smoothing with a 1-neighborhood (vertices directly connected by a mesh edge). This reduces noise to make the calculation of vertex normals and surface variation more robust.</p><p>JMP regions are identified by surface variations above a given threshold. In order to provide consistent results across datasets, a global surface variation threshold of 3.5 was chosen empirically. JMP regions are further smoothed using a mesh-based morphological opening with a 1-neighborhood, followed by morphological closing with a 5-neighborhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gonzalez and Woods, 2008</xref>). Finally, holes in the JMP regions are filled.</p><p>To identify individual JMPs, each connected region is isolated into sub meshes.

The stain value at each vertex is calculated as the mean of the eight voxels surrounding the vertex in the PECAM or VE-Cadherin channel. Vertices are considered ‘stained’ as long as their stain value is above an Otsu threshold.</p><p>To estimate the distribution of stained vertices within a JMP, each vertex in the JMP is also encoded with its minimum surface distance to the edge of the region. A normalized histogram of stained vertices binned by distance from the edge is used to approximate the distribution of PECAM or VE-Cadherin within the JMP region. The normalized histogram is summed to produce an empirical cumulative distribution function. The distance to the 50th, 75th, and 90th percentile of stained vertices is computed. These percentile distances are normalized by the maximum JMP edge distance and averaged over time, per dataset. An illustration of this process for some example staining distributions is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2G</xref>. This gives an estimate of coverage of the JMP by PECAM or VE-Cadherin. If the stain is mostly near the edge, the normalized percentile distances should be near zero. Whereas, if the stain is distributed towards the center of the JMP, then the normalized percentile distances should approach one.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Scanning electron microscopy</title><p>Samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and 1% glutaraldehyde for 1 hr at room temperature and dehydrated using an ethanol series.

Data was analyzed using ImageJ software. ROI with no cells presents throughout the movie was selected for background correction of Cerulean3 and mVenus image stacks. Alignment of Cerulean3 and mVenus was done using the ‘MultiStackReg’ plugin (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/index.html">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/index.html</ext-link>). To reduce noise a smooth filter was applied to both image stacks. To correct for bleed through, 0.62xCerulean was subtracted from the mVenus signal for each frame to get the corrected mVenus stack, which was divided by Cerulean to calculate the FRET ratio. To define regions of high Rac1 activation, we selected the 1 um junction of the cell and put a threshold to approximately cover 50% of the junction. Then diapedesis sites were scored for either high or low Rac1 activity. To measure Rac1 activation in JMPs, we used the mVenus stacks of the FRET images to select membrane ruffles. These ROIs were projected on the FRET ratio-image and the average FRET value of such a JMP was calculated. Because the FRET signal is always increased at the junctions compared to the cell body, we compared the JMP FRET value to the junction of the cell. For this we selected a border of 3 µm per cell and calculated the mean FRET value.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Photoactovatable-Rac1 probe</title><p>Flow experiment was performed as described above.

Chemiluminescence (Ref# 32106, Thermo Scientific) was detected on light sensitive films (Ref# 47410 19289, Fuji).</p></sec><sec id="s4-23"><title>Rac1 activation assay</title><p>A confluent monolayer of HUVEC in a 100 mm Petri dish was washed with cold PBS (+ 1 mM CaCl2; 0.5 mM MgCl2) and lysed in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 500 mM NaCl, 1% (vol/vol) Triton X-100, 0.5% (wt/vol) deoxycholic acid, and 0.1% (wt/vol) SDS supplemented with protease inhibitors. Lysates were cleared at 14,000 × g for 5 min. GTP-bound Rac1 was isolated with biotinylated Pak1-Crib peptide coupled to streptavidin agarose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">van Buul et al., 2007</xref>). Beads were washed four times in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NaCl, 1% (vol/vol) Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors. Pulldowns and lysates were immunoblotted with monoclonal Rac1 antibodies.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by LSBR grant # 1649 (ACIvS), ZonMW NWO Vici grant # 91819632 (JDvB) and PID2019-108902GB-I00 (Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities) (EM) and NWO ALW-OPEN grant ALWOP.306 (EKM).

cells remains a significant area of research. In this study, Arts and colleagues, propose a novel mechanism that helps to determine exit sites through the endothelial barrier. Specifically, they demonstrate that the formation of junctional membrane protrusions and the underlying activity or presence of Rac1 and Arp3 enhance the likelihood of these junctions to serve as exit sites for neutrophil diapedesis. These important findings should be of interest for the scientific community that focuses on processes of migration and inflammation.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Endothelial junctional membrane protrusions serve as hotspots for neutrophil transmigration&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Carla Rothlin as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall the manuscript is very strong and we look forward to a revised submission. As you prepare your revised submission, we ask that you please address all the reviewers' comments included below in the &quot;recommendations to authors&quot; and &quot;public reviews&quot; sections.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Arts and colleagues investigated neutrophil transmigration across endothelial cells. They finely characterized the location of neutrophil exit and found that these cells preferentially transmigrate at endothelial cell membrane protrusions at cell junctions (JMPs). They further demonstrate that these endothelial cell membrane protrusions depend on Rac1 activation and they observe preferential neutrophil exit in Rac1 active endothelial cells.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript is well written, timely, novel and interesting. This is especially relevant in light of the upcoming possibilities of novel therapeutic strategies to target leukocyte trafficking and induce or block leukocyte extravasation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This study identifies a role for endothelial membrane protrusions at cell junctions as guiding clues for the trans-endothelial migration of neutrophils. It is shown that various inflammatory mediators increase the tendency of endothelial cells to form such protrusions with high dynamics at endothelial junctions. About 70% of transmigrating leukocytes crossed the endothelial barrier at junctions with dynamic membrane protrusions. These protrusions carried PECAM-1, ICAM-1 and the non-signaling chemokine receptor ACKR1, which were reported to be involved in the diapedesis process. A possible equivalent of these protrusions in vivo is demonstrated by PECAM-1 staining in a postcapillary venule of the cytokine-stimulated cremaster muscle. Formation of the membrane protrusions in vitro was dependent on the activity of Arp3 and Rac1. Furthermore, Rac1 activation was observed at such sites based on a FRET-based Rac1 biosensor. PMN diapedesis was preferentially seen at sites of higher Rac1 activity and silencing of Arp3 impaired PMN transmigration. Overexpression of an active form of the Rac1 GEF TIAM1 induced junctional membrane protrusions. Expression of either active Tiam1 or constitutively active Rac1 or photoactivated Rac1 each directed neutrophils to migrate from the top of an &quot;inactive&quot; neighboring cell to underneath the &quot;active&quot; protruding endothelial cell.</p><p>This work is important because it demonstrates convincingly that the formation of junctional membrane protrusions and the underlying activity or presence of Rac1 and Arp3 enhance the likelihood of these junctions to serve as exit sites for neutrophil diapedesis. In addition, junctional membrane protrusions seem to facilitate the transmigration of neutrophils in a directed fashion leading to the movement underneath the protruding endothelial cell. Thus, a mechanism is proposed which helps to determine exit sites through the endothelial barrier.</p><p>The work would benefit from addressing the following points:</p><p>1) It is appreciated that the authors tried to document the existence of junctional membrane protrusions at sites of leukocyte exit in vivo by visualizing neutrophil extravasation in the inflamed cremaster muscle. However, Figure 3D does not allow to determine whether the endothelial membrane protrusions are indeed formed at junctions. In addition, at least for one of the leukocytes that are shown (lower left corner of the depicted vessel segment) it looks like that the endothelial protrusions engulf the leukocytes from two sides. This is highly reminiscent of similar structures that were described in vivo by the Kubes lab several years ago. In these studies, such structures where endothelial cell protrusions engulf the leukocytes had been described as &quot;domes&quot; (Phillipson et al., PLoS one Feb 2008, 3(2):e1649; Petri et al., Blood jan 2011, 117:942-952). These studies suggested that these structures are formed to retain the barrier function of the vessel wall during the diapedesis process. Whether these structures do indeed serve such a protective function is of course difficult to demonstrate. However, the authors of the present study should cite these papers and discuss the point.</p><p>In addition, it would need to be shown in the present study, whether the endothelial membrane protrusions found in vivo in cremaster venules are indeed formed at endothelial junctions or whether they may also form at sites of transcellular diapedesis. As it looks in Figure S3B, there are examples depicted where the endothelial membrane protrusions rather extend also from apical sites of the endothelium which are not directly extending from junctions. They very much resemble the &quot;cup&quot; structures, which were described by Olga Barreiro and by Christopher Carman in their in vitro studies.

We have introduced these papers to our Discussion section at page 25 in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, it would need to be shown in the present study, whether the endothelial membrane protrusions found in vivo in cremaster venules are indeed formed at endothelial junctions or whether they may also form at sites of transcellular diapedesis.

One of the reasons for this is the lack of resolution. We have used real-time imaging on the lattice light sheet microscope to be able to detect and analyze these structures in more detail. Using these tools, we found PECAM-1 to be present on the JMPs but not VE-cadherin. This latter finding indicates that the JMPs are not co-localizing with VE-cadherin but can be detected using PECAM-1. We used PECAM-1 staining in the cremaster and suggest that such structures that we found, after volume rendering of the raw data, may indeed resemble JMPs.</p><p>Together with the group of Emma Gordon, Brisbane, Australia, we used the GFP-Lifeact knock in animals and analyzed inflamed cremasters with PECAM-1 stains. Here we could indeed detect a colocalization of PECAM-1 with Lifeact, indicating that the structures are positive for F-actin and at least colocalizing with PECAM-1. This new data set is added to the revised mansucript to supplemental figure 4A.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that we cannot state that the JMPs found in vitro are the same as the ones we detected in vivo. Therefore, we have carefully described the in vivo protrusions and stated that these might resemble JMPs but more future research should reveal the true nature of these in vivo structures. Most likely this includes high resolution imaging. In addition and as described above, the Kubes lab detected PECAM-1-positive structures as well, that may represent JMPs. We have added this information to our Discussion section now.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The study documents that neutrophils migrate preferentially through junctions with high membrane dynamics.

And as shown in figure 4A, the protrusions are only a few μm in length and most of the time they are smaller. Moreover, supplemental figure 7F shows that only 20% of the junction contains such protrusions. We hypothesize that these sites are preferred exit sites for crawling neutrophils. In this way, potential endothelial damage induced by transmigrating leukocytes is limited to these areas and these sites may help to assist neutrophils to extravasate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is shown that junctional membrane protrusions express PECAM-1, ICAM-1 and ACKR1.

It is not possible to answer this based on the micrographs that are depicted.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point raised by the reviewer. We detected these proteins to be present at the protrusions and correlated that with a membrane marker CAAX. We have added a line-scan analysis to these data and found that the increase in protein presence is similar to the increase in membrane marker. This indicated that there was no specific enrichment of one of the proteins detected but rather an increase in membrane density. These data are displayed in figure 3E-F and S3D-G. We noticed that we have not clearly described this issue and have therefore adjusted the text of the result section at page 11 on this topic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional comments</p><p>1) The white arrow heads in figures S3E and F seem to be missing.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the missing arrowheads.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The quantification of fluorescence intensity of ACKR1 and ICAM-1 by line scan analysis depicted in Figure S3D is not well explained.

We will add an extra section explaining the quantification in the method section. In short, we made a Z-stack, summed all the slices and then quantified the intensity of the projection. Indeed, it could well be that the increased fluorescence intensity is caused by the accumulation of membrane. This is also the reason why the CAAX signal is increased. We do not state that there is enrichment of ICAM-1 or ACKR1, just that there is colocalization with the increased CAAX signal at the JMPs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It was not always clear to me, which of the results in the paper were obtained with HUVEC and which with microvascular endothelial cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. All in vitro experiments were done with HUVECs except Figure S2B, as stated. For all endothelial lines, including microvascular lung endothelial cells, we found the same induction of JMPs upon inflammation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
