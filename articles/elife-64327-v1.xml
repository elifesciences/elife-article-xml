First, LC activity modulates feedforward processing of sensory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hirata et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Devilbiss et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rodenkirch et al., 2019</xref>) and impacts sensory cortex states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Constantinople and Bruno, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Polack et al., 2013</xref>). Second, LC activity correlates with task performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rajkowski et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Usher et al., 1999</xref>) and pupil diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rajkowski et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Joshi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Reimer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). Finally, pupil diameter is thought to index arousal and has been found to be correlated with neuronal and behavioral detection or discrimination sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Reimer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McGinley et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McGinley et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vinck et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lee and Margolis, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schriver et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cazettes et al., 2021</xref>), as well as decision bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de Gee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Gee et al., 2020</xref>). Since sensory cortex activity impacts perceptual reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sachidhanandam et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Miyashita and Feldman, 2013</xref>), these observations suggest the hypothesis that LC/NE modulates sensory cortex activity and affects perceptual task performance and that this effect can be monitored noninvasively via the easy-to-measure pupil diameter. Testing this hypothesis requires simultaneous measurement of (1) LC activity, (2) cortical activity, ideally subthreshold membrane potential, and (3) pupil diameter, all during perceptual task performance. Here, we recorded spiking activity of optogenetically-tagged LC units together with pupil diameter in mice performing a tactile detection task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). In a subset of experiments, we also performed simultaneous whole-cell current clamp recordings in S1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cortical membrane potential, LC spike rate, and pupil recorded during a tactile detection task.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Task schematic, trial structure, and all trial types of the single-whisker detection task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yang et al., 2016</xref>).

Mean LC spiking activity aligned withÂ trial onsets showed prominent responses to a tone delivered at the beginning of each trial, as well as in trials where mice made Go (licking) responses (Hit and False Alarm trials, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,c</xref>). LC spiking activity to the tone was comparable to Go responses (p=0.24, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, Materials and methods). On Hit trials, where mice successfully licked to the whisker stimulus, pre-stimulus LC activity (measured in a 0.5 s window prior to stimulus onset) was slightly but significantly lower than Miss trials, where mice failed to lick to the whisker stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). We note that on Miss trials, LC responded weakly to the whisker stimulus alone (&lt;0.5 sp/s above baseline, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). LC activity measured in a short window (0.2 s) after stimulus onset was larger on Hits compared with Misses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>; the same trend holds for 0.1 s window, data not shown). Ideal-observer analysis showed that both pre- and post-stimulus LC activity significantly predicted perceptual reports of the mice on a trial-by-trial basis, with choice probabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yang et al., 2016</xref>) of 0.47Â Â±Â 0.014 (p=0.032, nÂ =Â 43) for pre-stimulus and 0.59Â Â±Â 0.017 (p=4.6e-6, nÂ =Â 43) for post-stimulus LC activity, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>).

Both LC activity and pupil diameter increased during licking responses, but LC also strongly responded to the tone, a salient sensory cue that alerted mice to trial onsets. Thus, LC activity and pupil diameter appear to reflect different sets of task events during this behavior.</p><p>Next, we analyzed recordings where we simultaneously measured membrane potential (V<sub>m</sub>) of S1 neurons (mostly from layer 2/3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>), along with LC spiking and/or pupil diameter during the detection task. Our goal was to determine how LC spiking related to cortical activity and to pupil diameter during task performance. We used spike-triggered averages (STAs) to quantify how individual spikes from single LC units correlated with changes in V<sub>m</sub> and pupil diameter.

On the other hand, the LCâPupilâ relationship was similar to that of LCâPupil (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e,f</xref>).</p><p>Together, these data show that LC spikes preceded S1 depolarizations and pupil dilations. LC spiking correlated with both V<sub>m</sub> and pupil diameter changes, but on vastly different timescales (~0.2 s vs.Â ~2 s). Our data also show that the time derivative of pupil diameter, but not the absolute pupil size, is a good predictor of S1 V<sub>m</sub> fluctuations. However, LC spiking can track fast V<sub>m</sub> fluctuations better than either pupil or pupilâ.</p><p>Individual trials in our detection task contained distinct events, including the tone that alerted mice of the trial start (âToneâ), the whisker stimulus on Go trials (âStimulusâ), and licks (âLickâ), as well as other periods in which mice did not receive stimuli or make lick responses (âQuietâ). For a more granular perspective on how LC spiking correlated with changes in V<sub>m</sub> and pupil diameter, we computed LC spike-triggered averages separately in these different event windows (task epochs, Materials and methods).</p><p>While single LC spikes were associated with prominent changes in both cortical V<sub>m</sub> and pupil diameter, we found that these associations strikingly depended on task epoch: V<sub>m</sub> depolarization associated with an LC spike had the biggest response to tone/licking and almost no response during the quiet periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). In contrast, pupil dilation associated with an LC spike had the biggest response to licking and almost no response to the tone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>; this was true as well for pupil dilation after z-scoring, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The pupilâ associated with an LC spike had an intermediate response to the tone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). In addition, peak pupil dilation, pupilâ and V<sub>m</sub> depolarization appeared to have different dependencies on LC spike counts, with a roughly monotonic relationship between pupil and LC, and a much weaker dependence between V<sub>m</sub> and LC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>). The relationship between V<sub>m</sub> and LC spike count could partly but not fully be attributable to differences in the LC inter-spike intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2a</xref>). Thus, the correlations between LC spiking and V<sub>m</sub>, and between LC spiking and pupil diameter, are non-stationary, even on the timescale of a few seconds. Importantly, these epochÂ dependencies were different for V<sub>m</sub> and pupil â with the biggest response occurring to the tone for V<sub>m</sub> and the smallest response occurring to the tone for pupil â suggesting that the correlations between LC activity and V<sub>m</sub> and pupil each reflect distinct unmeasured underlying processes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Correlations between LC spikes, S1 V<sub>m</sub>,Â and pupil diameter depend on task epoch.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Top: LC spike-triggered âV<sub>m</sub> separated by task epoch: tone, stimulus, lick, and quiet.

We found that pre-stimulus baseline LC spiking predicted behavioral responses, suggesting that being in a hyperactive or distractable state underlies failed stimulus detection. We excluded trials where mice licked before stimulus onset from our analysis; thus, the higher baseline spiking in Miss trials was not caused by premature licking. However, it is possible that higher baseline LC activity was correlated with more whisking, which has been shown to lead to failed stimulus detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ollerenshaw et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kyriakatos et al., 2017</xref>). Overall, the effect was weak, possibly due to the use of an auditory cue that puts the mice in a more homogeneous arousal/attentive state. In other tasks without such alerting cues, task performance may have a stronger dependence on arousal and pre-stimulus LC activity.</p><p>Recent optogenetic and pharmacological work has shown that activating the LCâNE system enhances detection/discrimination sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gelbard-Sagiv et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rodenkirch et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">McBurney-Lin et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, LCâNE acting on early sensory areas (i.e., primary sensory thalamus, primary sensory cortex) likely affects perceptual decisionÂ making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">McBurney-Lin et al., 2019</xref>). We showed that S1 depolarizations immediately follow LC spiking, suggesting that LC activity at least partially contributes to the amount of depolarization in S1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Constantinople and Bruno, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Polack et al., 2013</xref>). Given that sensory-evoked S1 responses predict the behavioral choices of the mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sachidhanandam et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kwon et al., 2016</xref>), our results suggest that the LCâS1 pathway is involved during this task. However, the effect could be mediated directly through LC innervation of S1 or indirectly through LC innervating other early somatosensory areas, such as the VPM thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rodenkirch et al., 2019</xref>). Future gain- and loss-of-function experiments are needed to determine causal roles of these distinct pathways to S1 and to determine how different LC activity patterns (e.g., tonic vs. phasic) affect sensory processing and task performance.</p><p>LC responded strongly to an auditory cue (tone) meant to alert the mice to the beginning of a trial. Such responses may be mediated via synaptic inputs to LC from the brainstem (e.g., nucleus paragigantocellularis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ennis and Aston-Jones, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aston-Jones et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Van Bockstaele et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Llorca-Torralba et al., 2016</xref>). While this tone carried no information about the presence of a tactile stimulus or reward on any given trial, and therefore was not associated with a particular movement response, it did inform the mice about the time when a tactile stimulus could occur (in our task the duration between the tone and stimulus onset was fixed). The robust LC spiking responses to this cue are therefore consistent with LCâs role in promoting alertness or preparedness to detect a weak stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berridge and Waterhouse, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005</xref>). We also found that LC responded to operant licking responses, which is consistent with earlier work showing that LC encoded overt decision execution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kalwani et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our data show that while LC spiking and pupil diameter correlate well at long timescales, and both can predict changes in cortical dynamics, LC does so an order of magnitude faster. Moreover, the correlation between pupil and V<sub>m</sub> is much more heterogeneous than between LC and V<sub>m</sub>. In support of previous studies, our results suggest that compared with change in the absolute size of pupil diameter, its time derivative is a better predictor of cortical states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Reimer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Reimer et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, the relationships between LC activity, S1 V<sub>m</sub>, and pupil depended on task epoch. Because these epochs changed on the timescale of a few seconds, our data imply that pupil diameter can be dissociated from LC spiking and cannot be used as a stationary index of LC activity. However, comparing across repeats of similar epochs should yield a more accurate prediction of LC spiking by pupil diameter. That is, in attempting to use pupil diameter as a proxy for LC spiking, our data suggest it would be useful to separately normalize distinct task epochs. Future work should examine the LCâpupil relationship using fine-scale analyses that consider behavioral states at a granular level specific to individual tasks.</p><p>Pupil size changes have been linked to activity in multiple brain areas and neuromodulatory systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Joshi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Reimer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cazettes et al., 2021</xref>), and different pupil response profiles reflect different cognitive processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schriver et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that the pupil exhibits dynamic coupling with different underlying brain circuits in a cognitive processÂ (behavioral epoch)-dependent way. In addition, a recent study showed that pupil responses to dorsal raphe stimulation exhibited task uncertainty-dependent variations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cazettes et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, it is also possible that other modulatory systems (e.g., serotonergic and cholinergic,Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berridge and Waterhouse, 2003</xref>) modulate the pupilâLC coupling in a dynamic manner.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">DBH-Cre</td><td valign="top">MMRRC</td><td valign="top">Cat# 036778-UCD, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:MMRRC_036778-UCD">MMRRC_036778-UCD</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Ai32</td><td valign="top">Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">Cat#: JAX:012569, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_JAX:012569">IMSR_JAX:012569</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">BControl</td><td valign="top">Princeton University</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://brodylabwiki.princeton.edu/bcontrol">https://brodylabwiki.princeton.edu/bcontrol</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">WaveSurfer</td><td valign="top">HHMI Janelia</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://wavesurfer.janelia.org/">http://wavesurfer.janelia.org/</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">MATLAB</td><td valign="top">MathWorks</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">StreamPix</td><td valign="top">Norpix</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_015773">SCR_015773</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Adobe Illustrator</td><td valign="top">Adobe</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_010279">SCR_010279</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">High-speed CMOS camera</td><td valign="top">PhotonFocus</td><td valign="top">DR1-D1312-200-G2-8</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Telecentric lens</td><td valign="top">Edmund Optics</td><td valign="top">Cat#: 55â349</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Pipette glass</td><td valign="top">Warner Instruments</td><td valign="top">Cat#: 640792</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Tetrode drive</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cohen et al., 2012</xref></td><td valign="top">N/A</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-TH primary antibody (rabbit, polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Thermo-Fisher</td><td valign="top">Cat#: OPA1-04050, RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_325653">AB_325653</ext-link></td><td valign="top">(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Secondary antibody (goat, polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Thermo-Fisher</td><td valign="top">Cat#: A-11008, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2534079">AB_2534079</ext-link></td><td valign="top">(1:500)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>All procedures were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Johns Hopkins University Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were DBH-Cre (B6.FVB(Cg)-Tg(Dbh-cre) KH212Gsat/Mmucd, 036778-UCD, MMRRC)Â and Ai32 (RCL-ChR2(H134R)/EYFP, 012569, JAX), singly housed in a vivarium with reverse lightâdark cycle (12 hr each phase). Male and female mice of 6â12 weeks were implanted with titanium head posts as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). After recovery, mice were trained to perform a Go/NoGo single whisker detection task as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). Behavioral apparatus was controlled by BControl (C. Brody, Princeton University). A custom âlickportâ was placed within reach of the mouseâs tongue and used both to deliver water rewards and to record the time of each lick, determined via measurement of an electrical conductance change caused by contact between tongue and lickport. On go trials, a single whisker was deflected for 0.5 s with a 40 Hz sinusoidal deflection (rostral to caudal, peak angular speedÂ ~800 deg/s). A âresponse windowâ was defined as 0.2â2 s after the time of whisker stimulus onset for go trials or the time that the whisker stimulus would have onset on no-go trials. A âhitâ trial occurred when mice licked the lickport within the response window, and a drop of water was delivered. On go trials, if mice did not lick within the 1.8 s response window, the trial was scored as a âmissâ and no reward or punishment was delivered. Go trials were randomly mixed with no-go trials, in which the whisker was not deflected. No more than three consecutive trials of the same type were allowed. On no-go trials, if mice licked within the response window, it was scored as a âfalse alarmâ, and mice were punished with a 3â5 s time-out. If mice licked during the time-out, an additional time-out was triggered. A âcorrect rejectionâ occurred when mice withheld licking during the response window. Correct rejections were not rewarded. A 0.1 s auditory cue (8 kHz tone,Â ~80 dB SPL) was introduced starting 1 s before stimulus onset. During all sessions, ambient white noise (cut off at 40 kHz,Â ~80 dB SPL) was played through a separate speaker to mask any other potential auditory cues associated with movement of the piezo stimulator. Trials where mice made âprematureâ licking during the period between tone and 0.1 s after whisker stimulation onset were excluded from further analysis. To align LC activity and pupil traces to the âfirst lickâ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>), we used the first lick occurring in the response window. A total of 46 recordings from eight mice are reported (mean hit rate: 0.52Â Â±Â 0.03; false alarm rate: 0.11Â Â±Â 0.02).</p><p>Custom microdrives with eight tetrodes and an optic fiber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>,Â 0.39 NA, 200 Âµm core) were built to make extracellular recordings from LC neurons. Each tetrode comprised four nichrome wires (100â300 kÎ©). AÂ ~1 mm diameter craniotomy was made (centered at â5.2 mm caudal and 0.85 mm lateral relative to bregma) for implanting the tetrodes to a depth of 2.7 mm relative to the brain surface. The microdrive was advanced in steps ofÂ ~100 Âµm each day until reaching LC, identified by optogenetic tagging of DBH+ neurons expressing ChR2, tail pinch response, wide extracellular spike waveforms, and postÂ hoc electrolytic lesions. Broadband voltage traces were acquired at 30 kHz (Intan Technologies) and filtered between 0.1 and 10 kHz. Signals were then bandpass filtered between 300 and 6000 Hz, and spikes were detected using a threshold of 4â6 standard deviations. The timestamp of the peak of each detected spike, as well as a 1 ms waveform centered at the peak, was extracted from each channel for offline spike sorting using MClust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Redish, 2014</xref>). At the conclusion of the experiments, brains were perfused with PBS followed by 4% PFA, post-fixed overnight, then cut into 100 Î¼m coronal sections, and stained with anti-tyrosine hydroxylase antibody (Thermo-Fisher OPA1-04050).</p><p>Pupil video was acquired at 50 Hz using a PhotonFocus camera and StreamPix five software. Light from a 940 nm LED was passed through a condenser lens and directed to the right eye, reflected off a mirror, and directed into a 0.25Ã telecentric lens. WaveSurfer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.janelia.org/open-science/wavesurfer">https://www.janelia.org/open-science/wavesurfer</ext-link>) triggered individual camera frames synchronized with electrophysiological recordings.</p><p>In a subset of animals, we performed simultaneous intracellular current clamp (whole-cell) recordings in conjunction with LC recording and/or pupil tracking during behavior. A craniotomy over the C2 barrel was made based on intrinsic signal imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). In some cases, we also made craniotomies over nearby barrels based on the known somatotopy of S1Â (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Welker and Woolsey, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wilson et al., 2000</xref>) to increase yield. Whole-cell recording procedures, quality control, and data processing were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, borosilicate glass pipettes (1.5 mm OD, 0.86 mm ID; Harvard Apparatus) were pulled (P-97, Sutter) to have a long shank and were 4â7 Mâ¦ when filled with solution containing (in mM): 135 potassium gluconate, 4 KCl, 10 sodium phos-phocreatine, 4 ATP magnesium salt, 0.3 GTP sodium salt hydrate, 10 HEPES, 3 mg/ml biocytin (pH 7.3 with KOH). Electrophysiological signals (Multiclamp 700B, Molecular Devices) were filtered at 10 kHz and acquired at 20 kHz using Ephus or WaveSurfer.</p><p>For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, LC responses to the tone were calculated using a 300 ms window starting at tone onset, and LC responses to Go were calculated using a 300 ms window starting 200 ms after stimulus onset to capture peak responses. These estimates were based on LC response profiles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>. Pupil responses to the tone were calculated using a 1 s window starting 1 s after tone onset. This estimate was primarily based on theÂ pupil response profile during CR trials (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,c</xref>, indicated by th gray bar), where there was no whisker stimulus or licking response. Pupil responses to Go (licking) were calculated using a 1 s window starting 1.5 s after stimulus onset (e.g., FalseÂ AlarmÂ trials in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,c</xref>, indicated by the black bar). Based on the temporal profiles of pupil diameter in different trial types shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,c</xref>, and that the whisker stimulus started 1 s after tone onset, pupil responses to tone and Go can be segregated. These estimates were consistent with the results showing that pupil dilated 1â2 s after LC spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3d-f</xref>).</p><p>For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>, pre-stimulus LC baseline activity was calculated using a 500 ms window ending 50 ms before stimulus onset. Post-stimulus activity was calculated using a 200 ms window starting 20 ms after stimulus onset, before licking responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). Choice probabilities were computed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>To compute lick-aligned changes in LC spiking and pupil diameter, we only used licks that occurred at least 0.5 s after the previous lick. To compute LC spike-triggered S1 V<sub>m</sub> and pupil, we only used LC spikes that occurred at least 0.5 s after the previous spike. For STA analysis, peak âV<sub>m</sub>, âPupil, or the time derivative of Pupil (Pupilâ) were defined as the largest positive or negative value within the observed window (Â±1 s orÂ Â±10 s, respectively).</p><p>For cross-correlogram analysis, each LC spike train was convolved with a 400 ms wide Gaussian kernel (results hold for 200 ms kernel, data not shown). Peak correlation coefficients were defined as the largest positive or negative value within the observed window (Â±1 s orÂ Â±10 s). To examine how well LC spiking and pupil diameter could predict cortical V<sub>m</sub> fluctuations at different timescales (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3l</xref>), V<sub>m</sub> was high-pass filtered at 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 Hz separately. Cross-correlogram analysis between the filtered V<sub>m</sub> and LC (pupil) activities was then performed as described above, and largest absolute values of peak correlation coefficients were taken.</p><p>Task epochs were defined asÂ follows: âToneâ epochs: â0.2 s to 0.3 s with respect to tone onset (we also tested 0 to 0.5 s, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3</xref>); âStimulusâ epochs: â0.2 s to 0.3 s with respect to stimulus onset (i.e., only on trials with whisker stimulation); âLickingâ epochs: â0.2 s to 0.3 s with respect to licks that occurred at least 0.5 s after the previous lick; âQuietâ epochs: non-overlapping 0.5 s segments excluding the three types of epoch defined previously during the entire session.</p><p>Thirty-nine LCâpupil pairs from seven mice were included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, including single- and multi-units, with and without S1 recordings. For the rest of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, LC analysis included 43Â recordings from eight mice, each with at least fourÂ Hit and four Miss trials. Among those, 36Â were with pupil recordings and were used for pupil analysis. Twelve pairs of S1 whole-cell and LC single-unit recordings from six mice were included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3aâc</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4a</xref>, of whichÂ seven were with pupil recordings and included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3dâf</xref>. Nineteen S1âpupil recordings from three mice were included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3gâl</xref>. Twenty pairs of LC SU and pupil recordings from five mice were included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b,c</xref>, with and without S1 recordings.</p><p>Data were reported as mean Â± s.e.m. unless otherwise noted. Statistical tests were by two-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank unless otherwise noted. We did not use statistical methods to predetermine sample sizes. Sample sizes are similar to those reported in the field. We assigned mice to experimental groups arbitrarily, without randomization or blinding.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Edward Zagha for comments on the manuscriptÂ and Dwight E Bergles for DBH-Cre mice.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Joshua Gold as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Qi Wang (Reviewer #2); Carl C H Petersen (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of significant interest, but as described below that additional analyses are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Yang et al., make careful measurements of the spiking activity of optogenetically-identified locus coeruleus (LC) neurons during a whisker detection task in head-restrained mice together with measurement of neuronal membrane potential in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and pupil diameter. A substantial body of previous work has linked LC activity with cortical intracellular membrane potential (V<sub>m</sub>) depolarization, pupil dilation, and behavioral performance, but simultaneous measurements of all of three of these correlates in the same behaving animal â as the authors perform here â are rare and technically challenging, and these experiments offer the potential to study features of timing and trial-to-trial variability that might otherwise be inaccessible. The authors focus on two issues in particular: First, the relative ability of pupil dilation and &quot;ground truth&quot; recordings of LC firing to predict behavioral performance and membrane depolarization in sensory cortex. Perhaps not surprisingly, both pupil and LC are informative, but the time scale of pupil correlations with behavior and intracellular membrane potentials is an order of magnitude longer (1s<sup>-1</sup>0s of seconds), compared to LC firing. Second, the authors discovered that the impact of LC spikes upon S1 membrane potential and pupil diameter differed across behavioural epochs. Given that pupil diameter is often interpreted as a direct correlate of LC activity, the results may be of broad interest. There are many potential factors that likely contribute to this heterogeneity across different task epochs that the authors do not explore, including other neuromodulator systems like acetylcholine, and population-level changes in cortical activity, but reviewers agreed that the high quality of the experimental methodology make the data strong.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Given the qualitative difference between the tonic and phasic modes in the LC, it would be helpful to have a plot like Figure 4âfigure supplement 2, but conditioned on different inter-spike intervals. Specifically it would be interesting to know whether the larger effect on membrane potential during the trial epochs compared to quiet periods might be due to differences in the LC ISI distributions in these epochs (i.e. presence or absence of bursting rather than total spike counts).</p><p>2) Some justification or analysis of the specific time windows chosen for analysis of the pupil in Figure 2A would be useful. It is unclear why tone epochs were defined as [-0.2 0.3s] around tone onset. LC activity should not be affected in the period prior to tone as animals didn't know when the tone would occur.</p><p>3) Prestimulus whisking was found to be an important determinant of hit vs miss trials in a related whisker-detection paradigm (Kyriakatos et al., 2017). Does LC activity correlate with whisking, as well as licking? Here, the authors report that pre-whisker stimulus LC spiking differed across hit and miss trials (with lower spike rate in hit trials), suggesting the LC activity could participate in determining hit vs miss, but perhaps it is an indirect correlation because of whisking. This might be good to discuss, and perhaps analyze if whisker movements were tracked in these experiments. The authors might also discuss potential future optogenetic and pharmacological tests of the hypothesis that LC activity contributes to task performance.</p><p>4) The authors should give a more complete methods description. In general, I am not sure why the authors chose to write in such a short format, and they might expand on some points. How might the auditory stimulus drive LC spiking? How might LC spiking affect membrane potential in S1?</p><p>5) It is very intriguing that tone prior to stimulus presentation evoked strong LC responses but no changes in pupil size. The underlying mechanisms may be complicated, but some further discussion would be helpful. There may be an interesting link here with a recent work where task-evoked pupil dilation was decomposed to contributions of different cognitive processes, which may be differently modulated by the LC-NE system (Schriver et al., 2020).</p><p>6) In Figure 1E, the minimal pupil size seemed already fairly large.

The results suggest that the ISI distribution may contribute, but cannot fully account for, the larger effect on V<sub>m</sub> during trial epochs compared with quiet periods. Specifically, at the lowest spike count numbers, the ISIs for Tone/Lick epochs were lower than Quiet epochs, suggesting that there could be a partial role for ISI. However, although Quiet and Stimulus epochs differ for the V<sub>m</sub> response across LC spike counts (Figure 4âfigure supplement 2A, left panel), the ISIs are similar (Figure 4âfigure supplement 2A, middle panel).</p><p>We now refer to this in the text:</p><p>âThe relationship between V<sub>m</sub> and LC spike count could partly but not fully be attributable to differences in the LC inter-spike intervals (Figure 4âfigure supplement 2A).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Some justification or analysis of the specific time windows chosen for analysis of the pupil in Figure 2A would be useful.

We then chose the same window for the other epochs for consistency. However, as noted by the Reviewers, this window need not precede the tone. We have therefore performed new analyses for the Tone epoch using a [0 0.5 s] window, and found that this did not significantly affect our conclusions. We show this new analysis in new Figure 4âfigure supplement 3 and reference it in the Materials and methods:</p><p>âTask epochs were defined as: âToneâ epochs: -0.2 s to 0.3 s with respect to tone onset (we also tested 0 to 0.5 s, Figure 4âfigure supplement 3)â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Prestimulus whisking was found to be an important determinant of hit vs miss trials in a related whisker-detection paradigm (Kyriakatos et al., 2017).

We agree this improves clarity.</p><p>We have added to the Discussion to address the other points. Specifically, we now write:</p><p>âWe showed that S1 depolarizations immediately follow LC spiking, suggesting that LC activity at least partially contributes to the amount of depolarization in S1 neurons<sup>4,5</sup>. Given that sensory-evoked S1 responses predict the behavioral choices of the mice<sup>21,23,30</sup>, our results suggest that the LC-S1 pathway is involved during this task. However, the effect could be mediated directly through LC innervation of S1, or indirectly through LC innervating other early somatosensory areas, such as the VPM thalamus<sup>1</sup>. Future gain- and loss-of-function experiments are needed to determine causal roles of these distinct pathways to S1, and to determine how different LC activity patterns (i.e., tonic vs. phasic) affect sensory processing and task performance.â</p><p>We also now write:</p><p>âLC responded strongly to an auditory cue (tone) meant to alert the mice to the beginning of a trial. Such responses may be mediated via synaptic inputs to LC from the brainstem (e.g. nucleus paragigantocellularis)<sup>31â34</sup>.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It is very intriguing that tone prior to stimulus presentation evoked strong LC responses but no changes in pupil size. The underlying mechanisms may be complicated, but some further discussion would be helpful. There may be an interesting link here with a recent work where task-evoked pupil dilation was decomposed to contributions of different cognitive processes, which may be differently modulated by the LC-NE system (Schriver et al., 2020).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a paragraph to the Discussion to address these points. Specifically, we now write:</p><p>âPupil size changes have been linked to activity in multiple brain areas and neuromodulatory systems<sup>8,10,18</sup>, and different pupil response profiles reflect different cognitive processes<sup>37</sup>. Therefore, it is possible that the pupil exhibits dynamic coupling with different underlying brain circuits in a cognitive process- (behavioral epoch-) dependent way. In addition, a recent study showed that pupil responses to dorsal raphe stimulation exhibited task uncertainty-dependent variations<sup>18</sup>. Thus, it is also possible that other modulatory systems (e.g., serotonergic and cholinergic)<sup>30</sup> modulate the pupil-LC coupling in a dynamic manner.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In Figure 1E, the minimal pupil size seemed already fairly large. Was this panel a poor example or animals were already in a high arousal state throughout sessions?</p></disp-quote><p>We now plot a histogram of median pupil size from all sessions, with the value of the example trace indicated (new Figure 1âfigure supplement 1). This shows that the example trace is typical, and that the pupil in the example trace still has dynamic range for further dilation.</p><p>We are unable to use baseline pupil diameter to assess overall levels of arousal across mice and sessions, because we used controlled ambient light from an LED to put the pupil in a non-saturated state. However, our use of an auditory cue was intended to put the mice in as homogenous an arousal state as possible at the beginning of each trial. Our Discussion now refers to this fact in the following paragraph:</p><p>âHowever, it is possible that higher baseline LC activity was correlated with more whisking, which has been shown to lead to failed stimulus detection<sup>25,26</sup>. Overall, the effect was weak, possibly due to the use of an auditory cue that puts the mice in a more homogeneous arousal/attentive state. In other tasks without such alerting cues, task performance may have a stronger dependence on arousal and pre-stimulus LC activity.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The manuscript reported changes in raw pupil diameter in Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4. Given the large dynamic range of pupil fluctuations reported in literature, would Z-scored pupil size be a better way to lump data across animals/sessions?</p></disp-quote><p>Several of our analyses will not be affected by z-scoring. These include the cross-correlation analyses (Figure 2B, Figure 3G-L, Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A-B), the paired-observation analyses (Figure 2D and Figure 2âfigure supplement 2A), and the analyses of peak timings shown in our histograms (Figure 3F and Figure 3âfigure supplement 3B). For the remaining analyses, Z-scoring will scale the values for an individual recording, and potentially affect the degree to which the different recordings will contribute to averages. We have confirmed that z-scoring does not affect our conclusions for these remaining analyses. For the most critical analysis, that of Figure 4B, we have added a new Figure 4âfigure supplement 1 to show a version of Figure 4B obtained after z-scoring the pupil data. The results are nearly identical. We now refer to this new Figure 4âfigure supplement 1 as follows:</p><p>âIn contrast, pupil dilation associated with an LC spike had the biggest response to licking and almost no response to the tone (Figure 4B; this was true as well for pupil dilation after z-scoring, Figure 4âfigure supplement 1).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) It would be very interesting to know if there were any differences between regular spiking neurons and fast spiking neuron in terms of their correlation with LC spiking activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree this is an interesting question. However, we do not have identifiable fast-spiking neurons in our dataset of recordings.</p></body></sub-article></article>
