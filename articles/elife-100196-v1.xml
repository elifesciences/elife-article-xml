brain states. For example, hippocampal theta, gamma, and sharp wave oscillations are critical for memory formation and communication between hippocampal subareas and the cortex. In this study, we investigated the neuronal activity of the dentate gyrus (DG) with optical imaging tools during sleep-wake cycles in mice. We found that the activity of major glutamatergic cell populations in the DG is organized into infraslow oscillations (0.01–0.03 Hz) during NREM sleep. Although the DG is considered a sparsely active network during wakefulness, we found that 50% of granule cells and about 25% of mossy cells exhibit increased activity during NREM sleep, compared to that during wakefulness. Further experiments revealed that the infraslow oscillation in the DG was correlated with rhythmic serotonin release during sleep, which oscillates at the same frequency but in an opposite phase. Genetic manipulation of 5-HT receptors revealed that this neuromodulatory regulation is mediated by <italic>Htr1a</italic> receptors and the knockdown of these receptors leads to memory impairment. Together, our results provide novel mechanistic insights into how the 5-HT system can influence hippocampal activity patterns during sleep.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dentate gyrus</kwd><kwd>serotonin</kwd><kwd>infraslow oscillation</kwd><kwd>sleep</kwd><kwd>microarousal</kwd><kwd>calcium imaging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006474</institution-id><institution>Columbia University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Startup funds</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peng</surname><given-names>Yueqing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21MH122965</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Turi</surname><given-names>Gergely F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21AG079025</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Turi</surname><given-names>Gergely F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS129997</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peng</surname><given-names>Yueqing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000874</institution-id><institution>Brain &amp; Behavior Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Young Investigator Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Turi</surname><given-names>Gergely F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Rhythmic release of serotonin organizes infraslow oscillatory activity of the dentate gyrus during sleep.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sleep is an evolutionarily conserved biological process observed in the animal kingdom. Invertebrates such as <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and even <italic>Hydra</italic> show sleep-like behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cirelli et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Raizen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kanaya et al., 2020</xref>). In mammals, sleep stages can be subdivided into rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-REM (NREM) phases. During NREM sleep the activity of the skeletal muscle is reduced and the EEG is dominated by slow, high amplitude synchronous oscillations while in REM sleep the EEG activity is more similar to the awake brain state. There are also smaller building blocks of sleep stages. For instance, NREM sleep is often interrupted by brief epochs, which based on their EEG and EMG signatures, show remarkable reminiscence to awake states, thus, they are often referred to as microarousals (MAs). These events can be captured as brief motor bursts on the EMG signal and by abrupt alternations of low frequency oscillatory patterns in EEG recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartsch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">dos Santos Lima et al., 2019</xref>). Even though MAs are natural parts of the sleep architecture, the function of these events is largely unknown.</p><p>Sleep is a fundamental biological process that plays a crucial role in many physiological functions. Studies using various model organisms have demonstrated that severe sleep loss or total sleep deprivation can even have fatal effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bentivoglio and Grassi-Zucconi, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rechtschaffen et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shaw et al., 2002</xref>). While the exact biological function of sleep is not fully understood, research has suggested that it plays a crucial role in memory consolidation, which is the process of converting newly acquired memories into a permanent form. The supportive evidence for this hypothesis is quite rich although far from consolidated. Current models suggest that slow wave sleep, which makes up deeper stages of NREM sleep, processes declarative memory and it requires the active participation of the hippocampus through the replay of episodic memory traces captured during waking hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buzsáki, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Klinzing et al., 2019</xref>). While the role of hippocampal CA1 and CA3 subareas in this process is extensively studied, less is known about the contribution of the dentate gyrus (DG) which is the first station of the classic trisynaptic loop and located upstream from CA3. The main glutamatergic cell types of the DG are the granule cells (GCs) located in the granule cell layer and the mossy cells (MCs) which populate the hilus or polymorph layer between the upper and lower blades of the GC layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amaral, 1978</xref>). Experimental work has shown that GCs and MCs form a functional unit to perform pattern separation during active exploration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Senzai and Buzsáki, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">GoodSmith et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Danielson et al., 2017</xref>), a neuronal mechanism by which distinct memory traces can be created even if the input pattern is highly overlapping. Furthermore, it has been also shown that in awake immobile mice, the DG generates sparse, synchronized activity patterns driven by inputs from the entorhinal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pofahl et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Sleep/wake cycles are regulated by various monoaminergic and peptidergic cell groups located throughout the hypothalamus and brainstem. Among the monoaminergic neuromodulators, the serotonin (5-HT) system has been shown to promote wakefulness and suppress REM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Monti, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jouvet, 1999</xref>). It is widely accepted in the field that 5-HT release is reduced during NREM sleep, and 5-HT cells become entirely silent during REM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jouvet, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee and Dan, 2012</xref>). Serotonin is also recognized as one of the primary neuromodulatory inputs to the DG and a substantial body of evidence implicates that genetic manipulation of 5-HT or 5-HT-related genes has a profound impact on a broad range of hippocampal processes, including anxiety behavior, learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Luchetti et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yoshida et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Santarelli et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caspi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holmes et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Teixeira et al., 2018</xref>). Serotonin receptors are expressed throughout the dorsoventral axis of the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tanaka et al., 2012</xref>), with GCs expressing both the inhibitory <italic>Htr1a</italic> and excitatory <italic>Htr4</italic> receptor subtypes and about a quarter of MCs expressing the excitatory <italic>Htr2a</italic> receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tanaka et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, the mesopontine Median Raphe Nucleus plays a role in memory-related hippocampal ripple oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jelitai et al., 2021</xref>). Together these findings suggest that the 5-HTergic system has a strong impact on hippocampal functions.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the activity of GCs and MCs during sleep-wake cycles and their modulation by the 5-HT system. We found that both glutamatergic cell types – especially GCs – exhibit higher activity during specific sleep stages compared to wakefulness, and the calcium activity is organized to infraslow oscillatory (ISO) cycles during NREM sleep epochs. Our further findings obtained by recording from major 5-HTergic cell populations in the raphe and by manipulating specific 5-HT receptor subtypes suggest that the slow oscillatory activity in the DG is regulated by an ISO of the 5-HT system oscillating in the opposite phase during NREM which is also tightly coupled to MA events. Genetic knockdown of <italic>Htr1a</italic> receptors in the DG impairs the ISOs and contextual fear memory, suggesting a key role for this inhibitory 5-HT receptor in governing the oscillatory effect.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Infraslow neural oscillation of DG populations during NREM sleep</title><p>To investigate population activity during sleep and awake brain states in the DG in a cell type-specific manner, we injected a set of <italic>Dock10</italic><sup>Cre+/-</sup> mice with AAV1-FLEX-GcaMP6s to drive the expression of GCaMP specifically in GCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kohara et al., 2014</xref>). The mice were then implanted with fiber photometry probes, EEG, and EMG electrodes to facilitate brain state classification. Two weeks after recovery, we conducted chronic photometry and EEG recordings while the animals experienced natural wake/sleep cycles in a behavioral chamber. Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Senzai and Buzsáki, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pofahl et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shen et al., 1998</xref>), we observed significantly higher populational calcium activity during sleep states (NREM and REM), compared to wakefulness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). Strikingly, our data also revealed a structured pattern in the calcium signal: GC activity was organized to an infraslow oscillation (ISO, 1–2 cycles/min, or 0.017–0.033 Hz) during NREM sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and D</xref>). The oscillation amplitude and power remained largely unchanged in the early and late stages of NREM sleep epochs. However, the analysis of the oscillatory power and amplitude in the early stage of the first NREM sleep epochs following prolonged wakefulness yielded statistically significant differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Cross-correlation analysis between calcium activity and EMG/EEG revealed a strong correlation between the calcium oscillation and the sigma band of the EEG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Additionally, the troughs of the calcium ISO partially coincided with MA episodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Quantitative analysis showed that 29% of the ISO events during NREM sleep were followed by a MA epoch while 62% of ISO events were accompanied by the maintenance of NREM sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Notably, the reduction in GC activity significantly preceded the occurrence of MA events as judged from the EMG, where the average latency between the calcium trough and the onset of the MA was 6.06+/-0.31 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Infraslow calcium oscillation of granule cells during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative recording session showing infraslow oscillation (ISO) during NREM sleep.

Given the second-long latencies between calcium troughs and MAs, we turned our attention toward neuromodulatory systems that are thought to modulate sleep/wake periods on a slower scale and display phasic activity during sleep cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Scammell et al., 2017</xref>). An earlier study in mice identified phasic activity of serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe during NREM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oikonomou et al., 2019</xref>). This finding was corroborated by another group, which also demonstrated that the frequency range of the phasic activity falls in the infraslow regime (0.01–0.3 Hz) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kato et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, we looked at the possibility whether the 5-HT system might be responsible for the modulation of the ISO in the DG. In a subsequent set of experiments, we used GRAB<sub>5-HT2h</sub>, a recently developed and optimized genetically encoded 5-HT sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wan et al., 2021</xref>) to measure 5-HT dynamics during sleep. Considering that 5-HT is exclusively synthetized by the raphe nuclei in the adult brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Muzerelle et al., 2016</xref>), our initial step involved stereotactic injection of an AAV expressing the GRAB<sub>5-HT2h</sub> sensor into this region, followed by the implantation of an optic fiber above the injection site. Our results recapitulated the canonical view on 5-HT dynamics during sleep/wake cycles: we observed the highest 5-HT level during wakefulness, significantly lower level during NREM and detected the lowest 5-HT levels during REM periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A, F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Monti, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jouvet, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee and Dan, 2012</xref>).

We injected <italic>Htr1a</italic><sup>flox/flox</sup> mice with AAV9-CaMKII-Cre-GFP (intervention group) or with AAV9-CaMKII-GFP (control group) bilaterally in the dorsal DG. Two weeks after surgery, we tested the memory performance of the mice by examining freezing behavior in a contextual fear conditioning (CFC) paradigm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). In accordance with our hypothesis, we observed diminished memory performance in retrieval tests in the intervention group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>) measured by the time spent with freezing (30.0 ± 4.63% <italic>vs</italic> 49.2 ± 7.10%).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we demonstrated that major glutamatergic cell types of the DG, the GCs and MCs, display ISO activity (1–2 cycles/min or 0.02–0.03 Hz) during NREM sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>) but not during awake or REM periods. Our two-photon calcium imaging data shows that this oscillation is mainly driven by NREM-active glutamatergic cells (about 50% of GCs and 28% of MCs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Furthermore, we found that the ISO is negatively correlated with phasic 5-HT release in raphe nuclei during NREM sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Finally, we showed that local genetic ablation of <italic>Htr1a</italic> receptors in GCs impaired the ISO and fear memory recall a week after contextual fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Taken together, our findings demonstrate that the serotonin system plays a pivotal role in modulating DG activity during NREM sleep.</p><p>MCs and GCs are two major cell populations of DG which are thought to be involved in pattern separation and other cognitive functions in awake animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Senzai and Buzsáki, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">GoodSmith et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Danielson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2020</xref>). The activity of GCs and MCs has been investigated with both electrophysiological and imaging tools and the available data suggests that both cell types are significantly more active during sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Senzai and Buzsáki, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pofahl et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jung and McNaughton, 1993</xref>) than wakefulness. However, to our knowledge, ours is the first report showing that the population activity is dynamically rendered to ISO pattern during NREM sleep which is organized by at least one of the neuromodulatory systems, the 5-HT.</p><p>Two-site photometry recordings revealed a tight coupling between the activity of the raphe and the DG. During awake periods we detected a strong positive correlation between the two regions, whereas during NREM intervals this activity became strongly anticorrelated. In REM sleep, we detected a greater variability of correlation across animals, which cannot be attributed to serotonin, as most neuromodulatory systems are silent during REM sleep. Rather, varied DG activity during REM sleep across recording sessions may contribute to this variability.</p><p>There is much less available data on the activity pattern of MCs and GCs during MA episodes. Here, we showed that about 50% of putative GCs and 28% of putative MCs are upregulated during NREM and their activity is abruptly terminated by MAs.</p><p>We also observed that local downregulation of <italic>Htr1a</italic> receptors disrupts the ISO, suggesting that the 5-HT is directly involved in the regulatory mechanisms of this oscillatory process. <italic>Htr1a</italic> receptors are expressed by GCs which suggest that the inhibitory effect is mediated via this cell type. Since MCs are driven by GCs via highly efficient ‘detonator’ type of synapses, our current working hypothesis is that MC excitation is driven by GCs during NREM. We speculate that the drop of the calcium activity in MCs during the ISO is not mediated by serotonin but rather it is the result of the lack of excitation from GCs during the phasic 5-HT release. This hypothesis is supported by the difference in the delay preceding MAs in GCs and MCs (5.89+/-0.28 s in GCs <italic>vs</italic>. 4.89+/-0.40 s in MCs) which shows that GC inactivity is followed by MC inactivity. Simultaneous recording of MCs and GCs with two-photon calcium imaging in <italic>Htr1a</italic> knockout mice will further test this hypothesis.</p><p>ISOs have been observed in multiple brain regions during sleep-wake cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hughes et al., 2011</xref>). Polysomnographic recordings have revealed a 0.02 Hz ISO pattern recorded from cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lecci et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vanhatalo et al., 2004</xref>) which frequency is on the same time scale as the ISO we recorded from the DG. The cortical ISO is dominant in the sigma (10–15 Hz) power range in both mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lecci et al., 2017</xref>) which is the most prominent frequency band that contains neural rhythms associated with the gating of sensory information during sleep. A follow-up study by the same group demonstrated that the ISO from cortical EEG sigma band is correlated with MAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cardis et al., 2021</xref>). Our data with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kato et al., 2022</xref>) show that 5-HT concentration slowly oscillates in the hippocampus and in the raphe during NREM, thus it would be intriguing to conclude that peaks of the phasic 5-HT bursts act as the gating signal when the animal is more receptive to external stimulation and this can lead to awakening. However, we also need to point out that there are multiple other systems that can be active in parallel and contribute to the shaping of the sleep microarchitecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kjaerby et al., 2022</xref>). Several recent publications from different laboratories have shown rhythmic release of norepinephrine (NE) (~0.03 Hz) in the medial prefrontal cortex, the thalamus, and in the locus coeruleus (LC), and similar rhythmic activity of glutamatergic neurons in the preoptic area during sleep-wake cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kjaerby et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antila et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Osorio-Forero et al., 2021</xref>). The recording techniques used in these studies are highly similar to ours and the analyses arrive at the same conclusion, that is, about 30% of the phasic neuromodulator bursts lead to MAs while NREM sleep is maintained about 60% of the time. Furthermore, their work also demonstrated a correlation between LC-NE signal and EEG sigma power during NREM sleep, a characteristic EEG frequency band of sleep spindles. We performed a correlation analysis between DG activity and EEG sigma power and found a positive correlation between them during NREM sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>). The available data obtained with other novel neuromodulatory sensors suggests, that several other neuromodulatory and peptidergic systems (i.e. histaminergic, cholinergic, oxytocinergic) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dong et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jing et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smith et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Osorio-Forero et al., 2025</xref>) also display this phasic ISO activity during NREM sleep which raises the question of how the individual components of the ascending reticular activating system shapes sleep microarchitecture. Increase in the infraslow oscillatory frequency of NE during NREM leads to increased frequency of MAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kjaerby et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antila et al., 2022</xref>). However, increasing the extracellular 5-HT level by acute SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) administration does not seem to change the frequency of these events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kato et al., 2022</xref>). This suggests that the 5-HT system might have different neuromodulatory functions from the NE system during sleep.</p><p>In our experiments we wanted to minimize the impact of the surgical procedures on the behavior, thus we used separate cohorts to record the photometry signals and carry out the behavior experiments, therefore, we are unable to correlate the magnitude changes in the serotonergic ISO and memory performance. However, in a recent paper published by Kjaerby et al. there seemed to be a direct correlation between the magnitude of the norepinephrine pulses and sleep behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kjaerby et al., 2022</xref>). Gradual decrease of norepinephrine during NREM led to a fragmented sleep phenotype characterized by increased MA occurrence, decreased REM, and reduced spindle activity. The memory performance was also tested in a novel object recognition task and found to be diminished in the manipulation group. Serotonin has multiple roles in the brain, many of them show overlap with proposed functions of the noradrenergic system including regulation of plasticity, signaling reward or fearful stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Teixeira et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Paquelet et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, we speculate that the modification of serotonin dynamics during sleep will most likely interfere with memory performance, however, further experiments are required to test this hypothesis.</p><p>Our data demonstrated that phasic release of 5-HT during sleep acts as an inhibitory input to the neuronal activity in DG via <italic>Htr1a</italic> receptors, thus it serves as a pacemaker signal. In addition, we speculate that there could be an excitatory input which is responsible for the elevated activity of GC and MC subpopulations during NREM. The DG is the main input node of the hippocampal tri-synaptic loop receiving glutamatergic inputs from distant brain areas such as the entorhinal cortex or the supramammillary nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farrell et al., 2021</xref>). Recent data have shown a similar ISO in the medial entorhinal cortex in head-fixed mice while moving on a rotating wheel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gonzalo Cogno et al., 2024</xref>) which also transcended immobility epochs, but further data would be needed to confirm that they exist during NREM sleep as well.</p><p>A recent work from Pofahl et al. have used in vivo two-photon microscopy and showed that GCs display synchronous activity patterns during immobility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pofahl et al., 2021</xref> which might be related to the phenomenon we observed. However, the authors were not able to break down the immobility intervals to sleep stages due to the lack of simultaneous EEG/EMG recordings, nor did they assess the activity of the MCs in their work. Our results demonstrated the dynamic activity of DG cells during sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Interestingly, we did not observe the ISO at the single-cell level under two-photon microscope. One possibility is that this was due to different sleep patterns between head-restricted and freely moving animals. We hypothesize that deep sleep is needed for the ISO. Even though we habituated our mice extensively to our two-photon setup to minimize stress, head-fixed posture may still result in differences in sleep behavior due to the slightly increased stress response caused by head-fixation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Juczewski et al., 2020</xref>). Another possibility is that the ISO mainly has a dendritic origin and manifests less at the somatic level. Future dendritic imaging in sleeping mice can test this possibility.</p><p>In summary, here we showed that calcium activity in the DG is highly increased during NREM sleep periods, and population activity is entrained to ISO. The activity of the serotonergic system is highly correlated with this oscillation, and rhythmic bursts of 5-HT maintain the oscillatory activity, via <italic>Htr1a</italic> receptors expressed by GCs. While our study highlights the role of neuromodulation in organizing neuronal activity during sleep, the direct relationship between these effects and sleep-dependent memory functions, such as memory consolidation, remains to be explicitly demonstrated.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

A solution containing 50–200 nl viral constructs was loaded into a pulled glass capillary and injected into the target region using a Nanoinjector (WPI). Optical fibers (0.2 mm diameter, 0.39 NA, Thorlabs) were implanted into the target region with the tip 0.1 mm above the virus injection site for fiber photometry recording.

EEG recordings were made from two screws on top of the cortex 1 mm from midline, 1.5 mm anterior to the bregma, and 1.5 mm posterior to the bregma, respectively. Two EMG electrodes were bilaterally inserted into the neck musculature. EEG screws and EMG electrodes were connected to a PCB board which was soldered with a 5-position pin connector.

Briefly, a week after the virus injection the mice were deeply anesthetized with Isoflurane, then a sagittal incision was made on the top of the skull. After removing the skin, trephination was done on the left side of the skull, by using a sterile 2 mm diameter tissue punch. The overlying cortical and hippocampal tissue was removed from above the DG, while the brain was constantly irrigated with sterile cortex buffer (125 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl,10mM glucose, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgSO4. pH set to 7.4, osmolality to 305 mOsm). A sterile metal cannula (diameter: 2 mm, height: 1.8 mm) with a glass coverslip glued (Norland) to the bottom was implanted above the DG and secured in place with layers of tissue adhesive (3 M Vetbond) and dental acrylic.

Recordings were performed for 24 hr (light on at 7:00 am and off at 7:00 pm) in a behavioral chamber inside a sound-attenuating cubicle (Med Associated Inc). Animals were habituated in the chamber for at least 4 hr before recording. EEG and EMG signals were recorded, bandpass filtered at 0.5–500 Hz, and digitized at 1017 Hz with 32-channel amplifiers (TDT, PZ5, and RZ5D or Neuralynx Digital Lynx 4 S). For sleep analysis, spectral analysis was carried out using a fast Fourier transform (FFT) over a 5 s sliding window, sequentially shifted by 2 s increments (bins). Brain states were semi-automatically classified into wake, NREM sleep, and REM sleep states using a custom-written MATLAB program using the following scoring criteria: wake: desynchronized EEG and high EMG activity; NREM: synchronized EEG with high-amplitude, delta frequency (0.5–4 Hz) activity and low EMG activity; REM: high power at theta frequencies (6–9 Hz) and low EMG activity. Semi-auto classification was validated manually by trained experimenters. We categorized wake bouts of &lt;15 s as microarousals (MA) in the following way: the baseline of the EMG was calculated by averaging the signal, then a threshold of 0.5 standard derivation above the baseline was used to detect the MA. Finally, each MA event was further validated manually by a trained experimenter.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Two-photon recording</title><p>Mice were extensively habituated to the two-photon rig and to the head-fixed position before the recording sessions. They were placed in the head holder apparatus for a gradually increasing amount of time (from 5 min to 1 hr) over the course of 2 wk. Mice were head-restrained under the objective of the two-photon microscope, but otherwise able to walk on a custom-built treadmill. The mouse’s behavior on the treadmill was collected with an earlier version of BehaviorMate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bowler, 2023</xref>). The locomotory and stationary epochs were detected with a rotary encoder attached to the axel of the treadmill wheel. The signal from the encoder was processed with BehaviorMate.</p><p>A commercial in vivo multiphoton imaging system was used for the two-photon recordings (Bruker Ultima IV), equipped with a dual scan head. Nikon 10 x (0.4 NA) or 16 x (0.8 NA) objectives were used to record cellular activity. The emitted light was collected with photomultiplier tubes (Hamamatsu, H11706-40 GaAsP). Excitation was achieved with an InSight X3 (Spectra-Physics) laser tuned to 940 nm. The light intensity was regulated with pockels cells (Model 350–80-LA-02 KD*P Series E-O Modulator, Conoptics). The collection optics consisted of a standard filter set (565 dichroic, 525/70, and 595/50 bandpass) before the detectors.</p><p>Two-photon imaging sessions took 45–60 min. Images were collected at a 10 Hz frequency sampling rate in resonant scanning mode. Image dimensions were set to 512×512 pixels (width and height). The collected binary data was directly converted to Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) then it was deposited to our server. Image registration and cell detection was performed using Suite2p software (ver. 0.7.0) package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pachitariu et al., 2017</xref>). The registered and segmented images went through hand curation by an experienced investigator. During this process, the ROI selection in the GC layer was restricted to cells with small soma size and sparse activity patterns while ambiguous ROIs (non-cellular structures, cells with big soma size and high activity) were discarded from the segmented data. In the hilar recordings only large, multipolar cells were accepted as putative MCs which had large amplitude calcium transients with fast onset and exponential decay. Delta F/F was calculated using the extracted raw calcium traces and neuropil signals with custom-written code in Python as to the following. The unfiltered neuropil was first subtracted from the unfiltered raw trace. Two partial baselines were estimated then by filtering the residual raw trace, and the neuropil. The residual raw trace minus its partial baseline forms the numerator term of the dF/F. The denominator is the sum of the partial baselines. The partial baselines were calculated by applying a minimax filter to the respective (smoothed) traces.</p><p>To detect wake/sleep states, a Neuralynx Digital Lynx 4 S system was used for EEG/EMG recordings under the two-photon microscopy. EMG and EEG signals were acquired and filtered as described above. The EEG/EMG data was collected on a PC. Sleep states were calculated as described above. The up-regulated (i.e. more active during NREM sleep), down-regulated (i.e. less active during NREM sleep), and non-significant cells were defined by comparing each cell’s activity between epochs of quiet wake (without motion) and NREM sleep (unpaired t-test).</p><p>To facilitate sleep under head-fixed conditions, the mice underwent mild sleep deprivation during the night (from 5 pm to 8 am) before the recording session. Please note that the night is the active phase for mice. The mice were placed in a custom-designed cage within a sound attenuated enclosure on a treadmill controlled by a microcontroller. The treadmill was set to 5 s on and 10 s off cycles. On the morning of the two-photon recording sessions, the mice were transferred to the head-fixed apparatus from the sleep deprivation box.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Fiber photometry</title><p>Fiber photometry recordings were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Teng et al., 2022</xref>). In brief, calcium dependent GCaMP fluorescence was excited by sinusoidal modulated LED light (473 nm, 220 Hz; 405 nm, 350 Hz, Doric lenses) and detected by a femtowatt silicon photoreceiver (New Port, 2151). Photometric signals and EEG/EMG signals were simultaneously acquired by a real-time processor (RZ5D, TDT) and synchronized with behavioral video recording. A motorized commutator (ACO32, TDT) was used to route electric wires and optical fiber. The collected data were analyzed by custom MATLAB scripts. They were first extracted and subject to a low-pass filter at 2 Hz. A least-squares linear fit was then applied to produce a fitted 405 nm signal. The DF/F was calculated as: (F-F0)/F0, where F0 was the fitted 405 nm signals. To compare activity across animals, photometric data were further normalized using Z-score calculation in each mouse. To analyze the infraslow oscillation (ISO) of calcium signals, data were first downsampled to 1 Hz, then spectral analysis was carried out using FFT over a 2 min sliding window, sequentially shifted by 2 s increments (bins). The spectral power in the range of 0–6 cycles per min (i.e. 0–0.1 Hz) during wake and sleep was analyzed. Then, the power in the range of 1–2 cycles per min (i.e. 0.0167–0.033 Hz) was normalized to the total power and used for statistical comparison between <italic>Htr1a</italic><sup>flox/flox</sup> and control mice in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>. To detect the calcium trough of ISO in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, we first calculated a moving baseline by smoothing the calcium signals over 60 s, then set a threshold (0.2 standard deviation from the moving baseline) for events of calcium decrease, and finally detected the minimum point in each event as the calcium trough. The similar method was used to detect 5-HT peaks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>. To examine the infraslow oscillation at different stages of NREM sleep, we calculated the oscillation power and amplitude at the first (T0), early (T1), and late (T2) 1 min of NREM sleep epochs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>. T0 refers to the first minute of the first NREM epochs, defined as those with the prior wakefulness longer than 5 min. T1 refers to the first minute of all NREM epochs, whereas T2 refers to the last minute of all NREM epochs of the recording sessions. To analyze the relationship between DG and raphe activity in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) was calculated between two signals during wakefulness, NREM sleep, and REM sleep in each recording session.</p><p>To examine the DG activity during microarousals in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>, the calcium signals were aligned to the onset of each microarousal event to generate the per-stimulus time histogram (PSTH). We then defined the baseline by calculating the average of calcium signals in the first 10 s window before the MA (from –15 s to –5 s). The onset of calcium decline is defined as the timepoint where calcium decrease was larger than 0.05 standard deviation from this baseline. Finally, the time difference between the onset of calcium declines and the MA onset was named as latency. The difference between the baseline and the calcium trough was named as calcium drop. The same method was used to calculate the latency of 5-HT release during MA in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, where calcium decrease was replaced with 5-HT increase.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)</title><p>Mice were deeply anesthetized and then decapitated and their brains were snap-frozen on powdered dry ice.

In Fig 1A, during NREM, the peaks and troughs of GC population activities seem to gradually decrease over time. Please address this point.</p><p>b. In Fig 1F, about 30% of Ca dips coincided with MA (EMG increase) and 60% of Ca dips did not coincide with EMG increase. If this is true, the readers can find 8 Ca dips which are not associated with MAs from Fig 1E. If MAs were clustered, please describe this properly.</p><p>c. In Fig 1F, the legend stated the percentage during NREM. If the authors want to include the percentage of wake and REM, please show the traces with Ca dips during wake and REM. This concern applies to all pie charts provided by the authors.</p><p>d. In Fig 1C, please provide line plots connecting the same session. This request applies to all related figures.</p><p>e. In Fig 2C, the significant increase during REM and the same level during NREM are not convincing. In Fig 2A, the several EMG increasing bouts do not appear to be MA, but rather wakefulness, because the duration of the EMG increase is greater than 15 seconds. Therefore, it is possible that the wake bouts were mixed with NREM bouts, leading to the decrease of Ca activity during NREM. In fact, In Fig 2E, the 4th MA bout seems to be the wake bout because the EMG increase lasts more than 15 seconds.</p><p>f. Fig 5D REM data are interesting because the DRN activity is stably silenced during REM. The varied correlation means the varied DG activity during REM. The authors need to address it.</p><p>g. In Fig 6, the authors should show the impact of DG Htr1a knockdown on sleep/wake structure including the frequency of MAs. I agree with the impact of Htr1a on DG ISO, but possible changes in sleep bout may induce the DG ISO disturbance.</p><p>(2) It is acceptable that DG Htr1a KO induces the reduced freezing in the CFC test (Fig. 6E, F), but it is too much of a stretch that the disruption of DG ISO causes impaired fear memory.

The authors responded only to the points raised and did not seem to see the need to improve the overall analysis and description. In this second revision, I would like to ask the authors to improve them. The biggest problem is that the detection criteria and the quantification of the specific event are not described at all in Methods and it is extremely difficult to follow the statement. All interpretations are made by the inappropriate data analysis; therefore, I have to say that the statement is not supported by the data.</p><p>Please read my following concerns carefully and improve them.</p><p>(1) The definition of the event is critical to the detection of the event and the subsequent analysis. In particular, the authors explicitly describe the definition of MA (microarousal), the trough and peak of the population level of intracellular Ca concentrations, or the onset of the decline and surge of Ca levels.</p><p>(1-1) The authors categorized wake bouts of &lt;15 seconds with high EMG activity as MA (in Methods). What degree of high EMG is relevant to MA and what is the lower limit of high EMG? In Fig 1E, there are some EMG spikes, but it was unclear which spike/wave (amplitude/duration) was detected as MA-relevant spike and which spike was not detected. In Fig 2E, the 3rd MA coincides with the EMG spike, but other EMG spikes have comparable amplitude to the 3rd MA-relevant EMG spike. Correct counting of MA events is critical in Fig 1F, 2F, 4C.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added more information about the MA definition in Methods, including EMG amplitude. Furthermore, we have re-analyzed MA and MA-related calcium signals in Fig1 and Fig2. Fig-S1 shows the traces of EMG aptitude for all MA events show in Fig1G and Fig2G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1-2) Please describe the definition of Ca trough in your experiments. In Fig 1G, the averaged trough time is clear (~2.5 s), so I can acknowledge that MA is followed by Ca trough. However, the authors state on page 4 that &quot;30% of the calcium troughs during NREM sleep were followed by an MA epoch&quot;. This discrepancy should be corrected.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the misleading statement. We meant 30% of ISO events during NERM sleep. We have corrected this. To detect the calcium trough of ISO, we first calculated a moving baseline (blue line in Fig-S2 below) by smoothing the calcium signals over 60 s, then set a threshold (0.2 standard deviation from the moving baseline) for events of calcium decrease, and finally detected the minimum point (red dots in Fig-S2) in each event as the calcium trough. We have added these in Methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1-3) Relating comment 1-2, I agree that the latency is between MA and Ca through in page 4, as the authors explain in the methods, but, in Fig 1G, t (latency) is labeled at incorrect position. Please correct this.</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry for the mistake in describing the latency in the Methods. The latency was defined as the time difference between the onset of calcium decline (see details below in 1-4) and the onset of the MA. We have corrected this in the revised manuscript. Thus, the labeling in Fig1G was correct.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1-4) The authors may want to determine the onset of the decline in population Ca activity and the latency between onset and trough (Fig 1G, latency t). If so, please describe how the onset of the decline is determined. In Fig 1G, 2G, S6, I can find the horizontal dashed line and infer that the intersection of the horizontal line and the Ca curve is considered the onset. However, I have to say that the placement of this horizontal line is super arbitrary. The results (t and Drop) are highly dependent on the position of horizontal line, so the authors need to describe how to set the horizontal line.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, we used the onset of calcium decline to calculate the latency as mentioned above. First, we defined the baseline (dashed line in Fig1G) by calculating the average of calcium signals in the10s window before the MA (from -15s to -5s in Fig1G). The onset of calcium decline is defined as the timepoint where calcium decrease was larger than 0.05 SD from this baseline. We have added these in Methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1-5) In order to follow Fig 1F correctly, the authors need to indicate the detection criteria of &quot;Ca dip (in legend)&quot;. Please indicate &quot;each Ca dip&quot; in Fig 1E. As a reader, I would like to agree with the Ca dip detection of this Ca curve based on the criteria. Please also indicate &quot;each Ca dip&quot; in Fig 2E and 2F. In the case of the 2nd and 3rd MAs, do they follow a single Ca dip or does each MA follow each Ca dip? This chart is highly dependent on the detection criteria of Ca dip.</p></disp-quote><p>We have indicated each ca dip in Fig 1 and Fig 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As I mentioned above, most of the quantifications are not based on the clear detection criteria. The authors need to re-analyze the data and fix the quantification. Please interpret data and discuss the cellular mechanism of ISO based on the re-analyzed quantification.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have re-analyzed the MA and MA-related photometry signals. Accordingly, parts of Fig1 and Fig2 have been revised. Although there are some small changes, the main results and conclusions remain unchanged.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors employ a series of well-conceived and well-executed experiments involving photometric imaging of the dentate gyrus and raphe nucleus, as well as cell-type specific genetic manipulations of serotonergic receptors that together serve to directly implicate serotonergic regulation of dentate gyrus (DG) granule (GC) and mossy cell (MC) activity in association with an infra slow oscillation (ISO) of neural activity has been previously linked to general cortical regulation during NREM sleep and microarousals.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>There are a number of novel and important results, including the modulation of dentage granule cell activity by the infraslow oscillation during NREM sleep, the selective association of different subpopulations of granule cells to microarousals (MA), the anticorrelation of raphe activity with infraslow dentate activity.</p><p>The discussion includes a general survey of ISOs and recent work relating to their expression in other brain areas and other potential neuromodulatory system involvement, as well as possible connections with infraslow oscillations, micro arousals, and sensory sensitivity.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>- The behavioral results showing contextual memory impairment resulting from 5-HT1a knockdown are fine, but are over-interpreted. The term memory consolidation is used several times, as well as references to sleep-dependence. This is not what was tested. The receptor was knocked down, and then 2 weeks later animals were found to have fear conditioning deficits. They can certainly describe this result as indicating a connection between 5-HT1a receptor function and memory performance, but the connection to sleep and consolidation would just be speculation. The fact that 5-HT1a knockdown also impacted DG ISOs does not establish dependency. Some examples of this are:</p><p>– The final conclusion asserts &quot;Together, our study highlights the role of neuromodulation in organizing neuronal activity during sleep and sleep-dependent brain functions, such as memory.&quot;, but the reported memory effects (impairment of fear conditioning) were not shown to be explicitly sleep-dependent.</p><p>– Earlier in the discussion it mentions &quot;Finally, we showed that local genetic ablation of 5-HT1a receptors in GCs impaired the ISO and memory consolidation&quot;. The effect shown was on general memory performance - consolidation was not specifically implicated.</p><p>– The assertion on page 9 that the results demonstrate &quot;that the 5-HT is directly acting in the DG to gate the oscillations&quot; is a bit strong given the magnitude of effect shown in Fig. 6D, and the absence of demonstration of negative effect on cortical areas that also show ISO activity and could impact DG activity (see requested cortical sigma power analysis).</p><p>– Recent work has shown that abnormal DG GC activity can result from the use of the specific Ca indicator being used (GCaMP6s). (Teng, S., Wang, W., Wen, J.J.J. et al. Expression of GCaMP6s in the dentate gyrus induces tonic-clonic seizures. Sci Rep 14, 8104 (2024). <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-58819-9">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-58819-9</ext-link>). The authors of that study found that the effect seemed to be specific to GCaMP6s and that GCaMP6f did not lead to abnormal excitability. Note this is of particular concern given similar infraslow variation of cortical excitability in epilepsy (cf Vanhatalo et al. PNAS 2004). While I don't think that the experiments need to be repeated with a different indicator to address this concern, you should be able to use the 2p GCaMP7 experiments that have already been done to provide additional validation by repeating the analyses done for the GCaMP6s photometry experiments. This should be done anyway to allow appropriate comparison of the 2p and photometry results.</p><p>– While the discussion mentions previous work that has linked ISOs during sleep with regulation of cortical oscillations in the sigma band, oddly no such analysis is performed in the current work even though it is presumably available and would be highly relevant to the interpretation of a number of primary results including the relationship between the ISOs and MAs observed in the DG and similar results reported in other areas, as well as the selective impact of DG 5-HT1a knockdown on DG ISOs. For example, in the initial results describing the cross correlation of calcium activity and EMG/EEG with MA episodes (paragraph 1, page 4), similar results relating brief arousals to the infraslow fluctuation in sleep spindles (sigma band) have been reported also at .02 Hz associated with variation in sensory arousability (cf. Cardis et al., &quot;Cortico-autonomic local arousals and heightened somatosensory arousability during NREMS of mice in neuropathic pain&quot;, eLife 2021). It would be important to know whether the current results show similar cortical sigma band correlations. Also, in the results on ISO attenuation following 5-HT1 knockdown on page 7 (fig. 6), how is cortical EEG affected? is ISO still seen in EEG but attenuated in DG?</p><p>– The illustrations of the effect of 5-HT1a knockdown shown in Figure 6 are somewhat misleading. The examples in panels B and C show an effect that is much more dramatic than the overall effect shown in panel D. Panels B and C do not appear to be representative examples. Which of the sample points in panel D are illustrated in panels B, C? it is not appropriate to arbitrarily select two points from different animals for comparison, or worse, to take points from the extremes of the distributions. If the intent is to illustrate what the effect shown in D looks like in the raw data, then you need to select examples that reflect the means shown in panel D. It is also important to show the effect on cortical EEG, particularly in sigma band to see if the effects are restricted to the DG ISOs. It would also be helpful to show that MAs and their correlations as shown in Fig 1 or G as well as broader sleep architecture are not affected.</p><p>– On page 9 of the results it states that GCs and MCs are upregulated during NREM and their activity is abruptly terminated by MAs through a 5-HT mediated mechanism. I didn't see anything showing the 5-HT dependence of the MA activity correlation. The results indicate a reduction in ISO modulation of GC activity but not the MA correlated activity. I would like to see the equivalent of Fig 1,2 G panels with the 5-HT1a manipulation.</p></disp-quote><p>Responses to Revewer#3 have been addressed in the first revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Minor comment: Several recent publications from different laboratories have shown rhythmic release of norepinephrine (NE) (~0.03 Hz) in the medial prefrontal cortex, the thalamus, and in the locus coeruleus (LC) of the mouse during sleep-wake cycles-&gt; Please add &quot;preoptic area&quot; here</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the citation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Minor</p><p>(1) (abstract, page 2 line 9) what kind of &quot;increased activity&quot; did the authors find?</p></disp-quote><p>Increased activity compared to that during wakefulness.
