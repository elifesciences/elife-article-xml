oscillations in primate early visual cortex can be induced by homogeneous color surfaces (Peter et al., 2019; Shirhatti and Ray, 2018). Compared to other hues, particularly strong gamma oscillations have been reported for red stimuli. However, precortical color processing and the resultant strength of input to V1 have often not been fully controlled for. Therefore, stronger responses to red might be due to differences in V1 input strength. We presented stimuli that had equal luminance and cone contrast levels in a color coordinate system based on responses of the lateral geniculate nucleus, the main input source for area V1. With these stimuli, we recorded magnetoencephalography in 30 human participants. We found gamma oscillations in early visual cortex which, contrary to previous reports, did not differ between red and green stimuli of equal L-M cone contrast. Notably, blue stimuli with contrast exclusively on the S-cone axis induced very weak gamma responses, as well as smaller event-related fields and poorer change-detection performance. The strength of human color gamma responses for stimuli on the L-M axis could be well explained by L-M cone contrast and did not show a clear red bias when L-M cone contrast was properly equalized.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>MEG</kwd><kwd>V1</kwd><kwd>gamma</kwd><kwd>color vision</kwd><kwd>DKL</kwd><kwd>LGN</kwd><kwd>N70</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FOR 1847 FR2557/2-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fries</surname><given-names>Pascal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FR2557/5-1-CORNET</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fries</surname><given-names>Pascal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FR2557/7-1 DualStreams</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fries</surname><given-names>Pascal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Union</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FP7-604102-HBP</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fries</surname><given-names>Pascal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>International Max Planck Research School for Neural Circuits</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>open access funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stauch</surname><given-names>Benjamin J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Colored surfaces induce gamma oscillations in human early visual cortex that are equally strong for red and green colors when L-M cone contrast is controlled for.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In early visual cortex of human and non-human primates, visual stimuli often induce rhythmic activity in the gamma band (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hoogenboom et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kreiter and Singer, 1992</xref>).

Especially strong gamma oscillations have been observed for high-contrast black and white stimuli that extend beyond the size of single-neuron receptive fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gieselmann and Thiele, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jia et al., 2011</xref>) and whose features are contiguous over space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brunet and Fries, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hermes et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lowet et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Uran et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vinck and Bosman, 2016</xref>). Likely, this dependence exists because extensive and uniform stimuli synchronize larger populations of neurons into a common gamma rhythm, thereby generating a clearer oscillatory population signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gray et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lowet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lowet et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Large homogeneous patches of color have also been shown to induce strong gamma oscillations, both in the early visual cortex of macaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brunet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Peter et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rols et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shirhatti and Ray, 2018</xref>) and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartoli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Perry et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, red stimuli have been reported to induce especially strong gamma-band responses in several of these reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartoli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Perry et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rols et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shirhatti and Ray, 2018</xref>). It has been speculated that this might be due to a higher ecological relevance of the color red in natural environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartoli et al., 2020</xref>), and it was recently related to potentially faster adaptation of the M-cone pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Peter et al., 2019</xref>). However, when comparing across different stimuli, the strength of input to the neuronal populations generating the investigated gamma signal should be controlled, because gamma-power scales with the strength of excitatory synaptic input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hadjipapas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Henrie and Shapley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lewis et al., 2021</xref>). Color-induced gamma has mostly been studied in area V1 (see above). In primates, feedforward driving input to V1 originates mostly from the LGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Felleman and Van Essen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sherman, 2005</xref>), including for color stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chatterjee and Callaway, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shapley, 2019</xref>). Note that in awake primates, the LGN itself does not show visually induced gamma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bastos et al., 2014</xref>; tested with grating stimuli), such that V1 is likely the first stage in the primate visual system generating gamma.</p><p>Earlier work has established in the non-human primate that LGN responses to color stimuli can be well explained by measuring retinal cone absorption spectra and constructing the following cone contrast axes: L+M (capturing luminance), L-M (capturing redness vs. greenness), and S-(L+M) (capturing S-cone activation, which corresponds to violet vs. yellow hues). These axes span a color space referred to as DKL space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Derrington et al., 1984</xref>). This insight can be translated to humans (for recent examples, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Olkkonen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Witzel and Gegenfurtner, 2018</xref>), if one assumes that human LGN responses have a similar dependence on human cone responses. Recordings of human LGN single units to colored stimuli are not available (to our knowledge). Yet, sensitivity spectra of human retinal cones have been determined by a number of approaches, including ex vivo retinal unit recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schnapf et al., 1987</xref>), and psychophysical color matching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stockman and Sharpe, 2000</xref>). These human cone sensitivity spectra, together with the mentioned assumption, allow to determine a DKL space for human observers. To show color stimuli in coordinates that model LGN activation (and thereby V1 input), monitor light emission spectra for colored stimuli can be measured to define the strength of S-, M-, and L-cone excitation they induce. Then, stimuli and stimulus background can be picked from an equiluminance plane in DKL space.</p><p>Because spectral peaks of cone opsin sensitivity show variability over individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Neitz and Jacobs, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Neitz and Neitz, 2011</xref>), recruiting a larger sample than is possible in human patient or macaque studies is necessary to measure the general, population-wide relationship between stimulus color and induced gamma oscillations in the early visual cortex.</p><p>In this study, we recorded MEG in 30 human participants while presenting them with uniform, circular color disks picked from a DKL equiluminance plane on an equiluminant background. Crucially, their cone contrasts on the L-M and the S-(L+M) axes were equalized. We analyzed the MEG recordings at the source level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gross et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Van Veen et al., 1997</xref>) and found that color-induced gamma-band responses localized to early visual cortex with a peak in area V1, confirming that color gamma responses can be studied non-invasively in humans. With colors that had identical luminance and identical color contrast in DKL space, we could not confirm stronger gamma responses for red stimuli. Instead, equiluminant colors with comparable absolute cone contrasts on the L-M axis induced gamma-power responses of equal strength in area V1, independent of their redness. Colors on the S-(L+M) axis induced weaker gamma power, especially for colors strongly activating only the S-cone.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Trial structure, stimuli, and stimulus color coordinates are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and described in detail in Methods. In brief, participants fixated a central fixation spot on a gray background. After a 1.2 s baseline, they were presented with a stimulus disk that was centered on the fixation spot and had a diameter of 10 deg visual angle (dva). The disk was filled either with uniform color (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) or with a luminance grating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). After 0.3–2 s, a change occurred at a random position on the disk, with the shape of a Gaussian blob (3.7 dva diameter). For colored disks, the change was a small decrement in color contrast, for gratings a small decrement in luminance contrast. In both cases, the decrement was continuously QUEST staircased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Watson and Pelli, 1983</xref>) per participant and color/grating to 85% correct detection performance.

When red-green color hues were chosen to equalize cone contrast on the L-M axis (and thereby to ideally equalize input drive), the induced V1 gamma power did not differ between red and green hues. Additionally, pure activation of the S-(L+M) axis induced weaker gamma power, especially for color hues activating primarily the S-cone.</p><p>This curious asymmetry on the S-(L+M) axis could also be seen in smaller amplitudes of early ERF components (N70) in area V1 and in worse color-contrast change-detection performance for high-S (blue) stimuli. Accordingly, across hues, N70 amplitude and gamma power were correlated with color-contrast change-detection performance. The fact that controlling for N70 amplitude and slope strongly diminished the recorded differences in induced gamma power between S+ and S− stimuli supports the idea that the recorded differences in induced gamma power over the S-(L+M) axis might be due to pure S+ stimuli generating weaker input drive to V1 compared to DKL-equicontrast S− stimuli, even when cone contrasts are equalized.</p><p>Concerning off-axis colors (red-blue, green-blue, green-yellow, and red-yellow), we found stronger gamma power and ERF N70 responses to stimuli along the green-yellow/red-blue axis (which has been called lime-magenta in previous studies) compared to stimuli along the red-yellow/green-blue axis (orange-cyan). In human studies varying color contrast along these axes, lime-magenta has also been found to induce stronger fMRI responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Goddard et al., 2010</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lafer-Sousa et al., 2012</xref>), and psychophysical work has proposed a cortical color channel along this axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Danilova and Mollon, 2010</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Witzel and Gegenfurtner, 2013</xref>).</p><p>In our data, the color-induced gamma oscillation clearly localized to early visual cortex, was narrow-banded and showed (for 90% of subjects) a second spectral peak around 80–100 Hz, which did not seem to be a harmonic of the main induced peak and which was rare for grating stimuli. As the induced gamma-power change source-localized as a continuous source over the early visual cortex with a peak in V1, our data cannot differentiate between a strong gamma source in V1 that shows source smearing over neighboring areas and, alternatively, several gamma sources in V1–V4 that show monotonous decreases in power with distance from V1.</p><p>By designing our stimuli to drive the LGN equally, we could test gamma responses of the early visual cortex for color stimuli of approximately equal V1 input strength on the cardinal DKL axes. While most previous studies of gamma responses to colored stimuli were limited to small samples of non-human primates or human patients, recruiting a bigger sample of human participants allowed us to generalize findings of color gamma responses to the population level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fries and Maris, 2022</xref>).</p><p>When comparing our results to previous reports based on intracranial recordings, it is important to note that the MEG signal does not represent a simple average over all population activity underneath the MEG sensor, but is influenced by the location and orientation of the underlying neuronal dipoles and is most sensitive to synchronized neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baillet, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Murakami and Okada, 2006</xref>). Thereby, the total power reported here does not correspond to the total power of all oscillatory neuronal activity in V1. Additionally, activity sources that are of unequal frequency or phase are likely not fully captured in MEG recordings. On the other hand, intracortical recordings will usually not sample all of area V1 equally, but will emphasize the color tuning of neuronal populations close to the electrodes.</p><p>The localization accuracy of source-localized MEG is limited by subject movement, uncertainties in head tracking and source spread. However, with careful head stabilization and exclusion of subjects showing excessive head movements (as practiced here), spatial resolution can be brought down to between 0.45 and 7 mm, depending on dipole location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nasiotis et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, the high similarity between early (source-localized) V1 ERF components recorded here and intracortical V1 ERP components recorded in macaque (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rols et al., 2001</xref>) suggests that our V1-localized activity in MEG captures the underlying intracortical voltage signal in V1.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Gamma responses to colored stimuli</title><p>In several previous studies in non-human and human primates analyzing early visual cortex gamma-band responses to colored stimuli, a red effect, that is stronger induced gamma power for red versus non-red colors, was reported.

In addition, they explored the effects of prestimulus and background adaptation and found that red induced the strongest gamma power only when presented on a gray background, but not when presented on a black background. Presenting a series of different stimulus and background combinations and summarizing results in a self-defined cone adaptation model, they showed that red and green stimuli induce equal gamma power when the background does not adapt M- and L-cones, and that, over all stimulus/background combinations, M-cone-activating backgrounds boost L-cone-stimulus-driven gamma oscillations the strongest.</p><p>In recordings from ECoG electrodes implanted over areas V1–V4 in 10 epilepsy patients, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartoli et al., 2019</xref> found strongest gamma-power responses for full-screen red/orange stimuli following a gray intertrial interval background.

These so-called end-spectral biases were likely at least partially an effect of the respective stimulus presentation and color coordinate systems, insofar as their red and blue colors induced maximal cone contrasts in the L-M pathway – highest L-M excitation for their red stimuli, and highest L excitation for their blue stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mollon, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Valverde Salzmann et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Lower responses for short-wavelength stimuli</title><p>In our data and in a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Peter et al., 2019</xref>), induced gamma power was not equal between equicontrast stimuli on the S-(L+M) axis: Blue stimuli showed no or very weak gamma-power increases. Similarly, we found that change-detection performance was worse and ERF amplitudes were smaller. This asymmetry on the S-(L+M) axis might be driven by underlying physiology: Compared to L- and M-cones, S-cones are sparser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">DeMonasterio et al., 1981</xref>) and show slower light responses, higher noise levels, and higher activation thresholds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baudin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cole et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lee et al., 2009</xref>). Additionally, S-(L+M)-sensitive neurons are sparser than L-M-sensitive ones in the LGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Derrington et al., 1984</xref>) and V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Li et al., 2021</xref>). Within V1, neurons sensitive to S-cone inputs reside in different cortical layers and respond later than other color-sensitive neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cottaris and De Valois, 1998</xref>). Likely, S-cone-induced signals are comparatively weak within LGN and are amplified and transformed in V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">De Valois et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mullen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Xiao, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Contrary to the unified pathway for L-M activation, stimuli high and low on the S-(L+M) axis (S+ and S−) each target different cell populations in the LGN, and different cortical layers within V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chatterjee and Callaway, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">De Valois et al., 2000</xref>), whereby the S+ pathway shows higher LGN neuron and V1 afferent input numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chatterjee and Callaway, 2003</xref>). Other metrics of V1 activation, such as ERPs/ERFs, reveal that these more numerous S+ inputs result in a weaker evoked potential that also shows a longer latency (our data; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nunez et al., 2021</xref>). The origin of this dissociation might lie in different input timing or less cortical amplification, but remains unclear so far. Interestingly, our results suggest that cortical gamma is more closely related to the processes reflected in the ERP/ERF: Stimuli inducing stronger ERF induced stronger gamma; and controlling for ERF-based measures of input drives abolished differences between S+ and S− stimuli in our data.</p><p>The source localization to V1, the dependence on input drive (L-M contrast), and the size dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Peter et al., 2019</xref>) are features that gamma responses induced by L-M input share with gamma responses induced by luminance contrast. This points to common principles in the generation of gamma for both chromatic and achromatic stimuli. Yet, the fact that colored disks as compared to gratings often induced a second, higher-frequency gamma peak suggests differences in underlying circuits and/or dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A potential source of V1 gamma selectivity across color hues</title><p>In sum, color-induced gamma responses in area V1 match LGN-to-V1 input strength in three measured aspects: (1) along the L-M axis, stimuli driving LGN to an equal degree induce gamma oscillations that do not differ measurably in strength across the population; (2) gamma oscillations are strongly diminished for S-cone-driving stimuli, which are encoded by smaller populations of LGN neurons and which provide weaker excitatory input into V1, compared to L-M-cone-driving stimuli; (3) the amplitude of the early, input-driven N70 component is correlated with later induced gamma power over stimuli. Previous reports of high color specificity of V1 gamma oscillations might therefore be explained by a positive relationship between the strength of feedforward input into V1 and the power of V1 gamma oscillations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>A sample size of 30 was chosen based on current standards in the MEG field. Thirty participants were recruited from the general public, 18 of them female. They were between 18 and 36 years old (average: 26 years). As participants were recruited via public advertisements, most of them had not participated in vision-science experiments before. They were screened to be free of metal implants, did not take medication during the study period except for contraceptives, had never been diagnosed with any neurological or psychological disorder, had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and did not show red-green color vision deficiencies. The screening criterion for red-green deficiencies was correct answer to all of a nine-plate subset of the 38-plate Ishihara test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ishihara, 1979</xref>). A further five subjects were recruited but excluded due to equipment malfunctions or excessive movements (&gt;5 mm) during the experiment.

Eye position and pupil size were recorded using an infrared eye tracking system (EyeLink 1000). Before the experiment, participants were trained to minimize saccades and blinks during the baseline and trial periods.</p><p>The 540 total trials of the experiment were split into two blocks, with 240 color (30 per color) and 30 grating trials shown during each block. Between blocks, participants were given a short break of no longer than 5 min. Within each block, the trial order was chosen randomly for each participant.</p><p>A gray background and a dark-gray fixation spot was shown throughout the experiment. Each trial was initiated once the participant fixated the central fixation spot. After a baseline of 1.2 s, the stimulus was shown as a central 10 dva diameter disk with broadly antialiased, smoothed edges. After a per-trial randomly chosen period of 0.3–2 s (randomized, Cauchy distributed with <italic>x</italic><sub>0</sub> = 1.65 s, FWHM = 0.2 s), a to-be-detected local color change (a circular, Gaussian-shaped color step toward the background color, 3.7 dva diameter) was shown at a random position on the stimulus. Participants were instructed to speedily report the left–right position of the target relative to the fixation dot using a button press (left thumb to indicate left, right thumb to indicate right). The relative transparency of the target to the stimulus was QUEST staircased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kleiner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Watson and Pelli, 1983</xref>) for each stimulus condition and participant to 85% correct responses.

Blink, muscle, and SQUID-jump artifacts were detected using a semiautomated artifact detection process.

For other analyses, linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamforming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Van Veen et al., 1997</xref>) was used to generate virtual dipole timecourses for all analyzed dipoles. For both beamformers, the covariance matrix was not regularized (<italic>λ</italic> = 0%), and dipoles were placed at all vertices of both hemispheres of the 32 k HCP-MMP1.0 atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Glasser et al., 2016a</xref>). The atlas was registered to subject-specific T1- and T2-weighted MRI scans (T1: 1 mm<sup>3</sup> MPRAGE with TR = 2530 ms, TE = 2.27 ms; T2: 1 mm<sup>3</sup> TSE with TR = 1500 ms and TE = 356 ms, acquired on a 3T Siemens Magnetom Prisma) using Freesurfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fischl, 2012</xref>) and HCP Workbench (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Glasser et al., 2016b</xref>). Area-specific analyses (e.g., analyses focusing on area V1) averaged results over all dipoles within the specific area of the atlas (1618 dipoles within V1). For the calculation of full spectra, to reduce computational demand, a reduced MMP1.0 atlas subsampled to 6.25% of all 64,000 dipole positions was used, which corresponds to 106 dipoles in area V1. Virtual dipole timecourses were computed by multiplying the sensor-level data with the LCMV filters.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Behavioral, ERF, and spectral analysis</title><p>Per-stimulus change-detection performance was defined as the target-change color contrast the per-stimulus staircase had converged to, averaged over the last 10 presentations of each stimulus.</p><p>To analyze source-localized ERFs, we low-pass filtered the V1 virtual dipole timecourses using an acausal Gaussian filter kernel (−6 dB at 80 Hz), cut them to −0.2 to 0.6 s relative to stimulus onset and <italic>z</italic>-scored them relative to the per-trial baseline. Then, we averaged over all V1 dipoles and trials of the same stimulus type within participants. Because the ERF polarity is dependent on dipole orientation and not consistent throughout V1, we flipped (per participant and dipole, yet identical for all stimuli) virtual dipole ERFs that were positive-going during the N70 component (55- to 95-ms poststimulus onset) before averaging. ERF peak time of the first negative-going (N70) component was defined as the timepoint between 50- and 110-ms poststimulus onset at which the per-participant, per-stimulus average ERF reached its minimum. The slope of this component was taken from the time period 2–12 ms before this peak. Per-trial N70 amplitude was then defined as the average V1 dipole amplitude in a window of ±10 ms around the per-stimulus N70 peak time.</p><p>For spectral analyses, virtual dipole timecourses were cut into baseline (−1.0 to 0 s relative to stimulus onset) and stimulus (0.3 to 1.3 s after stimulus onset) periods. Then, they were segmented into 50% overlapping time epochs of 500 ms (for frequencies ≤20 Hz) or 333 ms length (for frequencies &gt;20 Hz), demeaned and detrended. They were then Hann-tapered (for frequencies ≤20 Hz) or Slepian-window multitapered using three tapers to achieve ±3 Hz smoothing (for frequencies &gt;20 Hz), zero-padded to 1 s and Fourier transformed. Those Fourier spectra were used to obtain source-level power spectra. Spectra of stimulus-induced power change were computed relative to the per-stimulus averaged baseline spectra and then averaged over the selected dipoles. For time–frequency analyses, the same pipeline with epochs centered on each timepoint of the virtual dipole timecourse (sampling rate = 1200 Hz) and zero-padding to 4 s was run. To define per-trial power change values, we extracted the frequency bin centered on the per-participant, per-stimulus gamma-peak frequency.</p><p>To determine per-stimulus, per-participant gamma-peak frequencies, the trial-average spectra of stimulus-induced power change from 15 to 120 Hz were fit with three model alternatives: (1) A first-order polynomial; (2) The sum of a first-order polynomial and a Gaussian; (3) The sum of a first-order polynomial and two Gaussians. Spectral bins were weighted according to their scaled power change, and both Gaussians were set to have a minimum amplitude of 5% and a standard deviation between 1.5 and 10 Hz. For alternative (2), the single Gaussian was set to have a mean above 21; for alternative (3), one Gaussian was set to have a mean above 21 Hz, and the second Gaussian was set to have a mean above 61 Hz. The model giving the highest adjusted <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> was chosen, and gamma-peak frequencies of the found peaks were extracted. If no gamma-peak frequency was found for a given participant–stimulus pair, analyses that required a gamma-peak frequency (DICS beamforming and extracting power at the gamma peak) were computed using the average gamma-peak frequency over stimuli within that participant. These participant–stimulus combinations were excluded from analyses explicitly reporting peak frequency values.</p><p>To correlate per-color average ERFs and induced spectra with each other and with behavioral performance, we averaged per-stimulus V1 ERFs and per-stimulus V1 change spectra over trials within each participant.

in visual cortex of monkeys and humans, particularly red fields. However, prior work has rarely considered the effectiveness of the colored visual stimulus at driving the input to visual cortex.

I would like to see a more precise treatment of ERF and gamma power.

As indicated above, the paper rests on accurate modeling of human LGN recruitment, based in fact on human cone recruitment. However, the exact details of how such matching was obtained were rapidly discussed-this technical detail is much more than just a detail in a study on color matching: I am not against the logic nor do I know of a flaw, but it's the hinge of the paper and is dealt with glancingly.</p><p>A. Some discussion of model limitations.</p><p>B. Why it's valid to assume LGN matching has been achieved using data from the periphery: To buy knowledge, nobody has ever recorded single units in human LGN with these color stimuli…in contrast, the ERF is 'in their hands' and could be directly related (or not) to gamma and to the color matching predictions of their model.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The major strengths of this study are the use of MEG measurements to obtain spatially resolved estimates of gamma rhythms from a large(ish) sample of human participants, during presentation of stimuli that are generally well matched for cone contrast. Responses were obtained using a 10deg diameter uniform field presented in and around the centre of gaze. The authors find that stimuli with equivalent cone contrast in L–M axis generated equivalent gamma – ie. that 'red' (+L–M) stimuli do not generate stronger responses than 'green (–L+M). The MEG measurements are carefully made and participants performed a decrement-detection task away from the centre of gaze (but within the stimulus), allowing measurements of perceptual performance and in addition controlling attention.</p><p>There are a number of additional observations that make clear that the color and contrast of stimuli are important in understanding gamma. Psychophysical performance was worst for stimuli modulated along the +S–(L+M) direction, and these directions also evoked weakest evoked potentials and induced gamma. There also appear to be additional physiological asymmetries along non-cardinal color directions (e.g. Figure 2C, Figure 3E). The asymmetries between non-cardinal stimuli may parallel those seen in other physiological and perceptual studies and could be drawn out (e.g. Danilova and Mollon, Journal of Vision 2010; Goddard et al., Journal of Vision 2010; Lafer-Sousa et al., JOSA 2012). Similarly, the asymmetry between +S and -S modulation is striking and need better explanation within the model (that thalamic input strength predicts gamma strength) given that +S inputs to cortex appear to be, if anything, stronger than –S inputs (e.g. DeValois et al. PNAS 2000).</p><p>My only real concern is that the authors use a precomputed DKL color space for all observers. The problem with this approach is that the isoluminant plane of DKL color space is predicated on a particular balance of L- and M-cones to Vlambda, and individuals can show substantial variability of the angle of the isoluminant plane in DKL space (e.g. He, Cruz and Eskew, Journal of Vision 2020). There is a non-negligible chance that all the responses to colored stimuli may therefore be predicted by projection of the stimuli onto each individual's idiosyncratic Vlambda (that is, the residual luminance contrast in the stimulus). While this would be exhaustive to assess in the MEG measurements, it may be possible to assess perceptually as in the He paper above or by similar methods. Regardless, the authors should consider the implications – this is important because, for example, it may suggest that important of signals from magnocellular pathway, which are thought to be important for Vlambda.</p><p>Please show sign/scale on axes in Figure 2C/D and similar for legibility</p><p>Please report the cone contrast values of the stimuli that were presented</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is an interesting article studying human color perception using MEG. The specific aim was to study differences in color perception related to different S-, M-, and L-cone excitation levels and especially whether red color is perceived differentially to other colors. To my knowledge, this is the first study of its kind and as such very interesting. The methods are excellent, and manuscript is well written as expected this manuscript coming from this lab. However, illustrations of the results is not optimal and could be enhanced.</p><p>The results presented in the manuscript are very interesting, but not presented comprehensively to evaluate the validity of the results. The main results of the manuscript are that the gamma-band responses to stimuli with absolute L-M contrast i.e. green and red stimuli do not differ, but they differ for stimuli on the S-(L+M) (blue vs red-green) axis and gamma-band responses for blue stimuli are smaller. These data are presented in figure 3, but in its current form, these results are not well conveyed by the figure. The main results are illustrated in figures 3BC, which show the average waveforms for grating and for different color stimuli. While there are confidence limits for the gamma-band responses for the grating stimuli, there are no confidence limits for the responses to different color stimuli. Therefore, the main results of the similarities / differences between the responses to different colors can't be evaluated based on the figure and hence confidence limits should be added to these data. It is also not clear from the figure legend, from which time-window data is averaged for the waveforms.</p><p>The time-resolved profile of gamma-power changes are illustrated in Figure 3D. This figure would a perfect place to illustrate the main results. However, of all color stimuli, these TFRs are shown only for the green stimuli, not for the red-green differences nor for blue stimuli for which responses were smaller. Why these TFRs are not showed for all color stimuli and for their differences?</p><p>All main results are now only shown for data averaged over V1. Taken that V4 that is traditionally associated with color processing, the same results could also be shown for this region.</p><p>The authors are in results referring to a second higher gamma peak that was detected in 90% of participants for color but not for grating stimuli. How was the within-subject statistics performed to evaluate the presence of this peak?</p><p>The authors discuss the localization accuracy of source-localized MEG. In addition to rough approximations, the authors could also evaluate the specific source localization accuracy of their method in their specific subject population by using simulated data together with realistic forward and inverse modelling. Taken that V1 as a medial structure might not be well source-modelled, this could give important insight on the factors influencing the results.</p><p>The correlation of the gamma-power but not ERF with behavioral performance is interesting. The authors might want to elaborate and refer to Julku et al., 2021 Sci.

Firstly, we overhauled our ERF analysis to extract per-color ERF shape measures (such as timing and slope), added them as panels A and B in Figure 2—figure supplement 1:</p><p>We have revised the results to report those analyses:</p><p>“The initial ERF slope is sometimes used to estimate feedforward drive. We extracted the per-participant, per-color N70 initial slope and found significant differences over hues (F(4.89, 141.68) = 7.53, p<sub>GG</sub> &lt; 4*10<sup>–6</sup>). Specifically, it was shallower for blue hues compared to all other hues except for green and green-blue (all p<sub>Holm</sub> &lt; 7*10<sup>–4</sup>), while it was not significantly different between all other stimulus hue pairs (all p<sub>Holm</sub> &gt; 0.07, Figure 2—figure supplement 1A), demonstrating that stimulus drive (as estimated by ERF slope) was approximately equalized over all hues but blue.</p><p>The peak time of the N70 component was significantly later for blue stimuli (Mean = 88.6 ms, CI<sub>95%</sub> = [84.9 ms, 92.1 ms]) compared to all (all p<sub>Holm</sub> &lt; 0.02) but yellow, green and green-yellow stimuli, for yellow (Mean = 84.4 ms, CI<sub>95%</sub> = [81.6 ms, 87.6 ms]) compared to red and red-blue stimuli (all p<sub>Holm</sub> &lt; 0.03), and fastest for red stimuli (Mean = 77.9 ms, CI<sub>95%</sub> = [74.5 ms, 81.1 ms]) showing a general pattern of slower N70 peaks for stimuli on the S–(L+M) axis, especially for blue (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B).”</p><p>We also checked if our main findings (equivalence of drive-controlled red and green stimuli, weaker responses for S+ stimuli) are robust when controlled for differences in ERF parameters and added in the Results:</p><p>“To attempt to control for potential remaining differences in input drive that the DKL normalization missed, we regressed out per-participant, per-color, the N70 slope and amplitude from the induced gamma power. Results remained equivalent along the L–M axis: The induced gamma power change residuals were not statistically different between red and green stimuli (Red: 8.22, CI<sub>95%</sub> = [–0.42, 16.85], Green: 12.09, CI<sub>95%</sub> = [5.44, 18.75], t(29) = 1.35, p<sub>Holm</sub> = 1.0, BF<sub>01</sub> = 3.00).</p><p>As we found differences in initial ERF slope especially for blue stimuli, we checked if this was sufficient to explain weaker induced gamma power for blue stimuli. While blue stimuli still showed weaker gamma-power change residuals than yellow stimuli (Blue: –11.23, CI<sub>95%</sub> = [-16.89, –16.89, –5.57], Yellow: -6.35, CI<sub>95%</sub> = [-11.20, –11.20, –1.50]), this difference did not reach significance when regressing out changes in N70 slope and amplitude (t(29) = 1.65, p<sub>Holm</sub> = 0.88). This suggests that lower levels of input drive generated by equicontrast blue versus yellow stimuli might explain the weaker gamma oscillations induced by them.”</p><p>We added accordingly in the Discussion:</p><p>“The fact that controlling for N70 amplitude and slope strongly diminished the recorded differences in induced gamma power between S+ and S- stimuli supports the idea that the recorded differences in induced gamma power over the S-(L+M) axis might be due to pure S+ stimuli generating weaker input drive to V1 compared to DKL-equicontrast S- stimuli, even when cone contrasts are equalized.”</p><p>Additionally, we made the correlation between ERF amplitude and induced gamma power clearer to read by correlating them directly. Accordingly, the relevant paragraph in the results now reads:</p><p>“In addition, there were significant correlations between the N70 ERF component and induced gamma power: The extracted N70 amplitude was correlated across colors with the induced gamma power change within participants with on average r = –0.38 (CI95% = [–0.49, –0.28], p<sub>Wilcoxon</sub> &lt; 4*10<sup>–6</sup>). This correlation was specific to the gamma band and the N70 component: Across colors, there were significant correlation clusters between V1 dipole moment 68-79 ms post-stimulus onset and induced power between 28–54 Hz and 72 Hz (Figure 4C, r<sub>max</sub> = –0.30, p<sub>Tmax</sub> &lt; 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons across time and frequency).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>II.

These axes span a color space referred to as DKL space (Derrington, Krauskopf, and Lennie, 1984). This insight can be translated to humans (for recent examples, see Olkkonen et al., 2008; Witzel and Gegenfurtner, 2018), if one assumes that human LGN responses have a similar dependence on human cone responses. Recordings of human LGN single units to colored stimuli are not available (to our knowledge). Yet, sensitivity spectra of human retinal cones have been determined by a number of approaches, including ex-vivo retinal unit recordings (Schnapf et al., 1987), and psychophysical color matching (Stockman and Sharpe, 2000). These human cone sensitivity spectra, together with the mentioned assumption, allow to determine a DKL space for human observers. To show color stimuli in coordinates that model LGN activation (and thereby V1 input), monitor light emission spectra for colored stimuli can be measured to define the strength of S–, M–, and L-cone excitation they induce. Then, stimuli and stimulus background can be picked from an equiluminance plane in DKL space.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The major strengths of this study are the use of MEG measurements to obtain spatially resolved estimates of gamma rhythms from a large(ish) sample of human participants, during presentation of stimuli that are generally well matched for cone contrast.

In human studies varying color contrast along these axes, lime-magenta has also been found to induce stronger fMRI responses (Goddard et al., 2010; but see Lafer-Sousa et al., 2012), and psychophysical work has proposed a cortical color channel along this axis (Danilova and Mollon, 2010; but see Witzel and Gegenfurtner, 2013).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, the asymmetry between +S and -S modulation is striking and need better explanation within the model (that thalamic input strength predicts gamma strength) given that +S inputs to cortex appear to be, if anything, stronger than -S inputs (e.g. DeValois et al.

Other metrics of V1 activation, such as ERPs/ERFs, reveal that these more numerous S+ inputs result in a weaker evoked potential that also shows a longer latency (our data; Nunez et al., 2021). The origin of this dissociation might lie in different input timing or less cortical amplification, but remains unclear so far. Interestingly, our results suggest that cortical gamma is more closely related to the processes reflected in the ERP/ERF: Stimuli inducing stronger ERF induced stronger gamma; and controlling for ERF-based measures of input drives abolished differences between S+ and S– stimuli in our data.”</p><p>Given that this asymmetry presents a potential exception to the direct association between LGN drive and V1 gamma power, we have toned down claims of a direct input drive to gamma power relationship in the Title and text and have refocused instead on L–M contrast.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>My only real concern is that the authors use a precomputed DKL color space for all observers.

Our perceptual results are consistent with that: We had determined the color-contrast change-detection threshold per color; We used the inverse of this threshold as a metric of color change-detection performance; The ratio of this performance metric between red and green (L divided by M) had an average value of 1.48, with substantial variability over subjects (CI95% = [1.33, 1.66]).</p><p>If such variability also affected the neuronal ERF and gamma power measures reported here, L/M-ratios in color-contrast change-detection thresholds should be correlated across subjects with L/M-ratios in ERF amplitude and induced gamma power.

A comparison of Figure 3C with Figure 3B shows that the shape of non-aligned average spectra is strongly affected by inter-subject peak-frequency variability and thereby hard to interpret.

This revealed that overall color-induced gamma is much weaker in V4 than V1. This spatial pattern might be consistent with one prominent source in V1 whose source-projected power is partially smeared over early visual areas. This precludes a meaningful analysis of V4-projected data and a fair comparison between V4 and V1 in terms of color differences. We agree with the reviewer that the prominent role of V4 in the color literature requires a discussion of this point, and we have therefore added the following to our Discussion section:</p><p>“In our data, the color-induced gamma oscillation clearly localized to early visual cortex, was narrow-banded and showed (for 90% of subjects) a second spectral peak around 80-100 Hz, which did not seem to be a harmonic of the main induced peak and which was rare for grating stimuli. As the induced gamma-power change source-localized as a continuous source over the early visual cortex with a peak in V1, our data cannot differentiate between a strong gamma source in V1 that shows source smearing over neighboring areas and, alternatively, several gamma sources in V1-V4 that show monotonous decreases in power with distance from V1.”</p><p>However, our finding of stronger color gamma responses in V1 versus V4 were mirrored in a macaque study, and we have added in the Discussion to point out this fact:</p><p>“In an initial report on recordings in anesthetized macaque V1 and V4, Rols et al., (2001) first described stronger gamma power for a red stimulus compared to a green and a yellow one (<italic>heteroluminant</italic>, all presented on a gray background).

Previous work from our lab has shown high levels of similarity in findings from macaque V1-V4 recordings and MEG recordings source-localized to the same areas (Bastos et al., 2015; Michalareas et al., 2016; Peter et al., 2021; Stauch et al., 2021). Additionally, both our ERF and gamma power responses to colored stimuli agree well with previous reports in intracranial macaque recordings (Peter et al., 2019; Rols et al., 2001). Thirdly, V1 has been found to be well picked up as a gamma source and as a source of visually induced signals in other MEG (Duecker et al., 2021; Hall et al., 2005; Hoogenboom et al., 2006; Nasiotis et al., 2017) and EEG studies (Butler et al., 2019).</p><p>As source localization was computed (and dipole orientation was fixed) over all stimulus condition, it could not explain our results concerning differences between different stimuli.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The correlation of the gamma-power but not ERF with behavioral performance is interesting.

Higher change detection performance was also correlated with stronger induced V1 power across colors, for several gamma frequency ranges (Figure 4B; at 34–37 Hz: r<sub>max</sub> = –0.27, all p<sub>Tmax</sub> &lt;= 0.03; at 39–40 Hz: r<sub>max</sub> = –0.23, all p<sub>Tmax</sub> &lt; 0.04; at 44–53 Hz: r<sub>max</sub> = –0.31, all p<sub>Tmax</sub> &lt;= 0.03, corrected for multiple comparisons across frequency).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
