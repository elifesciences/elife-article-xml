changes in neuronal excitability and activity within the peri-infarct cortex of mice remains poorly defined. Most of the available data have been acquired from anesthetized animals, acute tissue slices, or infer changes in excitability from immunoassays on extracted tissue, and thus may not reflect cortical activity dynamics in the intact cortex of an awake animal. Here, in vivo two-photon calcium imaging in awake, behaving mice was used to longitudinally track cortical activity, network functional connectivity, and neural assembly architecture for 2 months following photothrombotic stroke targeting the forelimb somatosensory cortex. Sensorimotor recovery was tracked over the weeks following stroke, allowing us to relate network changes to behavior. Our data revealed spatially restricted but long-lasting alterations in somatosensory neural network function and connectivity. Specifically, we demonstrate significant and long-lasting disruptions in neural assembly architecture concurrent with a deficit in functional connectivity between individual neurons. Reductions in neuronal spiking in peri-infarct cortex were transient but predictive of impairment in skilled locomotion measured in the tapered beam task. Notably, altered neural networks were highly localized, with assembly architecture and neural connectivity relatively unaltered a short distance from the peri-infarct cortex, even in regions within ‘remapped’ forelimb functional representations identified using mesoscale imaging with anaesthetized preparations 8 weeks after stroke. Thus, using longitudinal two-photon microscopy in awake animals, these data show a complex spatiotemporal relationship between peri-infarct neuronal network function and behavioral recovery. Moreover, the data highlight an apparent disconnect between dramatic functional remapping identified using strong sensory stimulation in anaesthetized mice compared to more subtle and spatially restricted changes in individual neuron and local network function in awake mice during stroke recovery.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>stroke</kwd><kwd>photothrombosis</kwd><kwd>calcium imaging</kwd><kwd>GCaMP</kwd><kwd>somatosensory cortex</kwd><kwd>neural assemblies</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN-2023-04969</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Winship</surname><given-names>Ian Robert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PS 166144</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Winship</surname><given-names>Ian Robert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Longitudinal calcium imaging in awake mice after stroke suggests impairments in neuronal activity, functional connectivity, and neural assembly architecture is transient and limited to cortex immediately adjacent to the stroke.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Investigations of the excitability of neurons in the peri-infarct cortex during recovery from ischemic stroke have yielded a complex and at times contradictory data set.

It further reduces the potential contribution of corollary discharge and reafference due to voluntary action in modulating sensory input and cortical responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Crapse and Sommer, 2008</xref>).

Together, these studies point to a complex, interconnected system that modulates the activity of somatosensory networks in the awake behaving animal that is either not present, or is altered, in studies of evoked cortical activity under the anesthetized state. While monitoring cortical activity in awake mobile animals presents methodological complexity, it avoids confounds associated with the anesthetized state and provides unique insight into evolving patterns of network activity that may be unique to the awake state.</p><p>To investigate neural activity patterns during stroke recovery while avoiding the potential confounds of anesthesia, the present work used two photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging within and distal to the peri-infarct region of a focal photothrombotic stroke lesioning the FL primary somatosensory cortex in mice. We used awake, behaving but head-fixed mice in a mobile homecage to longitudinally measure cortical activity, then used computational methods to assess functional connectivity and neural assembly architecture at baseline and each week for 2 months following stroke. Behavioral recovery from stroke was measured in the same animals on a tapered beam task and string pull task to determine the time course of sensorimotor deficits related to changes in cortical activity and network architecture. Our goal was to use longitudinal imaging and advanced computational analyses to define network changes in somatosensory cortex associated with sensorimotor recovery. We show that despite disturbances to the widefield topology and amplitude of the sensory-evoked FL map (acquired under anesthetic), it is only within the immediate peri-infarct region after FL targeted stroke that neural activity, functional connectivity, and neural assembly architecture are disrupted. We demonstrate that the peri-infarct somatosensory cortex displays a marked reduction in neural assembly number, an increase in neural assembly membership, and persistent alterations in assembly-assembly correlations, and that this occurs alongside transient deficits in both functional connectivity and neural activity. Notably, we show that reduced neuronal spiking is strongly correlated with a deficit in motor performance on the tapered beam task. Surprisingly, we also show that significant alterations in neuronal activity (firing rate), functional connectivity, and neural assembly architecture are absent within more distal regions of cortex as little as 750 µm from the stroke border, even in areas identified by regional functional imaging (under anaesthesia) as ‘remapped’ locations of sensory-evoked FL activity 8 weeks post-stroke.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The experimental timeline is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. Adult Thy1-GCaMP6S mice were implanted with chronic cranial windows and habituated on the floating homecage, tapered beam and string pull task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). The cFL and cHL somatosensory areas were mapped on the cortex using widefield Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging of sensory-evoked activity in isoflurane anaesthetized mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>, see methods). Regions of interest for longitudinal awake two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging of cellular activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) were chosen based on these pre-stroke widefield Ca<sup>2+</sup> limb maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The first imaging region of interest was located at the boundary of the pre-stroke cFL and cHL somatosensory maps (termed ‘peri-infarct’ region based on its proximal location to the photothrombotic infarct after stroke) and the second region as lateral to the pre-stroke cHL map (termed ‘distal’ region due to its distance from the stroke boundary). These regions were imaged at baseline, and each week following photothrombotic stroke. Notably, these regions of interest incorporated the predicted areas of remapping for the limb associated somatosensory representations after focal cFL cortex stroke based on previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Winship and Murphy, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Winship and Murphy, 2009</xref>). Photothrombosis was directed to the cFL somatosensory representation as identified by regional imaging. Resulting infarcts lesioned this region, and borders were delineated by a region of decreased light absorption 1 week post-stroke (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, Top). Within the peri-infarct imaging region, cellular dysmorphia and swelling was visually apparent in some cells during two-photon imaging 1 week after stroke, but recovered over the 2-month post-stroke imaging timeframe (data not shown). These gross morphological changes were not visually apparent in the more distal imaging region lateral to the cHL.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental timeline and methods.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Timeline of experimental procedures, imaging times, and behavioral tests.

There was no statistical change in the average size of cFL evoked representation 8 weeks after stroke (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), but a significant posterior shift of the supra-threshold cFL map was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Unmasking of previously sub-threshold cFL responsive cortex in areas posterior to the original cFL map at 8 weeks post-stroke could contribute to this apparent remapping. However, the amplitude of the cFL evoked widefield Ca<sup>2+</sup> response in this distal region at 8 weeks post-stroke remains reduced relative to pre-stroke activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Previous studies suggest strong inhibition of cFL evoked activity during the first weeks after photothrombosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Winship and Murphy, 2008</xref>). Without longitudinal measurement in this study to quantify this reduced activation prior to 8 weeks post-stroke, we cannot differentiate potential remapping due to unmasking of the cFL representation that enhances the cFL-evoked widefield Ca<sup>2+</sup> response from apparent remapping that simply reflects changes in the signal-to-noise ratio used to define the functional representations. There were no group differences between stroke and sham groups in cHL evoked intensity, area, or map position (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Impaired performance on tapered beam but not string pull after focal somatosensory stroke</title><p>Post-stroke sensorimotor impairment was measured on the tapered beam task and string pull task.

To define functional connectivity in local neural networks within the peri-infarct somatosensory cortex, we plotted the functional connectivity of the neural population in terms of the strength of their cell-cell correlations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and quantified the properties of these connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We observed a significant loss of functional connectivity 1 week after stroke within the peri-infarct region.

Within the peri-infarct region, we observed a statistical trend of a main effect of time in the average number of ‘significant’ functional connections per neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; see Materials and methods). Post hoc comparisons confirmed a significantly reduced average number of significant connections per neuron at 1 week post-stroke compared to pre-stroke and to 1 week sham. We observed a significant main effect of time on the average number of strong connections (<italic>r</italic>&gt;.3) per neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Post hoc comparisons confirmed strong connections were significantly reduced 1 week post-stroke relative to pre-stroke. In the distal region, no main effects or interaction was identified in the average number of significant connections per neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), highlighting regionally specific connectivity changes in individual neurons after stroke.

Consistent with previous studies using intrinsic optical signal imaging, mesoscale imaging of regional calcium responses (reflecting bulk neuronal spiking in that region) showed that targeted stroke to the cFL somatosensory area disrupts the sensory-evoked forelimb representation in the infarcted region. Consistent with previous studies, this functional representation exhibited a posterior shift 8 weeks after injury, with activation in a region lateral to the cHL representation. Notably, sensory-evoked cFL representations exhibited reduced amplitudes of activity relative to pre-stroke activation measured in the cFL representation and in the region lateral the cHL representation. Longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging in awake animals was used to probe single neuron and local network changes adjacent the infarct and in a distal region that corresponded to the shifted region of cFL activation. This imaging revealed a decrease in firing rate at 1 week post-stroke in the peri-infarct region that was significantly negatively correlated with the number of errors made with the stroke-affected limbs on the tapered beam task. Peri-infarct cortical networks also exhibited a reduction in the number of functional connections per neuron and a sustained disruption in neural assembly structure, including a reduction in the number of assemblies and an increased recruitment of neurons into functional assemblies. Elevated correlation between assemblies within the peri-infarct region peaked 1 week after stroke and was sustained throughout recovery. Surprisingly, distal networks, even in the region associated with the shifted cFL functional map in anaesthetized preparations, were largely undisturbed.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Cortical plasticity after stroke</title><p>Plasticity within and between cortical regions contributes to partial recovery of function and is proportional to both the extent of damage, as well as the form and quantity of rehabilitative therapy post-stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Murphy and Corbett, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Xu et al., 2009</xref>). A critical period of highest plasticity begins shortly after the onset of stroke, is greatest during the first few weeks, and progressively diminishes over the weeks to months after stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Brown et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Biernaskie et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Brown et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Carmichael et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Cheatwood et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Ploughman et al., 2009</xref>). Functional recovery after stroke is thought to depend largely on the adaptive plasticity of surviving neurons that reinforce existing connections and/or replace the function of lost networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Winship and Murphy, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Winship and Murphy, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Carmichael, 2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Carmichael, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Dancause et al., 2005</xref>). This neuronal plasticity is believed to lead to topographical shifts in somatosensory functional maps to adjacent areas of the cortex. The driver for this process has largely been ascribed to a complex cascade of intra- and extra-cellular signaling that ultimately leads to plastic re-organization of the microarchitecture and function of surviving peri-infarct tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Winship and Murphy, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Murphy and Corbett, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Carmichael et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Carmichael, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Carmichael, 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Li and Carmichael, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Li et al., 2010</xref>). Likewise, structural and functional remodeling has previously been found to be dependent on the distance from the stroke core, with closer tissue undergoing greater re-organization than more distant tissue (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Winship and Murphy, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Previous research examining the region at the border between the cFL and cHL somatosensory maps has shown this region to be a primary site for functional remapping after cFL directed photothrombotic stroke, resulting in a region of cFL and cHL map functional overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Winship and Murphy, 2008</xref>). Within this overlapping area, neurons have been shown to lose limb selectivity 1 month post-stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Winship and Murphy, 2008</xref>). This is followed by the acquisition of more selective responses 2 months post-stroke and is associated with reduced regional overlap between cFL and cHL functional maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Winship and Murphy, 2008</xref>). Notably, this functional plasticity at the cellular level was assessed using strong vibrotactile stimulation of the limbs in anaesthetized animals. Our findings using longitudinal imaging in awake animals show an initial reduction in firing rate at 1 week post-stroke within the peri-infarct region that was predictive of functional impairment in the tapered beam task. This transient reduction may be associated with reduced or dysfunctional thalamic connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Paz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Staines et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Thomas Carmichael et al., 2001</xref>) and reduced transmission of signals from hypo-excitable thalamo-cortical projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Tennant et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, the strong negative correlation we observed between firing rate of the neural population within the peri-infarct cortex and the number of errors on the affected side, as well as the rapid recovery of firing rate and tapered beam performance, suggests that neuronal activity within the peri-infarct region contributes to the impairment and recovery. The common timescale of neuronal and functional recovery also coincides with angiogenesis and re-establishment of vascular support for peri-infarct tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Brown et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Brown and Murphy, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ergul et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Greenberg, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Hatakeyama et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with previous research using mechanical limb stimulation under anaesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Winship and Murphy, 2008</xref>), we show that at the 8-week timepoint after cFL photothrombotic stroke the cFL representation is shifted posterior from its pre-stroke location into the area lateral to the cHL map. Notably, our distal region for awake imaging was directly within this 8-week post-stroke cFL representation. Despite our prediction that this distal area would be a hotspot for plastic changes, there was no detectable alteration to the level of population correlation, functional connectivity, assembly architecture or assembly activations after stroke. Moreover, we found little change in the firing rate in either moving or resting states in this region. Contrary to our results, somatosensory-evoked activity assessed by two photon calcium imaging in anesthetized animals has demonstrated an increase in cFL responsive neurons within a region lateral to the cHL representation 1–2 months after focal cFL stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Winship and Murphy, 2008</xref>). Notably, this previous study measured sensory-evoked single cell activity using strong vibrotactile (1 s 100 Hz) limb stimulation under aneasthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Winship and Murphy, 2008</xref>). This frequency of limb stimulation has been shown to elicit near maximal neuronal responses within the limb-associated somatosensory cortex under anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bandet et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, strong stimulation and anaesthesia may have unmasked non-physiological activity in neurons in the distal region that is not apparent during more naturalistic activation during awake locomotion or rest. Regional mapping defined using strong stimulation in anesthetized animals may therefore overestimate plasticity at the cellular level.</p><p>Our results suggest a limited spatial distance over which the peri-infarct somatosensory cortex displays significant network functional deficits during movement and rest. Our results are consistent with a spatial gradient of plasticity mediating factors that are generally enhanced with closer proximity to the infarct core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Carmichael et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Carmichael, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Carmichael, 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Li and Carmichael, 2006</xref>). However, our analysis outside peri-infarct cortex is limited to a single distal area caudal to the pre-stroke cFL representation. Although somatosensory maps in the present study were defined by a statistical criterion for delineating highly responsive cortical regions from those with weak responses, the distal area in this study may have been a site of activity that did not meet the statistical criterion for inclusion in the baseline map. The lack of detectable changes in population correlations, functional connectivity, assembly architecture and assembly activations in the distal region may reflect minimal pressure for plastic change as networks in regions below the threshold for regional map inclusion prior to stroke may still be functional in the distal cortex. Thus, threshold-based assessment of remapping may further overestimate the neuroplasticity underlying functional reorganization suggested by anaesthetized preparations with strong stimulation. Future studies could examine distal areas medial and anterior to the cFL somatosensory area, such as the motor and pre-motor cortex, to further define the effect of FL targeted stroke on neuroplasticity within other functionally relevant regions. Moreover, the restriction of these network changes to peri-infarct cortex could also reflect the small penumbra associated with photothrombotic stroke, and future studies could make use of stroke models with larger penumbral regions, such as the middle cerebral artery occlusion model. Larger injuries induce more sustained sensorimotor impairment, and the relationship between neuronal firing, connectivity, and neuronal assemblies could be further probed relative to recovery or sustained impairment in these models. Recent research also indicates that stroke causes distinct patterns of disruption to the network topology of excitatory and inhibitory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Latifi et al., 2020</xref>), and that stroke can disproportionately disrupt the function of high activity compared to low activity neurons in specific neuron sub-types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Motaharinia et al., 2021</xref>). Mouse models with genetically labeled neuronal sub-types (including different classes of inhibitory interneurons) could be used to track the function of those populations over time in awake animals. A potential limitation of our data is the undefined effect of age and sex on cortical dynamics in this cohort of mice (with ages ranging from 3 to 9 months) after stroke. Aging can impair neurovascular coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Zaletel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akif Topcuoglu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Stefanova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Fabiani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Sorond et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Park et al., 2007</xref>) and reduce ischemic tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Menon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Faber et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Strandgaard, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ay et al., 2005</xref>), and greater investigation of cortical activity changes after stroke in aged animals would more effectively model stroke in humans. Future research could replicate this study with mice in middle-age and aged mice (e.g. 9 months and 18+months of age), and with sufficient quantities of both sexes, to better examine age and sex effects on measures of cortical function.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Altered network connectivity after stroke</title><p>A highly distributed network of neural circuits forms the basis of information flow in the mammalian brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Bullmore and Sporns, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Sporns, 2011</xref>). Many disease states are thought to result in disturbances in neural dynamics and connectivity of these networks due to a process of randomization that affects the network nodes and connections, leading to degraded functional performance of the networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Sporns, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Stam, 2014</xref>). Most studies looking at the functional connectivity of cortical networks after stroke have focused on connectivity between cortical regions and few have looked at functional connectivity within neural populations at the single neuron level within a region of cortex. Our finding of decreased number of functional connections per neuron in the peri-infarct somatosensory cortex are consistent with recent research that demonstrated a decrease in the total number of functional connections for both inhibitory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Latifi et al., 2020</xref>) and excitatory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Latifi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bechay et al., 2022</xref>) in the motor and premotor cortex approximately 1 week after focal sensorimotor stroke. Reductions in strong functional connections between neurons in our experiments peaked 1 week after stroke, with only partial recovery over the next 7 weeks. These changes were restricted to peri-infarct cortex and were not observed in distal regions. As the cumulative total number of functional connections within a neural network is dependent on the number of cells measured from the population, it is possible that a decrease in the number of connections at early timepoints in both studies may either reflect a loss of neurons and/or the functional silencing of neurons within the imaged areas. Contrary to the findings from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bechay et al., 2022</xref>, connection density (as % of max possible connections) did not decrease in either the peri-infarct somatosensory cortex or distal somatosensory cortex after stroke in our study. Thus, we observed a significant reduction in the number of strong functional connections between neurons, but not a reduction in the density of connections. It is notable that the peak deficit in peri-infarct functional connectivity in our study occurs simultaneously with reduced neuronal firing and sensorimotor impairment. Early disruption has been reported in anaesthetized animals, and our data in awake animals demonstrates that early network changes may be a key contributor to dysfunction, and a restoration of spiking in peri-infarct regions is related to recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Brown et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Lim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Sigler et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Sweetnam and Brown, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Sweetnam et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Winship and Murphy, 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Altered network dynamics after stroke</title><p>According to the cell assembly hypothesis, transient synchronous activation of distributed groups of neurons organize into “neural assemblies” that underly the representation of both external and internal stimuli in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Buzsáki, 2010</xref>).

Indeed, the similarity between spontaneous assemblies and sensory evoked assemblies tends to increase during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Berkes et al., 2011</xref>), potentially illustrating the ‘sculpting’ of neural circuits towards commonly encountered sensory stimuli. To date, however, no study has examined changes to the architecture of neural assemblies on the level of single cells within neural networks of the somatosensory cortex in the post-stroke brain. Our data shows a transient decrease in the number of assemblies and an increase in the number of neurons per assembly for the peri-infarct cortex after stroke. If assemblies within peri-infarct somatosensory cortex contribute to differential processing of distinct elements of sensory experience, a loss in the number of assemblies may contribute to a loss in sensory range, as is observed in human stroke patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Carey and Matyas, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Connell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Kwakkel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Patel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Tyson et al., 2008</xref>). Although there have been calculations on the typical size of cell assemblies in several regions of the brain as a percentage of the network population (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Buzsáki, 2010</xref>), whether there is an optimal number of assemblies or optimal membership size of a neural assembly for a particular neural population is currently unknown. It is possible that a decrease in the number of assemblies and an increase in the membership of neurons in remaining assemblies may signify inefficient or ineffective forms of sensory processing. Likewise, it has been shown that electrical stimulation of single somatosensory neurons is sufficient to bias animal behavior towards a desired behavioral response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brecht et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Houweling and Brecht, 2008</xref>), thereby suggesting that a sparse neural code may be sufficient for sensation. It has also been argued that minimizing correlation within the neural population serves to reduce representational redundancy and improves representational efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Simoncelli and Olshausen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barlow, 2001</xref>), thereby suggesting that fewer assemblies, with each containing more members, may be an inefficient form of representational coding for sensory information. Furthermore, we observed a persistent increase in the correlation between the activations of assemblies in the peri-infarct cortex that peaks 1 week post-stroke. Co-activation of multiple assemblies simultaneously may decrease the signal-to-noise ratio of the representational information that each specific assembly holds. It may further reduce efficient information transfer within and between cortical networks, and may relate to prolonged modes of somatosensory activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Brown et al., 2009</xref>) and reduced fidelity in response to sensory stimuli observed in mouse models of focal FL stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Sweetnam and Brown, 2013</xref>).</p><p>In summary, this work demonstrates that the peri-infarct region near to the stroke core displays decreased neuronal activity 1 week after stroke that is predictive of poor performance on the tapered beam task. Moreover, local neuronal networks immediately adjacent the stroke exhibited reductions in functional connectivity and sustained alterations in the structure of neuronal assemblies, suggesting that focal injury leads to long lasting alterations in functional properties in local neuronal networks. Interestingly, altered connectivity and neuronal assembly structure was not detected in more distal cortical regions despite these regions being located within regions of cortex that appear to undergo functional remapping measured by cortical activation in response to vibrotactile limb stimulation in anaesthetized animals. The persistence of these distal networks during recovery highlights the importance of awake imaging and naturalistic stimuli to fully define functional network changes during recovery from nervous system injury.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Three to nine month old Thy1-GCaMP6S mice (Jackson Labs GP4.3, Strain #024275), N=16 stroke (average age: 5.4 months; 13 male, 3 female), and 5 sham (average age: 6 months; 3 male, 2 female), were used in this study.

Animals were excluded at the 2 week post-implantation timepoint if their cranial window became cloudy or non-imageable.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Tapered beam task habituation, testing and analysis</title><p>Methods for tapered beam habituation and automated recording and analysis have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ardesch et al., 2017</xref>), with minor modification as follows. Nesting material from the homecage was placed inside of a dark box at the narrow end of the beam to motivate animals to cross the beam. For the first three sessions, mice were placed at the wide end of the beam and allowed to freely explore the beam for a period of 2 min, after which the experimenter placed a sheet of paper behind the animal as it crossed the beam to block its return path to the wide end and motivate it to cross to the narrow end with dark box. Once the mouse had reached the dark box with bedding material at the narrow end, they were given 60 s within the dark box to associate crossing the beam with reaching the safety of the dark box. The dark box was transported to their respective cage for the animal to further associate reaching the dark box with a safe transition to their cage. On subsequent days, mice were continuously run through the tapered beam for a period of 2 min each, with a return to their cage after each crossing. On each of the 3 days prior to the first Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging session, mice were tested with three crossings of the beam per day to determine baseline crossing performance. Left and right-side slips were captured automatically by Raspberry Pi computer attached to touch sensors on the tapered beam, and Python scripts run to determine number of slips for each side and distance to first slip. Performance on the 9 baseline trials were average to determine a singular average baseline performance level. Mice were tested with three trials on each day prior to each weekly post- imaging timepoint to measure changes in performance.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>String pull task habituation, testing and analysis</title><p>Methods for string pull habituation and testing have previously been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Blackwell et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Inayat et al., 2020</xref>), with modification as follows. For habituation, mice were individually placed in a transparent rectangular cage without bedding and allowed to freely explore for a period of 5 min. Twenty strings with variable length were hung over the edge of the cage. Half of the strings were baited with chocolate flavored sucrose pellets. Mice were removed from the apparatus once all of the strings had been pulled into the cage, or once 20 min had elapsed. On subsequent days 2 and 3, mice were again placed in the cage with 20 strings to pull. Following this 3 day habituation, from days 4 to 14 mice were habituated in an alternate transparent string pull box with high sides and transparent front face for video recording. Within this second habituation box, mice received three trials with baited strings hung facing the recording camera. The session was terminated when the animal had pulled all three strings or once 20 min had elapsed, and the apparatus prepared for the next mouse. On the last day prior to the first Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging session, three trials of string pull from each mouse were recorded with the use of a GoPro Hero 7 Black (60 fps, 1920×1080 pixels). Mice were re-tested with this same three-string protocol the day prior to each of their weekly imaging timepoints. Video recordings were analyzed using a semi-automated Matlab string pull package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Inayat et al., 2020</xref>). Reach and withdraw movement scaling for the left and right paw was calculated by running a Pearson’s correlation between the series of Euclidian distances that the paw travelled during each of the reach or withdraw movements during the string pull and correlating with the peak speed of the paw during each of the respective reaches or withdraws (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Blackwell et al., 2018b</xref>). A value of 1 indicates a strong linear relationship between longer reach/withdraw paw movement distance and greater peak speed that the paw obtained. Paw reach distance was calculated as the average distance that the paw travelled during each reach movement. Path circuity is used as a measure of how direct of a path a reach or withdraw movement takes between its starting and end points and is calculated as the total distance travelled divided by the Euclidian distance between the start and end points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Blackwell et al., 2018b</xref>). The greater the path circuity value is above 1, the more the path of the paw deviated from the ideal direct path between the start and end points of the reach/withdraw. A bimanual correlation coefficient was calculated by first detrending the timeseries of Y-axis paw position to remove general changes in the posture of the animal over the course of the string pull attempt, then running a Pearson’s correlation between the Y-axis paw position measurements for the right and left paw.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Mobile floating homecage habituation and measurement of movement parameters</title><p>Methods for floating homecage (Neurotar, Finland) habituation have previously been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Kislin et al., 2014</xref>), with modification as follows. Two weeks after cranial window implantation, each mouse was handled for 5 min three times per day for the first 2 days to habituate them to handling. For days 3–4, each mouse was handled and repeatedly wrapped and released with a soft cloth for a period of 5 min three times per day in order to habituate to the wrapping procedure. Mice were also given 1 period of 5 min each per day to freely explore the floating homecage without being head-restrained. For days 5–8, twice per day the animals were head-restrained in the floating homecage and allowed to move around the floating homecage for a period of 15 min with the room lights off before being returned to their cage. For days 8–14, twice per day the mice were head-restrained in the floating homecage for 25 min with the floating homecage attached to the microscope in the same conditions in which the animals would be imaged on day 15 onwards. On day 14 (one day prior to their first imaging session) baseline performance on the string pull and tapered beam tasks was measured prior to their last habituation in the floating homecage. Animal movement within the homecage during each Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging sessions was tracked to determine animal speed and position. Movement periods were manually annotated on a subset of timeseries by co-recording animal movement using both the Mobile Homecage tracker, as well as a webcam (Logitech C270) with infrared filter removed. Movement tracking data was low pass filtered to remove spurious movement artifacts lasting below 6 recording frames (240ms). Based on annotated times of animal movement from the webcam recordings and Homecage tracking, a threshold of 30 mm/s from the tracking data was determined as frames of animal movement, whereas speeds below 30 mm/s were taken as periods of rest.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Identification of forelimb and hindlimb somatosensory cortex representations using widefield Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging of sensory-evoked responses</title><p>On day 10 of habituation, mice were anesthetized with 1.25% isofluorane after they had completed all daily task training and floating homecage habituation. Mice were head-fixed on a stereotaxic frame with continuous isofluorane anesthesia. Body temperature was measured using a rectal probe and maintained at 37 ± 0.5°C. The cortical surface was illuminated with blue light from a xenon lamp (excitation band-pass filtered at 450–490 nm). Fluorescent emissions were long-pass filtered at 515 nm and captured in 12-bit format by a Dalsa Pantera 1M60 camera mounted on a Leica SP5 confocal microscope using a 2.5 X objective. The depth of focus was set at 200 μm below the cortical surface. Custom-made piezoceramic mechanical bending actuators were used to elicit oscillatory limb stimulation during widefield Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging. The piezo bending actuators comprised a piezo element (Piezo Systems # Q220-A4-203YB) attached to an electrically insulated metal shaft holding a metal U-bend at its end. The palm of the mouse paw was placed within the U-bend, and the U-bend bent to shape to lightly secure the palm. The metal U-bend made contact across a vertical rectangular area of approximately 3x1 mm on the palmar and dorsal surface of the hand. Stimulators were driven with square-wave signals from an A-M Systems Model 2100 Isolated Pulse Stimulator. Stimulation alternated between contralateral forelimb (cFL) and contralateral hindlimb (cHL) for up to 40 trials of stimulation of each limb. Placement of actuators was on the glabrous skin of the forepaw or hindpaw, with consistent alignment relative to the flexion of wrist and ankle. Images were captured for 5.0 s at 10 Hz (1 s before and 4 s after stimulus onset; interstimulus interval = 20 s). The trials for each limb were averaged in ImageJ software (NIH). 10 imaging frames (1 s) after stimulus onset were averaged and divided by the 10 baseline frames 1 s before stimulus onset to generate a response map for each limb. Response maps were thresholded at 5 times the standard deviation of the baseline period deltaFoF to determine limb associated response maps. These were merged and overlaid on an image of surface vasculature to delineate the cFL and cHL somatosensory representations and were also used to determine peak Ca<sup>2+</sup> response amplitude from the timeseries recordings. For cFL stimulation trials, an additional ROI was placed over the region lateral to the cHL representation (denoted as ‘distal region’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) to measure the distal region cFL evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> response amplitude pre- and post-stroke. The dimensions and position of the distal ROI was held consistent relative to surface vasculature for each animal from pre- to post-stroke.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Calcium imaging</title><p>On the day following testing for behavioral performance on the string pull and tapered beam tasks, animals were head-fixed within the mobile homecage and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging was performed. Awake in-vivo two-photon imaging was performed using a Leica SP5 MP confocal microscope equipped with a Ti:Sapphire Coherent Chameleon Vision II laser tuned to 940 nm for GCaMP6S excitation. A Leica HCX PL APO L 20x1.0 NA water immersion objective was used. Images were acquired using Leica LAS AF using no averaging, a zoom of 1.7 x and a frame-rate of 25 Hz. Images were acquired at 512x512 pixels over an area of 434x434 μm, yielding a resolution of 0.848 μm per pixel. Two imaging regions were chosen for each animal, with one corresponding to the half-way point between the pre-stroke cFL and cHL somatosensory maps previously determined with widefield Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging (the ‘peri-infarct’ imaging region), and the other an imaging region located just lateral to the cHL sensory map (the ‘distal’ imaging region). These regions can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. Each imaging region was recorded for 15 minutes while simultaneously tracking the animal’s movement and position within the mobile homecage. Imaging depth was set between 100–180 μm below the cortical surface. There were no differences between the stroke group and sham group for movement within the mobile homecage, though both groups displayed an equivalent decrease in the amount of time they spent moving within the 15-min recording sessions over the course of the 8-week experimental timeline, potentially reflecting continuing habituation over this period.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Photothrombotic stroke and sham procedure</title><p>After baseline cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, mice were anesthetized using 1.25% isofluorane and head-fixed on a stereotaxic frame with continuous isofluorane anesthesia. Body temperature was measured using a rectal probe and maintained at 37 ± 0.5°C. The mapped cFL area was used as a guide for a targeted photothrombosis procedure. Briefly, a 2 mm diameter hole was punched in black electrical tape and attached onto the glass window to block stray light from illuminating cortical areas outside of the desired region. Rose Bengal (a photosensitive dye) was dissolved in 0.01 M sterile phosphate buffered saline (Sigma) and injected intraperitoneal (30 mg/kg). The cFL cortical area visible through the punched electrical tape was illuminated using a collimated beam of green laser light (532 nm, 17 mW) for 20 min to photoactivate the Rose Bengal and cause a focal ischemic lesion. Sham controls were treated in the same manner as stroke, however illumination of the laser was omitted.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Two-photon image processing and analysis of neuronal activity</title><p>Timeseries images (15 min per imaging region, 22,500 frames per recording, 25fps) were group averaged in groups of 2, then motion corrected using the TurboReg plugin in FiJi with translation only registration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). Z-projections within FiJi of the average and standard deviation were used to define neuronal ROI through manual tracing. Using custom written scripts in Matlab 2020b, ROIs were imported and converted into a format suitable for the Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging toolbox used for subsequent steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Romano et al., 2017</xref>). Neuropil for each ROI was determined by expanding an annular donut around each ROI to calculate the neuropil deltaF/Fo surrounding each ROI. During computation of neuron ROI deltaF/Fo, fluorescence was corrected for neuropil contamination using the formula (F<sub>corrected</sub> = F<sub>raw</sub> – α * F<sub>neuropil</sub>) where α was set to 0.4 based on previous studies suggesting that α values between 0.3–0.5 were optimal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Peron et al., 2015</xref>), and with F<sub>neuropil</sub> determined by the peri-somatic donut neuropil fluorescence closely associated with each neuron. A smoothed estimate of the baseline fluorescence was calculated by taking a 30 s running average of the 8th percentile of the raw fluorescence, which was then subtracted from the raw fluorescence to remove baseline drift.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> trace deconvolution to determine neuronal transients</title><p>To determine significant fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients from the deltaF/Fo of each neuron, a dynamic threshold implementing a Bayesian odds ratio estimation framework for noise estimation was used to determine transients that met the condition of being greater than 98% of the confidence interval for the calculated fluorescent baseline noise, and were compatible with a tau of ~1.8 s for GCaMP6S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Romano et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Romano et al., 2017</xref>). Determination of firing was performed on the neuronal deltaF/Fo traces, as implemented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Romano et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Romano et al., 2017</xref>, in order to define the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient rate and to generate raster plots.

Distance between neuron pairs was calculated from the Euclidean distance between the central points of the neuron ROIs of the image frame. Functional connectivity plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) were generated by plotting neuron ROI centroids as red dots, and lines between them with line weight and color determined by the strength of the correlation between them. Stationary variable block bootstrapping (5000 iterations) was performed as a statistical test for the significance of each pairwise correlation and only correlations that were greater than the 99th percentile of the bootstrap were deemed statistically significant and plotted. Average number of significant connections per neuron was calculated by dividing the number of functional connections that met the bootstrapping threshold by the total number of neurons in the population. Connection density was calculated as percent of max by taking the total number of significant functional connections and dividing by the total potential number of functional connections if every neuron within the population was functionally connected with all other neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Determination of neural assemblies and their activity patterns</title><p>To evaluate the co-activity patterns of neurons that form putative neural assemblies, a PCA-Promax procedure was applied as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Romano et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Romano et al., 2017</xref>), with a zMax threshold manually selected by the first clear minimum in the distribution of z-scored maximal ROI loadings. Notably, the PCA-Promax procedure relaxes the PCA orthogonality condition using a PROMAX oblique rotation of the PC axes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Hendrickson and White, 1964</xref>), such that assemblies can contain neurons found within other assemblies. Due to this relaxation of the PCA orthogonality condition, assemblies with high overlap whose dot product exceeded 0.6 were merged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Hendrickson and White, 1964</xref>). All assemblies were compared to surrogate control datasets, and only those assemblies whose members were significantly correlated and synchronous were kept (p&lt;0.05). To determine the co-activity of neurons within assemblies, a matching index was calculated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Romano et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Romano et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Hilgetag et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Sporns et al., 2007</xref>). The matching index quantifies the proportion of neurons within the assembly that are co-activated simultaneously over the timeseries, with a maximal value of 1 indicating perfect overlap in assembly member activation. The significance of each assembly activation over the timeseries was determined by comparing the activation events to a probability distribution based on the size of the assembly, the size of the total population of N ROIs, and with a threshold p-value of &lt;0.05 considered to be a statistically significant activation. For cross-correlation of assembly-assembly correlations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) and assembly activations with speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>), the matching index was first multiplied by the Boolean timeseries of individual assembly activation significance to generate matching index timeseries of significant assembly activations only (presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref> as percent of maximal assembly activation).

Grubb’s test was used to remove data outliers with alpha set to 0.05. All zero time-lag cross-correlations were computed using Pearson’s <italic>r</italic>. A stationary bootstrapping procedure was used as a test of the significance of the calculated Pearson’s r of each pairwise timeseries comparison. Within the stationary bootstrapping procedure, 5000 iterations were run and an average block length of 23 frames (1.84 s) was used based on previous studies indicating ~1.8 s as the decay time for GCaMP6S Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor within neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Dana et al., 2019</xref>). Pairwise r values greater than the 99h percentile of the stationary bootstrap were deemed ‘significant’. Non-significant pairwise r values were excluded from analyses of average correlation values. For all statistical comparisons, a p value of≤0.05 was considered statistically significant. A p value of≤0.10 was considered a statistical trend.

The excitability of neurons in the peri-infarct cortex during stroke recovery has produced contradictory findings: some studies suggest hyper-excitability to direct-brain stimulation, while others indicate diminished responsiveness to physical stimuli. However, most studies have used anesthetized animals, which can disrupt cortical activity and functional connectivity. The present study used two-photon Ca2+ imaging after focal photothrombotic stroke to examine neural activity patterns in awake mice. The authors found reduced neuronal spiking in the peri-infarct cortex that was strongly correlated with motor performance deficits. Additionally, the authors found disruptions in neural activation, functional connectivity, and assembly architecture in the immediate peri-infarct region but not in the distal cortex regions.</p><p>The findings of this study are very important as they show that there is no measurable change in terms of neuronal activation and reorganization in distal regions of remapped cortical response areas after stroke.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.90080.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bandet</surname><given-names>Mischa Vance</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Alberta</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Edmonton</named-content></addr-line><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Winship</surname><given-names>Ian Robert</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Alberta</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Edmonton</named-content></addr-line><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Methods, please state the sex of the mice.</p></disp-quote><p>This has now been added to the methods section:</p><p>“Three to nine month old Thy1-GCaMP6S mice (Strain GP4.3, Jax Labs), N=16 stroke (average age: 5.4 months; 13 male, 3 female), and 5 sham (average age: 6 months; 3 male, 2 female), were used in this study.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The analysis in Fig 3B-D, 4B-C, and 6A, B highlights the loss of limb function, firing rate, or connections at 1 week but this phenomenon is clearly persisting longer in some datasets (Fig. 3 and 6). Was there not a statistical difference at weeks 2,3,4,8 relative to &quot;Pre-stroke&quot; or were comparisons only made to equivalent time points in the sham group? Personally, I think it is useful to compare to &quot;pre-stroke&quot; which should be more reflective of that sample of animals than comparing to a different set of animals in the Sham group. A 1 sample t-test could be used in Fig 4 and 6 normalized data.</p></disp-quote><p>On further analysis of our datasets, normalization throughout the manuscript was unnecessary for proper depiction of results, and all normalized datasets have been replaced with nonnormalized datasets. All within group statistics are now indicated within the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Fig 4A shows a very striking change in activity that doesn't seem to be borne out with group comparisons. Since many neurons are quiet or show very little activity, did the authors ever consider subgrouping their analysis based on cells that show high activity levels (top 20 or 30% of cells) vs those that are inactive most of the time? Recent research has shown that the effects of stroke can have a disproportionate impact on these highly active cells versus the minimally active ones.</p></disp-quote><p>A qualitative analysis supports a loss of cells with high activity at the 1-week post-stroke timepoint, and examination of average firing rates at 1-week shows reductions in the animals with the highest average rates. However, we have not tracked responses within individual neurons or quantitatively analyzed the data by subdividing cells into groups based on their prestroke activity levels. We have amended the discussion of the manuscript with the following to highlight the previous data as it relates to our study:</p><p>“Recent research also indicates that stroke causes distinct patterns of disruption to the network topology of excitatory and inhibitory cells [73], and that stroke can disproportionately disrupt the function of high activity compared to low activity neurons in specific neuron sub-types [61]. Mouse models with genetically labelled neuronal sub-types (including different classes of inhibitory interneurons) could be used to track the function of those populations over time in awake animals.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Fig 4 shows normalized firing rates when moving and at rest but it would be interesting to know what the true difference in activity was in these 2 states. My assumption is that stroke reduces movement therefore one normalizes the data. The authors could consider putting non-normalized data in a Supp figure, or at least provide a rationale for not showing this, such as stating that movement output was significantly suppressed, hence the need for normalization.</p></disp-quote><p>On further analysis of our datasets, normalization throughout the manuscript was unnecessary for proper depiction of results, and all normalized datasets have been replaced with nonnormalized datasets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) One thought for the discussion. The fact that the authors did not find any changes in &quot;distant&quot; cortex may be specific to the region they chose to sample (caudal FL cortex). It is possible that examining different &quot;distant&quot; regions could yield a different outcome. For example, one could argue that there may have been no reason for this area to &quot;change&quot; since it was responsive to FL stimuli before stroke. Further, since it was posterior to the stroke, thalamocortical projects should have been minimally disturbed.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for this comment. We have amended the discussion with the following:</p><p>“Our results suggest a limited spatial distance over which the peri-infarct somatosensory cortex displays significant network functional deficits during movement and rest. Our results are consistent with a spatial gradient of plasticity mediating factors that are generally enhanced with closer proximity to the infarct core [84,88,90,91]. However, our analysis outside peri-infarct cortex is limited to a single distal area caudal to the pre-stroke cFL representation. Although somatosensory maps in the present study were defined by a statistical criterion for delineating highly responsive cortical regions from those with weak responses, the distal area in this study may have been a site of activity that did not meet the statistical criterion for inclusion in the baseline map. The lack of detectable changes in population correlations, functional connectivity, assembly architecture and assembly activations in the distal region may reflect minimal pressure for plastic change as networks in regions below the threshold for regional map inclusion prior to stroke may still be functional in the distal cortex. Thus, threshold-based assessment of remapping may further overestimate the neuroplasticity underlying functional reorganization suggested by anaesthetized preparations with strong stimulation. Future studies could examine distal areas medial and anterior to the cFL somatosensory area, such as the motor and pre-motor cortex, to further define the effect of FL targeted stroke on neuroplasticity within other functionally relevant regions. Moreover, the restriction of these network changes to peri-infarct cortex could also reflect the small penumbra associated with photothrombotic stroke, and future studies could make use of stroke models with larger penumbral regions, such as the middle cerebral artery occlusion model. Larger injuries induce more sustained sensorimotor impairment, and the relationship between neuronal firing, connectivity, and neuronal assemblies could be further probed relative to recovery or sustained impairment in these models.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>Line 129, I don't necessarily think the infarct shows &quot;hyper-fluorescence&quot;, it just absorbs less white light (or reflects more light) than blood-rich neighbouring regions.</p></disp-quote><p>Sentence in the manuscript has been changed to:</p><p>“Resulting infarcts lesioned this region, and borders could be defined by a region of decreased light absorption 1 week post-stroke (Fig 1D, Top).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 130-132: the authors refer to Fig 1D to show cellular changes but these cannot be seen from the images presented.

Movement periods were manually annotated on a subset of timeseries by co-recording animal movement using both the Mobile Homecage tracker, as well as a webcam (Logitech C270) with infrared filter removed. Movement tracking data was low pass filtered to remove spurious movement artifacts lasting below 6 recording frames (240ms). Based on annotated times of animal movement from the webcam recordings and Homecage tracking, a threshold of 30mm/s from the tracking data was determined as frames of animal movement, whereas speeds below 30mm/s was taken as periods of rest.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 191-195: Note that although the finding of reduced neural activity is in disagreement with a multi-unit recording study, it is consistent with other very recent single-cell Ca++ imaging data after stroke (PMID: 34172735 , 34671051).</p></disp-quote><p>Text has been altered as follows:</p><p>“These results indicate decreased neuronal spiking 1-week after stroke in regions immediately adjacent to the infarct, but not in distal regions, that is strongly related to sensorimotor impairment.

The threshold is presumably used to discriminate between the sensory-evoked response and collateral activation / less &quot;relevant&quot; response (noise). Since the peak intensity is lower after stroke, the &quot;response&quot; area is larger - lower main signal results in less noise exclusion. Predictably, areas that show a higher response before stroke than after are excluded from the response area before stroke and included after. While it is expected that the remapped areas will exhibit a lower response than the original and considering the absence of neuronal activity, assembly architecture, or functional connectivity in the &quot;remapped&quot; regions, a minimal criterion for remapping should be to exhibit higher activation than before stroke. Please use a different criterion to map the cortical response area after stroke.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for this comment. We agree with the reviewer’s assessment of 95% of peak as an arbitrary criterion of mapped areas. To exclude noise from the analysis of mapped regions, a new statistical criterion of 5X the standard deviation of the baseline period was used to determine the threshold to use to define each response map. These maps were used to determine the peak intensity of the forelimb response. We also measured a separate ROI specifically overlapping the distal region, lateral to the hindlimb map, to determine specific changes to widefield Ca2+ responses within this distal region. We have amended the text as follows and have altered Figure 2 with new data generated from our new criterion for cortical mapping.</p><p>“The trials for each limb were averaged in ImageJ software (NIH). 10 imaging frames (1s) after stimulus onset were averaged and divided by the 10 baseline frames 1s before stimulus onset to generate a response map for each limb. Response maps were thresholded at 5 times the standard deviation of the baseline period deltaFoF to determine limb associated response maps. These were merged and overlaid on an image of surface vasculature to delineate the cFL and cHL somatosensory representations and were also used to determine peak Ca2+ response amplitude from the timeseries recordings. For cFL stimulation trials, an additional ROI was placed over the region lateral to the cHL representation (denoted as “distal region” in Fig 2E) to measure the distal region cFL evoked Ca2+ response amplitude pre- and post-stroke. The dimensions and position of the distal ROI was held consistent relative to surface vasculature for each animal from pre- to post-stroke.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Animals</p><p>Mice used have an age that goes from 3 to 9 months.

We have amended the discussion with the following to address this point:</p><p>“A potential limitation of our data is the undefined effect of age and sex on cortical dynamics in this cohort of mice (with ages ranging from 3-9 months) after stroke. Aging can impair neurovascular coupling [102–107] and reduce ischemic tolerance [108–111], and greater investigation of cortical activity changes after stroke in aged animals would more effectively model stroke in humans. Future research could replicate this study with mice in middle-age and aged mice (e.g. 9 months and 18+ months of age), and with sufficient quantities of both sexes, to better examine age and sex effects on measures of cortical function.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Statistics</p><p>Please describe the &quot;normalization&quot; that was applied to the firing rate.

There is an observed change in the criteria for what is considered a response.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. Text has been amended as follows:</p><p>“Fig 2A shows representative montages from a stroke animal illustrating the cortical cFL and cHL Ca2+ responses to 1s, 100Hz limb stimulation of the contralateral limbs at the pre-stroke and 8week post-stroke timepoints. The location and magnitude of the cortical responses changes drastically between timepoints, with substantial loss of supra-threshold activity within the prestroke cFL representation located anterior to the cHL map, and an apparent shift of the remapped representation into regions lateral to the cHL representation at 8-weeks post-stroke. A significant decrease in the cFL evoked Ca2+ response amplitude was observed in the stroke group at 8-weeks post-stroke relative to pre-stroke (Fig 2B). This is in agreement with past studies [19–25], and suggests that cFL targeted stroke reduces forelimb evoked activity across the cFL somatosensory cortex in anaesthetized animals even after 2 months of recovery. There was no statistical change in the average size of cFL evoked representation 8-weeks after stroke (Fig 2C), but a significant posterior shift of the supra-threshold cFL map was detected (Fig 2D). Unmasking of previously sub-threshold cFL responsive cortex in areas posterior to the original cFL map at 8-weeks post-stroke could contribute to this apparent remapping. However, the amplitude of the cFL evoked widefield Ca2+ response in this distal region at 8-weeks post-stroke remains reduced relative to pre-stroke activation (Fig 2E). Previous studies suggest strong inhibition of cFL evoked activity during the first weeks after photothrombosis [25]. Without longitudinal measurement in this study to quantify this reduced activation prior to 8-weeks poststroke, we cannot differentiate potential remapping due to unmasking of the cFL representation that enhances the cFL-evoked widefield Ca2+ response from apparent remapping that simply reflects changes in the signal-to-noise ratio used to define the functional representations. There were no group differences between stroke and sham groups in cHL evoked intensity, area, or map position (data not shown).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A lot of the nonsignificant results are reported as &quot;statistical trends towards...&quot; While the term &quot;trend&quot; is problematic, it remains common in its use.

This should be the main criterion for remapping, but it is not operationalized correctly by the threshold method.</p></disp-quote><p>With our new criterion for determining limb maps using a statistical threshold of 5X the standard deviation of baseline fluorescence, we have edited text throughout the manuscript to better emphasize that we may not be measuring new sensory-evoked spiking with the mesoscale mapping that was done. We have edited the discussion as follows:</p><p>“Here, we used longitudinal two photon calcium imaging of awake, head-fixed mice in a mobile homecage to examine how focal photothrombotic stroke to the forelimb sensorimotor cortex alters the activity and connectivity of neurons adjacent and distal to the infarct. Consistent with previous studies using intrinsic optical signal imaging, mesoscale imaging of regional calcium responses (reflecting bulk neuronal spiking in that region) showed that targeted stroke to the cFL somatosensory area disrupts the sensory-evoked forelimb representation in the infarcted region. Consistent with previous studies, this functional representation exhibited a posterior shift 8-weeks after injury, with activation in a region lateral to the cHL representation. Notably, sensory-evoked cFL representations exhibited reduced amplitudes of activity relative to prestroke activation measured in the cFL representation and in the region lateral the cHL representation. Longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging in awake animals was used to probe single neuron and local network changes adjacent the infarct and in a distal region that corresponded to the shifted region of cFL activation. This imaging revealed a decrease in firing rate at 1-week post-stroke in the peri-infarct region that was significantly negatively correlated with the number of errors made with the stroke-affected limbs on the tapered beam task. Periinfarct cortical networks also exhibited a reduction in the number of functional connections per neuron and a sustained disruption in neural assembly structure, including a reduction in the number of assemblies and an increased recruitment of neurons into functional assemblies. Elevated correlation between assemblies within the peri-infarct region peaked 1-week after stroke and was sustained throughout recovery. Surprisingly, distal networks, even in the region associated with the shifted cFL functional map in anaesthetized preparations, were largely undisturbed.”</p><p>“Cortical plasticity after strokePlasticity within and between cortical regions contributes to partial recovery of function and is proportional to both the extent of damage, as well as the form and quantity of rehabilitative therapy post-stroke [80,81]. A critical period of highest plasticity begins shortly after the onset of stroke, is greatest during the first few weeks, and progressively diminishes over the weeks to months after stroke [19,82–86]. Functional recovery after stroke is thought to depend largely on the adaptive plasticity of surviving neurons that reinforce existing connections and/or replace the function of lost networks [25,52,87–89]. This neuronal plasticity is believed to lead to topographical shifts in somatosensory functional maps to adjacent areas of the cortex. The driver for this process has largely been ascribed to a complex cascade of intra- and extracellular signaling that ultimately leads to plastic re-organization of the microarchitecture and function of surviving peri-infarct tissue [52,80,84,88,90–92]. Likewise, structural and functional remodeling has previously been found to be dependent on the distance from the stroke core, with closer tissue undergoing greater re-organization than more distant tissue (for review, see [52]).”</p><p>“Previous research examining the region at the border between the cFL and cHL somatosensory maps has shown this region to be a primary site for functional remapping after cFL directed photothrombotic stroke, resulting in a region of cFL and cHL map functional overlap [25]. Within this overlapping area, neurons have been shown to lose limb selectivity 1-month post-stroke [25]. This is followed by the acquisition of more selective responses 2-months post-stroke and is associated with reduced regional overlap between cFL and cHL functional maps [25]. Notably, this functional plasticity at the cellular level was assessed using strong vibrotactile stimulation of the limbs in anaesthetized animals. Our findings using longitudinal imaging in awake animals show an initial reduction in firing rate at 1-week post-stroke within the peri-infarct region that was predictive of functional impairment in the tapered beam task. This transient reduction may be associated with reduced or dysfunctional thalamic connectivity [93–95] and reduced transmission of signals from hypo-excitable thalamo-cortical projections [96]. Importantly, the strong negative correlation we observed between firing rate of the neural population within the peri-infarct cortex and the number of errors on the affected side, as well as the rapid recovery of firing rate and tapered beam performance, suggests that neuronal activity within the peri-infarct region contributes to the impairment and recovery. The common timescale of neuronal and functional recovery also coincides with angiogenesis and re-establishment of vascular support for peri-infarct tissue [83,97–100].”</p><p>“Consistent with previous research using mechanical limb stimulation under anaesthesia [25], we show that at the 8-week timepoint after cFL photothrombotic stroke the cFL representation is shifted posterior from its pre-stroke location into the area lateral to the cHL map. Notably, our distal region for awake imaging was directly within this 8-week post-stroke cFL representation. Despite our prediction that this distal area would be a hotspot for plastic changes, there was no detectable alteration to the level of population correlation, functional connectivity, assembly architecture or assembly activations after stroke. Moreover, we found little change in the firing rate in either moving or resting states in this region. Contrary to our results, somatosensoryevoked activity assessed by two photon calcium imaging in anesthetized animals has demonstrated an increase in cFL responsive neurons within a region lateral to the cHL representation 1-2 months after focal cFL stroke [25]. Notably, this previous study measured sensory-evoked single cell activity using strong vibrotactile (1s 100Hz) limb stimulation under aneasthesia [25]. This frequency of limb stimulation has been shown to elicit near maximal neuronal responses within the limb-associated somatosensory cortex under anesthesia [101]. Thus, strong stimulation and anaesthesia may have unmasked non-physiological activity in neurons in the distal region that is not apparent during more naturalistic activation during awake locomotion or rest. Regional mapping defined using strong stimulation in anesthetized animals may therefore overestimate plasticity at the cellular level.”</p><p>“Our results suggest a limited spatial distance over which the peri-infarct somatosensory cortex displays significant network functional deficits during movement and rest. Our results are consistent with a spatial gradient of plasticity mediating factors that are generally enhanced with closer proximity to the infarct core [84,88,90,91]. However, our analysis outside peri-infarct cortex is limited to a single distal area caudal to the pre-stroke cFL representation. Although somatosensory maps in the present study were defined by a statistical criterion for delineating highly responsive cortical regions from those with weak responses, the distal area in this study may have been a site of activity that did not meet the statistical criterion for inclusion in the baseline map. The lack of detectable changes in population correlations, functional connectivity, assembly architecture and assembly activations in the distal region may reflect minimal pressure for plastic change as networks in regions below the threshold for regional map inclusion prior to stroke may still be functional in the distal cortex. Thus, threshold-based assessment of remapping may further overestimate the neuroplasticity underlying functional reorganization suggested by anaesthetized preparations with strong stimulation. Future studies could examine distal areas medial and anterior to the cFL somatosensory area, such as the motor and pre-motor cortex, to further define the effect of FL targeted stroke on neuroplasticity within other functionally relevant regions. Moreover, the restriction of these network changes to peri-infarct cortex could also reflect the small penumbra associated with photothrombotic stroke, and future studies could make use of stroke models with larger penumbral regions, such as the middle cerebral artery occlusion model. Larger injuries induce more sustained sensorimotor impairment, and the relationship between neuronal firing, connectivity, and neuronal assemblies could be further probed relative to recovery or sustained impairment in these models. Recent research also indicates that stroke causes distinct patterns of disruption to the network topology of excitatory and inhibitory cells [73], and that stroke can disproportionately disrupt the function of high activity compared to low activity neurons in specific neuron sub-types [61]. Mouse models with genetically labelled neuronal sub-types (including different classes of inhibitory interneurons) could be used to track the function of those populations over time in awake animals. A potential limitation of our data is the undefined effect of age and sex on cortical dynamics in this cohort of mice (with ages ranging from 3-9 months) after stroke. Aging can impair neurovascular coupling [102–107] and reduce ischemic tolerance [108–111], and greater investigation of cortical activity changes after stroke in aged animals would more effectively model stroke in humans. Future research could replicate this study with mice in middle-age and aged mice (e.g. 9 months and 18+ months of age), and with sufficient quantities of both sexes, to better examine age and sex effects on measures of cortical function.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>315 - 317 Remodelling is dependent on the distance from the stroke core, with closer tissue undergoing greater reorganization than more distant tissue.

However, the motivation for this paper is that anaesthesia is a confounding factor. It appears to me that, given the results of this study, the authors should argue that the functional connectivity observed under anaesthesia may be spurious.</p></disp-quote><p>The incorrect word was used here. We have corrected the paragraph of the discussion and amended it as follows:</p><p>“Consistent with previous research using mechanical limb stimulation under anaesthesia [25], we show that at the 8-week timepoint after cFL photothrombotic stroke the cFL representation is shifted posterior from its pre-stroke location into the area lateral to the cHL map. Notably, our distal region for awake imaging was directly within this 8-week post-stroke cFL representation. Despite our prediction that this distal area would be a hotspot for plastic changes, there was no detectable alteration to the level of population correlation, functional connectivity, assembly architecture or assembly activations after stroke. Moreover, we found little change in the firing rate in either moving or resting states in this region. Contrary to our results, somatosensoryevoked activity assessed by two photon calcium imaging in anesthetized animals has demonstrated an increase in cFL responsive neurons within a region lateral to the cHL representation 1-2 months after focal cFL stroke [25]. Notably, this previous study measured sensory-evoked single cell activity using strong vibrotactile (1s 100Hz) limb stimulation under aneasthesia [25]. This frequency of limb stimulation has been shown to elicit near maximal neuronal responses within the limb-associated somatosensory cortex under anesthesia [101]. Thus, strong stimulation and anaesthesia may have unmasked non-physiological activity in neurons in the distal region that is not apparent during more naturalistic activation during awake locomotion or rest. Regional mapping defined using strong stimulation in anesthetized animals may therefore overestimate plasticity at the cellular level.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figures</p><p>Figure 1 and 2: Scale bar missing.</p></disp-quote><p>Scale bars added to both figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2: The representative image shows a drastic reduction of the forelimb response area, contrary to the general description of the findings.
