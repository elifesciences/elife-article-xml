To date, how proteins are directed to specific epithelial cell surface is not fully understood. Here we report a conserved DSSDE motif in LDL-receptor (LDLR) modules of corin (a transmembrane serine protease) and CD320 (a receptor for vitamin B12 uptake), which regulates apical membrane targeting in renal epithelial cells. Altering this motif prevents specific apical corin and CD320 expression in polarized Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Mechanistic studies indicate that this DSSDE motif participates in a Rab11a-dependent mechanism that specifies apical sorting. In MDCK cells, inhibition of Rab11a, but not Rab11b, expression leads to corin and CD320 expression on both apical and basolateral membranes. Together, our results reveal a novel molecular recognition mechanism that regulates LDLR module-containing proteins in their specific apical expression in polarized renal epithelial cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>apical expression</kwd><kwd>CD320</kwd><kwd>corin</kwd><kwd>ldl receptor module</kwd><kwd>Rab11a</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81873840</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dong</surname><given-names>Ningzheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81570457</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dong</surname><given-names>Ningzheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A conserved motif in corin and CD320 LDL receptor modules regulates specific apical trafficking in polarized renal epithelial cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Renal reabsorption is of fundamental importance in body fluid, electrolyte, and metabolic homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nawata and Pannabecker, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Polesel and Hall, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">van der Wijst et al., 2019</xref>). The majority of water and solutes, including glucose, ions, amino acids, and vitamins, in the glomerular filtrate are reabsorbed in the proximal tubule, which consists of a single layer of polarized cuboidal epithelial cells. In these epithelial cells, receptors, transporters, and enzymes are located on distinct apical and/or basolateral membranes to carry out their functions. Under pathological conditions, altered tubular epithelial membrane polarity and cell surface protein distribution impair renal function and physiological homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Matteis and Luini, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rossier et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stoops and Caplan, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wilson, 2011</xref>).

In the kidney, corin expression is mostly restricted to tubular epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dong et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting a potential role in regulating sodium excretion and reabsorption. In supporting this hypothesis, reduced renal corin expression was found in rat kidney disease models with sodium retention and proteinuria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Polzin et al., 2010</xref>).

These results suggest a possible cell membrane targeting mechanism, in which corin and CD320 are transported, likely via common recycling endosomes (CRE), to a Rab11a-positive apical recycling endosome (ARE), where LDLR modules with the DSSDE motif are recognized by a Rab11a-dependent mechanism that favors apical sorting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>).

In this study, we used MDCK cells as a model to examine corin expression on polarized epithelial membranes. In immunostaining, corin exhibited a specific apical expression pattern in MDCK cells, which differs from the overall membrane expression pattern in HL-1 cardiomyocytes and HEK293 cells. The distinct apical expression likely reflects the corin function in the lumen of renal tubules to regulate sodium excretion and reabsorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Apical targeting in polarized epithelial cells has been studied extensively. To date, cytoplasmic tail, transmembrane domain, glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, PDZ-binding motif, and N- or O-glycans have been identified as apical sorting signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stoops and Caplan, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weisz and Rodriguez-Boulan, 2009</xref>). Corin is a transmembrane, but not GPI-anchored, protein and contains no PDZ-binding motif or detectable amounts of O-glycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yan et al., 2000</xref>). In this study, we showed that the cytoplasmic tail and individual N-glycosylation sites near LDLR8 module were unnecessary for the specific apical expression of corin in MDCK cells. These results point to a yet unknown mechanism underlying apical corin expression in polarized renal epithelial cells.</p><p>By analyzing a series of corin mutants with modular deletions and point mutations, we identified a DSSDE motif in corin LDLR8 module required for specific apical expression in MDCK cells. In corin mutants, in which the DSSDE motif was disrupted in LDLR8 module, but re-introduced in LDLR6 or LDLR7 module, the distinct apical expression of corin was restored. These results indicate that the DSSDE motif is a key element, transportable among LDLR modules, that specifies apical corin expression in polarized renal epithelial cells. Based on modeling analysis of known LDLR module structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fass et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">North and Blacklow, 2000</xref>), Ser683 (first Ser in the D<underline>S</underline>SDE motif) in corin is predicted to be surface exposed. In LDLR modules of the human patriarch LDLR, the corresponding surface area is a proposed ligand-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fass et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Russell et al., 1989</xref>). Conceivably, the surface area around Ser683 in corin LDLR8 module may serve as a protein-interacting site for apical targeting in renal epithelial cells.</p><p>The finding of the DSSDE motif in corin LDLR8 module as a possible regulatory element in epithelial membrane targeting was unexpected. Corin protein has eight LDLR modules, six of which have the conserved DxSDE motif. Moreover, LDLR modules with the conserved DxSDE motif are present in numerous cell surface receptors and proteolytic enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bugge et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Herz, 2001</xref>). We verified our findings in CD320, a receptor for transcobalamin in vitamin B12 uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernard et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Quadros and Sequeira, 2013</xref>), which contains the DSSDE motif in its second LDLR module. CD320 expression in kidneys has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arora et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Park et al., 2009</xref>), but its cellular and subcellular distribution in renal segments remained unclear. In immunostaining with human kidney sections, we found apical CD320 expression in proximal tubular epithelial cells. The result is consistent with CD320 function in vitamin B12 uptake, as most vitamin reabsorption occurs via cell surface receptors in renal proximal tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Christensen and Birn, 1997</xref>). Importantly, we found that the DSSDE motif in CD320 LDLR2 module was also required for specific apical expression in MDCK cells. These results suggest that the DSSDE motif may have a similar regulatory function in other LDLR module-containing proteins that are expressed apically in renal epithelial cells.</p><p>In polarized epithelial cells, Rab11a-positive endosomes are primary trafficking stations toward the apical membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hoekstra et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Thuenauer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2000</xref>). In our study, overexpression of a dominant-negative Rab11a mutant (Rab11aS25N) or shRNA-mediated <italic>RAB11A</italic> knockdown in MDCK cells resulted in apical and basolateral expression of corin and CD320. In contrast, <italic>RAB11B</italic> knockdown did not alter the apical expression pattern of corin and CD320. It is possible that the DSSDE motif-containing LDLR modules in corin and CD320 are recognized by a Rab11a-dependent mechanism that specifies apical sorting. Mutations in the DSSDE motif abolish such a recognition mechanism, leading to apical and basolateral sorting of the mutant proteins. Further studies are required to understand the molecular basis for the potential Rab11a-dependent recognition mechanism.</p><p>In polarized epithelial cells, Rab11a is also known to mediate vesicle trafficking and recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Perez Bay et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weisz and Rodriguez-Boulan, 2009</xref>). At this time, it is unclear if corin undergoes endocytosis and recycling. In cardiomyocytes and HEK293 cells, corin is activated by PCSK6-mediated cleavage on the cell surface and subsequently undergoes ectodomain shedding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jiang et al., 2011</xref>). In western blotting under reduction conditions, the corin protease domain fragment derived from activation cleavage was not detected intracellularly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that activated corin may not be internalized for recycling. In this study, we found similar corin activation on the surface of MDCK cells and did not detect the cleaved protease domain fragment inside the cells. Consistently, corin WT was detected among biotin-labeled apical, but not basolateral, membrane proteins. Additional studies with more direct and sensitive assays are required to determine if corin and CD320 undergo endocytosis and recycling in MDCK cells.</p><p>In summary, targeted apical expression is a key characteristic of polarized epithelial cells. Disturbed protein trafficking to distinct cell membranes in renal epithelial cells has been shown to cause kidney diseases. In this study, we have identified a conserved DSSDE motif in corin and CD320 LDLR modules as a regulatory element in apical sorting in MDCK cells. This regulatory function is likely mediated by a Rab11a-dependent mechanism. The DSSDE motif is present in other proteins with LDLR modules. Our findings should encourage more research to examine if analogous motifs in other LDLR module-containing proteins have a similar role in apical membrane targeting in polarized epithelial cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

The overall structure alignment was generated by PyMOL based on the Cα of all residues. The local alignment of CD320 LDLR2 and corin LDLR8 modules was generated by PyMOL based on the Cα of the DSSDE motif.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed with Prism six software (Graphpad).

with the ultimate goal of identifying the &quot;sorting&quot; machinery that recognizes these motifs. This study defines an extracellular domain motif that specifies the accumulation of corin (a serine proteinase) and CD320 (receptor for B12 uptake) at the apical region of polarized MDCK cells. These two proteins contain conserved LDL receptor (LDLR) class A modules in their extracellular domains. Mutation or removal of a DSSDE motif in a subset of these LDLR modules causes a partial redistribution of the proteins to the basolateral membrane whereas transplant of this motif to unsorted forms of the proteins causes their apical redistribution. Other studies demonstrate a role of Rab11a in the preferential apical sorting of the proteins. Thus, the DSSDE motif represents a &quot;regulatory element&quot; that controls the expression of LDLR module-containing proteins at the apical pole of kidney cells.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A conserved LDL receptor motif regulates corin and CD320 membrane targeting in polarized renal epithelial cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Olga Boudker as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The major contribution of this article is the potentially novel finding that the apical membrane proteins corin and CD320 contain a peptide-based, sorting determinant in their extracellular domain that specifies apical targeting in kidney cells. Extensive mutagenesis and MDCK expression experiments were carried out to characterize the DXSDE motif present in Corin, a transmembrane serine protease, and CD320, a receptor for Vitamin B12 uptake. Mutation or removal of this motif causes a partial redistribution of the proteins to the basolateral membrane whereas transplant of this motif to unsorted forms of the proteins causes their apical redistribution. Other studies demonstrate a role of Rab11a in the preferential apical sorting of the proteins. While we don't learn how the signal works- especially in relation to rab11a function- the finding is significant given its novelty and appearance in multiple proteins. However, the review has raised issues that must be satisfactorily addressed before the manuscript is considered acceptable for publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The apical sorting of the constructs is not entirely convincing. There are several issues. Foremost is the lack of quantification of the microscopy-based assay. The authors present single selected images, which is not satisfactory. Additionally, given the lack of resolution of the microscopy in the Z-axis, it is not entirely convincing that the signal being detected is surface-localized rather than, at least partly, intracellular. One reviewer states &quot;the gold standard has been to use cell-surface biotinylation (or related techniques such as cell-surface immunoprecipitation). While transfection efficiency can affect one's ability to perform these studies, the standard for decades has been to make stable cell lines or use viral transduction approaches. These latter approaches could be done using a small subset of the mutants.&quot;</p><p>2) It is not convincing that the sorting involves direct apical delivery without endocytosis of a basolateral pool of protein. The possibility of endocytosis of a basolateral pool and either apical re-sorting or degradation was argued against in the Discussion. The basis was absence of intracellular detection of the cleaved form but this is not a direct endocytosis assay and controls and assay sensitivity are paramount. The extent of endocytosis should be addressed directly and convincingly.</p><p>3) All 3 reviewers had problems with the author's &quot;stop sign&quot; model of how the signal functions. Each expressed this in different ways and each is presented below in the hope that it helps the authors simplify and clarify a model for how the signal might work.</p><p>Reviewer 1 &quot;The mechanistic basis for a signal acting as a &quot;stop sign&quot; eludes me. Perhaps this could be clarified. Is this different from a retrieval signal bring escaped protein back to the sorting station? Alternatively, the authors might entertain what I think of as a more conventional view in which the signal (via whatever it binds) is simply strongly positive for apical sorting. In its absence some protein escapes in the basolateral direction and some remains apical (either passively or by some other means).&quot;</p><p>Reviewer 2 &quot;The model put forward by the authors to explain their results (Figure 8D) is highly speculative. It suggests that the DxSDE motif functions between Common Recycling Endosomes (CRE) and Apical Recycling Endosomes (ARE), favoring the entrance of Corin into ARE and preventing its entrance into Basolateral Sorting Endosomes (BSE). This is a good possibility since ARE are known to be enriched in Rab11a whereas BSE do not express this protein. However, trafficking studies available to date have not implicated BSE in basolateral targeting so their participation in this route is speculative. Furthermore, whether Rab11a participates at the entrance or at the exit of ARE is not studied in this manuscript (there are no imaging studies showing transit of Corin through ARE). So the possibility exists that Rab11a plays an active role in targeting Corin from ARE to the apical membrane, rather than preventing its entrance into ARE. Whether the basolateral route is emerging before or from the ARE is not clear. Hence, the proposed model should be simpler and simply postulate the involvement of Rab11a positive ARE in promoting apical delivery of proteins displaying the DxSDE motif.&quot;</p><p>Reviewer 3 &quot;Final paragraph of the Results and the start of the Discussion is confusing. The authors observe that upon expression of DN-RAB11A, a fraction of corin and CD320 are mis-directed to the basolateral surface. On one hand, the authors argue that <italic>RAB11A</italic> is not required for apical expression, but instead acts to prevent these proteins from entering the basolateral trafficking route. They further argue that the DSSDE motif is not an apical sorting determinant, but a stop signal to prevent entry in the basolateral trafficking route. The basis for this argument is unclear, as a protein lacking any sorting information would presumably be delivered in a non-polarized manner: 50% apical and 50% basolateral. Thus, in the absence of <italic>RAB11A</italic> or a functional DSSDE motif, the protein would assume a random distribution, which is what the authors observe. On the other hand, the authors then go on to say that <italic>RAB11A</italic> is involved in endocytic traffic and that apical traffic of these two proteins could be <italic>RAB11A</italic> and signal dependent. It seems that the authors want to rule out a positive role for <italic>RAB11A</italic> because they argue corin and CD320 are not recycling proteins. However, there is a substantial literature that indicates that a subset of newly synthesized apical and basolateral proteins transit endosomes (including <italic>RAB11A</italic>-positive ones) prior to surface delivery. This possibility should be discussed.&quot;</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56059.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The apical sorting of the constructs is not entirely convincing.

We detected biotin-labeled corin WT among apical, but not basolateral, membrane proteins, whereas the S684A mutant was detected among apical and basolateral membrane proteins. Together with the data from the trypsin digestion experiment, our results do support the idea that corin is expressed on the apical membrane in MDCK cells. The results from the biotin-labeling experiment are presented in Figure 4—figure supplement 2.
