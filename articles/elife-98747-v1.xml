is a vital appendage of the epidermis, and its normal homeostasis and function is crucial for effective maintenance of the skin barrier. Notch signaling is a well-known regulator of epidermal differentiation, and has also been shown to be involved in postnatal maintenance of SGs. However, the precise role of Notch signaling in regulating SG differentiation in the adult homeostatic skin remains unclear. While there is evidence to suggest that Notch1 is the primary Notch receptor involved in regulating the differentiation process, the ligand remains unknown. Using monoclonal therapeutic antibodies designed to specifically inhibit of each of the Notch ligands or receptors, we have identified the Jag2/Notch1 signaling axis as the primary regulator of sebocyte differentiation in mouse homeostatic skin. Mature sebocytes are lost upon specific inhibition of the Jag2 ligand or Notch1 receptor, resulting in the accumulation of proliferative stem/progenitor cells in the SG. Strikingly, this phenotype is reversible, as these stem/progenitor cells re-enter differentiation when the inhibition of Notch activity is lifted. Thus, Notch activity promotes correct sebocyte differentiation, and is required to restrict progenitor proliferation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Notch signaling</kwd><kwd>therapeutic antibodies</kwd><kwd>cell fates</kwd><kwd>differentiation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Inhibition of Notch signaling through the Jag2 ligand, blocks homeostatic sebocyte differentiation, and pushes the cells to a progenitor fate, in a reversible manner.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The skin is a vital organ that acts as a protective barrier against the external environment, and safeguards against fluid loss. An important component of this barrier function is the presence of a complex mixture of oils, known as sebum, which is produced by the SGs. SGs are part of the epidermis and are typically associated with the hair follicle. These acinar structures have two cell types: basal stem or progenitor cells which encase the differentiated sebocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Sebocyte differentiation begins at the proximal tip of the of the SG, with maturing sebocytes moving upwards, enlarging, accumulating lipids, and ultimately undergoing a highly regulated and specialized form of cell death in which they release their lipid contents into the sebaceous duct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kretzschmar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schneider and Paus, 2010</xref>). This process requires the constant turnover of sebocytes, which occurs over a period of 7–14 d in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jung et al., 2015</xref>). Both over- and underproduction of sebum have been linked to various skin disorders including acne or dry skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Zaid et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Binczek et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Karnik et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lovászi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rittié et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Seiffert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Smith and Thiboutot, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Stenn et al., 1999</xref>), and rare sebaceous carcinomas constitute aggressive tumors leading to high mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buitrago and Joseph, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nelson et al., 1995</xref>), thus SG number and function have to be tightly regulated for proper skin function.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Jag2 is the dominant ligand involved in regulating sebocyte differentiation.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) A representative image of the homeostatic hair follicle, including its associated sebaceous gland (SG).

The pathway consists of multiple ligands and receptors that typically form a signaling axis in pairs. Notch signaling can regulate cell fate by either inducing or inhibiting differentiation, or by making binary cell fate decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wilson and Radtke, 2006</xref>). Classically, these functions of Notch signaling have been studied during development, but increasing evidence suggests that the Notch pathway is also involved in regulating cell fate and cell states in adult homeostatic tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ables et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lafkas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mosteiro et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sato et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Siebel and Lendahl, 2017</xref>).</p><p>While it is known that Notch signaling is not required for embryonic development of the epidermis, it is essential for the postnatal maintenance of the hair follicles and the SGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Watt et al., 2008</xref>). However, the precise role of Notch signaling in adult sebocyte differentiation has not been comprehensively investigated, with most studies examining irreversible deletions of the Notch pathway components in the embryonic ectodermal lineages. While these studies report SG defects, it remains unclear whether these defects are due to a direct effect on the SGs, or whether they are a consequence of general skin defects also observed in these models. For example, SGs are absent in mice with embryonic pan-Notch deletions such as <italic>Rbpj</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blanpain et al., 2006</xref>), gamma-secretase, <italic>Notch1Notch2</italic>, and <italic>Notch1Notch2Notch3</italic>, and are severely reduced in <italic>Notch1</italic> and <italic>Notch1Notch3</italic> embryonically-deleted skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pan et al., 2004</xref>), while deletion of <italic>Notch2</italic> alone does not affect the SG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pan et al., 2004</xref>). Consistent with the constitutive deletions, loss of <italic>Rbpj</italic> in adult SGs also results in missing sebocytes, while loss of <italic>Notch1</italic> in the adult SGs results in miniaturized lobes that still contain some differentiated sebocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Veniaminova et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, activation of <italic>Notch1</italic> in the adult skin results in enlarged SGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Estrach et al., 2006</xref>). Conversely, for the Notch pathway ligands, embryonic and adult deletion of <italic>Jag1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Estrach et al., 2006</xref>), and embryonic deletion of <italic>Dll1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Estrach et al., 2008</xref>) results in normal SG morphology. Collectively, these data suggest that Notch1 is the dominant Notch receptor involved in regulating sebocyte differentiation, however, it remains unclear which ligand is required.</p><p>In our previous work, we observed that systemic inhibition of Jag2 using monoclonal therapeutic antibodies resulted in SG defects in adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lafkas et al., 2015</xref>). Given that our therapeutic antibodies selectively, potently, and transiently inhibit each of the distinct Notch receptors and ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tran et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yu et al., 2020</xref>), they constitute ideal tools to dissect the contribution of each of these pathway members to sebocyte differentiation in adult homeostatic skin. Leveraging the use of these antibodies, we demonstrate that specific inhibition of the Jag2 ligand or Notch1 receptor both result in the loss of mature sebocytes in the SG, establishing the Jag2/Notch1 signaling axis as a crucial regulator of sebocyte differentiation in adult homeostatic skin. The loss of mature sebocytes in the SG is concomitant with an accumulation of cells with a basal phenotype, forming epithelial remnants in the SG. Cells in these epithelial remnants are actively proliferating and express stem/progenitor markers indicating that sebocyte differentiation is halted, while stem/progenitor numbers are increased. Importantly, this phenotype is reversible, as these epithelial cells re-enter differentiation with the return of Notch activity. Thus, Notch activity is required in sebocyte stem/progenitor cells for their proper differentiation, and its inhibition locks these cells in a reversible progenitor state.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Jag2 is the dominant Notch signaling ligand involved in regulating sebocyte differentiation</title><p>To investigate the role of Notch signaling in the homeostatic skin, we treated 8- wk-old mice with a single dose of the various antagonizing antibodies (anti-Notch1, anti-Notch2, anti-Jag1, anti-Jag2, and the isotype control antibody anti-Ragweed) alone or in combination. We then examined the dorsal, resting phase (telogen) skin at 3, 7, and 14 d post-treatment. We first confirmed that our antibodies could reproduce the requirement of Notch1 in regulating sebocyte differentiation. To this end, we treated mice with Notch1 (aN1) and Notch2 (aN2) blocking antibodies and examined the SGs at 7 d post-treatment. Loss of mature sebocytes was observed specifically after aN1 treatment, while the aN2-treated SGs showed normal morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c and d</xref>). However, the combined treatment of aN1N2 had a more pronounced effect on SG morphology as compared to aN1 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c and d</xref>), indicating that Notch2 also contributes to regulating sebocyte differentiation, possibly as a compensatory mechanism after inhibition of the dominant Notch1 receptor.</p><p>Next, we investigated which ligand formed the signaling pair with Notch1. Loss of mature sebocytes was observed specifically after treatment with the Jag2 blocking antibody (aJ2), but not after treatment with the Jag1 blocking antibody (aJ1) at 7 d post-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e and f</xref>). For aJ2 treatment, the loss of sebocytes began at 3 d post treatment, but affected only a small proportion of the SGs at this time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). However, by 7 ds post-treatment, most SGs had either completely lost all sebocytes, or had only some sebocytes remaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). The loss-of-sebocyte phenotype was most pronounced with a combined treatment of Jag1/Jag2 blocking antibodies (aJ1J2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>), suggesting that while Jag2 is the primary Notch ligand involved in regulating sebocyte differentiation, Jag1 also plays a minor role in this process, but is unable to produce a phenotype on its own. In conclusion, these data indicate that the Jag2-Notch1 signaling axis is the dominant Notch ligand-receptor pair required for sebocyte differentiation in the adult skin.</p><p>We also examined the percentage of SGs consisting of bursting sebocytes releasing sebum as a proxy of a functional sebaceous duct. There were no significant differences between treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a and b</xref>), hinting at a functionally intact sebaceous duct.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Notch is active in the sebaceous gland stem cells</title><p>We next characterized the expression of the relevant receptor and ligand in the SG to develop a spatial map of Notch activity in this tissue. Both the Notch receptors and their ligands are transmembrane proteins that interact with each other in neighboring cells to activate the pathway. To examine this interaction, we performed a triple stain for the cleaved (active) form of the Notch1 intracellular domain (ICD), and Notch1 and Jag2 in situ hybridization (ISH) probes at 3 d post antibody treatment. In the control treated mice, Notch1 ICD was observed in the basal stem cell compartment of the SG, but not in the differentiating sebocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–c</xref>, cell types based on morphology). We saw a similar pattern of N1ICD-positive cells for aJ1 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d–f</xref>). Notch1 signaling was not active in all basal cells, as only ~50% of them were positive for N1ICD after control and aJ1 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>). Consistent with previous studies, the majority of these N1ICD + cells were present near the proximal tip of the SG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a–c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Veniaminova et al., 2019</xref>), where the initial sebocyte differentiation has been proposed to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kretzschmar et al., 2014</xref>). However, after aJ2 treatment, Notch1 activity (ICD staining) was absent, or observed only at very low levels in the basal stem cells, while they still expressed Notch1 and Jag2 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h–j</xref>). Strikingly, we noticed the expression of both Notch1 ISH and Jag2 ISH in the same cell on most N1ICD + cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2k</xref>). Interestingly, a majority of all basal cells (including N1ICD- cells), expressed both N1 and Jag2 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1d</xref>). Our data shows that the vast majority of SG basal stem cells express both the ligand and receptor, but only some basal stem cells experience active Notch signaling at any one point in time, as evidenced by the presence of N1ICD. This could be a technical limitation as the triple staining only captures a temporal snapshot of the basal stem cells, with the N1 + J2 mRNA positive cells going on to express N1ICD later, or it could hint towards a more complex regulatory mechanism involved in activating Notch signaling.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Notch is active in the sebaceous gland stem cells.</title><p>(<bold>a–c</bold>) Representative triple stain images for N1ICD, Notch1, and Jag2 mRNA in sebaceous glands (SGs) from mice (n=5 each) treated with aRW, 3 d post-treatment.

There were no significant differences in the number of Lrig1 positive stem cells per SG, or the AR-expressing progenitor population between treatments at 3 d post-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d and e</xref>).

To determine whether the loss of sebocyte phenotype was reversible, we examined the SGs 14 d post single-dose treatment. Intriguingly, mature sebocytes begin to recover at this time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a and b</xref>, compared with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f and g</xref>). We hypothesized that the sebocyte recovery must be due to the return of Notch activity after antibody washout. To test this, we examined the SGs for Notch activity at 7 d post-treatment, since the return of Notch activity must precede the recovery of mature sebocytes. Fittingly, we observed N1ICD expression return in some of the basal-like cells at this time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c and d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a–d</xref>). The percent of N1ICD positive cells per SG strongly increased from 1% at 3 d post-treatment to 29% at 7 d post-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>), even though the percentage of N1ICD positive cells per SG remained significantly lower than control for aJ2 and aJ1J2 treated SGs at this time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1d</xref>). Next, we examined the SGs at 14 d post-treatment for mature sebocyte markers to confirm the sebocyte recovery. Indeed, we saw the return of cells expressing adipophilin in the aJ2 and aJ1J2 treated SGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f and g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1e–h</xref>). There was an overall increase in the number of these cells from day 7 to day 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5h</xref>), even though the number of these cells remained significantly lower in these SGs compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1h</xref>). Interestingly, the majority of the adipophilin-expressing cells were found in the proximal third of the SG (51% for aJ2 treatment and 66% for aJ1J2 treatment), consistent with the initiation of sebocyte differentiation at the proximal tip. However, there was a significant proportion of these cells found in the middle third (22% and 25%, respectively), and distal third (27% and 9%, respectively) of the SG. This could be due to the newly differentiated cells moving through the SG in a proximal to distal direction, as is the case during normal homeostasis. Alternatively, the stem cells could also be differentiating at sites other than just the proximal tip, as previously demonstrated by multi-color lineage tracing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersen et al., 2019</xref>). We further examined the SGs at 14 d post-treatment for their AR expression, and confirmed that it had also been restored to its normal pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5i and j</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1i–l</xref>). We also found that the average number of AR-expressing cells decreased from day 7 to day 14 post aJ2 and aJ1J2 treatment (10–2.95, and 8.56–5.55, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5k</xref>), returning to a more homeostatic state. Together, these data indicate that Notch inhibition does not result in a permanent cell fate switch, but maintains the stem/progenitor state, allowing the recovery of the differentiation process with the restoration of Notch activity.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The block in sebocyte differentiation is lifted upon recovery of Notch activity.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Representative hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) images of sebaceous glands (SGs) from mice (n=5 each) treated with aRW, aJ1, aJ2, and aJ1J2, 14 d post treatment.

Thus, Notch signaling is required to prevent unregulated stem/progenitor proliferation, and induction of the sebocyte differentiation program. Moreover, Notch inhibition resulting in complete loss of mature sebocyte differentiation is a reversible phenotype, indicating that there remains a functional progenitor pool present during the studied timeframe.</p><p>Here, we have leveraged the use of monoclonal therapeutic antibodies designed to inhibit each of the distinct Notch receptors or ligands to study the role of Notch signaling in adult homeostatic tissue. We have shown that Jag2 is the hitherto unknown ligand involved in regulating sebocyte differentiation. Inhibition of Notch signaling using Jag2 blocking antibodies results in the loss of mature sebocytes, with the resulting SG being filled with basal-like cells forming ‘finger-like’ epithelial remnants. A similar phenotype has been described by a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Veniaminova et al., 2019</xref>) that used Lrig1-CreERT2 to irreversibly knock out RBPJ in adult homeostatic skin. This strategy enabled inhibition of Notch signaling specifically in the Lrig1 + stem cell population that normally maintains the SGs, but preserved it in the rest of the hair follicle. Interestingly, the authors saw two contradictory phenotypes as a result: overall loss of SG lobes, replaced by the finger-like epithelial remnants, as well as the presence of persistent SGs that were enlarged. The authors showed that over time, patches of Rbpj mutant cells extended out of their niche into the IFE, where Lrig1 is not expressed, and that loss of RBPJ in the IFE led to enlarged SGs. They argue that while Notch signaling promotes sebocyte differentiation in the SG stem cells, it indirectly suppresses these glands from the IFE. Our results did not show the enlarged SG phenotype, and we only observed the finger-like epithelial remnants. While injections of the Notch blocking antibodies are systemic, we only observed a reduction in the number of Notch-active cells in the IFE, but not a complete loss. This could explain why we didn’t observe the enlarged SG phenotype. Additionally, we observed the phenotype as early as 3 d post antibody treatment, while Veniaminova et al., observed the SGs 10 wk after tamoxifen injection. These differences are likely due to the different methodologies used in the two studies.</p><p>Several studies indicate that Notch signaling is essential for the postnatal maintenance of SGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blanpain et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Estrach et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Estrach et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Watt et al., 2008</xref>), but so far only Veniaminova et al., have specifically examined SGs in the adult homeostatic skin. They observed that the stem/progenitor and differentiation markers were intermingled in the finger-like remnants forming an unnatural hybrid state, neither staying in a true progenitor state nor differentiating. In contrast, we observed a complete block in differentiation, with the stem/progenitor cells being locked in an immature proliferative state. These observations suggest that antagonistic antibodies may be able to achieve a more complete inhibition of Notch signaling in the SG stem/progenitor compartment.</p><p>Importantly, we were able to show that the loss-of-sebocyte phenotype in the SG is reversible. Having used therapeutic antibodies to block Notch signaling, the inhibition of the signaling pathway was not permanent. As Notch activity returned to the SG after antibody washout, sebocyte differentiation also recovered. These data indicate that the loss of Notch signaling does not impact the stem/progenitor potential of the SG, but prevents further differentiation. Indeed, a functional progenitor pool accumulates in the SG, primed for differentiation, as soon as Notch signaling becomes active. A recent study by Veniaminova et al., has shown that Lrig1-CreERT2 used to irreversibly knock out <italic>Pparg</italic> in adult homeostatic skin ablates 99% of the SGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Veniaminova et al., 2023</xref>). Interestingly, they showed that non-recombined cells from other parts of the hair follicle migrate to the SG zone and regenerate the genetically ablated SGs. This regeneration process is dependent on the hair growth cycle, with the SGs primarily regenerating during the anagen (active growth) phase and not in the telogen phase. While our studies cannot rule out the contribution of non-SG cells to the SG recovery seen upon the return of Notch activity, this recovery is not dependent on the hair growth cycle. Sebocytes are able to differentiate while the hair follicle is still in the telogen phase, indicating a lift of the differentiation block on the stem/progenitor cells. This reversibility of phenotype is intriguing from a therapeutic perspective, as it suggests a translational potential in skin disorders involving sebocyte overactivity, such as acne.</p><p>An important open question is how Notch signaling regulates sebocyte differentiation. FASN, which can be used as a readout for sebocyte differentiation, is a downstream target of AR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Schirra et al., 2005</xref>). We observed a Lrig1+/AR+/FASN- population in the normal SGs, similar to the basal-like cells that fill the finger-like remnants seen after Notch inhibition. This expression pattern indicates that AR requires a co-activator to activate downstream gene expression in the SG. Previous studies have reported that Notch effectors such as HEY1, HEY2, and HEYL can act as co-repressors of AR in prostate cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belandia et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kamińska et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lavery et al., 2011</xref>). It is possible that certain Notch effectors can act as either co-activators or co-repressors of AR in a context-dependent manner. Further investigation will be needed to understand the exact molecular role Notch signaling plays in regulating sebocyte differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

By injecting antagonising antibodies against different Notch receptors and ligands into mice, the authors identified that the Notch1 receptor and, to a lesser extent, Notch2 receptor, as well as the Notch ligand Jagged2, contribute to the regulation of sebaceous gland differentiation. In situ hybridisation confirmed that treatment with anti-Jagged2 dramatically reduced the number of basal sebocytes staining for the transcriptionally active intracellular domain of Notch1. Loss of Notch activity in sebocyte progenitors robustly inhibited sebaceous gland differentiation. Under these conditions, the number of sebocyte progenitors marked by Lrig1 was not affected, while the number of proliferating basal sebocytes was increased. Upon recovery of Notch activity, sebaceous gland differentiation could likewise be recovered. By suggesting that Notch activity in sebocyte progenitors is required to balance proliferation and differentiation, these data bring valuable new and relevant findings for the skin field on the sebaceous gland homeostasis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.98747.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Abidi</surname><given-names>Syeda Nayab Fatima</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Genentech</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">South San Francisco</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chan</surname><given-names>Sara</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Genentech</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">South San Francisco</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Seidel</surname><given-names>Kerstin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Genentech</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">South San Francisco</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lafkas</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Genentech</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">South San Francisco</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Vermeulen</surname><given-names>Louis</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Genentech</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">South San Francisco</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Peale</surname><given-names>Frank</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Genentech</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">South San Francisco</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Siebel</surname><given-names>Christian W</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Genentech</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">South San Francisco</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><p>We thank the editors and reviewers for their thoughtful comments on our manuscript.

Why aJ1 doesn't have any effect? (same is true in other figures). If the data on aJ1 are maintained in the manuscript, this should be argued in the discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct in noting that the aJ1 treatment does not cause the phenotype, and this is indeed one of the key findings of the study. This is maintained throughout the manuscript. We have also cited references showing that embryonic and adult deletions of <italic>Jag1</italic> do not cause any sebaceous gland defects. All these data argue that Jag1 is not the relevant Notch signaling ligand in sebocyte differentiation. We have further clarified this in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2.3) Related to Figure 3G. As the Lrig1 stem cells can go towards both the sebocyte differentiation, or the sebaceous duct differentiation, it would be interesting to evaluate if the differentiation impairment caused by the antibody treatment affects in a similar manner (or not) the sebaceous duct differentiation. This could be tested through immunofluorescence, selecting markers of sebaceous duct.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this thoughtful question. We are unable to find any unique markers of the sebaceous ducts (that are not expressed in other parts of the sebaceous gland, especially sebocytes) in the literature, thus, any analysis of markers would be confounded by its change of expression due to the loss of sebocytes.</p><p>However, we have evaluated the histology using bursting sebocytes releasing sebum as a proxy of a functional sebaceous duct. We have not found any significant differences between treatments using this metric (Fig. S1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2.4) As the word &quot;therapeutic&quot; is often underlined in the manuscript, maybe a few sentences on the transnational aspects of the results could be added to the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this point. We have added this to the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2.5) Figure 3 suggests that Jag2 is produced by basal sebocytes and used by these cells to induce sebocyte differentiation. I'm wondering if in an in vitro cell system (with a mixture of marked Jag2-expressing cells and marked Jag2-negative cells), it would be possible to understand if this mechanism of differentiation is a cell-autonomous mechanism or a mechanism based on cell competition (for instance, it would be possible that the progenitors compete for their niche on the basal layer by pushing neighbouring basal cells to differentiate presenting them Jag2).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the insightful suggestion. The mechanistic underpinning of how Notch signaling induces sebocyte differentiation is still unclear, and we find the reviewer’s suggestion very interesting. However, establishing an <italic>in vitro</italic> model that captures the aspects mentioned, would require a lot of optimization and validation. To help rapid dissemination of our findings we elected to keep this out of the manuscript, but we will certainly consider it for future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(3.1) The authors focussed on mouse back skin sebaceous glands to analyse the phenotype. Are the effects also reproducible in the sebaceous glands of the mouse ears and tail epidermis? If so, the data should be strengthened by quantifying the phenotype using tail epidermal whole mounts (Braun et al., 2003; Development, PMID: 12954714), ideally by co-staining sebaceous glands for differentiation markers (e.g. FASN, Adipophilin) or lipid deposits (e.g., Oil red O). Also, the authors need to clarify how many sebaceous glands were scored per mouse. If not, please provide a rationale explaining the location restriction.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. Indeed, we have only incorporated data from the telogen dorsal skin of the animals. We have now more accurately reflected this in the revised manuscript. Additionally, we have added the number of sebaceous glands quantified in each figure per the reviewer’s suggestion.</p><p>Since the stage of hair growth cycle can affect the sebaceous glands, we chose the resting (telogen) phase of the hair cycle to reliably study the sebaceous glands. At 8 weeks of age, hair follicles have uniformly entered the telogen phase. As subsequent re-entry into the anagen phase is asynchronous in the adult skin, the color of the dorsal skin of C57BL/6 mice can be used to determine whether the hair follicles are in the telogen phase or not. These reasons led us to choose this location, allowing us to study only telogen phase hair follicles.</p><p>We also point out that previously reported data (Estrach et al., 2006) did not show differences between dorsal and tail skin, so we assume the mechanisms must largely be conserved. However, as the reviewer rightfully points out, we cannot be sure and have, therefore, indicated the dorsal location throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3.2) The micrographs in Figure 2 suggest that expression of both Jagged2 and Notch1 (intercellular domain) is not restricted to the sebaceous glands, as both molecules appear to be detected also in the isthmus and lower hair follicle. Of note, the online tool provided by the Kasper and Linnarsson labs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://linnarssonlab.org/epidermis">http://linnarssonlab.org/epidermis</ext-link>/) shows that both molecules are more widely expressed in mouse back skin. Please provide some analysis of the overall expression of these molecules in mouse skin. In line, is the observed effect of using the antagonising antibodies restricted to the sebaceous glands? Please provide additional data on proliferation and differentiation in the interfollicular epidermis, hair follicle cycling, and other skin compartments. For instance, the data published in the cited paper by Lafkas et al. (2005) suggest a thickening of the dermal adipocyte layer upon Jagged2 inhibition using monoclonal therapeutic antibodies.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct in noting that expression of both Jag2 and Notch1 is not restricted to the sebaceous gland. The Notch signaling pathway is a well-known regulator for epidermal differentiation, and members of the pathway are expressed in various locations of the skin, including the interfollicular epidermis and the hair follicle. The expression and function of Notch signaling in these locations has been reviewed in (Hsu et al., 2014; Nowell and Radtke, 2013; Watt et al., 2008). We have also added zoomed out images showing expression of Jag2 and Notch1 in the skin (Figure S2e,f).</p><p>The effect of the antagonizing antibodies is not restricted to sebaceous glands, as we already noted in our discussion section: “While injections of the Notch blocking antibodies are systemic, we only observed a reduction in the number of Notch-active cells in the IFE, but not a complete loss.” The functional impact of the antibodies is likely beyond the sebaceous gland, as the reviewer points out, but understanding the full effect in other compartments, we consider beyond the scope of the current study.</p><p>In our previous study (Lafkas et al., 2015), the skin was examined at different animal ages/gender and using different antibody dosing regimens, which is the likely explanation for the differences observed. We have now quantified the width of the adipocyte layer and the IFE and show that there are no significant differences between treatments (Figure S1g-j). This together with the histology suggest that there are no significant differences in the differentiation and proliferation of these compartments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3.3) Since Jagged1 is a Wnt/beta-catenin target gene that is essential for (ectopic) hair follicle formation and differentiation (Estrach et al., 2006, Development, PMID: 17035290) and the sebaceous gland is widely considered as an epidermal compartment with absent/low Wnt/beta-catenin pathway activity during normal homeostasis (Lim &amp; Nusse, 2013, Cold Spring Habor Perspectives in Biology, PMID: 23209129), how is the expression of Notch1 and Jagged2 regulated upstream in sebocyte progenitors? It would be important to bring some more mechanistic insights into the upstream regulation of Notch activity. In line with comment 2, how are the compartment-specific effects molecularly regulated if the effects are not restricted to the sebaceous glands?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct in noting that the Wnt pathway does not seem to be a likely candidate for driving sebocyte differentiation through Notch signaling. Indeed, Wnt inhibition is required for sebocyte differentiation (Merrill et al., 2001; Niemann et al., 2002), and the <italic>Jag2</italic> promoter region also does not contain TCF binding sites (Katoh and Katoh, 2006).</p><p>We speculate that Myc might regulate Notch signaling in the sebaceous gland. It is expressed in the sebaceous gland basal stem cells and has been reported to positively regulate sebocyte differentiation (Cottle et al., 2013). In addition, studies have shown that <italic>Jag2</italic> is a Myc target gene (Fiaschetti et al., 2014; Yustein et al., 2010). However, evaluating which upstream pathway potentially regulates Notch signaling, and resolving the regulatory network of sebocyte differentiation beyond the direct Notch ligands and receptors would require extensive <italic>in vivo</italic> modeling using KO and transgenic animals, which we consider to be beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p><p>References</p><p>Cottle DL, Kretzschmar K, Schweiger PJ, Quist SR, Gollnick HP, Natsuga K, Aoyagi S, Watt FM. 2013. c-MYC-Induced Sebaceous Gland Differentiation Is Controlled by an Androgen Receptor/p53 Axis. <italic>Cell Rep</italic> 3:427–441. doi:10.1016/j.celrep.2013.01.013</p><p>Estrach S, Ambler CA, Celso CLL, Hozumi K, Watt FM. 2006.
