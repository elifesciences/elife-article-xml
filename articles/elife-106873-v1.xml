remembering a list of words or navigating a new city, has important implications for everyday life. Yet, understanding what brain changes in humans underlies the acquisition of complex cognitive skills remains unresolved. Here, we developed and validated intensive multiweek interventions in which participants were randomly assigned training in either navigation or verbal memory. Healthy young participants (N=75) underwent structural and functional imaging prior to and following the training. Based on pre-registered and exploratory analyses, we did not find any evidence for changes to gross hippocampal or hippocampal subfield volume, cortical brain volume, or microstructural properties of major white matter tracts due to the training. In contrast, network-based analyses suggested changes in task-related informational connectivity, which occurred primarily between cortical areas and mostly involved putative cognitive control networks. These results suggest that cognitive interventions target more transient configurations in network connectivity rather than more durable structural changes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Learning new cognitive skills, such as navigating an unfamiliar city or remembering long lists of words, is a fundamental part of daily life. Yet, scientists still do not fully understand how the brain changes as these skills are acquired. Previous studies have often focused on experts, like London taxi drivers or memory champions, whose brains may have developed structural differences over many years of training. But it remains unclear how short-term training affects the brains of typical healthy adults.</p><p>To explore this question, Zheng et al. designed two intensive training programs that lasted for several weeks. One taught people how to navigate complex virtual environments, and the other trained them to remember long sequences of words. Young adults completed brain scans before and after the training. The researchers then measured brain structures (such as the size of the hippocampus, a region important for memory and navigation) and assessed how different brain regions interacted during cognitive tasks.</p><p>The results revealed that participants became significantly better at skills they had practiced, showing faster learning and improved performance. However, their brain structure did not change; there were no differences in hippocampal volume, cortical thickness, or the microstructure of white matter pathways. Instead, the most noticeable changes occurred in how brain regions communicated with one another during memory and navigation tasks. Networks of brain regions reorganized their patterns of activity, especially in areas involved in cognitive control, suggesting that the brain adapts to new challenges primarily by altering how its existing circuits work together rather than by growing new tissue.</p><p>These findings reveal that, at least in the early stages of learning complex skills, the brain’s functional networks are more flexible and responsive than its physical structure. This insight could help inform the design of cognitive training programs and rehabilitation strategies by highlighting the importance of targeting dynamic brain activity rather than structural changes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>navigation</kwd><kwd>verbal memory</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>cognitive training</kwd><kwd>brain networks</kwd><kwd>functional connectivity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01cwqze88</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21NS120237-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ekstrom</surname><given-names>Arne</given-names></name><name><surname>Weisberg</surname><given-names>Steven M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01cwqze88</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K01AG070333-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weisberg</surname><given-names>Steven M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00cvnc278</institution-id><institution>Arizona Alzheimer’s Consortium</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Pilot Project grant program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Learning new navigation or memory skills engages flexible brain network dynamics without altering gray matter, white matter, or hippocampal structure.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Improving cognitive skills can contribute positively to multiple aspects of daily life, such as education and professional endeavors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Edwards et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kraft et al., 2023</xref>). Yet, the neural changes underlying cognitive skill acquisition remain an unresolved question in cognitive neuroscience, limiting our ability to target interventions designed to improve these skills. Some past studies have suggested a relationship between cognitive skills and focal gray matter volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boyke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Draganski et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Draganski et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Engvig et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hänggi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maguire et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wenger et al., 2021</xref>), although many of these studies have involved comparison of experts with non-experts or specialized populations (e.g. older adults with cognitive decline). Therefore, it remains unclear whether gray matter volume differences underlie the behavioral changes that occur as part of new cognitive skill acquisition and whether the same mechanisms apply to healthy younger adults. Other studies have suggested the importance of changes in either the recruitment of specific brain areas (i.e. functional activation) or interactions between brain regions (i.e. functional connectivity) that may not result in macroscopic structural changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Braun et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dresler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kraft et al., 2023</xref>). Resolving the neural mechanism(s) underlying the acquisition of new cognitive skills in healthy populations, with the potential for maximal behavioral improvement, is important so we can determine how to target interventions in future studies.</p><p> One possibility is that training different cognitive skills leads to changes in similar underlying neural mechanisms by training a cognitive process or enhancing function in a brain region common to both skills. Past studies suggest such overlap for a brain region thought to be broadly important to memory, the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buzsáki and Moser, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Spiers et al., 2001</xref>). People with better navigation and/or verbal memory skills typically have larger hippocampi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brunec et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maguire et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Poppenk et al., 2013</xref>), although this finding has not been consistently replicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clark et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Weisberg et al., 2019</xref>). Alternatively, it might be that learning different cognitive skills targets only partially overlapping or even independent brain networks, which in turn might hint at why transfer of newly trained cognitive skills to other cognitive domains is often modest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sala and Gobet, 2017</xref>). For example, some studies suggest only partial overlap between navigation and verbal memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ekstrom and Hill, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Weisberg and Newcombe, 2016</xref>), and it is possible that some of the observed differences between experts and non-experts in past studies arose due to partial overlap between verbal memory and navigation. For example, when comparing expert navigators, street and landmark names would be intertwined with wayfinding skills, and thus it is important to determine whether superior verbal memory or navigation skills underlie greater hippocampal volume.</p><p>One issue with comparing experts and non-experts is that they involve between-participant designs, which may be underpowered compared to within-participant approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Marek et al., 2022</xref>) and may introduce other uncontrolled variables. One potential way to address this issue is to employ a within-participant manipulation to measure how a brain region such as the hippocampus (and connected brain networks) might change in the same participant as a result of training. Successful cognitive interventions suggest that targeted within-participant cognitive training, even for as little as 1–2 weeks, can result in improvements to specific cognitive functions, including changes in focal gray matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chavan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Colom et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Draganski et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Driemeyer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lövdén et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miró-Padilla et al., 2021</xref>); but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ganesan et al., 2024</xref>. In some instances, interventions may even generalize to areas not explicitly trained but closely related to the training (termed ‘near transfer’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jaeggi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Judd and Klingberg, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Karbach and Verhaeghen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schmiedek et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schweizer et al., 2013</xref>). We developed and pre-registered two cognitive training regimens in which we attempted to separately target navigation and verbal memory skills. This allowed us to address the following novel theoretical questions: (1) What neural changes, if any, result from an intensive within-participant intervention that improves memory or navigation skills in healthy young adults? (2) If such changes occur, what is the degree of neural overlap between the acquisition of these cognitive skills?</p><p>Here, we tested three different cohorts of healthy young adults using two different cognitive interventions, each consisting of 10 training sessions targeting either navigation or verbal memory. A third active control group watched educational videos containing information about navigation and verbal memory but did not receive explicit training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gobet and Sala, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Simons et al., 2016</xref>). Before and after training, participants underwent high-resolution structural imaging targeting the hippocampus (T2), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), whole brain structural imaging (T1), and task-related functional imaging during a spatial and temporal associative memory task to understand how the hippocampus and related brain networks changed. We pre-registered three novel and specific hypotheses, which are described in more detail here (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/etxvj">https://osf.io/etxvj</ext-link>): (1) targeted training over two weeks will result in improvements in navigation or verbal memory, (2) improvements will be specific to the trained task and will transfer to a separate behavioral measure of that skill (‘near transfer’), (3 a) if the hippocampus is central to navigation, hippocampal volume should increase from pre-test to post-test following navigation training but not verbal memory training or the video control condition, (3b) if the hippocampus is central to verbal memory, hippocampal volume should increase from pre-test to post-test in the Verbal Memory group but not in the Navigation or Video Control groups, or (3 c) alternatively, hippocampal volume does not reflect acquisition of new verbal memory nor navigation skills. As part of planned exploratory analyses, we also examined changes in microstructural properties of major white matter tracts (DWI), gray matter volume outside of the medial temporal lobes, functional changes to individual brain regions (i.e. univariate functional activation), and changes to brain networks (i.e. task-related informational connectivity).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Behavioral results</title><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Training-related effects</title><p>Participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions, each of which consisted of 10 training sessions, separated by at least one day over the course of approximately 4–8 weeks (4.12±1.87 weeks). Each training session lasted 2 hr. In the navigation training condition, we recruited a total of 29 participants, with 27 successfully completing 10 sessions of navigation training in a large city-scale virtual environment (‘Virtual Arida’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> left). Briefly, participants were placed at one building and given the name of another building to find. Participants traveled to and from that pair of buildings until they were able to take a path not exceeding 120% of the shortest possible path. Upon reaching the criterion, they navigated between a new pair of landmarks. After one subsection of Virtual Arida was learned completely, participants were trained on integrating that subsection with previously learned subsections, with no more than one subsection learned in a day (see Methods). To quantify the training effect, we analyzed the average distance error traveled and normalized it by 120% of the length of the shortest possible path. While all 27 participants learned subsections A (although data was lost due to technical reasons for one participant), B, and A-B integration, 26 participants progressed to C, while 23 made it to A-B-C integration. 19 participants made it to subsection D, and 14 participants made it to A-B-C-D integration. Thus, to determine the training effect, we performed a repeated-measures ANOVA with subsection as the only factor and threshold-normalized distance error as the dependent measure.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental design.</title><p>Participants were randomly assigned to one of three training conditions as follows. (<bold>a</bold>) In the verbal memory training condition (n=27), participants underwent 10 sessions of verbal memory training involving word free recall after a distractor task, with list complexity increasing over sessions. To quantify the training effect, we conducted a linear regression analysis on the maximum number of correctly recalled words for each day. The slopes of the regression lines for the first 5 days and the last 5 days were calculated separately, and both slopes were significantly greater than zero, indicating a significant improvement in memory performance over the training period: first 5 days, t(26) = 16.971, p&lt;0.001; last 5 days, t(26) = 23.579, p&lt;0.001. (<bold>b</bold>) In the navigation training condition (n=27), participants trained in a large virtual environment, navigating between buildings until optimal paths were learned. Subsections of the environment were integrated progressively across sessions. Participants improved over the course of the training, showing higher error initially for subsection A (M=79.09, SD = 33.22) compared to subsection B (M=65.52, SD = 26.89), which was significantly reduced for subsection C (M=47.44, SD = 31.22). (<bold>c</bold>) In the active control condition (n=21), participants watched videos related to memory and navigation, answering multiple-choice questions afterward, with accuracy consistently above 50%, indicating engagement.

In sum, participants improved both in learning new subsections of our large virtual training environment and in integrating multiple areas of the training environment together, suggesting that the navigation training resulted in significant reductions in path error over the course of the training.</p><p>In the verbal memory condition, we recruited a total of 32 participants, with 27 successfully completing 10 sessions of training. Briefly, participants viewed words for one second (one at a time), completed math problems as a distractor after all words were presented, and then recalled as many words as they could by typing them in any order they wished. They were trained on a time-based method of loci (‘temporal method of loci’) to improve their verbal memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bouffard et al., 2018</xref>). During the first five sessions, participants learned the same list of words, with the list growing in length after each successful trial (Same Word List, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> left). In the last five sessions, a new list of words was used for each trial (New Word List, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> left; see Methods). To quantify the training effect, we conducted a linear regression analysis on the maximum number of correctly recalled words for each day. The slopes of the regression lines for the first 5 days and the last 5 days were calculated separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> right), as the training paradigm differed between these two phases (see Methods). Both slopes were significantly greater than zero, indicating a significant improvement in memory performance over the training period: first 5 days, t(26) = 16.971, p&lt;0.001; last 5 days, t(26) = 23.579, p&lt;0.001. This effect remained significant after controlling for sex and site (Appendix 1), suggesting robust improvements in verbal memory performance as a result of the training.</p><p>In the active control condition, we recruited a total of 22 participants, with 21 successfully completing 10 sessions of watching videos. These videos included interviews, lectures, documentaries, and TV series on topics related to memory and navigation. After watching the videos for that session, participants responded to multiple-choice questions. We did not expect to find a training effect (i.e. improved performance on the questions over sessions), but did find that the percentage of correct responses each day was significantly higher than a 50% guess rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref> right, <italic>ts</italic>(20) &gt; 8.28, p<italic>s</italic> &lt;0.001, mean = 88.58%, SD = 5.82%), indicating that participants were engaged with the video content.</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-2"><title>Pre-test and post-test behavioral transfer</title><p>We administered a set of cognitive tests related to navigation and verbal memory before and after training to track transfer from the training. This involved learning a large virtual environment not related to the training (i.e. Navigation Transfer task: Virtual Silcton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Weisberg et al., 2014</xref>) and learning an untrained list of 12 words (i.e. Verbal Memory Transfer task) until all could be recalled perfectly (or after five trials). When we considered our pre-registered dependent measures specific to verbal memory (average number of words recalled, number of trials to criteria, and slope) and navigation (path error of Navigation Transfer task, pointing error of Navigation Pointing task, and map accuracy of Navigation Model Building task), we found some evidence of improvements in slope specific to the verbal memory training group and path error specific to the navigation training group. The other dependent measures, however, did not show any clear evidence of a training-specific benefit (see Appendix 1). We derived an exploratory measure that allowed us to compare between navigation and verbal memory, termed ‘<italic>learning rate’</italic>. The learning rate attempts to capture how quickly a participant might learn new information at post-test given that they were trained in improving their acquisition of this information. For example, participants who underwent navigation training should show a smaller difference in path distance on the first ten trials compared to the last ten at post-test compared to pre-test, reflective of faster learning due to the training (see Methods).</p><p>To quantify the learning rate for the Navigation Transfer task, a mixed-design ANOVA was conducted with condition (Navigation/Verbal Memory/Video Control) as a between-subjects factor and session (pre/post) as a within-subjects factor. This analysis revealed a significant main effect of session (F(1,70) = 37.52, p&lt;0.001, η<sup>2</sup>=0.202) and a marginally significant main effect of condition (F(2, 70)=2.66, p=0.08, η<sup>2</sup>=0.028), with no significant interaction between condition and session (F(2, 70)=1.82, p=0.17, η<sup>2</sup>=0.020).

We investigated this issue by collecting fMRI data both pre- and post-training during a source memory encoding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>) and retrieval task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). During the encoding phase, participants learned objects by placing them within either an autobiographical timeline (temporal) or a familiar spatial layout (spatial). During the retrieval phase, they saw the objects again and indicated which of the ‘sources’ (spatial or temporal) they had placed the object in. Because we trained the Verbal Memory group to use the temporal method of loci but trained the Navigation group to learn spatial locations, we reasoned that training-specific strategies might lead to context-specific changes (i.e. depending on whether the object was encoded in time or space) that would be reflected in network changes during the source memory tasks. We performed a univariate analysis across the whole brain and an informational connectivity analysis using 242 pre-defined brain regions involved in spatial processing and memory (see Methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>).

For the Verbal Memory group, we observed significantly increased informational connectivity at post-test compared to pre-test (i.e. post &gt;pre), relative to the combined Navigation and Video Control groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Specifically, we found enhanced connectivity between the left precuneus and left angular gyrus (t=3.94, p&lt;0.05), the right lateral occipital cortex (LOC) and left intracalcarine (visual) cortex (t=3.63, p&lt;0.05), and the right LOC and left superior parietal lobule (SPL) (t=4.16, p&lt;0.05). In contrast, no significant decreases in informational connectivity (i.e. post &lt;pre) were observed. Considering spatial and temporal encoding separately, for the Verbal Memory group during spatial encoding, we found enhanced informational connectivity from pre-test to post-test (i.e. post &gt;pre) between the frontal cortex and visual cortex (see Appendix 1 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). For temporal encoding, increased connectivity from pre- to post-test (i.e. post &gt;pre) was observed between the frontal cortex and temporal gyrus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). No significant decreases in informational connectivity from pre-test to post-test (i.e. post &lt;pre) were observed in the Verbal Memory group relative to the combined Navigation and Video Control groups during either spatial or temporal encoding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>).</p><p>Conversely, for the Navigation group compared to the combined Verbal Memory and Video Control groups, we observed significantly decreased informational connectivity at post-test compared to pre-test (i.e. post &lt;pre). Specifically, reduced connectivity was observed between the left paracingulate gyrus and right middle frontal gyrus (MFG) (t=3.80, p&lt;0.05), left superior frontal gyrus (SFG) and right supramarginal gyrus (SMG) (t=5.14, p&lt;0.05), left frontal pole and right MFG (t=3.85, p&lt;0.05), left dorsal LOC and right ventral LOC (t=3.7, p&lt;0.05) and right MFG and left MFG (t=3.79, p&lt;0.05). In contrast, no significant increases in connectivity were observed from pre- to post-test (i.e. post &gt;pre) for the Navigation group relative to the combined Verbal Memory and Video Control groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>, bottom-left). When considering spatial and temporal encoding separately, during spatial encoding, reduced connectivity was observed from pre-test to post-test (i.e. post &lt;pre) between the primary visual cortex and higher-order visual areas, while increased connectivity was identified from pre-test to post-test (i.e. post &gt;pre) between the parietal and temporal cortices. For temporal encoding, the Navigation group exhibited significant decreases in connectivity from pre-test to post-test (i.e. post &lt;pre) across multiple regions, including the frontal and parietal cortices (see Appendix 1), with no significant increases in connectivity from pre-test to post-test (i.e. post &gt;pre). No significant changes in task-related informational connectivity to the hippocampus survived after multiple comparisons correction for either navigation or verbal memory training. Broadly, these findings suggest changes in informational connectivity specific to each training group (i.e. decreases in informational connectivity from pre-test to post-test in the Navigation group and increases in the Verbal Memory group), with no changes specific to the hippocampus.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3-3"><title>Retrieval phase: increases in information connectivity specific to the Navigation group and decreases specific to the Verbal Memory group</title><p>For the univariate analyses for both spatial and temporal source memory retrieval, no significant changes were observed from pre-test to post-test, nor were there any interactions between session and training condition (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app2table16">Appendix 2—table 16</xref>). When examining spatial and temporal retrieval separately, we similarly found no significant changes from pre-test to post-test and no interactions between session and training group (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app2table16">Appendix 2—table 16</xref>).</p><p>We next examined informational connectivity changes from pre-test to post-test during the source memory retrieval stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>), finding a pattern somewhat opposite to that seen during encoding. In the Verbal Memory group, we observed significantly decreased informational connectivity in post-test compared to pre-test (i.e. post &lt;pre) relative to the combined Navigation and Video Control groups. These reductions were identified between the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and right frontal pole (t=4.01, p&lt;0.05), left frontal pole and right SFG (t=4.48, p&lt;0.05), right medial frontal gyrus and right posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) (t=4.42, p&lt;0.05), right ventral LOC and left temporo-occipital fusiform cortex (TOFC) (t=4.30, p&lt;0.05), and right lingual gyrus and left SPL (t=3.82, p&lt;0.05). No significant increases in connectivity from pre-test to post-test (i.e. post &gt;pre) were observed in the Verbal Memory group relative to the combined Navigation and Video Control groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>, top-left). Considering spatial and temporal source retrieval separately, spatial retrieval showed decreased connectivity from pre- to post-test (i.e. post &lt;pre) between frontal regions (e.g. left and right superior frontal gyri) and between the right frontal pole and PCC, and increased connectivity from pre to post (i.e. post &gt;pre) between temporal and parietal regions (e.g. left middle temporal gyrus [LMTG] and right SMG) and between the visual cortex and right SMG. For temporal retrieval, decreased connectivity from pre-test to post-test (i.e. post &lt;pre) was prominent across multiple regions, including the frontal pole, angular gyrus, precuneus, and lateral occipital cortices. One increase specific to the Verbal Memory group was observed from pre-test to post-test (i.e. post &gt;pre); however, in the left ventral lateral occipital cortex and left MFG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>, see details in Appendix 1).</p><p>In the Navigation group during retrieval, we found significantly increased informational connectivity in the post-test compared to the pre-test (i.e. post &gt;pre) relative to the combined Verbal Memory and Video Control groups. These increases were found between the right occipital pole and dorsal LOC (t=4.27, p&lt;0.05), and the right SPL and right angular gyrus (AG) (t=4.09, p&lt;0.05). Considering spatial and temporal retrieval separately, spatial retrieval showed enhanced connectivity from pre-test to post-test (i.e. post &gt;pre) between regions such as the left frontal pole and the occipital and parahippocampal cortices. Temporal retrieval revealed increases from pre- to post-test (i.e. post &gt;pre) between the precuneus and SFG, lingual gyrus and occipital gyrus, and SFG and MTG. No significant decreases in connectivity were observed from pre-test to post-test (i.e. post &lt;pre) in the Navigation group relative to the combined Verbal Memory and Video Control groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>, bottom).</p><p>Again, no significant changes in task-related informational connectivity during source retrieval were present to the hippocampus when controlling for multiple comparisons. To summarize, verbal memory training resulted in decreased connectivity during retrieval across frontal, parietal, and occipital regions, especially during temporal retrieval, with limited increases. In contrast, navigation training consistently increased connectivity for both spatial and temporal retrieval, particularly between frontal, occipital, parietal, and temporal regions, with no significant decreases observed. These findings suggest that verbal memory primarily alters network connectivity during temporal contextual retrieval, whereas navigation training enhances connectivity more broadly across both contexts.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3-4"><title>Specific changes in network-wide informational connectivity pattern distance during retrieval: Enhanced due to verbal memory but not navigation training</title><p>The above analysis focused on changes in informational connectivity between pre-test and post-test for individual connectivity edges between pairs of ROIs. Next, we examined changes in multivariate informational connectivity patterns, which we defined as the connectivity between a single ROI, and the remaining 241 ROIs. This analysis helped address network-wide changes in connectivity rather than those restricted to two different ROI pairs. Multivariate informational connectivity patterns were extracted separately for spatial and temporal informational connectivity matrices (ICMs), and the distance between the two patterns was computed using 1 r (Pearson’s, see Methods).</p><p>While no significant changes in pattern distance were observed during the encoding stage for any of the three conditions, a greater distance between spatial and temporal patterns in the left SFG network connectivity during source retrieval was found in the Verbal Memory group at post-test compared to pre-test (t(23) = –4.275, p=0.043, FDR corrected; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>).

A similar result was obtained using the Spearman correlation to compute the distance, with a greater distance in the left SFG for the Verbal Memory group at post-test relative to pre-test (t(23) = –4.400, p=0.050, FDR corrected). No significant differences were found in the Navigation or Video Control groups.

As suggested in past work, we are capable of remarkable improvements in performance across a wide range of domains, yet the neural basis for these changes remains unclear. Here, we build on expert training regimens in verbal memory (e.g. the method of loci) and spatial navigation (e.g. London taxi driver training) by employing a within-subject intervention approach to determine the neural correlates of training two related but distinct complex skills: navigation and verbal memory. Our results show that non-expert young adults substantially improved in the task they were trained on and exhibited some limited near transfer (to new lists of words or new environments). Unlike the neuroimaging literature on experts or impaired populations (like older adults or individuals with dementia who cannot perform these tasks as well), we found no evidence that training modified brain structure, as measured by hippocampal volume and DWI microstructure in relevant GM regions and WM tracts. Rather, analyses of task-based functional imaging data showed training-specific differences in informational connectivity, a neural metric that indexes how similar representations are across brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mooraj et al., 2025</xref>). Our findings have implications for both basic research and clinical translation. From a basic research perspective, our results suggest that structural changes in gray and white matter are relatively insensitive to cognitive intervention but are instead reflected in more transient changes to network-based connectivity patterns. From a clinical-translational perspective, our results suggest promise in training new complex cognitive skills such as navigation and verbal memory, although the efficacy of our specific training regimen in clinical populations remains to be tested.</p><p>Our study involved two novel and extensive in-lab training regimens, which shared key features but allowed for dissociable cognitive training. While previous training studies have examined network configurations before and after participants learned the method of loci or evaluated navigation training, these experiments often involved expert groups (memory athletes or London taxi drivers; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maguire et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maguire et al., 2003</xref>), or older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Engvig et al., 2010</xref>). In our experiment, we evaluated healthy young adults while carefully controlling the duration and nature of the verbal memory and navigation trainings to match the intensity and the degree to which the skill was scaffolded. In this way, one training serves as a control for the other, while also allowing us to compare with an active control group who did not gain a complex skill (video control) but was passively exposed to similar material.</p><p>Both training regimens were effective: participants in the Verbal Memory group were able to learn longer word lists, while participants in the Navigation group were able to reduce the length of their paths and required fewer trials to learn landmarks in new subsections of the environment. Yet, it was difficult to ascertain whether either training generalized beyond immediate transfer. Our near transfer measures exhibited strong individual differences at baseline, which were difficult to overcome with 10 sessions of training. Both near transfer measures also likely had practice and ceiling effects, which dampened our ability to measure the effects of training (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig2">Appendix 3—figure 2</xref>). Exploratory analyses, however, revealed training-specific differences in the learning rate on the transfer tasks from pre- to post-test. In addition to good face validity as a match for the skills we were training (that is, for example, in the navigation training, participants learned how to quickly acquire spatial information about the whole environment after only 10 trials compared to those who did not undergo that training), the change in learning rate from pre- to post-test was also the only dependent measure we found to correlate with baseline hippocampal volume. These findings, though exploratory, suggest that baseline hippocampal volume may enable more receptiveness to training, aligning with concepts like neural reserve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stern, 2012</xref>). In addition to replicating these findings, future research using these training regimens should develop a more comprehensive near-transfer measure and evaluate far transfer to completely untrained tasks.</p><p>Our navigation training is particularly notable in that it partially mimics the training undertaken by London taxi drivers, who first learn individual subsections of an environment before connecting these subsections to one another. While other virtual navigation trainings exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lövdén et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McLaren-Gradinaru et al., 2020</xref>), their environments are often small, simplified, or non-hierarchical. Thus, a key contribution of this work is the development of a navigation training environment that is suitable for training wayfinding skills. We also developed a novel verbal memory training paradigm that has not been reported previously in the literature. Using this training, we were able to dramatically increase the number of freely recalled words of the average participant, with the typical participant showing an improvement from about 25–30 words freely recalled (repeated) words on day 1 to 60–65 words after only five days of training.</p><p>Despite the efficacy of the training, neither the Navigation nor the Verbal Memory group showed macroscopic neural structural differences in the hippocampus, which has been linked to verbal memory and/or navigation function in past studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brunec et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burgess et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maguire et al., 2000</xref>). These results supply causal evidence supporting the notion that hippocampal structural changes may not impart superior navigation or verbal memory skills. Although previous work has shown effects of training, to our knowledge, this work has occurred in specialized populations or involved between-subject comparisons. For example, London taxi drivers who undergo extensive training to learn the city of London show increased hippocampal volume from pre- to post-training compared to taxi drivers who fail to complete the training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maguire et al., 2000</xref>). Older adults who undergo an exercise-only training or a navigation + exercise training show reduced hippocampal atrophy (i.e., less volume loss) compared to a no-contact control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lövdén et al., 2012</xref>). Here, in healthy younger adults, who nevertheless showed robust individual differences in navigation and verbal memory and showed strong evidence of improvement across both types of training, there were no observed structural changes to hippocampal gray or white matter tracts, nor were there any significant structural changes to other brain regions.</p><p>In exploratory analyses, informational connectivity analyses on fMRI data from a spatial and temporal source memory task revealed unique network reconfiguration signatures as a result of navigation and verbal memory training. These changes were based on a strict correction for multiple comparisons and suggest that verbal memory and navigation training results in robust changes in task-related functional connectivity patterns. Interestingly, the vast majority of these changes were to areas outside of the medial temporal lobe, an area often considered central to both navigation and memory. During encoding, we observed increases in connectivity due to the verbal memory training primarily in the frontal and occipital lobes. Conversely, we observed decreases in informational connectivity in some of these same areas as a result of navigation training. We observed somewhat of the opposite pattern during retrieval: increases in informational connectivity during navigation and decreases during verbal memory training. Again, many of these connectivity changes were areas within the frontal cortex, with some longer-range changes to parietal, parahippocampal, and occipital cortex. Finally, a multivariate approach centered around superior frontal gyrus as a hub revealed differences in network connectivity patterns for spatial compared to temporal retrieval, suggesting task-related network-level changes due to the training as well. Similarly, we note that two studies, which trained participants on an n-back task, also observed changes in dynamic functional connectivity in frontal and parietal cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bassett et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Finc et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Our results suggest that the networks most malleable during acquisition of complex cognitive skills largely involve areas related to cognitive control, with one possibility being that such changes allow modulation of existing networks that include the medial temporal lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schedlbauer and Ekstrom, 2019</xref>). At the same time, navigation and verbal memory training resulted in differential changes within these frontal-parietal networks, suggesting that such cognitive skills involve at least partially dissociable changes. While it is reasonable to conjecture that microstructural changes in brain tissue (as measured with DWI) or even macrostructural gray matter changes may occur after considerable expertise is developed, such structural reorganization would likely be preceded by network changes in functional connectivity. In this scenario, functional changes that reflect training effects could potentially become solidified through long-term maintenance or the development of domain-specific expertise.</p></sec><sec

They then received instructions for their first session verbally and via email. The study took place over 12 sessions, each of which occurred on a separate day. These 12 sessions took place over the course of 3–4 weeks (average duration = 4.116 weeks). The first and last sessions were 3 hr sessions, referred to as pre-test and post-test, and consisted of behavioral and neuroimaging measures. These sessions were identical for all participants, regardless of which condition they were assigned to. Following the pre-test session, participants completed ten 2 hr training sessions, during which they completed training based on their assigned condition.

Virtual Arida has six individual subsections (A, B, C, D, E, F), with each containing eight different target locations. Participants began training on day 1 in subsection A and were spawned in front of a target location. They were then asked to navigate using the shortest possible route to a second target location. If the participants did not perform a sufficiently direct route, they repeated the route; their route was determined to be sufficiently direct if it did not exceed 120% of the shortest possible path between two buildings. Once they successfully employed a sufficiently direct route, they moved on to the next route. Participants learned all 28 possible routes in the subsection. When they learned all routes successfully, they completed random target location pairings for the remainder of the 2 hr session. After completing a subsection, participants moved on to a new subsection. In some cases, the new ‘subsection’ involved navigating between two previously learned subsections. For example, once individual subsections A and B were completed, participants navigated between targets in subsection A and subsection B. This involved ‘integrating’ their previously learned knowledge from prior subsections (A+B). Participants then learned the next individual subsection (subsection C), and after that, the next integrated subsection A+B+C. This continued in this manner through the final integrated subsection A+B+C+D+E+F (for those participants that reached this far).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Training condition</title><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Verbal memory training</title><p>Participants placed in the verbal memory condition completed free recall training on a desktop computer using a task built with Unity 3D.

At the beginning of Day 1 of training, participants wrote 30 of their most memorable, vivid, and non-traumatic memories from their life thus far. They were asked to order these memories into a mental timeline to help them with the word recall task. Participants were asked to associate each word they were given with a memory from their mental timeline. Then, when they reached the recall portion of the task, participants were to use their mental timeline memories to help them recall the associated words in the current list. The number of words increased with each successful trial. If there were multiple unsuccessful trials, the number of words decreased. Once they were successful with this shorter list, the previous list was repeated. For example, if the list was ‘red’, ‘orange’, ‘yellow’, and the participant did not recall all three words, the next trial’s list would be ‘red’, ‘orange’. On successful completion, the next trial would be ‘red’, ‘orange’, ‘yellow’, ‘blue’.</p><sec id="s4-4-1-1"><title>Sessions 1-5 of verbal memory training (same words list)</title><p>For the first five sessions of training, participants recalled a list that increased in length on each trial when they successfully recalled all the words. This was done using an algorithm based on a power law learning function. For example, they could start with the words: ‘Jersey’, ‘rifle’, ‘pony’. Upon successful completion of this list, the list would grow to ‘Jersey’, ‘rifle’, ‘pony’, ‘castle’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-1-2"><title>Sessions 6–10 of verbal memory training (new word list)</title><p>For the final five sessions of training, once participants successfully recalled a list, they learned a completely new list of words that was increased in length in the same manner as described above.

Videos and quiz questions were administered using Qualtrics.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Pre-test overview</title><p>In the Pre-test session, participants provided informed consent, completed a demographics questionnaire, and confirmed their MRI prescreen information. Participants then completed pre-test behavioral measures, which included a navigation transfer task (Virtual Silcton), a verbal memory transfer task (a new set of words from the Toronto word pool), and an attention task (Posner cueing task). Next, the experimenter described the source memory task that would take place during the fMRI scan. The participants created the temporal and spatial contexts for this task, then after a short break to prepare for the scanner, they completed the source memory task in the scanner (see details in Appendix 1 and <xref ref-type="table" rid="app2table3">Appendix 2—table 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Post-test overview</title><p>The post-test session was similar to the pre-test session. The only changes in the post-test session were different words for the verbal memory transfer task, a different section of Virtual Silcton, and different images for the source memory task. After reviewing the MRI prescreening form for any changes, participants completed the post-test measures (navigation, verbal memory, and attention tasks). Participants then reviewed the spatial and temporal contexts created in the pre-test session, took a short break, and completed the source memory task in the scanner. Finally, participants completed a debriefing survey and received payment (see details in Appendix 1 and <xref ref-type="table" rid="app2table2">Appendix 2—table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Pre-post tests</title><sec id="s4-8-1"><title>Navigation transfer task: Virtual Silcton</title><p> The pre-test and post-test navigation transfer task was completed on a laptop computer with an Xbox game controller using the ‘Virtual Silcton’ environment recreated in Unity 3D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Weisberg et al., 2014</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.virtualsilcton.com/">http://www.virtualsilcton.com/</ext-link>). Participants were instructed to freely navigate from their starting location to one of the eight possible destination buildings within the environment. If the participant walked for more than 60 s during a trial, a compass appeared at the bottom of the screen to point them to the target building. Over the trials, participants learned the spatial environment from the routes taken between the buildings. Participants completed trials until all routes were completed, or until 30 min elapsed. After the learning phase, participants completed an on-site pointing task, in which they were placed next to one of the eight buildings and had to point to each of the other seven in a random order. Next, they completed a model-building task, in which they dragged and dropped images of the eight buildings around an on-screen box. These tasks demonstrate configural knowledge of the environment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-2"><title>Verbal memory transfer task</title><p>Participants memorized and recalled a list of 12 words from the Toronto Word pool.

For their temporal context, they were asked to create a list of 10–15 salient memories of events from their life. We then asked them to write these down on a piece of paper and arranged them into a mental timeline of life events. For their spatial context, participants drew a blueprint of their living space (e.g. dorm room or apartment) on a second piece of paper. Participants were given time to review their contexts to ensure they knew them well enough prior to entering the scanner. They were then instructed on how they would use these contexts to recall objects. They were provided with an example of how to use each context and practiced verbally by using these contexts verbally.</p><p> Participants underwent functional MRI scanning while performing the source memory task. This task was comprised of two phases, each with four runs. During the encoding phase (runs 1–4), participants were presented with images and instructed to encode them within either a temporal or spatial context, consistent with prior out-of-scanner practice. During the retrieval phase (runs 5–8), participants were presented with images and asked to make two judgments: first, whether the image was new, and second, if recognized, the context in which it had been previously encoded. All participants viewed the same images, but in counterbalanced orders.</p><sec id="s4-8-3-1"><title>Source memory encoding</title><p>This source memory task included four encoding and four retrieval runs. In the encoding task, participants viewed an image and were asked to imagine it in either ‘time’ or ‘space’, referring to their previously generated temporal or spatial contexts. Participants were to either visualize the image as a part of their mental timeline if it was to be imagined in ‘time’ or visualize this object existing in their living space if it was indicated that it was to be imagined in ‘space’. Following this visualization period, participants were asked to indicate how vividly they visualized this item on a Likert scale by pressing 1–4 on the button box (see image below). All trials were jittered. At the end of the block, participants completed a short odd/even task. In this 60 s task, an ‘X’ or an ‘O’ would be displayed. Participants pressed ‘1’ if it was an ‘X’ and ‘2’ if it was an ‘O’. This served as a baseline task for hippocampal activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Squire et al., 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-3-2"><title>Source memory retrieval</title><p>In the retrieval task, participants were shown an image of an object and asked whether they recognized it from the encoding phase or if it was a new image by pressing ‘1’ for recognition and ‘2’ for new.

Since distance errors are inherently influenced by the distance between the starting location and the target building, we normalized these errors by dividing each distance error by the corresponding optimal distance. The task consisted of 20 trials, during which participants progressively learned the environment. As expected, normalized distance errors decreased over time, indicating improved navigation performance in later trials. To quantify this learning effect, we calculated a learning rate, defined as the negative of the difference between the normalized distance errors of the first 10 trials and the last 10 trials, divided by their sum (see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>).

In this model, the free water (FW) compartment of each voxel is interpreted primarily as originating from extracellular water diffusion, and the second tensor represents the tissue compartment after removing the contribution from FW. We performed whole brain estimation of FW and calculated free water corrected tensor metrics using custom MATLAB scripts (R2023a, The Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA). Briefly, we calculated FW from single shell diffusion data based on minimization of a variational regularization framework outlined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pasternak et al., 2009</xref>. Initialization of the free water estimate in this pipeline used mean diffusivity (MD) maps calculated from a single tensor fit.

After initialization, 100 iterations were used to refine the FW estimates corresponding to free water corrected metrics. We used an automated quality assurance procedure and visually inspected output images (e.g. FW and fwcFA) to confirm appropriate data quality.</p><p>We used ANTs to perform nonlinear registration to MNI standard space by warping each participant’s FA image to the HCP 1065 template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yeh, 2022</xref>). We used participants’ uncorrected FA for the registration process because the HCP 1065 template was created with FA images from single tensor reconstruction, not fwcFA images. We then applied the same transformation matrix to align FW and fwcFA images from the same participant into MNI space. Following registration, we extracted FW and fwcFA values from ROIs in MNI space. We separately evaluated ROIs from gray matter (GM) regions and white matter (WM) tracts, selected based on prior literature and relevance to navigation. Eight bilateral GM ROIs from the Mayo Clinic Adult Lifespan Template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schwarz et al., 2017</xref>) were used: hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, entorhinal cortex, inferior temporal cortex, cuneus, superior parietal cortex, retrosplenial cortex, and caudate nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ekstrom et al., 2017</xref>). Seven bilateral WM ROIs from the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) white-matter tractography atlas were used: three subregions of the corpus callosum (body, genu, and splenium), fornix, posterior thalamic radiation, cingulum (hippocampus), and the fornix cres / stria terminalis (these two small tracts are not able to be differentiated at 2 mm voxel resolution).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13-3"><title>DWI statistics</title><p> Similar to previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wilkes et al., 2024</xref>), we performed separate statistical analyses of ROIs from GM and WM regions, as these tissue types have dramatically different values for DWI metrics. We also separately evaluated FW and fwcFA, as these metrics provide separate but complementary information about extracellular and intracellular contributions to tissue microstructure. For each of these four combinations (GM-FW, GM-fwcFA, WM-FW, WM-fwcFA), we performed mix-designed ANOVAs with condition (Navigation/Verbal Memory/Video Control) as a between-subjects factor and ROI and session (pre/post) as within-subjects factors with corresponding post-hoc comparisons. We also performed correlations (Pearson or Spearman, as appropriate) to evaluate the relationship between DWI metrics and performance on behavioral measures. Correlations were corrected for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate (FDR) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>), which was applied across p-values for each ROI, performed separately for FW and fwcFA analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13-4"><title>MTL subfield demarcation</title><p>Automatic hippocampal subfield segmentation software (ASHS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yushkevich et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yushkevich et al., 2015b</xref>) was used to segment the subfields of the MTL based on each participant’s high-resolution T2-weighted MRI image. We used ASHS with the ASHS-Princeton-1.0.0-Young-Adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yushkevich et al., 2015a</xref>). The MTL was segmented into CA1, CA2/3, DG, and subiculum (SUB), as well as the perirhinal cortex (PRC), entorhinal cortex (ERC), and parahippocampal cortex (PHC). We combined the CA2/3 and DG subfields as finer distinctions could not be made at the acquired resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zeineh et al., 2001</xref>). Each participant’s subfield segmentations were manually inspected to ensure accuracy of the segmentation protocol. The hippocampus was further subdivided into anterior (head) and posterior (body +tail) regions along its longitudinal axis using the T1-weighted MPRAGE sequence and FreeSurfer 7.4.1 software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/">https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/</ext-link>). To ensure reliable volume estimates, images were processed using FreeSurfer’s longitudinal pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reuter et al., 2012</xref>). This method creates an unbiased within-subject template using a robust, inverse-consistent registration approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reuter et al., 2010</xref>). Visual quality control was conducted by three trained raters who inspected the skull stripping, surface reconstruction, and segmentation accuracy at both the within-subject template and individual timepoints. Manual edits were primarily performed on the within-subject template to correct segmentation errors—particularly in challenging regions such as the hippocampus—since edits to the template automatically propagate to all associated timepoints. Raters followed standardized FreeSurfer longitudinal editing guidelines to ensure consistent correction across subjects and time points. Discrepancies between raters were resolved via consensus discussions. This approach enhanced segmentation accuracy and consistency across longitudinal scans, thereby improving the reliability of volumetric and morphometric analyses. These quality control procedures ensured that anatomical registration was accurate and that atlas-based ROI extractions were not confounded by segmentation or alignment errors. To account for individual differences in brain size, we normalized the volume of each MTL subregion by dividing each volume by intracranial volume (ICV) and scaling by a factor of 100.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13-5"><title>Whole-brain volumetric analysis</title><p>We conducted whole-brain structural analyses using FreeSurfer (version 7.4.1; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu">https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu</ext-link>).

Group-level statistical comparisons were corrected for multiple comparisons using mri_glmfit-sim, which implements cluster-wise correction based on Monte Carlo simulations. A vertex-wise threshold of Z&gt;3.0 (corresponding to p&lt;0.001, two-sided) was used to identify both positive and negative effects. Clusters were considered significant if they survived a cluster-wise corrected p-value of less than 0.05.</p><p>In addition to vertex-wise analyses, cortical parcellation was performed using the Destrieux atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Destrieux et al., 2010</xref>) (aparc.a2009s), which delineates 74 cortical regions per hemisphere, resulting in a total of 148 cortical regions of interest (ROIs). To account for inter-individual variability in brain size, each ROI volume was normalized by the estimated intracranial volume (ICV) and scaled by a factor of 100. Longitudinal statistical comparisons were conducted using paired-sample t-tests. To control for multiple comparisons across ROIs, FDR correction was applied at q&lt;0.05.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13-6"><title>Regions of interest</title><p>To identify brain regions associated with memory and spatial navigation, we conducted meta-analyses using Neurosynth (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://neurosynth.org/">https://neurosynth.org/</ext-link>). We first defined 11 maps based on Neurosynth association tests, using the following 11 key terms: ‘memory’, ‘episodic memory’, ‘autobiographical memory’, ‘recognition memory’, ‘subsequent memory’, ‘memory encoding’, ‘memory retrieval’, ‘memory performance’, ‘memory processes’, ‘memory tasks’, and ‘memory test’. These maps were then combined to create a single, comprehensive memory-related brain mask. Then, following the same steps, we created a single, comprehensive spatial navigation-related mask using six key terms: ‘navigation’, ‘spatial’, ‘spatial information’, ‘spatial temporal’, ‘time task’, and ‘visual spatial’. The memory-spatial map was then created by summing up the memory-related and navigation-related maps. Finally, this combined map was overlapped with the 400 ROIs from the ‘Schaefer 2018 parcellation’ to yield 242 ROIs, each containing a minimum of 30 voxels. Prior to ROI extraction, all registration steps—from individual subject space to MNI space—were visually inspected for each participant to ensure accurate alignment between the functional data and the Schaefer atlas.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13-7"><title>fMRI data preprocessing</title><p>We performed fMRI data preprocessing using FEAT (FMRI Expert Analysis Tool), version 6.00, implemented in FSL (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl">http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl</ext-link>). The EPI images underwent motion correction, slice-timing correction, and temporal filtering with a nonlinear high-pass filter (100  s cutoff). Six motion parameters were included as confounding regressors in the model. Additionally, outlier timepoints which were identified using the FSL’s motion outlier detection tool (framewise displacement [FD]&gt;0.9 mm) were incorporated as additional confounds in the first-level general linear model (GLM) analysis. If more than 20% of the volumes in a run had an FD exceeding 0.9 mm, or if the absolute head movement exceeded half the voxel size (i.e. 1.25 mm), the entire run was excluded from further analyses. For single-trial estimation, no spatial smoothing was applied. All functional images were linearly registered to the middle image of the first run, and all analyses were conducted in MNI standard space.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13-8"><title>Univariate activation analysis</title><p>We examined encoding and retrieval-related neural activity using the general linear model (GLM) within the FILM module of FSL. During the encoding stage, the GLM included five regressors: (1) the encoding stage of all pictures (i.e. the 6 s of the trial in which the participants were presented with an image and asked to encode that image using a temporal or spatial context); (2) rating period (i.e. reaction time, RT) when the participant made a rating judgment of all trials; (3) the remaining time period after the participant made a rating judgment of all trials (i.e. 6 s minus RT) while the stimulus stayed on the screen; (4) The duration of inter-trial interval (ITI) fixations; (5) all the instruction period within the same run. The ‘X’ or ‘O’ judgement baseline period was not coded and thus was treated as an implicit baseline. Events were modeled at the time of the stimulus onset and convolved with canonical hemodynamic response function (double gamma function). The encoding phase consisted of four runs, equally divided between spatial and temporal encoding runs. For the retrieval phase, remembered and forgotten pictures were separately modeled for both item memory retrieval and source memory retrieval. Source memory retrieval was further categorized into spatial and temporal retrieval trials. The source memory retrieval effect was defined as the difference in activity between correctly retrieved contextual pictures and the implicit baseline.</p><p>A second-level analysis was conducted to compute cross-run averages for spatial encoding effects, temporal encoding effects, combined encoding effects (spatial and temporal concatenated), spatial source memory retrieval effects, temporal source, and combined source memory retrieval effects (spatial and temporal concatenated) using a fixed-effects model. These contrasts were then used in a group analysis with a random-effects model using full FMRIB’s Local Analysis of Mixed Effect 1 with automatic outlier detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beckmann et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Woolrich, 2008</xref>). Unless otherwise noted, group images were thresholded using cluster detection statistics, with a height threshold of z&gt;3.1 and a cluster probability of p&lt;0.05, corrected for whole-brain multiple comparisons using Gaussian Random Field Theory. To specifically examine univariate activation within the hippocampus, a key region of interest in our experiment, we conducted small volume correction using the hippocampal mask derived from the Harvard-Oxford subcortical atlas in MNI152 space.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13-9"><title>Single-trial response estimates</title><p>General linear models (GLMs) were conducted separately to estimate the activation patterns for each of 80 encoding trials and 100 retrieval trials. In each single-trial model, a Least Square–Separate (LS-S) approach was used, in which the trial of interest was modeled as one regressor, with all other trials modeled as a separate regressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mumford et al., 2012</xref>). Specifically, during the encoding stage, each single-trial GLM included six regressors: (1) the trial of interest (i.e. the 6 s of the trial where the participants were presented with an image and asked to encode that image using a temporal or spatial context); (2) all other remaining trials within the same run; (3) rating period (i.e. reaction time, RT) when the participant made a rating judgment of all trials; (4) the remaining time period after the participant made a rating judgment of all trials (i.e. 6 s minus RT) while the stimulus stayed on the screen; (5) The duration of inter-trial interval (ITI) fixations; (6) the instruction period within the same run.

The ITI fixation period was not modeled and was treated as an implicit baseline. Each event was modeled at the time of stimulus onset and convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function (double gamma). To control the effects of head motion, six motion parameters were included in the GLM model as a covariate, as well as a regressor for each TR that was flagged as having greater framewise displacement (FD) than 0.9 during preprocessing. The t-map for each trial was used for multivariate pattern similarity analysis to increase the reliability by normalizing for noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Walther et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13-10"><title>Multivariate pattern similarity analysis (MPS)</title><p>Multi-voxel pattern similarity (MPS) was used to measure the similarity of activation patterns by calculating the correlation between trials that were either encoded or correctly retrieved, within each ROI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kriegeskorte et al., 2006</xref>). Following the approach of Power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Power et al., 2014</xref>), volumes with a framewise displacement greater than 0.9 mm were censored, and trials containing any censored frames within the duration of the modeled GLM response were excluded. Specifically, within-context pattern similarity (PS) during encoding was calculated using pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients between trials within the same context (i.e. spatial or temporal). Within-spatial context was calculated using only spatial trials, while within temporal context was calculated using only temporal trials. For source memory retrieval, we performed analogous calculations for within-context PS, separately measuring within-spatial context PS and within-temporal context PS, using correct retrieval trials. All MPS analyses were performed across trials from different runs to avoid temporal autocorrelations that could otherwise inflate or bias results. The resulting correlation coefficients were then transformed into Fisher’s z-scores.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13-11"><title>Informational connectivity analysis</title><p>We performed informational connectivity among the 242 predefined ROIs by calculating pairwise correlations between representational similarity matrices (RSMs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aly and Turk-Browne, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kriegeskorte et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zheng et al., 2023</xref>). This was done by correlating the within-context PS for each ROI with another ROI. In contrast to traditional functional connectivity (FC) analyses, which quantify temporal correlations of BOLD signal fluctuations between brain regions, the informational connectivity approach examines the similarity of information coding patterns across regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aly and Turk-Browne, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zheng et al., 2023</xref>). While FC analyses rely on averaged BOLD signals within regions, representational similarity analysis (RSA) captures the fine-grained spatial patterns of neural responses to different experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kriegeskorte et al., 2008</xref>). Specifically, RSA quantifies how similarly or differently a brain region responds to different stimuli or conditions by comparing multivariate activity patterns, creating a RSM that characterizes each region’s representational structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kriegeskorte et al., 2008</xref>). By correlating these RSMs between regions, we can assess whether different brain areas encode information in similar ways, providing insights into information sharing and processing that complement traditional FC measures.</p><p>Three types of within-context RSMs were calculated: one based on all trials, one based on spatial trials, and one based on temporal trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref> top). All Pearson correlation coefficients (r values) were Fisher-Z transformed prior to statistical analysis. Significance thresholds for informational connectivity were determined using 10,000 permutation simulations. The reported results have been corrected for multiple comparisons using the FDR method, with a q-value threshold of less than 0.05.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13-12"><title>Multivariate informational connectivity pattern distance analysis</title><p>To assess changes in multivariate informational connectivity patterns between pre and post, distances were computed for each ROI by comparing spatial and temporal informational connectivity patterns before and after training.

The distance between the two connectivity patterns was calculated using 1 minus the Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). Paired t-tests were conducted to evaluate statistical differences between pre and post, with FDR correction applied across the 242 ROIs at a q-value threshold of &lt;0.05.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Validation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Software, Validation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Validation, Investigation, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation, Visualization, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Supervision, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: All participants provided written informed consent.

In particular, there is a very large literature that has already explored the longitudinal effects of different types of training on functional and structural neuroimaging. However, this literature is barely acknowledged in the Introduction, which focuses on cross-sectional studies. Studies like the one by Draganski et al. 2004 are cited but not discussed, and are clumped together with cross-sectional studies, which is confusing. As a reader, it is difficult to understand whether the study was meant to be confirmatory based on previous literature, or whether it fills a specific gap in the literature on longitudinal neuroimaging effects of training interventions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these comments and feedback.</p><p>We want to clarify that through our pre-registered analysis plan, our approach was confirmatory, rather than exploratory (or rather than post-hoc justified.) This confirmatory approach allowed us to critically evaluate the theoretically novel and important hypotheses which tested what no other study like our longitudinal/intervention study proposed or performed previously. We have now clarified this in the introduction.</p><p><bold>“</bold>This allowed us to address the following novel theoretical questions: (1) what neural changes, if any, result from an intensive within-participant intervention that improves memory or navigation skills in healthy young adults (2) if such changes occur, what is the degree of neural overlap between the acquisition of these cognitive skills.”</p><p>“We pre-registered three novel and specific hypotheses, which are described in more detail here (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/etxvj">https://osf.io/etxvj</ext-link>) ”</p><p>We have also attempted to better separate cross-section and longitudinal studies. Due to space limitations, we have focused on interventional studies that involved gray matter changes that could relevance to either navigation, episodic memory, or the hypothesized time frame we chose for the training. We also note that some of these relevant studies are discussed in more depth in the discussion.</p><p>“Successful cognitive interventions suggest that targeted within-participant cognitive training, even for as little as 1-2 weeks, can result in improvements to specific cognitive functions, including changes in focal gray matter [4,23-27]; but see[28].”</p><p>We have also added some additional citations to relevant cognitive intervention work, although we agree that this is an extensive literature, only a subset of which we are able to capture here:</p><p>“In some instances, interventions may even generalize to areas not explicitly trained but closely related to the training (termed “near transfer”)[29-33].”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2.1) The main claim regarding the lack of changes in brain structure seems only partially supported by the analyses provided. The limited whole-brain evidence from structural neuroimaging makes it difficult to confirm whether there is indeed no effect of training. Beyond hippocampal analyses, many whole-brain analyses of both volumetric and diffusion-weighted imaging metrics are only based on coarse ROIs (for example, 34 cortical parcellations for grey matter analyses).</p><p>Although vertex-wise analyses in FreeSurfer are reported, it is unclear what metrics were examined (cortical thickness? area? volume?).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s thoughtful feedback. We apologize for the lack of clarity in the original manuscript regarding the type of metric used in the vertex-wise analysis. We confirm that these analyses were based on cortical volume, not thickness or area. To clarify this, we have explicitly stated in the revised Methods that the vertex-wise analyses were conducted on cortical volume using FreeSurfer’s mri_glmfit.</p><p>In addition, in response to the concern regarding the coarse nature of the ROI-based analyses, we have re-analyzed the volumetric data using the more fine-grained Destrieux atlas, which contains 148 cortical ROIs (74 per hemisphere), instead of the original, coarser 34-region atlas. These more detailed analyses still revealed no significant volume changes from pre- to post-training in any of the three groups. We believe this provides stronger support for the lack of training-induced volumetric changes outside the medial temporal lobe.</p><p>Relevant revisions have been made to the Results and Methods sections. Below is the updated content added to the manuscript:</p><p>In Results:</p><p>“We also analyzed gray matter volume changes outside of the medial temporal lobe using FreeSurfer (see Methods) to determine if any cortical or other relevant brain areas might have been affected by the training. We applied a vertex-wise analysis of cortical volume, again finding no significant differences across the entire cortex (see Methods). This finding was further validated using the Destrieux atlas, which includes 74 cortical parcellations per hemisphere (148 ROIs in total). Paired-sample t-tests revealed that none of the ROIs exhibited significant volume changes from pre- to post-test in any of the three groups (all ps &gt; 0.542, FDR-corrected). These findings suggest that training did not result in any measurable cortical volumetric changes.”</p><p>In Methods:</p><p>“Whole-brain structural analyses were conducted using FreeSurfer (version 7.4.1; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu">https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu</ext-link>). T1-weighted anatomical images were processed using the longitudinal processing pipeline. Vertex-wise analyses of cortical volume were performed using FreeSurfer’s general linear modeling tool, mri_glmfit. Group-level comparisons were corrected for multiple comparisons using mri_glmfit-sim, which implements cluster-wise correction based on Monte Carlo simulations. A vertex-wise threshold of Z &gt; 3.0 (corresponding to p &lt; 0.001, two-sided) was applied to detect both positive and negative effects. Clusters were retained if they survived a cluster-wise corrected p &lt; 0.05.</p><p>In addition to vertex-wise analysis, cortical parcellation was performed using the Destrieux atlas (aparc.a2009s), which includes 74 cortical regions per hemisphere, yielding 148 ROIs in total. To account for variability in brain size, each ROI volume was normalized by estimated intracranial volume (ICV) and scaled by a factor of 100. Longitudinal comparisons were conducted using paired-sample t-tests. To correct for multiple comparisons, we applied FDR correction (q &lt; 0.05).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2.2) Diffusion-weighted imaging seems to focus on whole-tract atlas ROIs, which can be less accurate/sensitive than tractography-defined ROIs or voxel-wise approaches.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s important point regarding diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) analysis. We focused primarily on atlas-defined tract-level ROIs derived from a standard white matter tract atlas as we did not feel that we had the resolution for more fine-grained analyses with our sequences. While this approach has the advantage of robust anatomical correspondence and improved interpretability, we agree that it may be less sensitive than tractography-defined or voxel-wise methods for detecting more subtle, localized training-related changes. Because of limitations in our DWI sequence, which was optimized to be shorter and identical between different scanners, we are not able to provide more fine-grained analysis of the DWI data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Quality control of images is only mentioned for FA images in subject space. Given that most analyses are based on atlas ROIs, visual checks following registration are fundamental and should be described in further detail.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your thoughtful comment. We agree that visual quality control is critical when using atlas-based ROI analyses. In our study, we implemented comprehensive quality control procedures across all structural and functional imaging analyses.</p><p>For hippocampal segmentation using ASHS, we performed manual visual inspections of each participant's subfield segmentation to verify the accuracy of the automated outputs. This is now clearly described in the revised Methods section:</p><p>“Each participant's subfield segmentations were manually inspected to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the segmentation protocol.”</p><p>For FreeSurfer-based hippocampal and cortical segmentation, we also conducted detailed visual inspections and manual edits following the standard FreeSurfer longitudinal pipeline. We have added the following description to the Methods section to clarify this process:</p><p>“Visual quality control was conducted by three trained raters who systematically inspected skull stripping, surface reconstruction, and segmentation accuracy at both the within-subject template and individual timepoints. Manual edits were primarily applied to the within-subject template to correct segmentation errors—particularly in challenging regions such as the hippocampus—since corrections to the template automatically propagate to all timepoints. Raters followed standardized FreeSurfer longitudinal editing guidelines to ensure consistent and reproducible corrections across subjects. Discrepancies were resolved via consensus discussion. This quality control approach enhanced the accuracy and consistency of segmentation across longitudinal scans, thereby improving the reliability of morphometric analyses and atlas-based ROI extractions.”</p><p>For functional MRI preprocessing, all registration steps—including transformations from individual functional runs to MNI space—were visually checked for each participant to ensure accurate alignment with the Schaefer atlas. We have clarified this point in the revised Methods section with the following statement:</p><p>“Prior to ROI extraction, all registration steps—from individual functional space to MNI space—were visually inspected for each participant to confirm accurate alignment between the functional images and the atlas parcellation.”</p><p>These additions now more clearly reflect the robust quality control procedures that were employed throughout our pipeline to ensure the validity of atlas-based analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p>(1) As a reader, I would have appreciated a short section in the methods regarding the preregistration and power analysis. Currently, it is not too straightforward to understand which analyses were included in the preregistration, and at what point in the project the pre-registration was written. Finding all the relevant information from OSF is feasible, but it would be more accessible if a summary of the information were available inside the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this valuable suggestion. We agree that providing a concise summary within the manuscript's methods section will significantly improve accessibility for readers.</p><p>The full preregistration is now explicitly referenced in the Methods:</p><p><bold>“</bold>Preregistration and Power Analysis</p><p>This study was preregistered on the Open Science Framework (OSF; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/etxvj">https://osf.io/etxvj</ext-link>). The preregistration was completed on October 30, 2023, after approximately 80% of data collection had been completed, but prior to any analysis of the primary outcome variables. The preregistration outlines the study hypotheses, design, target sample size, and planned behavioral and neuroimaging analyses, including longitudinal ROI comparisons and statistical correction procedures.</p><p>A priori power analysis was conducted using G*Power 3.1 to estimate the required sample size for detecting a Group × Time interaction in a mixed-design ANOVA. Assuming a small-to-medium effect size (f = 0.35), we determined that 24 participants per group would provide 80% power to detect a significant effect at α = 0.05. To allow for potential attrition and data exclusion (e.g., due to excessive motion or incomplete datasets), we targeted recruitment of 30 participants per group across two study sites.</p><p>All primary hypotheses, analytic plans, and inference criteria are documented in the preregistration.
