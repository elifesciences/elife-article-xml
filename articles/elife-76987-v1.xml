The metabolic microenvironment has been tightly connected to cell function and identity during development and tumorigenesis. Yet, the link between metabolism and cell identity at the mechanistic level in a regenerative context remains unclear. The adult zebrafish caudal fin, and bone cells specifically, have been crucial for the understanding of mature cell contribution to tissue regeneration. Here, we use this model to explore the relevance of glucose metabolism for the cell fate transitions preceding new osteoblast formation and blastema assembly. We show that injury triggers a modulation in the metabolic profile at early stages of regeneration to enhance glycolysis at the expense of mitochondrial oxidation. This metabolic adaptation mediates transcriptional changes that make mature osteoblast amenable to be reprogramed into pre-osteoblasts and induces cell cycle re-entry and progression. Manipulation of the metabolic profile led to severe reduction of the pre-osteoblast pool, diminishing their capacity to generate new osteoblasts, and to a complete abrogation of blastema formation. Overall, our data indicate that metabolic alterations have a powerful instructive role in regulating genetic programs that dictate fate decisions and stimulate proliferation, thereby providing a deeper understanding on the mechanisms regulating blastema formation and bone regeneration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>osteoblast</kwd><kwd>cell metabolism</kwd><kwd>dedifferentiation</kwd><kwd>blastema</kwd><kwd>cell fate</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PTDC/BIA-BID/29709/2017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brandão</surname><given-names>Ana S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PTDC/BTM-SAL/29377/2017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brandão</surname><given-names>Ana S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UIDB/04462/2020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brandão</surname><given-names>Ana S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LA/P/0087/2020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brandão</surname><given-names>Ana S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LISBOA-01-0145-FEDER-022170</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brandão</surname><given-names>Ana S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>ATIP-Avenir Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bensimon-Brito</surname><given-names>Anabela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Zebrafish caudal fin amputation induces an increase in the glycolytic influx that leads to dedifferentiation of osteoblasts and their re-entry in the cell cycle, which is essential for blastema formation and bone regeneration.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) is a well-established model to study vertebrate regeneration due to its capacity to efficiently regenerate multiple organs and complex tissues, such as the caudal fin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sehring and Weidinger, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Antos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Marques et al., 2019</xref>). Caudal fin regeneration is an epimorphic process dependent on the formation of a blastema, a transient structure composed of proliferative lineage-restricted progenitor cells that originate from mature cells of the uninjured tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kawakami, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Poss et al., 2003</xref>). One of the main components of the caudal fin are the segmented bone elements, or bony-rays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pfefferli and Jaźwińska, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Marí-Beffa and Murciano, 2010</xref>), which have been shown to regenerate from new osteoblasts (OBs) arising from dedifferentiation of mature OBs close to the amputation site. Mature OBs acquire the cellular properties of less differentiated cells or pre-osteoblasts (pre-OBs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Knopf et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sousa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Stewart and Stankunas, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Tu and Johnson, 2011</xref>), which proliferate and redifferentiate into mature bone-producing OBs, thereby reconstituting the fin skeletal tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Stewart et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brandão et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brown et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Wehner et al., 2014</xref>). Mammals, in contrast to zebrafish, have a poor ability to regenerate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Xia et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Poss, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Tanaka and Reddien, 2011</xref>). Mammalian bone, in particular, has an intrinsic capacity to be remodeled throughout life and, to a certain extent, repair after fracture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Salhotra et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Raggatt and Partridge, 2010</xref>), but it fails to fully regenerate. This is mainly achieved through activation of signalling cascades that culminate in the recruitment and differentiation of osteoprogenitors into OBs, the bone-forming cells. In this scenario, understanding how OBs and OB sources are activated and recruited in zebrafish can greatly contribute to new therapeutic solutions to improve bone formation and restoration in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Yao et al., 2013</xref>). Activation of reprogramming events that allow cells to change fate in response to injury appear to be conserved biological processes, which are used to prompt tissue regeneration in several organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Tanaka and Reddien, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Tanaka, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jopling et al., 2011</xref>), including in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Seifert and Muneoka, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Johnson et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, it is crucial to identify the early molecular events inducing cell dedifferentiation to promote tissue regeneration.</p><p>Cell identity and functional state often reflect a specific metabolic profile that depends, for instance, on nutrient and oxygen availability, and on bioenergetics and biomass requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Folmes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ito and Suda, 2014</xref>). Metabolic routes serve not only the crucial purpose of converting or use energy to maintain cellular integrity and survival, but also have a pivotal role in restructuring gene expression to determine cell identity and function by influencing cell signalling and epigenetic modulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Tarazona and Pourquié, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ly et al., 2020</xref>). Glucose metabolism is currently regarded as a powerful instructor of cell fate decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Wei et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Tatapudy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ghosh-Choudhary et al., 2020</xref>) during development. It is well documented that stem cells and their differentiated progeny have distinct metabolic preferences: stem cells often favour non-oxidative glycolysis, while differentiated non-dividing somatic cells rely on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Shyh-Chang and Daley, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Panopoulos and Izpisua Belmonte, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Tsogtbaatar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mathieu and Ruohola-Baker, 2017</xref>). Importantly, the metabolic signature is not static and can rapidly switch according to the cellular demands, a phenomenon commonly designated as metabolic reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Folmes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ghosh-Choudhary et al., 2020</xref>). This is particularly relevant under certain environmental conditions when tissue homeostasis is breached, such as during inflammation, and during disease. Both activated T cells and pro-inflammatory macrophages switch metabolic profiles compatible with a prevalence of aerobic glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Shyer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Viola et al., 2019</xref>). The shift to aerobic glycolysis is also observed in cancer cells, where it is referred as the Warburg effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">DeBerardinis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Intlekofer and Finley, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Warburg et al., 1927</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liberti and Locasale, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Vander Heiden et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Despite the considerable amount of information on the role of metabolism during development and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Vander Heiden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">DeBerardinis and Thompson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Tzika et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bettencourt and Powell, 2017</xref>), the link between glucose metabolism and regeneration is still far from understood. Shifts in metabolism leading to a prevalence of glycolysis have already been observed in planarians and amphibians during regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Osuma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Love et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alibardi, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Varela-Rodríguez et al., 2020</xref>). More recently, glycolysis was proposed to modulate specific aspects of regeneration in the zebrafish, specifically in the larval tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sinclair et al., 2021</xref>) and in the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Honkoop et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fukuda et al., 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, much remains to be elucidated on how metabolism influences changes in cell identity necessary to promote tissue regeneration.</p><p>Here, we use the adult zebrafish caudal fin to determine the role of energy metabolism in mature OB dedifferentiation and pre-OB recruitment. By performing a series of gene expression and metabolomic studies, we observed that changes in the metabolic signature triggered upon amputation are at the core of the initial set-up of the cellular programmes that control caudal fin regeneration. These data indicate that mature OBs, and possibly other cell lineages in the caudal fin, undergo a metabolic adaptation that increases glycolysis. We further demonstrate that these changes in metabolism are necessary for mature OBs to commit to a specialized genetic program that enables them to dedifferentiate, proliferate and act as progenitor cells, ensuring proper bone regeneration. Taken together, our results demonstrate that metabolic reprogramming is one of the earliest described cellular events that dictate adult caudal fin and bone regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Osteoblast dedifferentiation occurs before blastema formation and during the wound healing phase</title><p>Caudal fin bone regeneration is achieved through activation of cell sources, such as mature OBs, that change their identity to generate new OBs. Under homeostatic conditions, mature OBs reside as quiescent bone-lining cells, but lose their differentiated character when undergoing dedifferentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Knopf et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sousa et al., 2011</xref>). This process is characterized by the downregulation of mature markers, such as <italic>bone gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-containing protein</italic> (<italic>bglap</italic>) at 12 hpa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Knopf et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sousa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Long, 2011</xref>), and upregulation of the pre-OB marker, <italic>runx2,</italic> at 24 hpa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Knopf et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sousa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Salhotra et al., 2020</xref>). OBs undergoing dedifferentiation detach from the bony-ray surface via an EMT-like event, migrate toward the stump region, re-enter the cell cycle and form a pool of pre-OB cells that incorporates the blastema (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Knopf et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sousa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Stewart et al., 2014</xref>). To determine if OBs show signs of dedifferentiation in early stages of regeneration, we increase the time resolution of the initial OB response to amputation. First, we analyze the relative expression of mature (<italic>bglap</italic>) and pre-OB (<italic>runx2a, runx2b</italic>) markers 6 hr post-amputation (hpa) in regenerating caudal fins in relation to uninjured caudal fins (0 hpa). We observed a downregulation of <italic>bglap</italic> and upregulation of <italic>runx2a</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) suggesting that, in contrast to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Knopf et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sousa et al., 2011</xref>), mature OBs are already undergoing transcriptional changes consistent with dedifferentiation as early as 6 hpa. We then analyzed the <italic>bglap</italic>:EGFP transgenic line which, due to the stable GFP signal, allows to follow mature OB for long periods even upon <italic>bglap</italic> downregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sousa et al., 2011</xref>). Using live-imaging approaches, we monitored the two segments below the amputation plane of each bony-rays and performed a time-course analysis of OB migration every 5 hr during the first 25 hpa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). Tracking of <italic>bglap</italic>-positive (Bglap+) OBs revealed that OBs from the segment below amputation (segment 0) become motile at the 5–10 hpa time-interval and in average reach the amputation plane around 20–25 hpa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>), while Bglap +OB from the second segment (segment-1) remain predominantly immotile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Subsequently, we assessed when OBs acquire proliferative capacity. Immunofluorescence for PCNA (marker of G1 phase) indicated that the proportion of Bglap +OBs entering the cell cycle progressively increases, specifically from 12 to 24 hpa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). At 24 hpa, almost 80% of Bglap +OBs in the first segment have entered the G1 phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). To examine when OBs begin to show signs of dedifferentiation toward a pre-OB state, we performed immunofluorescence for Runx2 in <italic>bglap</italic>:EGFP transgenic fins. In homeostasis conditions (0 hpa), Runx2 is observed in the nucleus of bone-lining mature OB (Runx2 +Bglap + ; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F, F’ and H</xref>), which is in accordance with Runx2 being expressed at basal levels in fully differentiated OB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Conaway et al., 2013</xref>). At 12 and 24 hpa, we observed a slight decrease in the total number of Runx2 +Bglap + OB population within the first segment below amputation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G, G’ and H</xref>). OBs are not described to undergo apoptosis at this stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Knopf et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that decrease in the Runx2 +Bglap + OBs could be due to actual loss of the <italic>bglap</italic> differentiation marker in a portion of dedifferentiated OB. Nevertheless, remaining Runx2 +Bglap + possess higher levels of Runx2 when compared to Runx2 +Bglap + OBs at 0 hpa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G’</xref> arrows), further indicating that they converted into a pre-OB phenotype, in accordance with published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mishra et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, at 0 hpa a small number of pre-OB (Runx2 +Bglap-) was detected in the bony-rays intersegment/joint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and F’</xref> asterisk,I), which may correspond to a population of OB progenitors (OPs) recently identified in this region, refered as joint OP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ando et al., 2017</xref>). At 12 and 24 hpa, we observed an increase in the number of Runx2 +Bglap cells, suggesting that pre-OB arise in the first 12 hpa and their numbers increase until the beginning of blastema formation at 24 hpa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F-G' and I</xref>). Altogether, these data indicate that mature OBs lose their differentiated character and contribute to the pre-OB pool in a time-window between 12 and 24 hpa. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude that pre-OB can also arise from the joint-associated OB progenitor niche. Thus, we hypothesize that at 24 hpa, multiple OB sources are recruited to contribute to the blastema (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Osteoblast dedifferentiation time-window during caudal fin regeneration.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Biological traits of OB dedifferentiation process.

We isolated OBs from the first bony-ray segment below amputation at 0 hpa, our control population and closest to a homeostatic state, and at 6 hpa, when most dedifferentiation features are not detected yet, and performed a genome-wide transcriptomic analysis (zebrafish 8x60 K ArrayXS technology) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). OBs were isolated by FACS using the <italic>bglap</italic>:EGFP transgenic line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). By comparing the expression profiles of mature OBs (0 hpa) and dedifferentiating OBs (6 hpa), we evaluated whether our set of differentially expressed (DE) genes was associated with a specific biological process or signalling pathway, particularly relevant for OB dedifferentiation. We observed that OBs show a dynamic transcriptional response at 6 hpa in comparison to OBs from uninjured conditions with almost 2200 differentially expressed genes, from which 1040 were downregulated and 1130 were upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>,D). These data further demonstrates that the dedifferentiation machinery is triggered very early during regeneration (for more details about the set of DE genes see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Importantly, a large set of genes related to energy metabolism was also dramatically altered (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>Depending on the energy and biomass demands, cells can uptake glucose and, through glycolysis, use it to produce pyruvate, which can serve as a substrate to: generate acetyl-CoA and fuel mitochondrial OXPHOS, obtaining a high energy yield; or to produce lactate, allowing diversion of metabolic intermediates from glycolysis toward various biosynthetic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lunt and Vander Heiden, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rabinowitz and Enerbäck, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). From our transcriptome data set of DE, we observed that at 6 hpa OBs upregulate the expression of major glycolytic enzymes, such as <italic>hexokinase 1</italic> (<italic>hk1</italic>) and <italic>phosphofructokinase</italic> (<italic>pfkp</italic>), whereas OXPHOS components remain mostly unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Most importantly, we detected a significant increase in <italic>lactate dehydrogenase</italic> (<italic>ldha</italic>) expression, suggesting an increase in lactate production, possibly by diverting pyruvate from mitochondrial oxidation. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). These data suggest that dedifferentiating OBs change their metabolic signature, adopting a metabolic program that increases glycolysis. Since OBs only account for around 1–3% of the total cell number in a bony-ray segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), we evaluated whether these changes in gene expression were specific to OB undergoing dedifferentiation or are also observed as a general behavior induced upon injury. For that, we collected the first segment below the amputation and analyzed by qPCR the expression profile of key glycolytic and OXPHOS genes in regenerating caudal fins from 6 hpa and 24 hpa and compared to control uninjured caudal fins (0 hpa). At 6 hpa, when cells start to dedifferentiate, most glycolytic enzymes were highly upregulated, including <italic>hk1</italic>, <italic>hk</italic>2, <italic>pfkpa</italic>, and <italic>pyruvate kinase</italic> (<italic>pkma</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Importantly, as observed during OB dedifferentiation, <italic>ldha</italic> expression was increased and <italic>pyruvate dehydrogenase a 1b</italic> (<italic>pdha1b</italic>) was downregulated. <italic>pdha1b</italic> is part of the Pdh1 complex, which catalyzes irreversibly the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and progression to OXPHOS, further corroborating that at this stage pyruvate is being shunt from the mitochondria and stimulating lactate-producing glycolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). As for the OXPHOS components analyzed, most remained unchanged or slightly upregulated. However, this increase in expression was not as accentuated as the one observed for the glycolytic pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Later, at 24 hpa, when most cells have dedifferentiated and the blastema starts to be assembled, we observed that most glycolytic enzymes were still significantly upregulated, although not as striking as at 6 hpa time-point, and <italic>ldha</italic> expression continued to be upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). At this time-point, we also observed an increase in expression of some OXPHOS components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), suggesting that blastema formation may also require mitochondrial glucose oxidation. Consistent upregulation of the genes associated with glycolysis and lactate production suggests that the OB dedifferentiation process and possibly the early response to amputation are characterized by a metabolic adaptation toward glycolysis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Metabolic adaptation is triggered during zebrafish caudal fin regeneration.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of glucose metabolism.

Therefore, to corroborate these observations, we used mass spectrometry (MS) to quantify specific metabolites and determine the prevalent energy metabolism route. For that, we dissected the whole fin stump and analyzed the amount of glucose, lactate, glutamine and glutamate at 0, 6, and 24 hpa. According with our transcriptome data, we observed an increase in glucose and lactate at 6 and 24 hpa in relation to control fins (0 hpa), which is consistent with an increment in the glycolytic influx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We also observed a strong increase of glutamine and glutamate at 24 hpa but not at 6 hpa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Glutamine and glutamate act as important substrates for protein and nucleotide synthesis necessary to support cellular integrity and growth suggesting an increase in biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Newsholme et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Yoo et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>We also monitored glucose uptake during regeneration using a fluorescent glucose analogue (2-NBDG). In control fins (0 hpa), we detected glucose uptake in the intersegment region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–H</xref> arrows,L,N), where a population of OP have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ando et al., 2017</xref>), which may imply that under homeostatic conditions, these cells require higher levels of glucose to maintain the progenitor niche. At 24 hpa, we observed a significant increase of glucose uptake in the blastema primordium and in the first segment below the amputation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I–K, M and N</xref>).</p><p>Finally, metabolic changes are usually associated to mitochondria dynamics events, fusion and fission, which control mitochondria shape, distribution and size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">van der Bliek et al., 2013</xref>). A balance between ﬁssion and fusion allows mitochondria to acquire the morphological structure to conduct specific cellular requisites and functions. Fusion maximizes OXPHOS for energy production in differentiated cells by stabilisation of the mitochondrial respiratory network, characterized by long mitochondria chains. In contrast, fission generates smaller and spherical mitochondria and is usually associated with stemness and with cells that rely on a glycolytic metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wanet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lisowski et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Prigione et al., 2015</xref>). Considering the increase in the glycolytic influx previously observed, we decided to address how mitochondria were affected during regeneration. By performing a qPCR analysis at 0, 6, and 24 hpa, we observed an increase in expression of genes associated with mitochondrial fission, namely <italic>drp1</italic> and <italic>fis1</italic>, at 6 hpa but not at 24 hpa, when compared to uninjured condition (0 hpa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). By quantifying the number of mitochondria using the reporter line MLS-GFP, which labels the mitochondria membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kim et al., 2008</xref>), we noticed an increase in the number of mitochondria per cell at 6 and 24 hpa, in relation to uninjured control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C-H’,I</xref>). To address if there were also changes in mitochondria size that could correspond to an actual increase in fission, we measured mitochondria volumes and grouped them into different size intervals. Mitochondria usually measure between 0.5 and 3 µm<sup>3</sup>, but their size and shape can vary considerably (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Shami et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Wiemerslage and Lee, 2016</xref>). In accordance with an increase in mitochondria fission, we observed a significant increase in percentage of mitochondria smaller than 0,1 µm<sup>3</sup> at 6 hpa, while at 24 hpa the mitochondria size profile is similar to the 0 hpa condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C-H',J</xref>). Taken together, these results are in consistent with an increase in mitochondrial fission triggered by amputation and further supports the hypothesis that the early stages of regeneration involve an upregulation of glycolytic activity, which is accompanied by a temporally restricted program of mitochondria fission.</p><p>Thus, metabolic adaptation enhancing glycolysis seems to constitute an integral response to amputation, tightly regulated in terms of time and space. Our transcriptome and metabolome studies indicate a specific metabolic signature as part of an early response to amputation by OBs and by the remaining caudal fin tissue. Overall, cells respond to injury by increasing the glycolytic influx, lactate production and mitochondrial fission just preceding dedifferentiation and blastema formation. These results corroborate the hypothesis that amputation induces a reprogramming of the metabolic profile, which may be part of a general program that coordinates the regenerative response.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Glycolytic influx and lactate generation supports blastema formation during caudal fin regeneration</title><p>To investigate the functional relevance of the energy metabolism, we chose to start with a broader analysis in which we manipulated specific branches of energy metabolism with pharmacological compounds and address its requirement for blastema formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The blastema is a hallmark and prerequisite of epimorphic regeneration and is fully assembled within 48 hpa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kawakami, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Poss et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pfefferli and Jaźwińska, 2015</xref>). Firstly, we inhibited glycolysis using an established glucose analogue, 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sinclair et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Honkoop et al., 2019</xref>), that competes with glucose for Hk catalytic domain, the first step of glycolysis, inhibiting the downstream products derived from glucose. 2DG was administered in different time points right after amputation to affect different stages of blastema formation: for a short period before blastema formation (0 hpa and 0-12hpa), or for a prolonged period, which includes the blastema assembly phase (0-24hpa and 0-36hpa). Fins were imaged at 48 hpa to determine the effect of 2DG on blastema growth by measuring the total fin regenerated area and quantifying the percentage of regenerated area, in relation to control caudal fin regenerated area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We observed that the higher the duration of the treatment the stronger the effect on blastema growth in comparison to control fins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D–K</xref>). Interestingly, a single dose of 2DG administered at 0 hpa already showed significant smaller regenerates when compared to control fins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref>). Administration of 2DG between 0–12, 0–24, and 0–36 hpa had a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the overall regenerated area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and F–K</xref>). Accordingly, blocking of the glycolytic influx for the first 36 hpa led to a complete abrogation of blastema assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and J–K</xref>). Similarly, the glycolysis inhibitor acting downstream of 2DG, 3-(3-pyridinyl)–1-(4-pyridinyl)–2-propen-1-one (3PO), which partially inhibits the glycolytic activator of Pfk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schoors et al., 2014</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), also exhibited a general impairment of caudal fin regeneration, as observed at 48 hpa in relation to control fins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A-D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Inhibition of glycolysis, but not OXPHOS, impairs blastema formation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the compounds used to manipulate glucose metabolism.

Together, these results indicate that glycolysis and lactate generation, but not OXPHOS, are essential for the initial stages of caudal fin regeneration.

Therefore, we blocked glycolysis with 2DG and performed a detailed characterization of OB dedifferentiation at 24 hpa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

During homeostasis NF-kB pathway maintains retinoic acid (RA) signalling in OBs, supporting differentiation. Upon amputation, NF-kB pathway becomes inactivated and RA is degraded through activity of the RA-degrading enzyme, Cyp26b1, thereby inducing OB dedifferentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mishra et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blum and Begemann, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In addition, Bmp signaling is also considered to be a potent inducer of OB differentiation during regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Stewart et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brandão et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Smith et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Quint et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, we performed qPCR analysis at 24 hpa of NF-kB target genes (<italic>e.g. nf</italic>k<italic>biaa</italic> and <italic>nf</italic>k<italic>biab</italic>), retinoic acid degrading enzyme (<italic>e.g. cyp26b1</italic>), and Bmp ligands (<italic>e.g. bmp2a</italic> and <italic>bmp2b</italic>) in control and 2DG-treated fins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We observed an increase in NF-kB target genes and in <italic>bmp2b</italic>, accompanied by a decrease in <italic>cyp26b1</italic> in 2DG-treated fins. Thus, suppression of glycolysis seems to maintain the mature OB differentiation profile and to prevent their dedifferentiation after amputation, resembling a pre-amputation scenario.</p><p>We then evaluated whether glycolysis is necessary for other aspects of OB dedifferentiation namely migration toward the stump and cell cycle re-entry. Surprisingly, by measuring the relative cell displacement of the OB population in the first segment below the amputation region after 24 hpa, we observed that 2DG administration had no effect on the ability of OB to migrate and reach the amputation zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–E</xref>). However, cell cycle re-entry, examined through a EdU 3 hr pulse assay in <italic>bglap</italic>:EGFP transgenics, was strongly affected by 2DG treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–G’</xref>) contrasting with control caudal fins. We observed a significant reduction of total number of Runx2 +Bglap + EdU +pre OBs per area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>) and percentage of Runx2 +Bglap + EdU +within the Runx2 +Bglap + population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). By quantifying the remaining pre-OB population Runx2 +Bglap-, we also observed a reduction in the number and relative percentage of Runx2 +Bglap-EdU+pre OBs upon 2DG treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–G’</xref> arrows, H,I). This indicates that blocking glycolytic machinery has a severe impact in the number of pre-OB that re-enter the cell cycle, reducing their proliferative capacity. This inhibition of cell cycle re-entry by 2DG was also observed in the blastema primordium mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A-F,H</xref>) and the overlying epidermal cap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A-F,G</xref>). Moreover, the decline in the capacity of pre-OB to re-enter the cell cycle and to proliferate could be correlated with defects in the activity of pathways known to be indispensable for blastema proliferation, such as, Wnt, Insulin and Fgf signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lee et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Poss et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Stoick-Cooper et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chablais and Jazwinska, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Wehner and Weidinger, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Shibata et al., 2016</xref>).

As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Stewart et al., 2014</xref>), in control fins Runx2 +Osx + immature OBs exhibit a higher proliferation rate than Runx2 +Osx- pre-OBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H, H’, J and K</xref>). Strikingly, glycolysis inhibition had a more profound impact on proliferation at 48 hpa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I–K</xref>) than at 24 hpa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–I</xref>), with both OB subtypes exhibiting a significant reduction of their proliferative capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H–K</xref>). This reduction was particularly noticeable in Runx2 +Osx + OB subtype. We also noticed that, as observed at 24 hpa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G,H</xref>), the epidermis and mesenchyme were also affected, displaying a decrease in proliferation in 2-DG-treated fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A-H</xref>). Given the results obtained, the most likely interpretation is that both pre-OB and immature OB populations accumulate at the stump region since they are unable to proceed in the cell cycle and divide. In fact, corroborating these observations, when monitoring Runx2 +Bglap + pre-OB, using <italic>bglap</italic>:EGFP line, at 48 hpa, we observed that while in normal regenerating conditions dedifferentiated OBs were found near the stump region, contributing to the blastema (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A,A’,C</xref>) as previously demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Knopf et al., 2011</xref>), after 2DG inhibition these cells remained accumulated at the stump, indicative of their inability to progress during the regenerative process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B,B’,C</xref>). These data let us to further hypothesized that the Runx2 +Osx + immature OBs found near the stump region in the 2DG context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D, D', I, I'</xref>), are, at least in part, still OBs that were unable to fully dedifferentiate after fin amputation. Also, it is noteworthy mentioning that after 2DG administration, Runx2 +Osx- pre-OBs are still able to be recruited at this stage, but do not increase in total numbers due to inability to proliferate. Interestingly, this may indicate that, although OB dedifferentiation is compromised after blocking the glycolytic influx, pre-OB may be generated by alternative sources. By extending 2DG treatment into the outgrowth and patterning phase of regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4A</xref>), we observe that while control fish are able to efficiently reconstruct the lost skeletal tissue at 7 days post-amputation (dpa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4C,D</xref>), in 2DG-treated animals bone regeneration was completely abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4E, F</xref>). Although we observe a clear effect of 2DG in inhibiting new bone regeneration, sustained 2DG exposure for 7 consecutive days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4B</xref>) seemed to have no impact on uninjured caudal fin morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4G-J</xref>).

Here, by providing a deeper characterization of OB dedifferentiation, we demonstrate that this process is triggered as early as 6 hpa, in parallel with the initial wound healing response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, our transcriptomic analysis of isolated OBs revealed a dynamic transcriptional response at 6 hpa in comparison to OBs from uninjured conditions. This provides the first molecular characterization of OBs preceding the dedifferentiation stage, highlighting that mature OBs start changing their transcriptome earlier than expected and that the first hours after amputation are crucial for the transcriptional and phenotypic alterations leading to dedifferentiation. The set of differentially expressed genes unveils potential new players worth revisiting in the future. Our study uncouples OB response from surrounding tissues, and addresses the early stages of fin regeneration, which are the least investigated. In fact, most published data focus on time points from 24 hpa onwards, when wound closure has finished, blastema formation is in progress and consequently initial cell identity transitions have been dictated, potentially missing initial regulators of dedifferentiation. Importantly, we show that at 6 hpa OB prioritise lactate-producing glycolysis, when compared to OB from uninjured fins. Additionally, we also observed a similar response at 6 hpa in the whole fin stump, corroborated by gene expression and metabolomic data. These alterations persist at least until 24 hpa, when the blastema primordium is being assembled. Moreover, we demonstrate that this change in metabolism to enhance glycolysis occurs concomitantly with an increase in mitochondria fission. We also show that glycolysis is indispensable to support blastema formation and regeneration. Blocking glycolysis leads to a complete blastema suppression, with a single injection of 2DG at 0 hpa being sufficient to induce aberrant blastema formation. These results indicate that OBs and other cell lineages respond to amputation by undergoing a change in the metabolic profile that favours glycolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Furthermore, glycolysis is necessary from the early onset of regeneration and the time interval when these changes in metabolism happen appears to be fundamental for the initiation of regeneration. It is possible that early wound response signals are important to trigger changes in metabolic signature. One potentially relevant event described at this stage is reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gauron et al., 2013</xref>). ROS and cellular metabolism are tightly connected as ROS are a by-product of mitochondrial oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Zorov et al., 2014</xref>) and produced by epithelial cells upon damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cordeiro and Jacinto, 2013</xref>). ROS are shown to activate important molecules, such as HIF-1α, which has been shown to promote metabolic reprogramming toward glycolysis in other contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nagao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sies and Jones, 2020</xref>).

This reflects an essential role of glycolysis in periods of rapid cellular growth, while oxidative metabolism is preferred in mature cells to maintain homeostasis (Lunt el al., 2011; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gándara and Wappner, 2018</xref>). Prioritizing glycolysis entails several advantages for rapid proliferating cells: fuels biosynthetic pathways necessary to sustain rapid cell growth and division by generating intermediaries for macromolecules synthesis (e.g. nucleic acids, lipids; and non-essential amino acids); the rate ATP generation is faster through glycolysis than mitochondrial glucose oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">DeBerardinis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liberti and Locasale, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Vander Heiden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lunt and Vander Heiden, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Yadav et al., 2020</xref>); and finally, pathways branching from glycolysis also provide intermediate metabolites necessary for post-translational modification of proteins, histones and DNA (e.g. acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, or glycosylation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Tarazona and Pourquié, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sun et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Moussaieff et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Etchegaray and Mostoslavsky, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Ryall et al., 2015</xref>).

One of the best reported examples occurs during induced-pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) reprogramming, in which the switch toward a glycolytic metabolism happens before the expression of endogenous reprogramming factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cliff and Dalton, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Folmes et al., 2011</xref>), implying that metabolic reprogramming is a cause rather that a consequence of cell reprogramming.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Caudal fin metabolic adaptation resembles the Warburg effect</title><p>Metabolic reprogramming has also emerged in a disease context as a cancer hallmark and first described in cancer cells as the ‘Warburg effect’ (i.e. aerobic glycolysis) in which cancer cells use primarily glycolysis, resulting in lactate production, instead of pyruvate oxidation through OXPHOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">DeBerardinis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Intlekofer and Finley, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Warburg et al., 1927</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Yadav et al., 2020</xref>). The metabolic changes that occur during fin regeneration share several parallels between cancer metabolism pathophysiology, namely preference for glycolysis to support proliferation and elevated levels of glutamine, an essential nutrient that supplies cancer metabolism. Besides functioning as a precursor for nucleotides and amino acid synthesis, glutamine can be converted into glutamate, a metabolic intermediate with various fates in proliferating cells (e.g. protein synthesis, and incorporation into the TCA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Melissa, 2016</xref>). Interestingly, like cancer cells, our data points to an important role of glutamine and glutamate for the assembly of the blastema primordium, as our metabolome studies show an increase by 100- and 400-fold in glutamine and glutamate at the beginning of blastema formation, respectively. Cancer cells also produce high levels of lactate where it is often regarded as an important oncometabolite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Loeffler et al., 2018</xref>), correlated with cancer-induced angiogenesis, invasion, metastasis, and immunosuppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de la Cruz-López et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Parks et al., 2020</xref>). Our studies show not only an increase in lactate during the initial stages of regeneration, but also reveal that inhibition of pyruvate conversion to lactate leads to defects in blastema formation, although milder when compared to glycolysis inhibition. This indicates that lactate production may also contribute to proper blastema formation. The mechanisms by which the glutamine and glutamate cycle and lactate influence blastema formation should be addressed in future studies. Unexpectedly, albeit aerobic glycolysis is known to support cancer cell migration, our results show that glycolysis is not required for mature OB recruitment and motility. It would be interesting to evaluate how alterations in glucose metabolism are regulated throughout the regenerative process, without falling into tumorigenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Metabolic adaptation is necessary for cell fate transitions and blastema proliferation</title><p>Our data shows that enhancing glycolysis serves to adapt to the cellular demands of regeneration, but it also seems to have the power to dictate several aspects of the regeneration program, including modulation of mature OB dedifferentiation. Previous studies have shown that OB dedifferentiation is a result of the activity of the NF-kB-RA axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mishra et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blum and Begemann, 2015</xref>). In homeostasis, NF-kB supports RA signalling, by blocking the expression of <italic>cyp26b1</italic>, the RA-degrading enzyme, maintaining OB differentiation. After amputation, NF-kB becomes inactivated and Cyp26b1 suppression is lifted, thereby protecting OB from RA and promoting their dedifferentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mishra et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blum and Begemann, 2015</xref>). We show that blocking glycolysis leads to NF-kB signalling stimulation and decrease in <italic>cyp26b1</italic> expression, providing evidence that increase in glycolytic activity precedes and is necessary to induce mature OB reprogramming into pre-OB. In addition, our data shows that glycolysis is necessary to support pre-OB cell cycle re-entry and to sustain blastema proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) and can be linked to <italic>fibroblast growth factor 20</italic> a (<italic>fgf20a</italic>), which is fundamental for blastema initiation and proliferation during regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Poss et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Shibata et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Whitehead et al., 2005</xref>). Mutants for <italic>fgf20a</italic> fail to form a functional blastema and are unable to proliferate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Whitehead et al., 2005</xref>). Accordingly, blocking Fgf receptor 1 activity leads to a similar phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lee et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Poss et al., 2000</xref>), but does not impair OB dedifferentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Knopf et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that its primary role is to regulate blastema proliferation. Our work suggests that glycolysis promotes not only the expression of <italic>fgf20a</italic>, but also of other ligands that cooperate to induce <italic>fgf20a</italic> expression, such as <italic>igf2b</italic> and <italic>wnt10a</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Stoick-Cooper et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chablais and Jazwinska, 2010</xref>). Since these pathways are part of a general mechanism triggered upon amputation to stimulate proliferation, it is not surprising that glycolysis inhibition caused an overall reduction of proliferation. In addition, the presented data indicates that glycolysis is necessary until the end of blastema formation, to generate new OBs and to maintain a proper balance between OB subtypes within the blastema (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Decline in the total number of immature OB and in the proliferative rates of distal pre-OB and of proximal immature OB populations observed upon glycolysis inhibition, can be accounted, at least in part, by the pronounced effects of glycolysis inhibition on blastema proliferation. Importantly, these results corroborate the idea that regeneration benefits from glycolysis both in terms of biomass generation, to support cell proliferation, and by inducing the expression of powerful mitogens, like <italic>fgf20a</italic>. Noteworthy, besides mature OBs, pre-OB can also derive from a population of OB progenitor that resides in the joint regions of the fin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ando et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, mature OB and joint-associated progenitors may act as complementary sources that supply the pre-OB pool. In fact, we observed that glycolysis inhibition leads to a diminished number of pre-OBs before blastema formation, yet this number is back to normal after blastema formation. Since blocking glycolysis prevented OB dedifferentiation, we could speculate that over time OB progenitors from the joints were able to replenish the pre-OB pool. Further work is needed to test this hypothesis and the impact of glucose metabolism in supporting OP activation and contribution for new OB formation. In general terms, this study provides the first line of evidence that metabolic adaptation towards glycolysis governs mature OB dedifferentiation and blastema proliferation. To some extent, this is mediated through glycolysis-driven changes in gene expression that allows to uncouple dedifferentiation from acquisition of proliferative capacity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Metabolic adaptation as a conserved mechanism in regenerative contexts</title><p>Regeneration is in its essence an anabolic process. After an insult, reconfiguration of the extracellular milieu can induce metabolic adaptations that are fundamental to accommodate new cellular functions that support growth and cell fate decisions necessary for regeneration. In line with our data, other animals with enhanced regenerative abilities, such as planarians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Osuma et al., 2018</xref>) or amphibians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alibardi, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Varela-Rodríguez et al., 2020</xref>) also show a predominance of glycolysis upon injury to sustain proliferation. This indicates that metabolic rewiring towards glycolysis might be a conserved mechanism necessary for the regenerative process. Importantly, changes in glucose metabolism were also shown to be necessary for regeneration of other zebrafish tissues. Like OBs in the fin, after cardiac injury, regeneration is achieved via dedifferentiation and proliferation of cardiomyocytes near the injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kikuchi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jopling et al., 2010</xref>). Recent studies have demonstrated that these cells switch to a glycolytic metabolism necessary for their dedifferentiation and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Honkoop et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fukuda et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, regeneration of the embryonic tail was shown to rely on glycolysis to support blastema formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sinclair et al., 2021</xref>). Glycolysis was required to fuel the hexosamine pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sinclair et al., 2021</xref>), which is responsible for glycosylation of proteins associated with cell signaling, gene transcription, and EMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akella et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Reily et al., 2019</xref>). Given these results and the similarities between larval tail and adult caudal fin regeneration, it would be important to examine the function of hexosamine pathway during fin regeneration. In contrast to zebrafish, mammals possess poor capacity to perform epimorphic regeneration of complex structures, with only a few examples, such as amputated ear and digit tips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Seifert and Muneoka, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Johnson et al., 2020</xref>). In mice models of ear and digit injuries, regeneration is impaired by OXPHOS inhibition, suggesting that in this context OXPHOS is required to mediate regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Shyh-Chang et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, the MRL mice strain, which has an enhanced regenerative capacity in comparison to other mice, showed an increase of aerobic glycolysis over OXPHOS after injury of several organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Naviaux et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Heber-Katz, 2017</xref>). This indicates that further studies are necessary to clarify the potential role of glucose metabolism during mammalian regeneration. Regarding bone, disruption of the metabolic profile of OBs and OB sources (e.g. mesenchymal stem cells) might also have important implications for bone repair after injury and in certain pathological conditions (e.g. osteoporosis), as they influence OB identity status and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Loeffler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">van Gastel and Carmeliet, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Karner and Long, 2018</xref>). Cell metabolism can potentially be a target in the contexts of fracture healing or bone diseases, to stimulate the repair process, or to prevent OB dysfunction.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>The data described here provides clear evidence that a metabolic reprogramming favouring anaerobic glycolysis occur at early stages of adult regeneration and are an integral component of the regenerative program. This is in accordance with recent regeneration studies performed in other systems and resembles many traits of the Warburg effect observed in cancer cells. Our data indicates that OB and possibly other cell lineages favour glycolysis, to engage a specialized genetic program that enables them to act as progenitor cells. We unveil a novel and fundamental role of glycolysis in mediating mature OB dedifferentiation and cell cycle re-entry and supporting blastema assembly and proliferation. Moreover, we have uncoupled the effects of glycolysis in mediating OB dedifferentiation from proliferation by identifying distinct downstream transcriptional targets of the glycolytic metabolism. This provides evidence that the role of glucose metabolism in regeneration is not limited to sustain macromolecule synthesis and energy production. Overall, our findings support a notion that glucose metabolism has a powerful instructive role in regulating lineage-specific programs and generic responses to injury that induce changes in cell identity and function, crucial to prompt bone regeneration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Zebrafish lines maintenance and caudal fin amputation</title><p>Wild-type (WT) AB and transgenic zebrafish lines, namely <italic>Tg(osterix:mCherryNTRo)<sup>pd4</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Singh et al., 2012</xref>) (referred as <italic>osx</italic>:mCherry), kindly provided by Kenneth Poss, <italic>Tg(ola.Bglap:EGFP)<sup>hu4008</sup></italic> (referred as <italic>bglap</italic>:EGFP) and <italic>Tg(Has.RUNX2-Mmu.Fos:EGFP)<sup>zf259</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Knopf et al., 2011</xref>) (referred as <italic>runx2</italic>:EGFP), kindly provided by Gilbert Weidinger, and <italic>Tg(Xla.Eef1a1:mlsEGFP</italic>) (referred as MLS-GFP), kindly provided by Seok-Yong Choi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kim et al., 2008</xref>) were maintained in a circulating system with 14 hr/day and 10 hr/night cycle at 28 °C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Westerfield, 2000</xref>).

Only p-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant and log2 values that lie between –1 and 1 were ignored.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All the people involved in animal handling and experimentation were properly trained and accredited by FELASA.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Phillip Newmark as Reviewing Editor and Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Yi Feng (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) One of the major claims of the manuscript is that there is a &quot;metabolic switch&quot; from OXPHOS to aerobic glycolysis. The authors clearly show that enhanced glycolysis is indispensable for osteoblast dedifferentiation and cell cycle reentry during regeneration; however, they do not provide direct evidence that OXPHOS is diminished. Although treatment with two OXPHOS inhibitors (MB6, UK5099) does not inhibit regeneration, the authors provide no rationale or citations for the concentrations of the drugs used here, nor validation that these concentrations are effective in the animal. Thus, for the authors to maintain their assertion of a &quot;metabolic switch,&quot; they should provide further evidence to support the downregulation of OXPHOS (e.g., is PDK upregulated? Is mitochondria pyruvate carrier downregulated? Are TCA cycle intermediates downregulated?). In the absence of such additional support for OXPHOS downregulation, the authors should modify their text (title, abstract, and main manuscript) and tone down their conclusions accordingly.</p><p>2) In the course of our editorial consultation, one reviewer noted that if UK5099 treatment blocks pyruvate entry into mitochondria, it should lead to enhanced lactate production. Based on the authors' model, enhanced lactate might be predicted to enhance regeneration. Figure 3S shows a slightly increased blastema area in UK5099-treated animals, but the sample size is quite small (n=5). The authors are encouraged to repeat this experiment and increase their sample sizes.</p><p>3) In their comments (included below), reviewer #1 noted that the terminology used in this manuscript to define proximal and distal blastema, as well as the patterning zone is not consistent with standard usage in the field. The figures and text should be modified so that use of these terms is consistent with standard usage. The authors should also comment on why they appear to be detecting proliferation in the distal blastema (Figures 6H, S6A-C), in contrast to previous reports.</p><p>4) As requested by Reviewer #2 in their public review, please provide more details of the microarray analysis reported in Figure S1, along with documentation of the differentially expressed genes, including annotations, fold changes, and p values.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Positive impact of glycolysis activation or oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) inhibition</p><p>The authors nicely demonstrate the negative impact of glycolysis inhibition on fin regeneration and its cellular mechanisms, such as dedifferentiation, blastema formation and proliferation. However, the authors did not address another important aspect whether activation of glycolysis or inhibition of OXPHOS can enhance regeneration. One can argue that glycolysis is an essential metabolism and thus inhibition of glycolysis may cause defects of any biological events, including regeneration. Thus, another important approach is to determine whether metabolic reprogramming can enhance the regenerative program. I understand that the authors tried to address this by targeting OXPHOS but OXPHOS enzymes do not show differential transcription and UK5099 and MB6 do not impact fin regeneration. To address this further, I recommend the following:</p><p>1) LC-MS analysis</p><p>It is unclear whether the authors target to profile only four metabolites with LC-MS analysis (Figure 2E). I expect that the authors may be able to get more data from LC-MS, such as a profile of TCA cycle intermediates and key metabolites (succinate, citrate, malate, and so on). Even, there are more glucose metabolites, such as glucose-6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, and so on. As the authors focus on glycolysis and OXPHOS, the profiles of more glycolysis and TCA cycle metabolite changes should be provided.</p><p>2) Functional impact of glycolysis activation and/or OXPHOS inhibition</p><p>The authors used two drugs, MB6 and UK5099. However, it is unclear whether treatment of these drugs can efficiently and specifically inhibit OXPHOS. By brief literature search, it is hard to find out papers using these two drugs with animals (although there are multiple papers treating these drugs with cells). Thus, I recommend alternative approaches.</p><p>a) Genetic method</p><p>Fukuda et al., (2020, EMBO reports, DOI 10.15252/embr.201949752) employed genetic manipulation to enhance glycolysis in adult zebrafish. They used ppargc1a mutants and pdk3b overexpression line, providing evidence that metabolic switch can result in positive effects of heart regeneration. Magadum et al., (2020, Circulation, DOI: 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.043067) also used mouse genetics to transiently express Pkm2 and demonstrated positive effects on heart regeneration. Note that pkm2 is a well-characterized glycolytic enzyme in cancer that promotes glucose metabolism toward lactate. Based on Fukuda's work, pkma2 is likely a homolog of pkm2 in zebrafish. The authors consider using one of these animal models to determine whether metabolic reprogramming can enhance fin regeneration.</p><p>b) Pharmaceutical approach</p><p>An alternative approach is to change metabolism by treating drugs. Bae et al., (2021, Circulation, DOI: 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.049952) changed mouse metabolism by treating several drugs. They inhibit the succinate dehydrogenase enzyme complex by treating malonate and Atpenin A5 in mice. The authors consider treating these drugs and assess whether the metabolic switch can enhance fin regeneration.</p><p>2. Blastema subdivision</p><p>The blastema is defined as a proliferative cell mass, indicating that there are dedifferentiated cells, and once cells exit blastema they differentiate. In a 2002 paper (Nechiporuk and Keating, Development), the authors identified there are two distinct populations in the blastema. Distally located blastema cells are non-proliferative but express blastema marker msxb, naming it as distal blastema (DB). Thereafter, this DB is similarly used by multiple groups in the fin regeneration field as shown by several papers (Kang et al., Dev. Cell, 2013; Wehner et al., Cell Reports, 2014). This DB is a very small domain at the tip of mesenchymal cells. Based on previous works (Wehner et al., Cell Reports, 2014 and Stewart et al., Cell Reports, 2014), this DB is not marked by runx2 positive cell lining. By contrast, proximal blastema (PB) contains bilateral zones of proliferative pre-OB runx2 positive cell layers. As PB is a major blastema region and comprises proliferative cells, the PB ends by emerging differentiated cells, such as osterix positive cells. As patterning zone (PZ) indicates differentiation, the PZ area starts with osx expressing cells. This compartmentalization of blastema is standard in fin regeneration. However, the authors define DB, PB, and PZ incorrectly. In Figure 6B, DB actually indicates PB and both PB and PZ indicate PZ. DB is a very small domain distal to PB, which is not annotated in Figure 6B. Thus, Figure 6 and Sup Figure 5 use incorrect indications and result 5 &quot;Glycolysis suppression leads to ~&quot; is also incorrectly described.</p><p>Line 321 &quot;show cycling Runx2+ pre-OBs maintain the progenitor pool in the DB&quot;</p><p>– This is not DB, but PB.</p><p>Line 322&quot; as they proliferate and populate the PB, they differentiate into fast-proliferating Runx2+ Osx+ immature OBs&quot;</p><p>– This describes PZ, not PB (or the border of PB and PZ as it is not possible to clearly subdivide these two regions).</p><p>I highly recommend revising the manuscript (result section 5 and discussion) and figures based on the definition of PB and DB widely used in the field.</p><p>3.

The authors clearly show that enhanced glycolysis is indispensable for osteoblast dedifferentiation and cell cycle reentry during regeneration; however, they do not provide direct evidence that OXPHOS is diminished. Although treatment with two OXPHOS inhibitors (MB6, UK5099) does not inhibit regeneration, the authors provide no rationale or citations for the concentrations of the drugs used here, nor validation that these concentrations are effective in the animal. Thus, for the authors to maintain their assertion of a &quot;metabolic switch,&quot; they should provide further evidence to support the downregulation of OXPHOS (e.g., is PDK upregulated? Is mitochondria pyruvate carrier downregulated? Are TCA cycle intermediates downregulated?). In the absence of such additional support for OXPHOS downregulation, the authors should modify their text (title, abstract, and main manuscript) and tone down their conclusions accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers concerns and feedback on this matter and agree that in order to use the term “metabolic switch” we need to provide further evidence. We have followed the reviewer’s suggestions and our results were the following:</p><p>– By evaluating the expression profile of <italic>pdk</italic>, the inhibitor of pdh, namely <italic>pdk3a</italic> and <italic>pdk3b</italic>, we observe that there is an actual downregulation of the expression of both genes, which goes against a downregulation of OXPHOS. However, we highlight that in our data (Figure 2C) we also observe a clear downregulation of <italic>pdha1b</italic>, which converts pyruvate into acetyl-CoA, at 6 hpa when changes in energy metabolism start to occur. The expression profile of the mitochondria pyruvate carriers analysed, <italic>mpc1</italic> and <italic>mpc2</italic>, was unchanged at 6 and 24 hpa. Overall, the analysis by qPCR of the expression of both <italic>pdk</italic> and <italic>mpc</italic> components does not provide clear evidence for a “metabolic switch”. Given this, we decided to not include these data into the manuscript, but we provide the reviewers the graphs containing the data mentioned above.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Relative gene expression of <italic>mpc1, mpc2, pdk3b</italic>, in the whole caudal fin stump, a (A) 6hpa and at (B) 24 hpa in comparison to uninjured conditions (0 hpa).</title><p>Statisical analysis with <italic>t</italic> test (n=5 (A) and 4 (B) biological replicates).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-76987-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>– To assess TCA cycle intermediates, which could give further proof of a “metabolic switch” during fin regeneration, we did an untargeted MS protocol at 6 and 24 hpa in relation to 0 hpa. Unfortunately, for our 6 and 24 hpa samples, the amount of most of the metabolites was very low, bellow the MS instrument sensibility, which limited the data that we could analyse and that we were confident enough to include in the manuscript. Since this experiment is very time consuming and requires many animals, we could not repeat the assay. We were only able to use the measurements for Citrate, the first metabolic intermediate from TCA cycle generated from acetyl-CoA, and α-KG for the 6 hpa time-point. Citrate is significantly downregulated, and α-KG remained unchanged, which suggests a lower contribution of acetyl-CoA to fuel TCA cycle and be converted into Citrate, thus potentially reducing of OXPHOS. Given that few TCA intermediates were retrieved from our MS assay, we were not able to further improve our arguments on this point. We decided to not include these results into the manuscript but provide the data to the reviewers in this document.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Relative measurement of Citrate and a-KG metabolite levels, in the whole caudel fin stump, at 6 hpa in comparison to uninjured conditions (0 hpa) Statistical analysis with Turkey HSD test (n=4 biological replicates).</title><p>Mean and SD displayed on the graphs. <italic>n.s., not significative, *, p-value &lt;0,01</italic>.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-76987-sa2-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Regarding the reviewer’s comment on, the drugs used in this manuscript to inhibit OXPHOS, UK5099 and MB6, our rationale to the amount of drug administered via IP was the following:</p><p>“For UK5099, we used the higher concentration that allows a proper dissolution of the compound in the solvent used (PBS:DMSO, 1:1 mixture). This concentration did not lead to mortality nor signs of toxicity in the animals used in our study. This pharmacological compound was previously validated and shown to work in mice for inhibition of mitochondrial OXPHOS (Corbet et al., 2018; Buyse et al., 2021).</p><p>For MB6, animals were incubated with an already validated concentration, previously described in two studies using zebrafish larvae (Dabir et al., 2013; Sinclair et al., 2021). In our setting, animals incubated with the same concentration of MB6 did not show signs of toxicity nor increase in mortality.”</p><p>We hope this explanation helps clarifying this point.</p><p>In addition to the suggested experiments, we also looked at mitochondria dynamics in this context. Usually, changes in cellular metabolism are accompanied and are highly influenced by alterations in the mitochondria morphology, shape and size, due to fusion and fission events or even due to mitochondria biogenesis (Wai and Langer, 2016). In fact, there are many studies linking mitochondria morphology and function (Zemirli et al., 2018). In general terms, while differentiated cells possess a fused and elongated mitochondria network that sustains OXPHOS, the mitochondria of stem cells or proliferating cells, which rely on glycolysis, are smaller and spherical due to increase in fission events (Wai and Langer, 2016). Here, using a reporter line that labels mitochondria, MLS-GFP, we made two important observations that suggest that changes in metabolism occur in parallel or are accompanied by an increase in fission events at 6 hpa:</p><p>– Genes responsible for mitochondria fission, like <italic>drp1</italic> and <italic>fis1,</italic> were upregulated at 6 hpa;</p><p>– By analysing the number and size of mitochondria at 0, 6 and 24 hpa, we observed that there is an increase in mitochondria number at 6 and 24 hpa, when compared to uninjured caudal fins (0 hpa). Strikingly, at 6 hpa there is an increase in the percentage of smaller mitochondria (&lt;0.1 µm<sup>3</sup>), which is not observed at 24 hpa.</p><p>These data suggest that early stages of caudal fin regeneration, at 6 hpa time-point, are characterized by an enhancement of glycolysis that is associated with a potential increase of mitochondria fission. The increase in mitochondrial number and percentage of smaller mitochondria is indicative of mitochondria fission that, in other contexts, is known to be correlated with decrease of mitochondrial OXPHOS activity. Furthermore, similar observations were shown to occur during zebrafish heart regeneration (Honkoop et al., 2019). The authors demonstrated that border zone cardiomyocytes near the injury site, were characterized by having smaller and immature mitochondria, suggesting a reduced OXPHOS activity. Likewise, our data seems to support a tendency to decreased mitochondrial OXPHOS, at least at 6 hpa, however, a more detailed analysis on mitochondrial dynamics using other tools and evaluating other markers related to mitochondria fusion should be done to further support the data. Although mitochondria dynamics was not the primary focus of this work, these experiments presented very interesting results that could further support the manuscript’s main idea. Thus, we decided to add this data to the manuscript on new Figure 2—figure supplement 2 (Lines 212-232 and 425-426 in the main text, and Lines 587; 767-769; 814-818 in Material and Methods) and expect that these results contribute to clarifying the main message of this work.</p><p>Taking into account all the comments above and after carefully analysing our new sets of data we consider that “metabolic switch” may be a strong term to use in this case, so we opted to tone down our conclusions, as the reviewers also suggested. Therefore, we removed “metabolic switch” and rephrased the title and all the sentences throughout the main text and figures and, instead, we propose that our data is indicative of a metabolic adaptation that increases glycolysis, occurring at early stages of regeneration and supporting regeneration. We hope the reviewers agree that these modifications make the manuscript more precise and, importantly, are in accordance with the experimental data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In the course of our editorial consultation, one reviewer noted that if UK5099 treatment blocks pyruvate entry into mitochondria, it should lead to enhanced lactate production. Based on the authors' model, enhanced lactate might be predicted to enhance regeneration. Figure 3S shows a slightly increased blastema area in UK5099-treated animals, but the sample size is quite small (n=5). The authors are encouraged to repeat this experiment and increase their sample sizes.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for making this observation. As mentioned, the sample size used for this experiment was quite low, which may have masked an effect of UK5099 to increase regeneration. By following the reviewer’s suggestion and increasing the sample size, we observed that, in fact, administration of UK5099 lead to a slight but significant increase of the regenerated area (Figure 3P-S). This indicates that blocking pyruvate entry into the mitochondria could potentiate pyruvate conversion into lactate, which we have shown to be important for proper regeneration, enhancing this branch of glycolysis. These data are also in accordance with a recent study in zebrafish showing that stimulation of glycolysis can promote proliferation and regeneration (Fukuda et al., 2019). This new set of results was added to the manuscript on Figure 3S (Lines 270-275 in the main text). We expect this data to make the manuscript more interesting and exciting and thank the reviewer for leading us in this direction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In their comments (included below), reviewer #1 noted that the terminology used in this manuscript to define proximal and distal blastema, as well as the patterning zone is not consistent with standard usage in the field. The figures and text should be modified so that use of these terms is consistent with standard usage. The authors should also comment on why they appear to be detecting proliferation in the distal blastema (Figures 6H, S6A-C), in contrast to previous reports.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer #1 is correct, the definitions of the PZ, PB and DB are inconsistent with the terminology used in the field. We truly apologize for this oversight in our study and thank reviewer #1 for his remark. To be in accordance with the standard nomenclature used for the blastema subdivision, we have rectified and modified these terms to the proper definition in the main text (Lines 351-356 and 366 in the main text) and blastema representation in Figure 6B. In addition, we decided to withdraw blastema compartmentalization from images of caudal fin cryosections as the boundaries between the different compartments could be difficult to define, namely between the PB and PZ.</p><p>The reviewer also spotted dividing cells within the DB compartment (Figure 6H and S6A-C (now Figure 6—figure supplement 2A-C)) and expresses concerns, as DB cells are described to be non-proliferative (Nechiporuk and Keating, 2002). There are two main reasons for detecting cell proliferation within the DB:</p><p>– The initial reports addressing cell proliferation used mainly BrdU (Nechiporuk and Keating, 2002) and we used EdU, which could lead to differences in cell labelling and variances in the number of cells being detected. EdU is a simpler, quicker and sensitive assay, in contrast to BrdU, which requires harsh treatments that can compromising tissue integrity. Some studies observed discrepancies using the two methodologies and suggested that for the EdU and BrdU treatments to be considered equivalent, the exposure time to BrdU should be increased (da Silva et al., 2017). Thus, there may also exist differences between these two methods in the context of caudal fin regeneration that were not addressed before and should be potentially reviewed in the future;</p><p>– Although DB cells are characterized to be non-proliferative (Nechiporuk and Keating, 2002), depending on the BrdU incorporation interval there are cell within the DB demonstrating proliferative capacity. As quoted from the Nechiporuk and Keating, 2002 study: “During various lengths of BrdU treatment, we noticed that the number of proximally labeled DMB cells progressively increased with longer treatments (Figure 5C,E,F), suggesting that proximal DMB cells cycle at a slow rate&quot;.</p><p>The authors use several BrdU treatments to assess proliferation in the DB, 40min, 140min and 6 h, showing a correlation between the duration of treatment and the increase in number of proliferating cells, suggesting that DM is composed of slow cycling cells. Since we perform a 3 hour EdU incorporation assay, we could be detecting these slow cycling DB cells.</p><p>Therefore, our interpretation and explanation for detecting proliferative cells in the DB regards differences in methodology used to label proliferative cells. Due to differences in the compounds used to label proliferative cells and the incorporation time-window, these methodologies cannot be considered equivalent. We hope to have addressed the reviewer concerns on this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) As requested by Reviewer #2 in their public review, please provide more details of the microarray analysis reported in Figure S1, along with documentation of the differentially expressed genes, including annotations, fold changes, and p values.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested by reviewer #2, we now supply more details regarding the differential expressed genes obtained in the osteoblastArrayXS. In the Methods section, we added more information on the methods used to infer significantly differential expression (Lines 711-715 in Material and Methods). As mentioned in the main text, we submitted to NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus archive the transcriptome datasets analysed on this study (accession number GSE194385). Nevertheless, we now follow the reviewer suggestion and provide expression values for all samples and a list of the differentially expressed genes including annotations, fold changes and p values. This additional information is provided in Supplementary File 1. Please, also note that the data provided in the main Figure 2B regards a set of differentially expressed genes retrieved from the osteoblastArrayXS, which illustrates the differences in some glycolytic enzymes and OXPHOS components at 6 hpa in relation to uninjured (0 hpa). To make sure that this is clear on the text, we have rephrased it in the revisited manuscript (Lines 168-170 in the main text). By providing this additional data we give a more complete picture on metabolism related genes and pathways important for osteoblast dedifferentiation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. Positive impact of glycolysis activation or oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) inhibition</p><p>The authors nicely demonstrate the negative impact of glycolysis inhibition on fin regeneration and its cellular mechanisms, such as dedifferentiation, blastema formation and proliferation. However, the authors did not address another important aspect whether activation of glycolysis or inhibition of OXPHOS can enhance regeneration. One can argue that glycolysis is an essential metabolism and thus inhibition of glycolysis may cause defects of any biological events, including regeneration. Thus, another important approach is to determine whether metabolic reprogramming can enhance the regenerative program. I understand that the authors tried to address this by targeting OXPHOS but OXPHOS enzymes do not show differential transcription and UK5099 and MB6 do not impact fin regeneration. To address this further, I recommend the following:</p><p>1) LC-MS analysis</p><p>It is unclear whether the authors target to profile only four metabolites with LC-MS analysis (Figure 2E). I expect that the authors may be able to get more data from LC-MS, such as a profile of TCA cycle intermediates and key metabolites (succinate, citrate, malate, and so on). Even, there are more glucose metabolites, such as glucose-6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, and so on. As the authors focus on glycolysis and OXPHOS, the profiles of more glycolysis and TCA cycle metabolite changes should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the pertinent observation. To address the reviewer suggestion, we have tried to perform an untargeted MS analysis on caudal fin from 0, 6 and 24 hpa to assess whether TCA cycle intermediates were downregulated at 6 hpa and 24 hpa, in comparison to 0 hpa. As mentioned above, many TCA cycle metabolites at 6 and 24 hpa were not suitable for analysis since they did not pass the quality control, potentially due to the low amount of the metabolites obtained in these conditions. Unfortunately, we were only able to properly measure Citrate and α-KG at 6 hpa in relation to uninjured fins (0 hpa). Given that this is a very time-consuming experiment that requires many animals, we could not repeat the MS assay. Thus, the analysis of TCA cycle intermediates remains incomplete. As an alternative, we also tried, by other means, to demonstrate that there is an increase in glycolysis and a diminished OXPHOS activity by addressing mitochondria dynamics in this context. Usually, changes in cellular metabolism are accompanied and are highly influenced by alterations in the mitochondria morphology, shape and size due to fusion and fission events or even due to mitochondria biogenesis (Wai and Langer, 2016). These changes in morphology and intimately correlated to mitochondria function (Zemirli et al., 2018). In general terms, while differentiated cells possess a fused and elongated mitochondria network that sustains OXPHOS, the mitochondria of stem cells or proliferating cells which rely on glycolysis, are smaller and spherical due to increase in fission events (Wai and Langer, 2016).

Therefore, we decided to be more conservative regarding our conclusions. Instead of proposing that a complete “metabolic switch” occurs during fin regeneration, we rephrased and changed the main manuscript and figures so that the main idea is that there is a metabolic adaptation in the form of an increase in glycolysis and in the glycolytic influx that supports regeneration, not excluding a potential effect or role of OXPHOS. We acknowledge that by doing those modifications the manuscript becomes clearer, more accurate and precise and, importantly, in accordance with the experimental data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Functional impact of glycolysis activation and/or OXPHOS inhibition</p><p>The authors used two drugs, MB6 and UK5099.

Thus, I recommend alternative approaches.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer relevant comments and concerns and acknowledge that further information should be provided regarding the drugs used in this study. We also thank the reviewer for providing the following alternative suggestions. Regarding the reviewer’s apprehension regarding the drugs used in this manuscript to inhibit OXPHOS, UK5099 and MB6, our rationale to the amount of drug administered via IP was the following:</p><p>– For UK5099, we used the higher concentration that allows a proper dissolution of the compound in the solvent used (PBS:DMSO, 1:1 mixture).

In our setting, animals incubated with the same concentration of MB6 did not show signs of toxicity nor increase in mortality.</p><p>We hope this explanation helps clarifying this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a) Genetic method</p><p>Fukuda et al., (2020, EMBO reports, DOI 10.15252/embr.201949752) employed genetic manipulation to enhance glycolysis in adult zebrafish. They used ppargc1a mutants and pdk3b overexpression line, providing evidence that metabolic switch can result in positive effects of heart regeneration. Magadum et al., (2020, Circulation, DOI: 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.043067) also used mouse genetics to transiently express Pkm2 and demonstrated positive effects on heart regeneration. Note that pkm2 is a well-characterized glycolytic enzyme in cancer that promotes glucose metabolism toward lactate. Based on Fukuda's work, pkma2 is likely a homolog of pkm2 in zebrafish. The authors consider using one of these animal models to determine whether metabolic reprogramming can enhance fin regeneration.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully understand that genetics would be the best approach to further explore our data. However, when Fukuda et al., (2020, EMBO reports) was published, we already had most of the data regarding 2DG, UK5099 and SO. We have considered to use <italic>ppargc1a</italic> and <italic>pkma2<sup>-/-</sup>; pkmb<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants, which were the more suitable to us and for the adult zebrafish studies. The use of these lines could confirm our results and possibly demonstrate show that fin regeneration is improved by stimulating glycolysis. Nevertheless, this would increase greatly the time required to perform the experiments This would require permission to perform a new set of experiments with animals, and mutant and sibling fish to grow into adulthood (approximately 3/4 months) to be genotyped and then subjected to experimentation. Alternatively, as mentioned above in the “Essential Revisions” section, we have increased the sample size for the UK5099 treatment, which, since it blocks pyruvate transportation to the mitochondria, may enhance pyruvate conversion into lactate and potentiate aerobic glycolysis. We observed that administration of UK5099 lead to a slight but significant increase of the regenerated area (Figure 3P-S). This indicates that blocking pyruvate entry into the mitochondria could potentiate pyruvate conversion into lactate, which we have shown to be also important for proper regeneration, enhancing this branch of glycolysis. We hope this new set of data is enough to persuade the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Pharmaceutical approach</p><p>An alternative approach is to change metabolism by treating drugs. Bae et al., (2021, Circulation, DOI: 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.049952) changed mouse metabolism by treating several drugs. They inhibit the succinate dehydrogenase enzyme complex by treating malonate and Atpenin A5 in mice. The authors consider treating these drugs and assess whether the metabolic switch can enhance fin regeneration.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her suggestion. We would like to avoid using another drug since the process of optimization could be very time-consuming and titration is usually required. Also, the drugs used in this manuscript, UK5099 and MB6, have been shown to block the oxidative branch of glycolysis, both in mice and in zebrafish (i.e., MB6). In addition, we also think that using UK5099 is a more effective approach to test whether the metabolic adaptation can enhance fin regeneration, since it inhibits the pyruvate entry into mitochondria, thereby pyruvate is available to fuel, support and increase aerobic glycolysis. As suggested by the reviewer, inhibition of the mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase enzymatic complex, part of the electron transport chain, would allow to access whether OXPHOS is important to support regeneration, similar to the MB6 context. Importantly, as suggested by the reviewer, we also test the ability of UK5099 to enhance of caudal fin regeneration and in fact we observed an increase in the regenerative area of the fin at 48 hpa. Given this new set of results, we became more confident that UK5099, potentially by enhancing glycolysis, to have a beneficial, although modest, effect on fin regeneration. We hope this explanation and the new set of result obtained with UK5099 is sufficient to clarify this point and these arguments can convince the reviewer that UK5099 is the more suitable compound to address this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Blastema subdivision</p><p>The blastema is defined as a proliferative cell mass, indicating that there are dedifferentiated cells, and once cells exit blastema they differentiate. In a 2002 paper (Nechiporuk and Keating, Development), the authors identified there are two distinct populations in the blastema. Distally located blastema cells are non-proliferative but express blastema marker msxb, naming it as distal blastema (DB). Thereafter, this DB is similarly used by multiple groups in the fin regeneration field as shown by several papers (Kang et al., Dev. Cell, 2013; Wehner et al., Cell Reports, 2014). This DB is a very small domain at the tip of mesenchymal cells. Based on previous works (Wehner et al., Cell Reports, 2014 and Stewart et al., Cell Reports, 2014), this DB is not marked by runx2 positive cell lining. By contrast, proximal blastema (PB) contains bilateral zones of proliferative pre-OB runx2 positive cell layers. As PB is a major blastema region and comprises proliferative cells, the PB ends by emerging differentiated cells, such as osterix positive cells. As patterning zone (PZ) indicates differentiation, the PZ area starts with osx expressing cells. This compartmentalization of blastema is standard in fin regeneration. However, the authors define DB, PB, and PZ incorrectly. In Figure 6B, DB actually indicates PB and both PB and PZ indicate PZ. DB is a very small domain distal to PB, which is not annotated in Figure 6B. Thus, Figure 6 and Sup Figure 5 use incorrect indications and result 5 &quot;Glycolysis suppression leads to ~&quot; is also incorrectly described.</p><p>Line 321 &quot;show cycling Runx2+ pre-OBs maintain the progenitor pool in the DB&quot;</p><p>– This is not DB, but PB.</p><p>Line 322&quot; as they proliferate and populate the PB, they differentiate into fast-proliferating Runx2+ Osx+ immature OBs&quot;</p><p>– This describes PZ, not PB (or the border of PB and PZ as it is not possible to clearly subdivide these two regions).</p><p>I highly recommend revising the manuscript (result section 5 and discussion) and figures based on the definition of PB and DB widely used in the field.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is absolutely correct, the definitions of the PZ, PB and DB are inconsistent with the terminology used in the field and therefore are not correct. We truly apologize for this flaw in our study and thank reviewer #1 for noticing this error. In accordance with the nomenclature used to define the blastema regions, we have rectified and modified these terms to the proper definition in the main text (Lines 351-356 and 366 in the main text) and representation in Figure 6B. We decided to withdraw blastema compartmentalization from images of caudal fin cryosections as the boundaries between the different compartments could be difficult to define, namely between the PB and PZ. We hope that the changes made to this revisited version of the manuscript are now correct regarding blastema nomenclature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Long-term effects of glycolysis inhibition</p><p>The authors assess fin regeneration before 48hpa. How about after 48 hours? Are there any bone phenotypes at 4 or 7 dpa or is bone completely lost?</p></disp-quote><p>We performed these experiments as the reviewer suggested. However, we had to do slight changes to the protocol. Instead of performing 2 IP injections per day (every 12 h) with PBS or 2DG (as represented on Figure 3B), we opted to give only a single injection of PBS or 2DG per day. The reason for this is that 7 days of treatment with a dose of 2DG every 12h, lead to an increase in toxicity and mortality in 2DG-treated fish. Therefore, by using this extended protocol until 7 dpa with a single PBS or 2DG injection per day, we were able to avoid mortality and visible toxic effects and, importantly, we were able to observe that bone regeneration is completely abolished in 2DG-trested animals in comparison to control animals. This indicates that 2DG is fundamental for regeneration and bone formation. This new data was added to the main manuscript (Lines 392-396 in the main text, and Lines 632-637 in Material and Methods) and to Figure 6—figure supplement 4A,C-F. We hope the new data on this matter is sufficient to clarify the role of glycolysis during bony-ray regeneration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Effect of glycolysis inhibition on uninjured fins (homeostasis)</p><p>Is there any outcome on OB behavior or fin integrity from blocking glycolysis (with 2DG) in uninjured fins?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for her/his suggestions and have performed the experiments to address the effect of glycolysis inhibition during homeostasis. We opted to use the same protocol used above to address point 3 of reviewer#1. We did single IP injections of PBS or 2DG during 7 consecutive days on fish with uninjured caudal fins. After the 7 days, fins were collected and stained fins for Calcein. We measured general and simple parameters that can be used as a readout of fin integrity, like fin area to width ratio and bony-ray length to width ratio. We did not detect differences in those parameters or any obvious malformations, suggesting that inhibition of glycolysis does not seem to impact fin homeostasis, but as a crucial role in controlling regeneration. These data were added to the main manuscript (Lines 396-401 in the main text, and Lines 632-637 in Material and Methods) and to Figure 6—figure supplement 4B,G-N. We hope this data helps clarifying this point.</p></body></sub-article></article>
