capillary beds. Many aspects of the relationship between central control of vascular flow and peripheral resistance are unclear. An important example of this is the relationship between hypoxic response in individual tissues, and the effect that response has on systemic cardiovascular adaptation to oxygen deprivation. We show here how hypoxic response via the HIF transcription factors in one large vascular bed, that underlying the skin, influences cardiovascular response to hypoxia in mice. We show that the response of the skin to hypoxia feeds back on a wide range of cardiovascular parameters, including heart rate, arterial pressures, and body temperature. These data represent the first demonstration of a dynamic role for oxygen sensing in a peripheral tissue directly modifying cardiovascular response to the challenge of hypoxia.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28755.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Diseases of the heart and blood vessels are linked with high blood pressure. The causes of most cases of high blood pressure are unknown, but it is often accompanied by the reduced flow of blood through small vessels in the skin and other parts of the body that are a long way from the heart. It is not clear why this change happens or why it tends to get worse over time in people with high blood pressure that has not been treated.</p><p>Previous research has shown that when a tissue is starved of oxygen, blood flow to that tissue will increase. The HIF family of proteins help to increase blood flow to tissues in these low-oxygen situations. To investigate what role the skin plays in the flow of blood through small vessels, Cowburn et al. exposed mutant mice that cannot produce certain HIF proteins specifically in the skin to low-oxygen conditions. The experiments show that mice lacking either HIF-1α or HIF-2α in the skin have altered responses to oxygen starvation that affected their heart rate, blood pressure, skin temperature and general levels of activity. Mice lacking specific proteins controlled by the HIFs also responded in a similar way.</p><p>Cowburn et al. also demonstrated that the way normal healthy mice respond to oxygen starvation is more complex than previously thought. Blood pressure and heart rate rise in during the first ten minutes. This is followed by a period of up to 36 hours where blood pressure and heart rate decrease below normal levels. By around 48 hours after exposure to low levels of oxygen, blood pressure and heart rate recover, returning to normal levels. Loss of the HIF proteins or other proteins involved in the response to oxygen starvation specifically in the skin affect when this process starts and how long it takes.</p><p>These findings suggest that the responses of the skin to environmental challenges may have substantial effects on the how the heart pumps blood around the body. More studies are needed to understand how the HIFs and other proteins may contribute to high blood pressure and diseases affecting the heart and blood vessels.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hypoxia</kwd><kwd>peripheral resistance</kwd><kwd>HIF</kwd><kwd>skin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>Randall S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Radiotelemetric and genetic studies of peripheral tissue response show that a peripheral tissue can dynamically alter cardiovascular adaptation to changes in environmental oxygen.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Vertebrates confront the world chiefly through the skin. As a reflection of how different vertebrates adapt to the environment, skin structure varies to a significant degree from one vertebrate class to another, and even within classes. One of the key differences in skin function found amongst vertebrates is the degree to which it responds to environmental variations; in particular, the extent to which these changes in turn affect systemic organismal physiology. Mammalian skin is amongst the most complex of all the vertebrate forms of skin. It also varies significantly in its form in the different orders of mammalia, with variations chiefly following adaptations to the external environment.</p><p>A key physiological challenge faced by most multicellular organisms is variation in oxygen supply. This is a common challenge to animals that obtain their oxygen from surrounding water, particularly those that live in fresh water; it can apply also to mammals at high altitudes, or during movement into a small den or confined space. Hypoxia also occurs in various tissues if there are high levels of oxygen demand, e.g., in skeletal muscle during exercise. Work undertaken over the last 50 years has shown that acute systemic hypoxia in mice, rats, rabbits, chickens, dogs, sheep and humans causes acute tachycardia and hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Korner and Edwards, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Butler, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yasuma and Hayano, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Campen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Walsh and Marshall, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heinonen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Giussani et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fletcher, 2000</xref>). Prolonged hypobaric hypoxia in humans has also been shown to cause tachycardia and hypertension (these studies have primarily been undertaken in high altitude environments or models thereof)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schultz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Calbet, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Naeije, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hainsworth et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vogel and Harris, 1967</xref>).</p><p>The skin has an extensive vasculature, which is known to be responsive to shifts in oxygen availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Durand et al., 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Weil et al., 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kuwahira et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Minson, 2003</xref>).

Of interest, it has been shown that in both rodents and humans the basal epidermis is hypoxic relative to the underlying dermal tissue, and displays constitutive stabilisation of hypoxia inducible transcription factor-(HIF)α proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cowburn et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cowburn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Peyssonnaux et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Boutin et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>HIF transcription factors initiate the transcription of multiple genes involved in oxygen homeostasis, including a number that regulate vascularisation and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Semenza, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Semenza, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pouysségur et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Formenti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Djagaeva and Doronkin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hubbi et al., 2014</xref>).

The HIF-1α/NOS2 and HIF-2α/arginase pathways strongly influence tissue L-arginine consumption and NO generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cowburn et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Takeda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Branco-Price et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>We have also shown that keratinocyte selective deletion of HIF-1α reduces epidermal NO levels, whereas loss of HIF-2α suppresses arginase expression/activity, increasing local concentrations of NO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cowburn et al., 2013</xref>). Hence, in murine skin, cutaneous NO levels are determined by differential HIFα isoform expression which affect both local vascular resistance and systemic blood pressure. Little is known, however, concerning how a localized tissue response to hypoxia affects the cardiovascular system more generally.</p><p>The literature on the response of animals to systemic hypoxia and its cardiovascular effects is limited almost exclusively to studies under anaesthesia. Hence, almost all previous studies have focused on the first ten minutes of the hypoxic response. Radio-telemetry in non-anesthetised non-restrained animals allows a more rigorous evaluation of the changes in hemodynamic variables during the acclimation to environmental hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kawaguchi et al., 2005</xref>). The work described here demonstrates for the first time that systemic hypoxia induces a tri-modal response: with an initial tachycardia and hypertensive phase that lasts approximately 10 min, followed by an immediate and profound drop in heart rate and blood pressure that can last as long as 24 hr, followed by a recovery to close to a normoxic state. In this context, we show that peripheral resistance and oxygen sensing, in this case in the skin, plays an essential role in this systemic cardiovascular response. These data demonstrate that peripheral tissues can play a fundamental role in cardiovascular adaptation to hypoxia.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Loss of HIFα isoforms in the epidermis differentially affects blood pressure and skin temperature across diurnal cycles</title><p>In this study we utilise mouse strains with conditional alleles of <italic>Hif1a</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ryan et al., 2000</xref>), <italic>Epas1</italic>(HIF-2α)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gruber et al., 2007</xref>), the HIF-1α target gene, nitric oxide synthase-2 (<italic>Nos2</italic>) and the HIF-2α target gene, arginase-1(<italic>Arg1</italic>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">El Kasmi et al., 2008</xref>), crossed to mouse strains expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the keratin 14 (<italic>Krt14</italic>) promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vasioukhin et al., 1999</xref>).

Curiously, published measurements to date indicate that almost all studies examining the cardiovascular effects of hypoxia have been carried out either over long time frames, that is, weeks and months, as part of studies of high altitude adaptations, or over very short time frames of approximately 5 to 10 min, typically under anaesthesia. To better understand how hypoxia at varying levels affects the cardiovascular parameters of blood pressure, heart rate, and cutaneous temperature in mice over time, we subjected wild-type (C57/Bl6) mice with implanted radiotelemetric reporters to 15%, 12%, and 10% normobaric oxygen over 48 hr, followed by 24 hr of recovery at 21% normobaric oxygen. The transition to low oxygen levels occurred in each case at the dark-light interphase (dark cycle equates to the shaded regions in the graphs).</p><p>As noted above, the acute cardiovascular response to hypoxia has been described in a number of animal models. As previous investigators have documented, there was an acute response in the first 10–15 min, with increased ventilation (160BrPM to 250BrPM), and a hypoxic pressor reflex, with blood pressures increasing from means of 123/88 mmHg (baseline) to 143/102 mmHg within the first 10 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>). Following this brief initial response, there was a severe drop in systemic blood pressures at the 12% and 10% oxygen levels, to means of 87 mmHg SBP and 57 mmHg DBP at 120 min for 10% oxygen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>). Heart rates peak at 13 min in the lowest level of hypoxia, from 606 BPM (baseline) to 717 BPM at the lowest levels of oxygen, followed immediately by a decline to 285 BPM (a 53% drop from baseline) at 120 min post-transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–F</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28755.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Cardiovascular response to graded hypoxia in wild-type (C57/Bl6) animals.</title><p>Mice were individually housed for 14 hr in normoxia before being exposed to hypoxia (15% O<sub>2</sub> (dark red, n = 4), 12% O<sub>2</sub> (green, n = 5), 10% O<sub>2</sub> (blue, n = 8)) at the light-dark interphase for 48 hr.

We found that skin temperature rapidly decreased from 33.7°C (baseline) to 28.9°C (−4.8°C) 180mins post hypoxic challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), suggesting an increase in peripheral vascular resistance. Physical activity also declined from 5.3 m/hr to 0.2 m/hr in the 120 min following the introduction of 10% oxygen. This change, similar to those seen in blood pressure and heart rate, demonstrates that lowered levels of oxygen cause a triphasic cardiovascular response, with the degree and duration of this response dependent on the level of oxygen.</p><p>At the lowest FiO<sub>2</sub> studied, 10% oxygen, there was an initial phase of response lasting 10–20 min that includes increased blood pressures and heart rates; then a longer depression, resulting in profound hypotension and bradycardia; followed finally by a chronic acclimation phase, with gradually recovering blood pressures, heart rates, temperatures and activity levels. We defined recovery as the point at which the animal reached 90% of heart rates and blood pressures seen at the same time of the diurnal cycle in normoxia; with this definition, recovery occured in 36 hr at 10% oxygen levels in wild type controls. In wild type mice this tri-phasic response is readily apparent at the two lower concentrations of oxygen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We chose to use a 10% oxygen challenge for the remainder of our experiments, as this level of hypoxia had the most pronounced (and thus easily dissected) phases of response, and yet still showed a return to normoxic cardiovascular parameters over time.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Loss of HIF-1α in the epidermis retards cardiovascular adaptation to hypoxia</title><p>As shown above, mice lacking HIF-1α, HIF-2α, NOS2 and Arg-1 expression in the epidermis show significant changes in systemic blood pressures and cutaneous temperatures relative to littermate control animals. All of these genes are involved in cellular adaptations to hypoxia. However, it is unclear how this cellular adaptation leads to more general tissue-specific adaptations to hypoxia. Even less well understood is how a peripheral tissue response might affect systemic responses to hypoxia. To undertake an analysis of that question, using the skin as a model for a peripheral tissue with a substantial vascular bed, we analysed the effect of loss of these hypoxia-responsive genes on the cardiovascular hypoxic response. We began with an analysis of the role of HIF-1α.</p><p>As described above and shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, there is a decrease in skin temperature in mice lacking HIF-1α in keratinocytes.

Infra-red analysis of skin temperature was also used to monitor peripheral vascular perfusion during hypoxic challenge.

However, in the second phase there is a larger drop in systolic and diastolic pressures relative to littermate control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, for statistical analysis see Figure 9C). This resolves rapidly, and although the subsequent systolic pressures in mutants are similar to those in littermate control animals, the diastolic pressures in the mutants begin to elevate. This elevated diastolic pressure begins in the first hour of hypoxia, and gradually increases throughout the 48 hr of hypoxic exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). An elevation in systolic pressures in HIF-1α mutants does not reappear until the animals are restored to normoxia. Elevation of diastolic pressures is indicative of an increase in peripheral resistance, and this is consistent with the lowered skin temperatures described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>, the acute and chronic changes in heart rate in littermate control and mutant animals can be seen (for statistical analysis see Figure 9D and E). The chief difference seen in the HIF-1α mutants is an increase in heart rate that is likely required to sustain systolic pressures; this coincides with the relative increase in diastolic pressures in HIF-1α mutants. Unlike the increased diastolic pressure, this tachycardia resolves following approximately 36 hr of hypoxia, indicating cardiac acclimation has occurred at that point. The chronic change in heart rate in HIF-1α mutants appears to coincide with an increase in whole-body metabolic activity between 12–36 hr hypoxia, as determined by VO<sub>2</sub> and VCO<sub>2</sub> analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>).

Here again, there is a shift at 24 hr, and although diastolic pressures at that point are similar to those seen in littermate control animals, systolic pressure drops relative to littermate controls. The systolic blood pressures remain substantially lower until normoxia is restored, when they return to steady state and mildly hypotensive levels. Finally, at the return of normoxia, diastolic pressures rise to levels substantially higher than those seen in littermate control animals for approximately 12 hr, before finally dropping again 24 hr after the restoration of normoxia. This effect on both systolic and diastolic pressures indicates that changes in the skin affect both traditionally understood changes in peripheral resistance, that is, changes that result in altered diastolic pressures, and other changes that can influence systolic pressures.</p><p>The effect of hypoxia on the heart rate of the epidermal HIF-2α knockout animals is strikingly altered when compared to the effect on littermate control animals. Hypoxia has virtually no effect on heart rate in the HIF-2α mutant animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, for statistical analysis see Figure 9I); they show a diurnal variation of heart rate that is essentially the same as that seen in animals in normoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, for statistical analysis see Figure 9J). This is in comparison to the approximate 50% decline in heart rates seen in littermate control animals after two hours at 10% oxygen. Whole-body metabolic activity (VO<sub>2</sub> and VCO<sub>2</sub>) in HIF-2α mutant animals is also significantly increased above littermate control rates between 12–24 hr hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and H</xref>). This increased metabolic activity does not return to levels seen in littermate control animals until the mice are returned to normoxia. Physical activity, similarly to the patterns described above, is greatly reduced in littermate and mutant animals during the initial 12 hr of hypoxia.

Here we show for the first time that keratinocyte HIF-1α and HIF-2α expression affects the immediate, acute and chronic phases of the cardiovascular response to hypoxia.</p><p>Hypoxia immediately heightens sympathetic tone in the skin to increase peripheral vascular resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Simmons et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chalmers and Korner, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kollai, 1983</xref>). Hypoxia also increases nitric oxide release from keratinocytes to stimulate vasodilation and act as a neuromodulator of sympathetic activity, dampening vasoconstriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ramchandra et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sartori et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hirooka et al., 2011</xref>). The opposing roles of keratinocyte HIF-1α and HIF-2α on nitric oxide synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cowburn et al., 2013</xref>) would suggest divergent effects on sympathetic activity and blood flow in this highly vascular tissue.</p><p>Epidermal HIF-1α is shown here to have a direct effect on peripheral vascular resistance and the tonic tensive status of the mouse. The opposite cardiovascular relationship is apparent in the HIF-2α mutant mouse. In the case of the HIF-2α mouse, however, there is a significant increase in heart rate, likely to maintain systolic blood pressure. In this mutant, there appears to be a transition/acclimation checkpoint following 24 hr in hypoxia. The heart rates of both HIF-2α mutant and littermate mice converge at this point, and systolic pressure of the HIF-2α mutant drops below that of controls. This suggests a sustained decrease in the vascular resistance of the skin. Epidermal deletion of arginase-1 in this hypoxia acclimation model phenocopied several characteristics of the K14cre-HIF-2α mutant mouse. There is an overall lessening of the effect, however, indicating that other genes controlled by HIF-2α are likely involved in the hypoxic acclimation process.</p><p>These alterations in peripheral vascular blood flow also appear to affect whole body metabolism and physical activity during the acclimation phase to hypoxia. Although all four epidermal mutant mice described here demonstrated a similar increase in oxygen consumption during this acclimation phase, only K14cre-HIF-2α and K14cre-arginase-1 mice demonstrated some preservation of physical activity in comparison to wild-type animals. This is intriguing, as it indicates that the response of the peripheral tissue can modulate the animals overall behaviour during environmental stress.</p><p>Interestingly, the data presented here are consistent with cardiopulmonary investigation of patients with germline, heterozygous gain-of-function mutations in HIF-2α, where baseline heart rate and cardiac responses to moderate hypoxia were shown to be higher in the HIF-2α-gain of function patients when compared to control subjects, suggesting an increase in cardiac sympathetic tone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Formenti et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we present here the first dissection of the murine cardiovascular response to hypoxia, and we present evidence that this response is highly influenced by peripheral vascular responses. This indicates that peripheral tissues, and their vascular beds, form a complex physiological network of oxygen-responsive tissues that influence, and are not just influenced by, central regulators of cardiovascular function. This interaction amongst tissues indicates that cardiovascular responses to hypoxia are likely a summation of a range of tissue responses, and not solely dictated by central mediators of cardiovascular activity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All animals were housed in an association and accreditation of laboratory animal care international-approved facility.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Didier Stainier (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Jan-Marino Ramirez (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an important and novel study by Cowburn et al. that significantly contributes to our understanding of long-term adaptation to hypoxia. The authors provide evidence that keratocytes play an important role in the midrange adaptation to chronic hypoxia. They specifically demonstrate that the cutaneous HIF1-HIF2-axis plays a key role in cardiovascular responses upon exposure of mice to low oxygen environments. The authors argue that HIF1α promotes via NOS2-dependent NO production local cutaneous vasodilatation. In contrast, HIF2α antagonizes this response by promoting local skin Arginase expression and thereby diminishes Arginine, which is a critical substrate for NOS2.</p><p>The main concern raised by the reviewers centered on the statistical analysis and some of your conclusions. As you will see, we provide specific recommendations to address this concern.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The study reports several observations with a low &quot;n&quot;, and in these cases the numbers should be increased. As an example, in the last paragraph of the subsection “Loss of HIFα isoforms in the epidermis differentially affects blood pressure and skin temperature across diurnal cycles” the authors state that there was a tendency towards a temperature effect in HIF2α mutants. This statement is based on an &quot;n&quot; of only 4. Clearly this finding is &quot;underpowered&quot; and more n's are needed to come to a meaningful conclusion.</p><p>2) The <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> summarizes the &quot;statistical analysis&quot;. Several of the findings really don't look significantly different. E.g. I don't see how differences in the heart rate changes as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref> or 8N should be highly significant. The same applies to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>; the differences seem quite subtle. This is consistent with our general concern (see next comments), that the statistical analysis was not always appropriate.</p><p>3) The authors stated that two-way ANOVO with Dunnett's test was used to compare K14cre-mutants to wild-type controls under baseline condition in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>While two-way ANOVA is a good option for testing statistical difference when combining strains with treatments (baseline, hypoxia, recovery). However, given the fluctuation of data I believe there is a significant interaction between two independent variables. Thus, we urge the authors to consider additional tests.</p><p>4) The use of un-paired t-test for analyzing gene expression is not appropriate since the values tested have been normalized, and the normalization could violate one or more of the underlying assumptions for the test. A non-parametric test should be used instead.</p><p>5) The Akaike information criterion (AIC) measures the relative quality of models but does not test a null hypothesis. Thus, the p values in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> are misleading and should be removed from this figure.</p><p>6) The authors did not mention what statistics methods were used for testing differences in cardiovascular radio-telemetry parameters among strains during hypoxia and recovery. This information should be provided.</p><p>7) As already mentioned above, in several instances the sample size of each group is too small (i.e., n=2-6) and makes the results questionable. Variation in each group should be reported in a certain form (e.g., text, table or figure), and additional n's should be provided.</p><p>8) Please clarify the following issue: Peripheral resistance has been considered a major contributor to diastolic pressure. If HIF-2α is important in regulating peripheral resistance as proposed by the authors, how do you interpret that effect of keratinocyte deletion of HIF-2α is more profound in systolic than diastolic pressure, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C (0-16</xref> hr, 48-64 hr)? Indeed, diastolic pressure during 0-16 hr and 48-64 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) seems not to be different in HIF-2α KO from WT.</p><p>9) NO production by NOS requires molecular O<sub>2</sub>. How do you interpret the increased NO production in the skin during prolonged hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>)? Please also explain why the biochemical measurements were obtained from tissues of mice treated with 72 hrs hypoxic exposure, whereas physiological measurements were made in mice treated with 48 hrs hypoxia?</p><p>10) The authors argue that HIF1α affects peripheral resistance. This statement is based on quantification of skin body temperature as surrogate parameter (subsection “Cardiovascular responses to 48 hours of hypoxia: brief initial hypertension and tachycardia, followed by hypotension and bradycardia”, third paragraph). Alternatively, HIF1-HIF2 might impact on skin temperature by affecting mitochondrial energy production (e.g. Thomas et al., 2017, AJPRP). The authors might want to consider backing up these findings with experiments that directly demonstrate effects of HIF1-HIF2 axis on skin tissue perfusion.</p><p>11) As far as we understand the authors used WT mice as controls for their conditional skin specific k.o. mice. I wonder whether the authors performed controls that demonstrate that littermates of their conditional Hif1, Hif2a and Arg1 mice show similar responses as did the WT BL/6 mice?</p><p>12) The impaired suppression of heart rate upon hypoxic exposure in K14-HIF2 k.o. is impressive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The authors argue that K14-Arg1 k.o. display similar findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). However, the figures are rather different. Therefore, we don't agree with the authors' statement that &quot;the effect on heart rate is similar&quot;. These data rather suggest that K14-HIF2 differentially affect heart rate, which is not linked to Arg1 expression. In K14-HIF2 HIF1 might compensate for losses of HIF2. Along this line, there is some evidence that in addition to HIF2 (as shown by the authors in previous studies) HIF1 might regulate Arg1 as well (Colegio et al., Nature, 2014). Overall, we are not sure whether all the effects observed in K14-HIF2 mice are due to diminished Arg1 expression. Please clarify.</p><p>13) The authors demonstrated earlier that skin HIF-1 is required for renal EPO production (Cell 2008). Therefore, it remains unclear whether the cardiovascular responses observed in the K14-Hif1 situation are due to local regulation of tissue perfusion (as suggested in this paper) or affected by alterations in blood viscosity and blood oxygenation (due to suppressed EPO production). Experiments that dissect the contribution of EPO vs. local effects of HIF1 would help to clarify this issue (e.g. injection of rm-EPO in K14-Hif1 mice).</p><p>14) Please better emphasize the novelty (specifically the mechanistic insights) of the present study, compared to the cardiovascular characteristics of the mutant mice reported previously by the same group (PNAS, 2013; (Cowburn et al., 2013).</p><p>15) Cardiovascular control is a highly integrative process and peripheral resistance is one of major determinates of blood pressure. How do you integrate your finding to the overall control of blood pressure?</p><p>16) The authors need to explain whether the delayed cardiovascular responses in K14Cre-HIF-1α mice are due to higher baseline blood pressure. Likewise, changes in heart rate responses in K14Cre-HIF-2α mice might as well be due to baseline bradycardia.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28755.014</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The study reports several observations with a low &quot;n&quot;, and in these cases the numbers should be increased.

We hope it is apparent that in this manuscript we are just beginning an analysis of the complexity of tissue-specific feedback on regulation of cardiovascular response. The most straightforward way for this to occur is via localized changes in peripheral resistance; but clearly, there are other potential means for peripheral tissues to alter cardiovascular response, and the HIF system regulates many different genes that can accomplish this. As changes in peripheral resistance do occur in these models, along with changes in diastolic pressure, we have focused much of our discussion on those changes, but have touched on the other multiple factors that will need to be considered in interpreting and ultimately expanding on these findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) NO production by NOS requires molecular O<sub>2</sub>. How do you interpret the increased NO production in the skin during prolonged hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>)? Please also explain why the biochemical measurements were obtained from tissues of mice treated with 72 hrs hypoxic exposure, whereas physiological measurements were made in mice treated with 48 hrs hypoxia?</p></disp-quote><p>The explanation for how NO generation can increase when oxygen levels drop is simply that this is due to increases in NO synthase levels, coupled to increases in L-arginine availability; these are able to compensate for lowered oxygen availability. It should be noted that there are still very significant levels of oxygen available in tissues and cells at environmental oxygen levels of 10%.</p><p>We have now increased the n values for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and included data for 48hrs hypoxia.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The authors argue that HIF1α affects peripheral resistance. This statement is based on quantification of skin body temperature as surrogate parameter (subsection “Cardiovascular responses to 48 hours of hypoxia: brief initial hypertension and tachycardia, followed by hypotension and bradycardia”, third paragraph). Alternatively, HIF1-HIF2 might impact on skin temperature by affecting mitochondrial energy production (e.g. Thomas et al., 2017, AJPRP). The authors might want to consider backing up these findings with experiments that directly demonstrate effects of HIF1-HIF2 axis on skin tissue perfusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers concerns, and have performed two additional sets of experiments in response. First, we have analysed skin surface temperature using a Flir infra-red thermal imaging camera. These measurements were taken from littermate controls and K14cre-HIF1α and K14cre-HIF2α mice in normoxia, followed by repeat measures at 1-3-5hrs under hypoxia (10% O<sub>2</sub>) We have performed a non-linear regression analysis and asked whether a single line would fit both data sets or whether a separate line would be required for each data set. However this method focuses on surface skin temperature. We would also like to make available laser Doppler data for the reviewers only. We have spent a considerable amount of time fine tuning anaesthetic delivery and thermoregulatory parameters in order to determine peripheral vascular response to hypoxia. Our protocol consists of anaesthetising a mouse with isoflurane 2% at 2L/min oxygen, after which this is quickly reduced to 1% isoflurance on a nose cone. The mouse is kept thermoneutral on a lightly heated blanket and temperature monitored. The laser Doppler starts recording hind-limb blood flow within 3 minutes of anaesthetic induction. The Doppler takes very high definition images over a 1 minute recording time.</p><p>Initially, 3 images were recorded, before the composition of the anaesthetic carrier gas was altered to 10% O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author Response Image 1</xref>). Images were recorded for an additional 32 minutes. Peripheral perfusion was analysed frame by frame using Moors Instruments analysis software. A) Skin blood flow (flux) as a percentage of baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">image 1</xref>). Black squares represent skin perfusion of mice maintained on normal anaesthetic carrier gas for the duration of the protocol.</p><p>The main concern we have with this data, and the reason we do not wish to include it in the manuscript, is an increase in baseline skin perfusion with time using an inhaled anaesthetic agent. We would like to make the reviewers aware of a number of papers highlighting the caveats of using inhaled isoflurane in conjunction with measuring cardiovascular parameters in small rodent models (C Constantinides. ILAR J, 2012; CF Yang. TC Med J 2014). However, switching the anaesthetic carrier gas to 10% oxygen (A, black circles) re-capitulated the documented peripheral vascular flush induced by hypoxia, however this was not followed by hypoxia driven peripheral vasoconstriction at later time points that we see. We feel the anaesthetic agent is masking this latter physiological response.</p><p>We also analysed K14cre- HIF2α mice with this protocol. The initial hypoxic vasodilation reflex was preserved in these mutant animals. Interestingly the degree of vasodilation was maintained throughout the remaining hypoxia protocol, indicating a significant effect of the mutant on peripheral vascular flow. We feel these data are key to the review process of this manuscript, but are compromised by the secondary effects of the inhaled anaesthetic agent, and therefore wish to include these data solely for the purposes of response to the reviewers concerns.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-28755-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) As far as we understand the authors used WT mice as controls for their conditional skin specific k.o. mice. I wonder whether the authors performed controls that demonstrate that littermates of their conditional Hif1, Hif2a and Arg1 mice show similar responses as did the WT BL/6 mice?</p></disp-quote><p>All procedures performed with K14cre+ animals throughout this manuscript have been accompanied by littermate control animals. The nomenclature has been clarified where appropriate. Only data for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> used wild-type C57Bl6 mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) The impaired suppression of heart rate upon hypoxic exposure in K14-HIF2 k.o. is impressive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The authors argue that K14-Arg1 k.o. display similar findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). However, the figures are rather different. Therefore, we don't agree with the authors' statement that &quot;the effect on heart rate is similar&quot;. These data rather suggest that K14-HIF2 differentially affect heart rate, which is not linked to Arg1 expression. In K14-HIF2 HIF1 might compensate for losses of HIF2. Along this line, there is some evidence that in addition to HIF2 (as shown by the authors in previous studies) HIF1 might regulate Arg1 as well (Colegio et al., Nature, 2014). Overall, we are not sure whether all the effects observed in K14-HIF2 mice are due to diminished Arg1 expression. Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the overall response to loss of epidermal HIF-2a is broader, stronger and certainly more complex than that seen when the same tissue lacks Arg1. And we agree that this is related at least in part to the reasons cited by the reviewers. We now have revised our descriptions of these results to better reflect these considerations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) The authors demonstrated earlier that skin HIF-1 is required for renal EPO production (Cell 2008). Therefore, it remains unclear whether the cardiovascular responses observed in the K14-Hif1 situation are due to local regulation of tissue perfusion (as suggested in this paper) or affected by alterations in blood viscosity and blood oxygenation (due to suppressed EPO production). Experiments that dissect the contribution of EPO vs. local effects of HIF1 would help to clarify this issue (e.g. injection of rm-EPO in K14-Hif1 mice).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ concerns with regard to the potential role of EPO, haematocrit and blood viscosity in the cardiovascular response observed in the K14cre-HIFα mice. The Cell manuscript referred to discusses over-expression of HIF, occurring in a K14cre-VHL deletion model; in that mutant, there is an excess of EPO and a high hematocrit. That manuscript goes on to show that basal EPO levels are unchanged in K14cre-HIFa mutant animals, and that their haematocrits are also normal.</p><p>We have measured basal haematocrits in k14cre+ mutants and littermates used here and seen no significant differences. We would also like to draw the reviewers’ attention to our recent manuscript: Cowburn, et al., PNAS 2106, where in supplemental <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> we show a time course of hematocrit changes during hypoxia (10% O<sub>2</sub>). Although there is a small increase in hematocrit following 7 days of exposure to hypoxia, this only becomes significant following 14 days of exposure. This is consistent with the findings of many other researchers on both normobaric and hypobaric hypoxia.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) Please better emphasize the novelty (specifically the mechanistic insights) of the present study, compared to the cardiovascular characteristics of the mutant mice reported previously by the same group (PNAS, 2013; (Cowburn et al., 2013).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion, and in this revision have attempted to better address the novelty of this study. As regards the previous study, the key difference here is that initial study looked at static blood pressures, and did not employ telemetry, but rather described single observations of blood pressure. Additionally, and more importantly, that study did not look at response to any stressor, but looked instead at steady state blood pressures. It is the difference in a dynamic response to hypoxia that is the key novel aspect of this study, and this was not addressed at all in our previous work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) Cardiovascular control is a highly integrative process and peripheral resistance is one of major determinates of blood pressure. How do you integrate your finding to the overall control of blood pressure?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is, in the end, the most important consideration: how does this finding integrate with a classical understanding of blood pressure regulation and response to stress. We feel that this will require, first, more work; and then a review article or a series of them to begin to integrate understanding of peripheral responses and their influence on the cardiovascular stress response. We hope that this article ultimately is part of the beginning of this reconsideration of how blood pressure regulation and response functions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) The authors need to explain whether the delayed cardiovascular responses in K14Cre-HIF-1α mice are due to higher baseline blood pressure. Likewise, changes in heart rate responses in K14Cre-HIF-2α mice might as well be due to baseline bradycardia.</p></disp-quote><p>We see variations in response over time here; that is, indeed, our key finding. It is these variations that demonstrate that we are not simply seeing the effects of a mild constitutive hyper- or hypotensive state on hypoxic response. These dynamic changes have considerable complexity, and will need further work to be mechanistically defined. However, we feel that they confirm our hypothesis, i.e., that there is a significant role for peripheral tissue response via HIF in the dynamic response of the cardiovascular system to changes in oxygen availability.</p></body></sub-article></article>
