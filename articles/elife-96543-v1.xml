caregiving or aggression toward conspecific offspring. The neural mechanisms underlying the infanticide and pup care remain poorly understood. Here, using monogamous mandarin voles (<italic>Microtus mandarinus</italic>), we found that more oxytocin (OT) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) were activated during pup caring than infanticide. Optogenetic activation of OT neurons in the PVN facilitated pup caring in male and female mandarin voles. In infanticide voles, optogenetic activation of PVN OT cells or PVN-medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) OT projection fibers prolonged latency to approach and attack pups, whereas inhibition of these OT neurons or projections facilitated approach and infanticide. Optogenetic activation of PVN OT neuron projections to the mPFC in males shortened the latency to approach and retrieve pups and facilitated the initiation of pup care, but produced no effects on pup-care females. In addition, OT release in the mPFC increased upon approaching and retrieving pups, and decreased upon attacking pups. Intraperitoneal injection of OT promoted pup care and inhibited infanticide behavior. It is suggested that the OT system, especially PVN OT neurons projecting to mPFC, modulates pup-directed behaviors and OT can be used to treat abnormal behavioral responses associated with some psychological diseases such as depression and psychosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>PVN</kwd><kwd>paraventricular nucleus</kwd><kwd>mPFC</kwd><kwd>medial prefrontal cortex</kwd><kwd>oxytocin</kwd><kwd>infanticide</kwd><kwd>mandarin voles</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32270510</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tai</surname><given-names>Fadao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31901082</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Zhixiong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007128</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2020JQ-412</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Zhixiong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002858</institution-id><institution>China Postdoctoral Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019M653534</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Zhixiong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012226</institution-id><institution>Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GK202301012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Zhixiong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022ZD0205101</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tai</surname><given-names>Fadao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Activation of oxytocin (OT) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus or their projections to medial prefrontal cortex or periphery OT administration facilitated pup caring and inhibited infanticide, while inhibitions of these neurons and projections promoted infanticide.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Both paternal and maternal care are critical to the survival as well as the physical and mental well-being of the offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">He et al., 2019</xref>). Although we know a great deal about the neural mechanisms underlying maternal care, the neural substrates of paternal behavior remain elusive because of the lack of an ideal animal model of paternal care. Only in some monogamous rodents (e.g., prairie voles), canids, and primates do males assist and spend a great deal of energy caring for pups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Malcolm, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mendoza and Mason, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rosenfeld et al., 2013</xref>). However, some male rodents without reproductive experience also show paternal care toward alien pups, while some others ignore or even attack alien pups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dai et al., 2022</xref>). These different pup-directed behavioral responses are based on their physiological and environmental states, and the killing of young conspecifics by sexually inexperienced mammals is a widespread phenomenon among different animal taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lukas and Huchard, 2014</xref>). Infanticide is thought to benefit the infanticide by promoting their own reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hrdy, 1974</xref>). In laboratory mice, male mice without pairing experience typically display infanticide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Svare and Mann, 1981</xref>), but males are able to shift from infanticide to pup care when they have the opportunity to encounter their own offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Elwood, 1977</xref>). Compared to our extensive understanding of the maternal circuit, little is known about the neural substrates underlying female infanticide. The virgin mandarin voles (<italic>Microtus mandarinus</italic>) naturally exhibit biparental care and infanticide in both females and males that provide an ideal animal model to reveal the mechanism underlying paternal care in males and infanticide in females.</p><p>Oxytocin (OT) is well known as a key hormone for initiating and maintaining maternal care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yoshihara et al., 2018</xref>), which is primarily synthesized in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and supraoptic nucleus (SON), among which the PVN plays an important role in initiating maternal care in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Munetomo et al., 2016</xref>). There is evidence to suggest that OT not only regulates maternal motivation, but also mediates paternal behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bales et al., 2004</xref>). When mouse fathers were exposed to their pups, OT neurons in the PVN were specifically activated and they also showed more aggression toward intruders to protect their own pups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shabalova et al., 2020</xref>). Compared with rodents, similar neuropeptides and hormones are involved in paternal behavior in non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Woller et al., 2012</xref>). Similar to other mammals, paternal care only exists in a few primate species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dulac et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Woller et al., 2012</xref>). A study on marmoset monkeys showed that fathers have higher levels of OT secretion in the hypothalamus than non-fathers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Woller et al., 2012</xref>), and intraventricular infusion of OT reduces the tendency of marmoset fathers to refuse to transfer food to their young offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Saito and Nakamura, 2011</xref>). However, where and how pathways of OT neurons regulate pup care and infanticide behavior remain largely unknown.</p><p>The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is involved in attention switching, decision-making, behavioral flexibility, and planning, making it potentially crucial for rapidly expressing pup care or infanticide behavior. A study on virgin male and female mice found that the mPFC lesion (targeting the prelimbic cortex) significantly affected a number of females and males showing pup cares and infanticide. Here, 50%females in the lesioned group exhibited maternal while 100% of sham-operated groups show maternal care, whereas the 100% lesioned males exhibited infanticide, 83% of control males showed infanticide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alsina-Llanes and OlazÃ¡bal, 2021</xref>). It has been reported that the mPFC is highly activated in human mothers when they hear cries from their babies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lorberbaum et al., 2002</xref>). The mPFC is also activated when rat mother contacts their pups first time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fleming and Korsmit, 1996</xref>), while the damage of the mPFC disrupts pup-retrieving and -grooming behavior in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afonso et al., 2007</xref>). In rodents and humans, the mPFC was activated during the process of caring offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">HernÃ¡ndez-GonzÃ¡lez et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Seifritz et al., 2003</xref>). A study in rat mothers indicated that inactivation or inhibition of neurons in the mPFC largely reduced pup retrieval and grouping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Febo et al., 2010</xref>). A subsequent study on firing patterns in the mPFC of rat mother suggested that sensory-motor processing carried out in the mPFC may affect decision-making of maternal care to their pups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Febo, 2012</xref>). Examining different regions of the mPFC (anterior cingulate [Cg1], prelimbic [PrL], infralimbic [IL]) of new mother identified a role for the IL cortex in biased preference decision-making in favor of the offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pereira and Morrell, 2020</xref>). A study on rats suggests that the IL and Cg1 subregion in mPFC are the motivating circuits for pup-specific biases in the early postpartum period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pereira and Morrell, 2011</xref>), while the PrL subregion is recruited and contributes to the expression of maternal behaviors in the late postpartum period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pereira and Morrell, 2011</xref>). In addition, a large number of neurons in the mPFC express oxytocin receptors (OTRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smeltzer et al., 2006</xref>). OT in the circulation of mice can act on the mPFC to increase social interaction and maternal behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Munesue et al., 2021</xref>). Although there are some studies on the role of the mPFC in pup care, the involvement of mPFC OT projections in pup cares and infanticide requires further research. Thus, we hypothesized that PVN OT neuron projections to mPFC may causally control paternal or infanticide behaviors.</p><p>Based on the potential antagonistic effects between pup care and infanticide behavior in neural mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dulac et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kohl et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mei et al., 2023</xref>) as well as the potential role of PVN-to-mPFC OT projections in pup care and infanticide, a combination of methods, including immunohistochemistry, optogenetics, fiber photometry, and intraperitoneal injection of OT, were used to reveal neural mechanisms underlying paternal care and infanticide. We found that PVN OT neurons regulated the expression of pup care and infanticide, and further identified the involvement of PVN-to-mPFC OT projections in paternal care and infanticide. Collectively, these findings establish a regulatory role for PVN-to-mPFC OT neurons in the expression of pup-directed behaviors and suggest potential targets for the future development of intervention strategies against psychiatric disorders associated with infanticide such as depression and psychosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Pup-care behavior activates more OT<sup>+</sup> cells than infanticide in PVN</title><p>In order to observe the activated OT neurons in virgin voles during pup care and infanticide behaviors, we co-stained OT and c-Fos on brain slices from voles exhibiting different behaviors using the immunofluorescence method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

Approximately 11% (male) and 14% (female) of OT cells expressed c-Fos during pup caring, whereas only about 3% (males) and 7% (females) of OT neurons were labeled by c-Fos during infanticide (female: t(6) = 5.173, p&lt;0.01, d = 3.658, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1âsource data 1</xref>; male: t(6) = 2.607, p&lt;0.05, d = 1.907, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1âsource data 1</xref>).

In male and female infanticide group voles, optogenetic activation of the PVN OT neuron projection fibers prolonged latency to approach (female: F(1,5) = 37.094, p&lt;0.01, OFF/ON: Î·<sup>2</sup> = 0.875; male: F(1,5) = 74.718, p&lt;0.001, OFF/ON: Î·<sup>2</sup> = 0.889) and attack pups (female: F(1,5) = 38.347, p&lt;0.01, OFF/ON: Î·<sup>2</sup> = 0.877; male: F(1,5) = 61.589, p&lt;0.01, OFF/ON: Î·<sup>2</sup> = 0.910) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6fâi</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6âsource data 1</xref>).

More OT neurons in the PVN were activated during pup care than infanticide behaviors. Optogenetic activation of the OT neurons in the PVN or OT neuron fibers in the mPFC promoted pup care and inhibited infanticide behavior, whereas inhibition of these neurons and their fibers in the mPFC promoted infanticide. In addition, intraperitoneal administration of OT promoted approach and retrieval of pups in pup-care male voles, and inhibited infanticide in both male and female voles. The present study revealed that the PVN to mPFC OT neural projections regulate pup care and infanticide behavior in virgin mandarin voles.</p><p>Firstly, we found that more OT neurons in the PVN were activated during pup care than infanticide behaviors, which is consistent with the well-established prosocial role of OT and its ability to promote pup-care behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bosch and Young, 2018</xref>). In a previous study on virgin male prairie voles, OT and Fos-colabeled neurons in PVN increased after exposure to conspecific pups and experiencing paternal care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kenkel et al., 2012</xref>). In another study of prairie voles, OT and c-Fos-colabeled neurons in the PVN significantly increased after becoming parents, which may be due to a shift from virgin to parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kelly et al., 2017</xref>). Meanwhile, we found that activation of OT neurons in the PVN facilitated pup-care behaviors such as approach, retrieval, and crouching in pup-care male voles, whereas inhibition of OT had no effect on paternal behavior; activation and inhibition of OT neurons in the PVN had no significant effect on pup-care behaviors in pup-care females; and activation of OT neurons in the PVN inhibited pup killing in infanticide voles, whereas the corresponding inhibition of OT neurons in the PVN facilitated infanticide. This finding is consistent with a previous report that silencing OT neurons delayed the retrieval behavior in virgin mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carcea et al., 2021</xref>). Further study found that simply observing dams retrieve pups through a transparent barrier could increase retrieval behavior and PVN OT neuron activity of virgin females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carcea et al., 2021</xref>). If OTR knockout mice are used, no pup retrieval occurs after observation, and these results suggest that activation of PVN OT neurons in virgin mice induced by visual signals promoted pup-care behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carcea et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, this study further demonstrated that OT in the PVN facilitated the retrieval behavior by modulating the plasticity of the left auditory cortex and amplifying the response of mice to the pupâs call (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carcea et al., 2021</xref>). In another study, we found that the OT neurons in the PVN projecting to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) as well as to the Nac brain region regulate pup-directed behaviors, which may also be accompanied by dopamine release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">He et al., 2021</xref>). This study also supports the findings from optogenetic activation of OT neurons in the PVN in the present study. The results of the present study are also supported by a recent study that chemogenetic activation of OT neurons in the PVN increases pup care and reduces infanticide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Inada et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>However, manipulation of OT neurons in the PVN produced no significant effects on pup caring in pup-care females. This may be due to the fact that female voles have inherently higher OT neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">HÃ¤ussler et al., 1990</xref>) and female mice have more OT neurons and OT axon projections than males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">HÃ¤ussler et al., 1990</xref>), and that there are also significant differences in OTR expression between the two sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Insel et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Uhl-Bronner et al., 2005</xref>) that possibly shows ceiling effects of the OT system. In the present study, we found that females have more activated OT neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d and g</xref>) and released higher levels of OT into the mPFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d and e</xref>) than males. This sex difference has been reported in other study that activation of OT neurons in the PVN activated noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus by co-releasing OT and glutamate, increased attention to novel objects in male rats, and that this neurotransmission was greater in males than in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). In a study on virgin female mice, pup exposure was found to activate oxytocin and OTR-expressing neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Okabe et al., 2017</xref>). Virgin female mice repeatedly exposed to pups showed shorter retrieval latencies and greater c-Fos expression in the preoptic area (POA), concentrations of OT in the POA were also significantly increased, and the facilitation of alloparental behavior by repeated exposure to pups occurred through the organization of the OT system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Okabe et al., 2017</xref>). In the present study, we also observed that optogenetic activation of OT neurons in PVN increased crouching behavior in the pup-care male voles, but did not affect grooming time possibly via increase of OT release. This result is in line with a previous study that injection of an OTR antagonist into the medial preoptic area (MPOA) of male voles significantly reduced the total duration of pup-care behavior and increased the latency to approach pups and initiate paternal behavior in male voles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yuan et al., 2019</xref>). This finding suggests that the results of peripherally administered OT and optogenetically activated PVN OT neurons in the present study may also have the involvement of OT-OTR interactions in MPOA. Parturition in experimental animals is accompanied by a decrease in infanticide and the emergence of pup-care behavior, and along with this process OTR expression increased not only on mammary contractile cells, but also in various regions of the brain, such as MPOA, VTA, and olfactory bulb (OB), which are all considered to be important brain regions related to the onset and maintenance of pup-care behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bosch and Neumann, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shahrokh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yu et al., 1996</xref>). For example, in a OB study, intra-OB injection of OT antagonist significantly delayed the onset of pup-care behaviors such as retrieving pups, crouching, and nesting in female rats, whereas intra-OB injection of OT in virgin females induced 50% of females to show intact pup-care behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yu et al., 1996</xref>). Therefore, the effects of activation of PVN OT neurons may be a result of actions on multiple brain regions involved in the expression of pup-care behavior. Which brain regions that PVN OT neurons project to are involved in pups caring or infanticide needs further studies. Although we used a virus strategy to specifically activate or inhibit PVN OT neurons, other neurochemicals may also be released during optogenetic manipulations because OT neurons may also release other neurochemicals. In one of our previous studies, activation of the OT neuron projections from the PVN, the VTA, as well as to the Nac brain also altered pup-directed behaviors, which may also be accompanied by dopamine release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">He et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, back-propagation of action potentials during optogenetic manipulations may also cause the same behavioral effect as direct stimulation of PVN OT cells. These indirect effects on pup-directed behaviors should also be investigated further in future studies.</p><p>Optogenetic activation of the OT neural projection fibers from the PVN to the mPFC facilitated the onset of pup-care behaviors, such as approach and retrieval, in pup-care male voles, whereas inhibition of this circuit had no effect; neither activation nor inhibition had a significant effect in pup-care females; and activation of this neural circuit inhibited infanticide in infanticide voles, whereas the corresponding inhibition of this circuit facilitated infanticide. In addition, we have demonstrated an increase in OT release in pup-care voles upon approaching and retrieving pups, and a decrease in OT release in infanticide voles when infanticide occurs, as recorded by OT sensors in the mPFC. There is some evidence indicating that the mPFC may be an important brain region for OT to exert its effects. In addition to expressing OTRs in the mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smeltzer et al., 2006</xref>), the mPFC contains OT-sensitive neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ninan, 2011</xref>) and receives projections of OT neurons from the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Knobloch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sofroniew, 1983</xref>). It has been further shown that blocking OTR in the mPFC of postnatal rats by an OTR antagonist delayed the retrieval of pups and reduced the number of pups retrieved by rats, impaired the care of pups, decreased the latency to attack intruders, increased the number of attacks, and increased anxiety in postnatal rats but had no effect on the level of anxiety in virgin rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sabihi et al., 2014</xref>). These results further suggest that OT in the mPFC is involved in the regulation of pup-care behavior and support the results of this study in pup-care voles and infanticide voles from an OTR perspective. Previous studies have shown that optical activation of the mPFC maintains aggression within an appropriate range, with activation of this brain region suppressing aggression between male mice and inhibition of the mPFC resulted in quantitative and qualitative escalation of aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Takahashi et al., 2014</xref>), which is similar to our findings with infanticide voles. For pup-care behavior, it has been reported that the mPFC brain region may be involved in the rapid initiation of pup-care behavior in mice without pairing experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alsina-Llanes and OlazÃ¡bal, 2020</xref>), which supported the experimental results of pup-care male voles in the present study, but the present study further suggested that OT neurons projecting to mPFC regulated pup-caring and infanticide behavior possibly via increase of OT release in the mPFC. We must also mention the function of the mPFC subregion. In the present study, viruses were injected into the PrL. The PrL and IL regions of the mPFC play different roles in different social interaction contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bravo-Rivera et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moscarello and LeDoux, 2013</xref>). A study has shown that the PrL region of the mPFC contributes to active avoidance in situations where conflict needs to be mitigated, but also contributes to the retention of conflict responses for reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Capuzzo and Floresco, 2020</xref>). This may reveal that the suppression of infanticide by PVN to mPFC OT projections is a behavioral consequence of active conflict avoidance. In a study of pain in rats, OT projections from the PVN to the PrL were found to increase the responsiveness of cell populations in the PrL, suggesting that OT may act by altering the local excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance in the PrL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2023</xref>). A study of anxiety-related behaviors in male rats suggests that the anxiolytic effects of OT in the mPFC are PL-specific and that this is achieved primarily through the engagement of GABAergic neurons, which ultimately modulate downstream anxiety-related brain regions, including the amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sabihi et al., 2017</xref>). This may provide possible downstream pathways for further research.</p><p>Another interesting finding is that peripheral OT administration promoted pup-care behavior in male voles, such as approaching and retrieving pups, but had no significant effect on pup-care behaviors in female voles. This result was supported by a previous study that OT administered peripherally inhibited infanticide in pregnant and reproductively inexperienced females and promoted pup caring in pregnant females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McCarthy et al., 1986</xref>). Further research has demonstrated that OT in the central nervous system also inhibited infanticide in female house mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McCarthy, 1990</xref>). In addition, peripheral administration of OT inhibits infanticide in male mice without pairing experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nakahara et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, the experience of pairing facilitated the retrieval of pups by increasing peripheral OT levels in both male and female mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lopatina et al., 2011</xref>). This is similar to the findings of pup-care males in the present study, whereas the absence of similar results in females may be due to the differences in OT levels between the sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tamborski et al., 2016</xref>). Pup-care female voles in this study already showed short latency to approach and retrieve pups before peripheral administration of OT. We also found that peripheral OT administration suppressed infanticide behavior in both male and female voles. It is consistent with a previous study that infanticide in female house mice with no pairing experience and pregnant females with preexisting infanticide was effectively suppressed by subcutaneous injection of OT, while injection of OT also helped pregnant females show care for strange pups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McCarthy et al., 1986</xref>). Unpaired male miceâs aggression toward pups was accompanied by changes in the activity of the vomeronasal neurons, and as males were paired with females and lived together, the activity of these neurons decreased, accompanied by a shift from infanticide to pup-care behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nakahara et al., 2020</xref>). The OTR expresses throughout the vomeronasal epithelium that allows OT to potentially inhibit infanticide by reducing vomeronasal activity. A previous study found that intraperitoneal injection of OT reduced the activity of the vomeronasal and further validated that OT modulates the activity of vomeronasal neurons by acting on the sensory epithelium to produce behavioral changes by intraperitoneal injection of an OTR antagonist that cannot cross the bloodâbrain barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nakahara et al., 2020</xref>). It has recently been shown that peripheral OT was able to cross the blood-brain barrier into the central nervous system to act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yamamoto et al., 2019</xref>), meaning that delivery of OT via the periphery may have increased central OT levels and thus exerted an effect. A recent study demonstrated that the secretion of OT in the brain of male mice with no pairing experience facilitated the performance of pup-care behaviors and inhibited infanticide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Inada et al., 2022</xref>), which also supported the results of the present study. Similar to rodents and non-human primates, there is evidence to suggest that OT contributes to paternal care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feldman and Bakermans-Kranenburg, 2017</xref>). Fathers with partners have higher plasma OT levels than non-fathers without partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mascaro et al., 2014</xref>). Intranasal OT treatment increases fathers' play, touch, and social interaction with their children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Weisman et al., 2012</xref>). Our result provides possible application of OT in the reduction of abnormality in pup-direct behavior associated with psychological diseases in humans such as depression and psychosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Milia and Noonan, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Naviaux et al., 2020</xref>) and increases of well-being of wildlife.</p><p>In summary, these results indicate that the PVN to mPFC OT neural projection is involved in the regulation of pup care and infanticide behavior in virgin mandarin voles.

After the injection, a 200 Î¼m optical fiber was implanted ~100 Î¼m above the injection site and fixed with dental cement. After 2 weeks of recovery, the optic fiber was connected to the fiber photometry system (QAXK-FPS-LED, ThinkerTech, Nanjing, China) through a patch cable. This system can reduce the effects of motion artifacts by simultaneously recording signals stimulated by a 405 nm light source. To avoid bleaching the sensor, the 470 nm laser power at the tip of the fiber was adjusted to 50 Î¼W. Voles were placed in test cages and allowed to move freely for at least 20 min to acclimate to the environment. Then, a pup was placed in the cage at a distance from the testing vole. If the vole ignored the pup completely or attacked the pup, gently remove the pup and introduce another pup ~60 s later to stimulate more interaction. This process was repeated 3â6 times, and then the vole exhibiting pup-care behavior was allowed to freely interact with the last introduced pup until the vole crouched over the pup for more than 10 s, after which the pups were removed for about 60 s and reintroduced.

The researchers used techniques like immunofluorescence, optogenetics, OT sensors, and peripheral OT administration. Activating OT neurons in the PVN reduced the time it took pup-caring male voles to approach and retrieve pups, facilitating pup care behavior. However, this activation had no effect on females. Interestingly, this same PVN OT neuron activation also reduced the time for both male and female infanticidal voles to approach and attack pups, suggesting PVN OT neuron activity can promote pup care while inhibiting infanticide behavior. Inhibition of these neurons promoted infanticide. Stimulating PVN-&gt;mPFC OT projections facilitated pup care in males and in infanticide prone voles, activation of these terminals prolonged latency to approach and attack. Inhibition of PVN-&gt;mPFC OT projections promoted infanticide. Peripheral OT administration increased pup care in males and reduced infanticide in both sexes. However, some results differed in females, suggesting other mechanisms may regulate female pup care.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This multi-faceted approach provides converging evidence and strengthens the conclusions drawn from the study and make them very convincing. Additionally, the study examines both pup care and infanticide behaviors, offering insights into the mechanisms underlying these contrasting behaviors. The inclusion of both male and female voles allows for the exploration of potential sex differences in the regulation of pup-directed behaviors. The peripheral OT administration experiments also provide valuable information for potential clinical applications and wildlife management strategies.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>While the study presents exciting findings, there are several weaknesses. The sample sizes used in some experiments, such as the Fos study and optogenetic manipulations, appear to be small, which may limit the statistical power and generalizability of the results.</p><p>There is potential effect of manipulating OT neurons on the release of other neurotransmitters (or the influence of other neurochemicals or brain regions) on pup-directed behaviors, especially in females, are not fully explored. Additionally, it is unclear whether back-propagation of action potentials during optogenetic manipulations causes the same behavioral effect as direct stimulation of PVN OT cells. However, the authors now discuss these possibilities. It is also uncertain whether more OT neurons were manipulated in females compared to males. All other comments have been addressed by the authors.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.96543.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>This series of experiments studied the involvement of PVN OT neurons and their projection to the mPFC in pup-care and attack behavior in virgin male and female Mandarin voles.

The researchers used techniques like immunofluorescence, optogenetics, OT sensors, and peripheral OT administration. Activating OT neurons in the PVN reduced the time it took pup-caring male voles to approach and retrieve pups, facilitating pup-care behavior. However, this activation had no effect on females. Interestingly, this same PVN OT neuron activation also reduced the time for both male and female infanticidal voles to approach and attack pups, suggesting PVN OT neuron activity can promote pup care while inhibiting infanticide behavior. Inhibition of these neurons promoted infanticide. Stimulating PVN-&gt;mPFC OT projections facilitated pup care in males and in infanticide-prone voles, activation of these terminals prolonged latency to approach and attack. Inhibition of PVN-&gt;mPFC OT projections promoted infanticide. Peripheral OT administration increased pup care in males and reduced infanticide in both sexes. However, some results differed in females, suggesting other mechanisms may regulate female pup care.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This multi-faceted approach provides converging evidence, strengthens the conclusions drawn from the study, and makes them very convincing. Additionally, the study examines both pup care and infanticide behaviors, offering insights into the mechanisms underlying these contrasting behaviors. The inclusion of both male and female voles allows for the exploration of potential sex differences in the regulation of pup-directed behaviors. The peripheral OT administration experiments also provide valuable information for potential clinical applications and wildlife management strategies.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>While the study presents exciting findings, there are several weaknesses that should be addressed. The sample sizes used in some experiments, such as the Fos study and optogenetic manipulations, appear to be small, which may limit the statistical power and generalizability of the results. Effect sizes are not reported, making it difficult to evaluate the practical significance of the findings. The imaging parameters and analysis details for the Fos study are not clearly described, hindering the interpretation of these results (i.e., was the entire PVN counted?). Also, does the Fos colocalization align with previous studies that look at PVN Fos and maternal/ paternal care? Additionally, the study lacks electrophysiological data to support the optogenetic findings, which could provide insights into the neural mechanisms underlying the observed behaviors.</p></disp-quote><p>In some previous studies (He et al., 2019; Mei, Yan, Yin, Sullivan, &amp; Lin, 2023), the sample size in morphological studies is also small and may be representative. We agree with reviewerâs opinion that results from larger sample size may be more statistically powerful and generalizable. We will pay attention to this issue in the future study. As reviewer suggested, we have added effect size both in the source data and in the main text, including d, Î·2 and odds ratio. We have added the objective magnification used in the figure legend. The imaging parameters and analysis details for the Fos study have also been added in the revised manuscript. Brain slices of 40 Âµm thick were collected consecutively on 4 slides, each slide had 6 brain slices spaced 160 Âµm apart from each other. PVN area were determined based on the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas and our previous study, and Fos, OT and merged positive neurons were counted. Our result about Fos and OT colocalization is consistent with previous study. In a previous study on virgin male prairie voles, OT and Fos colabeled neurons in the PVN increased after exposure to conspecific pups and experiencing paternal care (Kenkel et al., 2012). In another study of prairie voles, OT and c-fos colabeled neurons in PVN significantly increased after becoming parents which may be due to a shift from virgin to parents (Kelly, Hiura, Saunders, &amp; Ophir, 2017). To support the optogenetic findings, we used c-Fos expression as a marker of neuron activity and revealed significant increases/decreases of c-Fos positive neurons induced by optogenetic activation/inhibition (Supplementary Data Fig. 1), and additionally we found that optogenetic inhibition of OT neurons reduced levels of OT release using OT1.0 sensors. Based on these two experiments, we verified that optogenetic manipulation in the present study is validate and results of optogenetic experiment are reliable (Supplementary Data Fig. 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The study has several limitations that warrant further discussion. Firstly, the potential effects of manipulating OT neurons on the release of other neurotransmitters (or the influence of other neurochemicals or brain regions) on pup-directed behaviors, especially in females, are not fully explored. Additionally, it is unclear whether back-propagation of action potentials during optogenetic manipulations causes the same behavioral effect as direct stimulation of PVN OT cells. Moreover, the authors do not address whether the observed changes in behavior could be explained by overall increases or decreases in locomotor activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with reviewerâs suggestion that several limitations should be discussed. Although we used a virus strategy to specifically activate or inhibit PVN OT neurons, other neurochemical may also be released during optogenetic manipulations because OT neurons may also release other neurochemicals. In one of our previous studies, activation of the OT neuron projections from the PVN to the VTA as well as to the Nac brain also altered pup-directed behaviors, which may also be accompanied by dopamine release (He et al., 2021). In addition, backpropagation of action potentials during optogenetic manipulations may also causes the same behavioral effect as direct stimulation of PVN OT cells. These effects on pup-directed behaviors should also be investigated further in the future study. For the optogenetics experiments, we have referred to some of the previous research (Mei et al., 2023; Murugan et al., 2017), and in our study we have also carried out the verification of the reliability of the methods. To exclude effects of locomotor activity on pup directed behaviors, we also investigated effect of optogenetic manipulations on the locomotor activity of experimental animals and found that optogenetic manipulation did not change levels of locomotor activity (Supplementary Data Fig. 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors do not specify the percentage of PVN-&gt;mPFC neurons labeled that were OT-positive, nor do they directly compare the sexes in their behavioral analysis (or if they did, it is not clear statistically). While the authors propose that the sex difference in pup-directed behaviors is due to females having greater OT expression, they do not provide evidence to support this claim from their labeling data. It is also uncertain whether more OT neurons were manipulated in females compared to males. The study could benefit from a more comprehensive discussion of other factors that could influence the neural circuit under investigation, especially in females.</p></disp-quote><p>AAV11-Ef1a-EGFP virus can infect fibers and retrogradely reach to cell body, thus this virus can be used to retrogradely trace neurons. We injected this virus (green, AAV11-Ef1a-EGFP) in the mPFC and observed virus infected and OT (red) positive neuron in the PVN (Yellow), and we also counted the OT neurons that project from PVN to mPFC and found that approximately 45.16% and 40.79% of cells projecting from PVN to the mPFC were OT-positive, and approximately 18.48% and 18.89% of OT cells in the PVN projected to the mPFC in females and males, respectively (Supplementary Data Fig. 4). In addition, as reviewers suggested, we compared the numbers of OT neurons, activated OT neurons (OT and Fos double-labeled neurons) and level of OT release between males and females. We found that females have more activated OT neurons (Figure1, d, g) and released higher levels of OT into the mPFC (Figure 4 d, e) than males. This part has been added in the result and discussion. We did not analyze whether more OT neurons were manipulated in females compared to males, which is indeed a limitation of this study that requires our attention.</p><p>As the reviewers suggested, we also discussed other factors that could influence the neural circuit under investigation. In addition to OT neurons, OTR neurons may also regulate behavioral responses to pups. In a study of virgin female mice, pup exposure was found to activate oxytocin and oxytocin receptor expressing neurons (Okabe et al., 2017). Other brain regions such as preoptic area (POA) may also be involved in parental behaviors. For example, virgin female mice repeatedly exposed to pups showed shorter retrieval latencies and greater c-Fos expression in the preoptic area (POA), concentrations of OT in the POA were also significantly increased, and the facilitation of alloparental behavior by repeated exposure to pups occurred through the organization of the OT system (Okabe et al., 2017). A recent study suggests that OT of the PVN is involved in the care of pups by male voles (He et al., 2021). This study suggests that PVN to ventral tegumental area (VTA) OT projections as well as VTA to nucleus accumbens (NAc) DA projections are involved in the care of pups by male voles. Inhibition of OT projections from the PVN to the VTA reduces DA release in the NAc during licking and grooming of pups (He et al., 2021). The effects of these factors on pup-directed responses should also be considered in the future study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This series of experiments studied the involvement of PVN OT neurons and their projection to the mPFC in pup-care and attack behavior in virgin male and female Mandarin voles.

Individuals with appropriate viral expression and optical fiber implant location were included in the statistical analysis, otherwise excluded. For optogenetic experiments, the virus (AAV2/9-mOXT-hCHR2(H134R)âmCherry-ER2-WPRE-pA or rAAV-mOXT-eNpHR3.0-mCherry-WPRE-hGH-pA) was designed and constructed to only infect OT neurons, which limited the diffusion of the virus. For fiber photometric experiments, the OT1.0 sensor was largely able to restrict expression within the mPFC brain region, and additionally individuals with incorrect optical fiber embedding position were not included in the statistical analysis. The diffusion of central optogenetic viruses and OT1.0 sensors are shown in the supplemental figure (Supplementary Data Fig. 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Whether all central targets were consistent across animals included in the data analyses. This includes that is not stated if the medial prelimbic mPFC target was in all optogenetic study animals as shown in Figure 4 and if that is the case, there is no discussion of that subregion's function compared to other mPFC subregions.</p></disp-quote><p>As shown in Figure 4 and in the schematic diagram of the optogenetic experiment, the central targets of virus infection and fiber location remain consistent in the data analysis, otherwise the data would be excluded. In the present study, viruses were injected into the prelimbic (PrL). The PrL and infralimbic (IL) regions of the mPFC play different roles in different social interaction contexts (Bravo-Rivera, Roman-Ortiz, Brignoni-Perez, Sotres-Bayon, &amp; Quirk, 2014; Moscarello &amp; LeDoux, 2013). A study has shown that the PrL region of the mPFC contributes to active avoidance in situations where conflict needs to be mitigated, but also contributes to the retention of conflict responses for reward (Capuzzo &amp; Floresco, 2020). This may reveal that the suppression of infanticide by PVN to mPFC OT projections is a behavioral consequence of active conflict avoidance. In a study on pain in rats, OT neurons projections from the PVN to the PrL were found to increase the responsiveness of cell populations in the PrL, suggesting that OT may act by altering the local excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance in the PrL (Liu et al., 2023). A study on anxiety-related behaviors in male rats suggests that the anxiolytic effects of OT in the mPFC are PrL-specific but not infralimbic or anterior cingulate and that this is achieved primarily through the engagement of GABAergic neurons, which ultimately modulate downstream anxiety-related brain regions, including the amygdala (Sabihi, Dong, Maurer, Post, &amp; Leuner, 2017). This finding may provide possible downstream pathways for further research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) How groups of pup-care and infanticidal animals were created since there was no obvious pretest mentioned so perhaps there was the testing of a large number of animals until getting enough subjects in each group.</p></disp-quote><p>Before the experiments, we exposed the animals to pups, and subjects may exhibit pup care, infanticide, or neglect; we grouped subjects according to their behavioral responses to pups, and individuals who neglected pups were excluded.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The apparent use of a 20-minute baseline data collection period for photometry that started right after the animals were stressed from handling and placement in the novel testing chamber.</p></disp-quote><p>In fiber photometric experiments, all experimental animals were required to acclimatize to the environment for at least 20 minutes prior to the experiment as described in the Methods section. The time 0 in Fig. 4 represents the point in time when a behavior or a segment of behavior started and is not the actual time 0 at which the test was started.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) A weakness in the results reporting is that it's unclear what statistics are reported (2 x 2 ANOVA main effect of interaction results, t-test results) and that the degrees of freedom expected for the 2 X 2 ANOVAs in some cases don't appear to match the numbers of subjects shown in the graphs; including sample sizes in each group would be helpful because the graph panels are very small and data points overlap.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestion. We displayed analysis methods for the data statistics and the sample sizes for each group of experiments in the figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The additional context that could help readers of this study is that the authors overlook some important mPFC and pup caregiving and infanticide studies in the introduction which would help put this work in better context in terms of what is known about the mPFC and these behaviors. These previous studies include Febo et al., 2010; Febo 2012; Peirera and Morrell, 2011 and 2020; and a very relevant study by Alsina-Llanes and OlazÃ¡bal, 2021 on mPFC lesions and infanticide in virgin male and female mice. The introduction states that nothing is known about the mPFC and infanticide. In the introduction and discussion, stating the species and sex of the animals tested in all the previous studies mentioned would be useful. The authors also discuss PVN OT cell stimulation findings seen in other rodents, so the work seems less conceptually novel. Overall, the findings add to the knowledge about OT regulation of pup-directed behavior in male and female rodents, especially the PVN-mPFC OT projection.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate you very much to provide so many valuable references. We have cited them in the introduction and discussion. We agree with the reviewerâs opinion that nothing is known about the mPFC and infanticide is incorrect. It should be whether mPFC OT projections are involved in paternal cares and infanticide remains unclear. A study in mother rats indicated that inactivation or inhibition of neuronal activity in the mPFC largely reduced pup retrieval and grouping (Febo, Felix-Ortiz, &amp; Johnson, 2010). In a subsequent study on firing patterns in the mPFC of mother rats suggested that sensory-motor processing occurs in the mPFC that may affect decision making of maternal care to their pups (Febo, 2012). In a study on new mother rats examining different regions of the mPFC (anterior cingulate (Cg1), PrL, IL), they identified a involvement of the IL cortex in biased preference decision-making in favour of the offspring (Pereira &amp; Morrell, 2020). A study on maternal motivation in rats suggests that in the early postpartum period, the IL and Cg1 subregion in mPFC, are the motivating circuits for pup-specific biases (Pereira &amp; Morrell, 2011), while the PrL subregion, are recruited and contribute to the expression of maternal behaviors in the late postpartum period (Pereira &amp; Morrell, 2011).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Here Li et al. examine pup-directed behavior in virgin Mandarin voles.

Do the authors have data about the housing or life history/experiences of these animals? How bimodal and robust are these behavioral tendencies in the population?</p></disp-quote><p>As our response to reviewer 2, animals generally exhibit three types of behavioral responses toward pups, and data on the percentage of these different behavioral types occurring in the group will be included in another study in our lab. The reviewer's suggestion of scoring the behaviors is an inspiring idea that will help us to more fully parse these behaviors. Mandarin voles were captured from the wild in Henan, China. The experimental subjects were F2 generation voles reared in the Experimental Animal Centre of Shaanxi Normal University. In our observations, pup care and infanticide behaviors were conserved across several pup exposures, especially pup care behaviors, whereas for infanticide behaviors we did not conduct more pup exposures in order to protect the pups.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Optogenetics with the oxytocin promoter virus is a nice advance here. More details about their preparation and methods should be in the main text, and not simply relegated to the methods section. For optogenetic stimulation in Figure 2, how were the stimulation parameters chosen? There is a worry that oxytocin neurons can co-release other factors- are the authors sure that oxytocin is being released by optogenetic stimulation as opposed to other transmitters or peptides, and acting through the oxytocin receptor (as opposed to a vasopressin receptor)?</p></disp-quote><p>As reviewer suggested, more detailed information about virus construction and choice of optogenetic stimulation parameter have been added in the revised manuscript. The details about the construction of CHR2 and mCherry viruses used in optogenetic manipulation can refer to a previous study in which they constructed an rAAV-expressing Venus from a 2.6 kb region upstream of OT exon 1, which is conserved in mammalian species (Knobloch et al., 2012). For details about construction of the eNpHR 3.0 virus, expression of the vector is driven by the mouse OXT promoter, a 1kb promoter upstream of exon 1 of the OXT gene, which has been shown to induce cell type-specific expression in OXT cells (PeÃ±agarikano et al., 2015). Details about the construction of OT1.0 sensor can be referred to the research of Professor Li's group (Qian et al., 2023). The mapping of the viral vectors and OT1.0 sensor is shown below.</p><p>The optogenetic stimulation parameters were used based on a previous study (He et al., 2021). However, our description of the parameters in the experiment is still not in detail, so some information about optogenetic stimulation parameters has been added in the method. In pupdirected pup care behavioral test, light stimulation lasted for 11 min. Parameters used in optogenetic manipulation of PVN OT neurons were ~ 3 mW, 20 Hz, 20 ms, 8 s ON and 2 s OFF and parameters used in optogenetic manipulation of PVN OT neurons projecting to mPFC were ~ 10 mW, 20 Hz, 20 ms, 8 s ON and 2 s OFF to cover the entire interaction. We performed fiber photometric experiments to determine the role that OT plays in behavior, and these results were able to support each other with optogenetic experiments. In addition, we further confirmed the role of optogenetic manipulation on OT release in combination with optogenetic inhibition and OT1.0 sensors (Supplementary Data Fig. 2). It has been previously shown that OT is able to act specifically on OTR in mPFC-PL (Sabihi et al., 2017). Our study focuses on oxytocin neurons as well as oxytocin release, and more research is needed to construct a more complex and complete network regarding the involvement of the OTR and other factors in the mPFC in these behaviors.</p><fig id="sa4fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-96543-sa4-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="sa4fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-96543-sa4-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given that they are studying changes in latency to approach/attack, having some controls for motion when oxytocin neurons are activated or suppressed might be nice.

However, photometry is known to be susceptive to motion artifacts and I didn't see much in the methods about controls or correction for this. It's also surprising to see such dramatic, sudden, and large-scale suppression of oxytocin signaling in the mPFC in the infanticidal animals - does this mean there is a substantial tonic level of oxytocin release in the cortex under baseline conditions?</p></disp-quote><p>The optical fiber recording system used in the present study can automatically exclude effects of motion artifacts by simultaneously recording signals stimulated by a 405nm light source. As shown in the formula below, the z-score data were calculated and presented, and the increase and decline of the OT signal is a trend relative to the baseline. For a smooth baseline, the decreasing signal is generally amplified after calculation. In our experiments combining optogenetic inhibition and OT1.0 sensors, we were able to find that there was a certain level of OT release at baseline, on which there was room for a decrease in the signal recorded by the OT1.0 sensor.<disp-formula id="sa4equ1"><mml:math id="sa4m1"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mover><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>basalÂ </mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo accent="false">Â¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="sa4equ2"><mml:math id="sa4m2"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Î</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>signalÂ </mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>off setÂ </mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="sa4equ3"><mml:math id="sa4m3"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>Ï</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>STD</mml:mi><mml:mo>â¡</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>basal</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="sa4equ4"><mml:math id="sa4m4"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>signalÂ </mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>Ï</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5 is difficult to parse as-is, and relates to an important consideration for this study: how extensive is the oxytocin neuron projection from PVN to mPFC?</p></disp-quote><p>AAV11-Ef1a-EGFP virus can infect fiber and retrogradely reach to cell body, thus this virus can be used to retrogradely trace neurons.

We measured the OT release using OT1.0 sensors when the OT neuron projections in the mPFC were optogenetically inhibited.

In addition, females already exhibited more rapid approach and retrieval of pups than male before the optogenetic activation this may be the reason no effects of this manipulation were found in female.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Check for spelling and grammar errors throughout.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks to the reviewer's suggestion, we have checked and revised the article.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Report effect sizes for all significant findings to allow evaluation of practical significance.</p></disp-quote><p>As reviewer suggested, we have added effect size both in the source data and in the main text, including d, Î·2 and odds ratio.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Provide detailed information on the imaging parameters and analysis methods used in the Fos study.</p></disp-quote><p>The imaging parameters and analysis details for the Fos study have also been added in the revised manuscript.

In a previous study on virgin male prairie voles, OT and Fos colabeled neurons in the PVN increased after exposure to conspecific pups and experiencing paternal care (Kenkel et al., 2012). In another study of prairie voles, OT and c-fos colabeled neurons in PVN significantly increased after becoming parents which may be due to a shift from virgin to parents (Kelly et al., 2017).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Discuss the limitations of the study, such as the potential effects of manipulating OT neurons on the release of other transmitters or the influence of other neurochemicals or brain regions on pupdirected behaviors, especially in females.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with reviewerâs suggestion that several limitations should be discussed. Although we used a virus strategy to specifically activate or inhibit PVN OT neurons, other neurochemical may also be released during optogenetic manipulations because OT neurons may also release other neurochemicals. In one of our previous studies, activation of the OT neuron projections from the PVN to the VTA as well as to the Nac brain also altered pup-directed behaviors, which may also be accompanied by dopamine release (He et al., 2021). In addition, backpropagation of action potentials during optogenetic manipulations may also causes the same behavioral effect as direct stimulation of PVN OT cells. These effects on pup-directed behaviors should also be investigated further in the future study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Address the possibility of back-propagation of action potentials in the optogenetic manipulations causing the same behavioral effects as PVN OT cell stimulation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewerâs opinion hat optogenetic manipulation may possibly induce back-propagation of action potentials that may result in same behavioral effects as OT cell stimulation.

In addition to OT neurons, OTR neurons may also regulate behavioral responses to pups. In a study of virgin female mice pup exposure was found to activate oxytocin and oxytocin receptor expressing neurons (Okabe et al., 2017). Other brain regions such as preoptic area (POA) may also be involved in parental behaviors. For example, virgin female mice repeatedly exposed to pups showed shorter retrieval latencies and greater c-Fos expression in the preoptic area (POA), concentrations of OT in the POA were also significantly increased, and the facilitation of alloparental behavior by repeated exposure to pups occurred through the organization of the OT system (Okabe et al., 2017). A recent study suggests that OT of the PVN is involved in the care of pups by male voles (He et al., 2021). This study suggests that PVN to ventral tegumental area (VTA) OT projections as well as VTA to nucleus accumbens (NAc) DA projections are involved in the care of pups by male voles. Inhibition of OT projections from the PVN to the VTA reduces DA release in the NAc during licking and grooming of pups (He et al., 2021).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>A few additional things the authors may want to consider:</p><p>(1) I don't understand the subject numbers in the peripheral OT study data shown in Figure 8. Panels p and q have 69 females shown and 50 males. Was there a second, much larger, IP injection study conducted that was different than the subjects shown in panels a-o that had ~5 subjects per treatment group per sex?</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for the confusing. More animals were used to test effects of OT on infanticide behaviors in our pre-test. These data combined with data from formal pharmacological experiment were presented in Fig. 8p, q. After OT treatment, the changes in detailed and specific behaviors were only collected in several animals. We have clarified that in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors suggest higher baseline OT release in the female mPFC, which makes sense and helps explain some of their results. It seems that the data in Figure 1 show what is probably no sex difference in OT cell numbers in the PVN of Mandarin voles, which is unlike the old studies in mice or rats. If readers look at the data in Figure 1 showing what seems to be no sex difference in OT cell number, the authors' argument in the discussion about mPFC OT release levels higher in females would be inconsistent with their own data shown. The authors have the brain sections they need to help support or undermine this argument in the discussion, so maybe it would be useful to analyze the OT cell numbers across the PVN and report it in this paper or briefly mention it in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We compared the numbers of OT neurons, activated OT neurons (OT and Fos doublelabeled neurons) and level of OT release between males and females. We found that females have more activated OT neurons (Figure1, d, g) and released higher levels of OT into the mPFC (Figure 4 d, e) than males. This part has been added in the result and discussion. The inconsistency of the OT cell numbers with previous studies may be due to the method of cell counting, as we did not count all slides consecutively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The discussion suggests visual cues are involved in mPFC OT release relevant for pup care or infanticide, but this is a very odd claim for nocturnal animals that live and nest with their pups in underground burrows.</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for the confusing. Here, we cited the finding in mice that activation of PVN OT neurons induced by visual stimulation promoted pup care to support our finding that the activity of OT cells of the PVN is involved in pup care, rather than to illustrate the role of visual stimulation in voles. We have clarified that in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The lack of decrease in mPFC OT release in the 2nd and 3rd approaches to pups is probably because the release was so high after the 1st approach that it didn't have time to drop before the subsequent approaches. The authors don't state how long those between-approach intervals were on average to help readers interpret this result.</p></disp-quote><p>As described in our methods, we spaced about 60 s between each behavioral test to allow the signal return back to the baseline level.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Do PVN-mPFC OT somata collateralize to other brain sites? Could mPFC terminal stimulation activate entire PVN cells and every site they project to? A caveat could be mentioned in the discussion if there's support for this from other optogenetic and PVN OT cell projection studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We verified the OT projections from PVN to mPFC, to validate the optogenetic manipulation of this pathway, but did not investigate whether the OT neurons projecting from PVN to mPFC also project collaterally to other brain regions. It is suggested that mPFC terminal stimulation only activate PVN OT cells projecting mPFC, whether other OT neurons were activated remains unclear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) I don't see an ethics statement related to the experiments obviously having to involve pup injury or death. Nothing is said in methods about what happened after adult subjects attacked pups. I assumed the tests were quickly terminated and pups euthanized.</p></disp-quote><p>In case the pups were attacked, we removed them immediately to avoid unnecessary injuries, and injured pups were euthanized.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) The authors could be more specific about what psychological diseases they refer to in the abstract and elsewhere that are relevant to this study. Depression? Rare cases of psychosis? Even within the already rare parental psychosis, infanticide is tragic but rare.</p></disp-quote><p>Infanticide is caused by a variety of factors, mental illness, especially depression and psychosis, is often a very high risk factor among them (Milia &amp; Noonan, 2022; Naviaux, Janne, &amp; Gourdin, 2020). In human, infanticide has been used to refer to the killing, neglect or abuse of newborn babies and older children (Jackson, 2006). Here, we believe that research on the neural mechanisms of infanticide can also contribute to the understanding and treatment of attacks on children, physical and verbal abuse, and direct killing of babies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Figure 8 - in one case the &quot;*&quot; is a chi-square result , correct?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your careful checking.
