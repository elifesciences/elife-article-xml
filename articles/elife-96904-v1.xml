many splendid adaptations. Classical morphological work subdivides insect wings into several distinct domains along the anteroposterior (AP) axis, each of which can evolve relatively independently to produce the myriad forms we see in nature. Important insights into AP subdivision of insect wings come from work in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>; however, they do not fully explain the diversity of AP domains observed across broad-winged insects. Here, we show that the transcription factor <italic>mirror</italic> acts as a selector gene to differentiate a far posterior domain in the butterfly wing, classically defined as the vannus, and has effects on wing shape, scale morphology, and color pattern. Our results support models of how selector genes may facilitate evolutionarily individuation of distinct AP domains in insect wings outside of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and suggest that the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> wing blade has been reduced to represent only a portion of the archetypal insect wing.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>butterfly</kwd><kwd>wing domain</kwd><kwd><italic>Iroquois</italic> genes</kwd><kwd>broad-winged insect</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS-1753559</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reed</surname><given-names>Robert D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS-2128164</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reed</surname><given-names>Robert D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The selector gene <italic>mirror</italic> defines the far posterior wing domain in butterflies, revealing how ancestral axial subdivisions have been evolutionarily reduced in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Insect wings vary dramatically in their size and morphology. Butter`lies and moths in particular have attracted attention for their rapidly evolving wings that show extreme variation in shape and color pattern. Interestingly, the diversity of lepidopteran color patterns appears to follow relatively simple rules, wherein an evolutionarily conserved set of spot and stripe pattern elements can vary in size, color, and presence/absence along the anteroposterior (AP) axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Nijhout, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Nijhout, 2001</xref>). Surveys of wing pattern diversity across butterflies, considering both natural variation and genetic mutants, suggest that wings can be subdivided into five AP domains, bounded by the M1, M3, Cu2, and 2A veins as summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">McKenna et al., 2020</xref>). Within each domain, there is a strong correlation between pattern variation and wing morphology, and, conversely, between domains, there is a relative degree of independence in morphological variation. We know little about how these different AP domains are differentiated during wing development, however.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Proposed anteroposterior (AP) domains of insect wings.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Comparative morphology previously identified boundaries associated with color pattern variation, demarcated by the M1, M3, Cu2, and 2A veins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">de Celis et al., 1996</xref>).

This expression precisely marks the vannus, or anal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and E</xref>), of the butterfly wing – a distinct posterior domain of the wing blade populated by the anal (A) veins and bordered anteriorly by the claval fold between the cubital (Cu) and A veins in the hindwing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). As observed in various representative species across different butterfly families, this region of the hindwing is distinct from the rest of the wing; the color patterns defining the wing blade terminate at the 2A vein, and in many species, it is marked by scales that differ in morphology and lack color patterns found in anterior regions of the wing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

Remarkably, in <italic>mirror</italic> mKO mutants, these entire color pattern systems extend past the 2A vein into the posterior regions of the wing on both dorsal and ventral wing surfaces.

First, across all mKO replicates, we never observed mutant phenotypes anterior to the 2A vein, which suggests that <italic>mirror</italic> effects are limited to the far posterior domain in which we observed <italic>mirror</italic> expression. Second, <italic>mirror</italic> knockouts appear to affect multiple aspects of wing morphology, including scale shape and coloration, overall wing shape, and wing venation. Finally, the loss of <italic>mirror</italic> function resulted in transformation, not loss, of the posterior domain. Even in mKO individuals that appeared to have a mutant phenotype across the entire posterior region, the <italic>mirror</italic>-expressing cells posterior to the 2A vein were not simply lost – the wing field continues well past the 2A vein. Instead, the identities of the post-2A scale cells changed in color and structure. In this respect, the expansion of multiple color pattern systems into the posterior domain of mutants was particularly compelling because the loss of central symmetry system and submarginal patterns in the post-2A vannus region is commonly observed in Lepidoptera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The ability to reconstitute these complex color pattern elements in the posterior domain by knocking out a single transcription factor leads us to speculate that their patterning information may occur in a latent form that is masked by <italic>mirror</italic> effects. Together, our expression and knockout data suggest that <italic>mirror</italic> acts as a selector gene necessary to define the identity of the far posterior wing domain.</p><p>Identifying <italic>mirror</italic> as a vannus-specifying factor is of interest for a few reasons. First, it provides a molecular explanation for how different AP domains of the butterfly wing may be individuated to independently evolve their own shape and color pattern variations. Previous authors have proposed the existence of such individuated domains and speculated that they may be specified by selector genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">McKenna et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbasi and Marcus, 2017</xref>). Our data provide experimental support for this model and now motivate us to identify additional factors that may specify other domain boundaries between the M1 and A2 veins.</p><p>Next, the role of <italic>mirror</italic> in specifying the vannus provides an important link between molecular developmental biology and Snodgrass’ classical anatomical designations of the insect wing fields – i.e., the remigium, the vannus, and the jugum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Snodgrass, 1935</xref>). The remigium and the vannus are dominant features of most insect wings, while the jugum is a smaller lobe-like feature that is reduced or lost in many clades. The remigium is the major anterior wing blade that is directly articulated by thoracic motor musculature to power flight and is typically divided from the vannus by a distinct wing fold (e.g. the ‘anal fold’ in butterflies). In many insect orders, the vannus is a prominent fan-like structure, which can be a greatly enlarged gliding surface in some hemimetabolous clades such as Orthoptera (crickets and grasshoppers), Dictyoptera (mantids and roaches), Phasmatodea (stick insects), and Plecoptera (stoneflies). Importantly, <italic>mirror</italic> knockdown in the hemimetabolous milkweed bug <italic>Oncopeltus fasciatus</italic> causes developmental defects in the claval and anal furrows in the posterior wing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fisher et al., 2021</xref>), which leads us to infer that <italic>mirror</italic>’s role in determining the vannus may be deeply conserved in insects. This prompts us to speculate that the developmental individuation of the posterior domain by <italic>mirror</italic> facilitated the remarkable diversification of the vannus across the insects.</p><p>Finally, the function of <italic>mirror</italic> in determining the alula in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kehl et al., 1998</xref>) suggests that the alula may represent an evolutionarily reduced vannus. The ramifications of this are significant for reconstructing the history of the insect wing, because they suggest that the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> wing blade is a lone remigium – only one-third of the archetypal insect wing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The dipteran jugum appears to have been lost entirely, except perhaps as a membranous haltere cover (calypter) in the Calyptratae clade, as speculated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Snodgrass, 1935</xref>. Thus, while flies have been an important model for characterizing genes and processes that build insect wings, a more comprehensive understanding of the development and evolution of insect wings requires work in species that have wings more representative of the complete ancestral blueprint.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Junonia coenia</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>mirror</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">V2 genome: JC_02269-RA; V3 genome: JC_g12219</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">V2 genome is available on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.lepbase.org/">https://www.lepbase.org/</ext-link>.

The dissected discs collected from the left and right sides of the larvae were randomly assigned to control or treatment batches. Both control and treatment batches were fixed in 1× cold fix buffer (750 µL PBS, 50 mM EGTA, 250 µL 37% formaldehyde) on ice. The discs were then washed three times in 1× PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 (PTw) on ice, spending approximately 30 s to 2 min for each wash. Tissues were then gradually dehydrated by washing in 33%, 66%, and 100% MeOH (in PTw) for 2–5 min/wash on ice and stored in 100% MeOH at –20°C for days until the HCR protocol was started. On the day of the HCR protocol, the wing discs were progressively rehydrated in cold 75% MeOH, 50% MeOH, and 25% MeOH in PTw, spending 2–5 min/wash. After rehydrating, discs were washed once for 10 min and twice for 5 min with PTw. The discs were then permeabilized in 300–500 µL of detergent solution (1.0% SDS, 0.5% Tween, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl) for 30 min at room temperature. While waiting, hybridization buffer (Molecular Instruments) was warmed to 37°C (200 µL/tube). After permeabilizing with detergent solution, each tube of wing discs was incubated in 200 µL of pre-warmed hybridization buffer for 30 min at 37°C. Probe solution was prepared by adding 0.8 pmol (0.8 µL of probe from 1 µM stock solution) of each probe mixture to 200 µL of probe hybridization buffer at 37°C. The pre-hybridization buffer was removed, and the probe solution was added. For negative control tissues, hybridization buffer without probes was added instead. All wing discs were incubated overnight (12–16 hr) at 37°C. Before resuming the protocol, probe wash buffer (Molecular Instruments) was warmed to 37°C, amplification buffer (Molecular Instruments) was calibrated to room temperature, and a heat block was set to 95°C. The probe solution was removed and saved at –20°C to be reused. Wing discs were then washed four times in 1 mL pre-warmed probe wash buffer at 37°C for 15 min/wash. After the last wash step, discs were washed twice (5 min/wash) with 1 mL of 5× SSCT (5× sodium chloride sodium citrate, 0.1% Tween 20) at room temperature. The wing discs were pre-amplified with 1 mL of equilibrated amplification buffer for 30 min at room temperature. During this step, 2 µL of each of hairpin h1 and 2 µL of each hairpin h2 were mixed in 100 µL of amplification buffer at 95°C for 90 s and cooled to room temperature in the dark for 30 min. For <italic>mirror</italic>-only in situ hybridizations, we used B1 hairpin amplifiers tagged with Alexa Fluor 594 fluorophore (Molecular Instruments). For <italic>mirror</italic> and <italic>wingless</italic> double stains, we used <italic>mirror</italic> probes with B1 amplifier tagged with Alexa Fluor 647 fluorophore and <italic>wingless</italic> probes (Lot #PRG129) with B3 hairpin amplifiers tagged with Alexa Fluor 546 fluorophore. After 30 min, the pre-amplification buffer was removed from the discs, hairpin solution added, and the tissues were then incubated in the dark at room temperature for 2–16 hr. The hairpins were removed and saved at –20°C to be reused later. Excess hairpins were removed by washing five times (twice for 5 min, twice for 30 min, and once for 5 min) with 1 mL of 5× SSCT at room temperature. The wing discs were then incubated in 50% glycerol solution (in 1× PBS) with DAPI (0.01 µg/mL) overnight at 4°C. The wing discs were then mounted and visualized on a Zeiss 710 or Leica Stellaris 5 confocal microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>CRISPR-Cas9-mediated mutagenesis of <italic>mirror</italic> in <italic>J. coenia</italic></title><p>Two single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs; sgRNA1-5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">GAATGGACTTGAACGGGGCA</named-content>; sgRNA2-5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">AGAAACAGGGTCGATGATGA</named-content>) targeting the homeobox domain of <italic>mirror</italic> were mixed with 500 ng/μL of Cas9 nuclease and injected to <italic>J. coenia</italic> eggs 0.5–4 hr after oviposition (n=1042 eggs) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Zhang and Reed, 2017</xref>).

They present some evidence that is required for the proper development of the back of the wing in butterflies (a region dubbed the vannus by the ancient guru Snodgrass). But there are problems with that evidence. First, concerning the method, using CRISP they treat embryos and the expectation is that the mirror gene will be damaged in groups of cell lineages, giving a mosaic animal in which some lines of cells are normal for mirror and others not. We do not know where the clones or patches of cells that are defective for mirror are because they are not marked. Also, we do not know what part of the wing is wildtype and what part is mutant for mirror. When the mirror mutant cells colonise the back of the wing and that butterfly survives (many butterflies fail to develop), the back of the wing is altered in some selected butterflies. This raises a second problem: we do not know whether the rear of the wing is missing or transformed. From the images the appearance of the back of the wing is clearly different from wild type, but is that due to transformation or not? And then I believe we need to know specifically what us difference between the rear of the wing and the main part. What we see is a silvery look at the back that is not present in the main part, is it the structure of the scales? We are not told. There are other problems. Mirror is only part of a group of genes in flies and in flies both iroquois and mirror are needed to make the back of the wing, the alula (Kehl et al). What is known about iro expression in butterflies?</p><p>In flies, mirror regulates a late and local expression of dpp that seems to be responsible of making the alula. What happens in butterflies? Would a study of expression of Dpp in wildtype and mirror compromised wings be useful?</p><p>Thus, I find the paper to be disappointing for a general journal as it does little more than claim what was discovered in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is at least partly true in butterflies. Also it fails to explain what the authors mean by &quot;wing domains&quot; and &quot;domain specification&quot;. They are not alone, butterfly workers in general appear vague about these concepts, their vagueness allowing too much loose thinking. Since these matters are at the heart of the purpose and meaning of the work reported here, we readers need a paper containing more critical thought and information. I would like to have a better and more logical introduction and discussion.</p><p>They do define what they mean by the vannus of the wing. In flies the definition of compartments is clear and abundantly demonstrated, with gene expression and requirement being limited precisely to sets of cells that display lineage boundaries. It is true that domains of gene expression in flies, for example, of the iroquois complex, which includes mirror, can only be related to pattern with difficulty. Some recap of what is known plus the opinion of the authors on how they interpret papers on possible lineage domains in butterflies might also be useful as the reader, is no wiser about what the authors might mean at the end of it!</p><p>The references are sometimes inappropriate. The discovery of the AP compartments should not be referred to Guillen et al 1995, but to Morata and Lawrence 1975.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>Nearly all the previous criticisms remain valid and are not discussed or overcome in the revision. The authors wish to draw their conclusions and we think they can do that, but they should make clear that key evidence is lacking. Thus their conclusions are speculative. But they present them more or less as facts. This is not justified. Let us suppose that clones lacking mirror do not survive or do not develop properly in the rear part of the wing and what they are seeing is occasional damage due to incomplete regeneration or to regenerative duplication?</p><p>Many clones in flies only include parts of one surface of the wing, could this happen here and how would it affect interpretations?</p><p>The null phenotype in the wing is not known but deduced from abnormal wings which &quot;even in mKO..... appeared to have a mutant phenotype across the entire posterior region&quot;, a nice example of circular logic.</p><p>We believe the authors should be more objective and explain that their interpretations are not solid and that they should ideally be tested by finding ways of independently marking the clones.

The authors examine the pattern of mirror expression in the common buckeye butterfly, Junonia coenia and then employ CRISPR mutagenesis to generate mosaic butterflies carrying clones of mirror mutant cells. They find that mirror is expressed in a well-defined posterior sector of final-instar wing discs from both hindwings and forewings and that CRISPR-injected larvae display a loss of adult wing structures presumably derived from the mirror expressing region of hindwing primordium (the case for forewings is a bit less clear since the mirror domain is narrower than in the hindwing, but there also do seem to be some anomalies in posterior regions of forewings in adults derived from CRISPR injected larvae). The authors conclude that wings of these butterflies have at least three different fundamental wing compartments, the mirror domain, a posterior domain defined by engrailed expression, and an anterior domain expressing neither mirror or engrailed. They speculate that this most posterior compartment has been reduced to a rudiment in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and thus has not been adequately recognized as a such a primary regional specialization.</p><p>Critique: This is a very straight-forward study and the experimental results presented support the key claims that mirror is expressed in a restricted posterior section of the wing primordium and that mosaic wings from CRISPR injected larvae display loss of adult wing structures presumably derived from cells expressing mirror (or at least nearby). The major issue I have with this paper is the strong interpretation of these findings that lead the authors to conclude that mirror is acting as a high level gene akin to engrailed in defining a separate extreme posterior wing compartment. To place this claim in context, it is important in my view to consider what is known about engrailed, for which there is ample evidence to support the claim that this gene does play a very ancestral and conserved function in a defining posterior compartments of all body segments (including the wing) across arthropods.</p><p>(A) engrailed is expressed in a broad posterior domain with a sharp anterior border in all segments of virtually all arthropods examined (broad use of a very good pan-species anti-En antibody makes this case very strong).</p><p>(B) In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, marked clones of wing cells (generated during larval stages) strictly obey a straight anterior-posterior border indicating that cells in these two domains do not normally intermix, thus, supporting the claim that a clear A/P lineage compartment exists.</p><p>In my opinion, mirror does not seem to be in the same category of regulator as engrailed for the following reasons:</p><p>(1) There is no evidence that I am aware of, either from the current experiments, or others that the mirror expression domain corresponds to a clonal lineage compartment. It is also unclear from the data shown in this study whether engrailed is co-expressed with mirror in posterior most cells of J. coenia wing discs? If so, it does not seem justified to infer that mirror acts as an independent determinant of the region of the wing where it is expressed.</p><p>(2) The mirror is not only expressed in a posterior region of the wing in flies but also in the ventral region of the eye. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, mirror mutants not only lack the alula (derived approximately from cells where mirror is expressed), but also lacks tissue derived from the ventral region of the eye disc (although this ventral tissue loss phenotype may extend beyond the cells expressing mirror).</p><p>In summary, it seems most reasonable to me to think of mirror as a transcription factor that provides important development information for a diverse set of cells in which it can be expressed (posterior wing cells and ventral eye cells) but not that it acts as a high level regulator as engrailed.</p><p>Recommendation:</p><p>While the data provided in this succinct study are solid and interesting, it is not clear to me that these findings support the major claim that mirror defines an extreme posterior compartment akin to that specified by engrailed. Minimally, the authors should address the points outlined above in their discussion section and greatly tone down their conclusion regarding mirror being a conserved selector-like gene dedicated to establishing posterior-most fates of the wing. They also should cite and discuss the original study in <italic>Drosophila</italic> describing the mirror expression pattern in the embryo and eye and the corresponding eye phenotype of mirror mutants: McNeill et al., Genes &amp; Dev. 1997. 11: 1073-1082; doi:10.1101/gad.11.8.1073.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.96904.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chatterjee</surname><given-names>Martik</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Cornell University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ithaca</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Xin Yi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Cornell University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ithaca</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Brady</surname><given-names>Noah K</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Cornell University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ithaca</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hatto</surname><given-names>Gabriel C</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Cornell University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ithaca</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Amendola</surname><given-names>Connor</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Cornell University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ithaca</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Reed</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Cornell University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ithaca</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This short report shows that the transcription factor gene mirror is specifically expressed in the posterior region of the butterfly wing imaginal disk, and uses CRISPR mosaic knock-outs to show it is necessary to specify the morphological features (scales, veins, and surface) of this area.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The data and figures support the conclusions.

We appreciate that many readers may not accustomed to looking at mosaic knockouts. As discussed in a previous review article (Zhang &amp; Reed 2017), we rely on a combination of contralateral asymmetry and replicates to infer mutant phenotypes. For many genes (e.g. pigmentation enzymes) mutant clones are obvious, but for other types of genes (e.g. ligands) clone boundaries are sometimes not directly diagnosable. It is simply a limitation of our study system. Nonetheless, you see for yourself that “the back of the wing is altered in some butterflies” – the effects of deleting <italic>mirror</italic> are clear and repeatable.</p><p>In terms of interpreting mutant phenotypes, we agree that that paper would benefit from a better description of the specific effects.

The authors examine the pattern of mirror expression in the common buckeye butterfly, Junonia coenia, and then employ CRISPR mutagenesis to generate mosaic butterflies carrying clones of mirror mutant cells. They find that mirror is expressed in a well-defined posterior sector of final-instar wing discs from both hindwings and forewings and that CRISPR-injected larvae display a loss of adult wing structures presumably derived from the mirror expressing region of hindwing primordium (the case for forewings is a bit less clear since the mirror domain is narrower than in the hindwing, but there also do seem to be some anomalies in posterior regions of forewings in adults derived from CRISPR injected larvae). The authors conclude that the wings of these butterflies have at least three different fundamental wing compartments, the mirror domain, a posterior domain defined by engrailed expression, and an anterior domain expressing neither mirror nor engrailed. They speculate that this most posterior compartment has been reduced to a rudiment in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and thus has not been adequately recognized as such a primary regional specialization.</p><p>Critique:</p><p>This is a very straightforward study and the experimental results presented support the key claims that mirror is expressed in a restricted posterior section of the wing primordium and that mosaic wings from CRISPR-injected larvae display loss of adult wing structures presumably derived from cells expressing mirror (or at least nearby). The major issue I have with this paper is the strong interpretation of these findings that lead the authors to conclude that mirror is acting as a high-level gene akin to engrailed in defining a separate extreme posterior wing compartment. To place this claim in context, it is important in my view to consider what is known about engrailed, for which there is ample evidence to support the claim that this gene does play a very ancestral and conserved function in defining posterior compartments of all body segments (including the wing) across arthropods.</p><p>(1) Engrailed is expressed in a broad posterior domain with a sharp anterior border in all segments of virtually all arthropods examined (broad use of a very good panspecies anti-En antibody makes this case very strong).</p><p>(2) In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, marked clones of wing cells (generated during larval stages) strictly obey a straight anterior-posterior border indicating that cells in these two domains do not normally intermix, thus, supporting the claim that a clear A/P lineage compartment exists.</p><p>In my opinion, mirror does not seem to be in the same category of regulator as engrailed for the following reasons:</p><p>(1) There is no evidence that I am aware of, either from the current experiments, or others that the mirror expression domain corresponds to a clonal lineage compartment. It is also unclear from the data shown in this study whether engrailed is co-expressed with mirror in the posterior-most cells of J. coenia wing discs. If so, it does not seem justified to infer that mirror acts as an independent determinant of the region of the wing where it is expressed.</p><p>(2) Mirror is not only expressed in a posterior region of the wing in flies but also in the ventral region of the eye. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, mirror mutants not only lack the alula (derived approximately from cells where mirror is expressed), but also lack tissue derived from the ventral region of the eye disc (although this ventral tissue loss phenotype may extend beyond the cells expressing mirror).</p><p>In summary, it seems most reasonable to me to think of mirror as a transcription factor that provides important development information for a diverse set of cells in which it can be expressed (posterior wing cells and ventral eye cells) but not that it acts as a high-level regulator as engrailed.</p><p>Recommendation:</p><p>While the data provided in this succinct study are solid and interesting, it is not clear to me that these findings support the major claim that mirror defines an extreme posterior compartment akin to that specified by engrailed. Minimally, the authors should address the points outlined above in their discussion section and greatly tone down their conclusion regarding mirror being a conserved selector-like gene dedicated to establishing posterior-most fates of the wing. They also should cite and discuss the original study in <italic>Drosophila</italic> describing the mirror expression pattern in the embryo and eye and the corresponding eye phenotype of mirror mutants: McNeill et al., Genes &amp; Dev. 1997. 11: 1073-1082; doi:10.1101/gad.11.8.1073.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their summary, critique, and recommendations. We agree with everything the reviewer says. Honestly, however, we were surprised by these comments because we took great care in the paper to never refer to <italic>mirror</italic> as a compartmentalization gene or claim it has a function in cell lineage compartmentalization like engrailed. As pointed out, we lack clonal analyses to test for compartmentalization. This is why we used the term “domain” instead of “compartment” in the title and throughout the manuscript. Nevertheless, we have recrafted the discussion in the manuscript, including completely removing the term “compartment”, to better avoid implications that <italic>mirror</italic> plays a role in cell lineage compartmentalization.</p><p>We also thank the reviewer for recommending the paper about the role of <italic>mirror</italic> in eye development. For the sake of keeping the paper focused, however, we decided not to broach the topic of <italic>mirror</italic> functions outside the context of wing development.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>I have minor comments for improvement.</p><p>The abstract and introductions are terminologically problematic when they refer to the concept of compartment and compartment boundaries. Allegedly this confusion has previously propagated in several articles related to butterfly wing development, which keeps alienating this literature from being taken seriously by fly specialists, for example. So it is important to use the right terms. I will try to explain point by point here, but I would appreciate it if the authors could undertake a significant rewrite taking these comments into account. The authors use the terms compartment and compartment boundary. This has a very specific use in developmental genetics: mitotic clones never cross a boundary (or compartment). I think the authors can keep referring to the equivalent of the A-P boundary, which is situated somewhere between M1-M2 based on unpublished data from the Patel Lab, and is not very well defined (Engrailed expression moves a little bit during development in this area). Domain is a looser term and can be used more liberally to describe genetically defined regions.</p><p>- &quot;Classical morphological work subdivides insect wings into several distinct domains along the antero-posterior (AP) axis, each of which can evolve relatively independently.&quot; Yes. This concept of domain and individuation seems important. You could make a proposed link to selector genes here.</p><p>- &quot;There has been little molecular evidence, however, for AP subdivision beyond a single compartment boundary described from <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>.&quot; Incorrect, and this conflates &quot;domain&quot; and &quot;compartment&quot;.</p><p>Flies have wing AP domains too, that pattern their veins (see the cited Banerjee et al).</p><p>- &quot;Our results confirm that insect wings can have more than one posterior developmental domain, and support models of how selector genes may facilitate evolutionarily individuation of distinct AP domains in insect wings&quot;. Yes, and I like the second part of the sentence. Still, I would recommend simply deleting &quot;confirm that insect wings can have more than one posterior developmental domain, and&quot; because this is neglecting previous work on AP genetic regionalization in both flies (vein literature) and butterflies (e.g. McKenna and Nijhout, Banerjee et al).</p><p>- &quot;Analyses of wing pattern diversity across butterflies, considering both natural variation and genetic mutants, suggest that wings can be subdivided into at least five AP domains, bounded by the M1, M3, Cu2, and 2A veins respectively, within each of which there are strong correlations in color pattern variation and wing morphology (Figure 1A)&quot;. Yes, and I would recommend emphasizing they correspond to welldefined gene expression domains as mentioned in Banerjee et al, or McKenna and Nijhout.</p><p>- &quot;The anterior-most of these domains, bordered by the M1 vein, appears to correspond to an AP compartment boundary originally described by cell lineage tracing in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, and later supported in butterfly wings by expression of the Engrailed transcription factor. Interestingly, however, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> work has yet to reveal clear evidence for additional AP domain boundaries in the wing.&quot; Confusingly, because the first sentence is about compartments while the second is about AP domains. I also think the claim that Dmel has no other known AP domains is dubious because Spalt is highly regionalized in flies.</p><p>- &quot;Previous authors have proposed the existence of such individuated domains, and speculated that they may be specified by selector genes.5,10 Our data provide experimental support for this model, and now motivate us to identify factors that specify other domain boundaries between the M1 and A2 veins.&quot; Yes, I completely agree with this way to emphasize the selector effect, and to link it to the concept of &quot;individuated domain&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We cannot thank the reviewer enough for the time and thought they devoted to giving helpful suggestions to improve our manuscript.
