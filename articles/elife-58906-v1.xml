Recently, humanity has invented another powerful cognitive tool: computer programming. The ability to flexibly instruct programmable machines has led to a rapid technological transformation of communities across the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ensmenger, 2012</xref>); however, little is known about the cognitive and neural systems that underlie computer programming skills.</p><p>Here, we investigate which neural systems support one critical aspect of computer programming: computer code comprehension. By code comprehension, we refer to a set of cognitive processes that allow programmers to interpret individual program tokens (such as keywords, variables, and function names), combine them to extract the meaning of program statements, and, finally, combine the statements into a mental representation of the entire program. It is important to note that code comprehension may be cognitively and neurally separable from cognitive operations required to process program content, thatÂ is, the actual operations described by code. For instance, to predict the output of the program that sums the first three elements of an array, the programmer should identify the relevant elements and then mentally perform the summation. Most of the time, processing program content recruits a range of cognitive processes known as computational thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Wing, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib149">Wing, 2011</xref>), which include algorithm identification, pattern generalization/abstraction, and recursive reasoning (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Kao, 2010</xref>). These cognitive operations are notably different from code comprehension per se and may not require programming knowledge at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Guzdial, 2008</xref>). Thus, research studies where people read computer programs should account for the fact that interpreting a computer program involves two separate cognitive phenomena: processing computer code that comprises the program (i.e., code comprehension) and mentally simulating the procedures described in the program (i.e., processing problem content).</p><p>Given that code comprehension is a novel cognitive tool, typically acquired in late childhood or in adulthood, we expect it to draw on preexisting cognitive systems. However, the question of which cognitive processes support code comprehension is nontrivial. Unlike some cognitive inventions that are primarily linked to a single cognitive domain (e.g., reading/writing building on spoken language), code comprehension plausibly bears parallels to multiple distinct cognitive systems. First, it may rely on domain-general executive resources, including working memory and cognitive control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bergersen and Gustafsson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Nakagawa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Nakamura et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, it may draw on the cognitive systems associated with math and logic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">McNamara, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Papert, 1972</xref>), in line with the traditional construal of coding as problem-solving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Dalbey and Linn, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Ormerod, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Pea and Kurland, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Pennington and Grabowski, 1990</xref>). Finally, code comprehension may rely on the system that supports comprehension of natural languages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Fedorenko et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Murnane, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Papert, 1993</xref>). Like natural language, computer code makes heavy use of hierarchical structures (e.g., loops, conditionals, and recursive statements), and, like language, it can convey an unlimited amount of meaningful information (e.g., describing objects or action sequences). These similarities could, in principle, make the language circuits wellÂ suited for processing computer code.</p><p>Neuroimaging research is well positioned to disentangle the relationship between code comprehension and other cognitive domains. Many cognitive processes are known to evoke activity in specific brain regions/networks: thus, observing activity for the task of interest in a particular region or network with a known function can indicate which cognitive processes are likely engaged in that task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Mather et al., 2013</xref>). Prior research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Assem et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Duncan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Duncan, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Duncan and Owen, 2000</xref>) has shown that executive processes â such as attention, working memory, and cognitive control â recruit a set of bilateral frontal and parietal brain regions collectively known as the multiple demand (MD) system. If code comprehension primarily relies on domain-general executive processes, we expect to observe code-evoked responses within the MD system, distributed across both hemispheres. Math and logic also evoke responses within the MD system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Fedorenko et al., 2013</xref>), although this activity tends to be left-lateralized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amalric and Dehaene, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amalric and Dehaene, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Goel and Dolan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Micheloyannis et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Monti et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Monti et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Pinel and Dehaene, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Prabhakaran et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Reverberi et al., 2009</xref>). If code comprehension draws on the same mechanisms as math and logic, we expect to observe left-lateralized activity within the MD system. Finally, comprehension of natural language recruits a set of left frontal and temporal brain regions known as the language system (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Fedorenko and Thompson-Schill, 2014</xref>). These regions respond robustly to linguistic input, both visual and auditory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Deniz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Fedorenko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Nakai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Regev et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Scott et al., 2017</xref>). However, they show little or no response to tasks in non-linguistic domains, such as executive functions, math, logic, music, action observation, and non-linguistic communicative signals,Â like gestures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Fedorenko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Jouravlev et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Monti et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Monti et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Pritchett et al., 2018</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Fedorenko and Blank, 2020</xref>, for a review). If code comprehension relies on the same circuits that map form to meaning in natural language, we expect to see activity within the language system.</p><p>Evidence from prior neuroimaging investigations of code comprehension is inconclusive. Existing studies have provided some evidence for left-lateralized activity in regions that roughly correspond to the language system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Siegmund et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Siegmund et al., 2017</xref>), as well as some evidence for the engagement of frontal and parietal regions resembling the MD system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Floyd et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Huang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Siegmund et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Siegmund et al., 2017</xref>). However, none of these prior studies sought to explicitly distinguish code comprehension from other programming-related processes, and none of them provide quantitative evaluations of putative shared responses to code and other tasks, such as working memory, math, or language (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; see Discussion).</p><p>Here, we use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to evaluate the role of the MD system and the language system in computer code comprehension. Three design features that were lacking in earlier neuroimaging studies of programming allow us to evaluate the relative contributions of these two candidate systems. First, we contrast neural responses evoked by code problems with those evoked by content-matched sentence problems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>); this comparison allows us to disentangle activity evoked by code comprehension from activity evoked by the underlying program content (which is matched across code and sentence problems).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental paradigms.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Main task. During code problem trials, participants were presented with snippets of code in Python (Experiment 1) or ScratchJr (Experiment 2); during sentence problem trials, they were presented with text problems that were matched in content with the code stimuli. Each participant saw either the code or the sentence version of any given problem. (<bold>B</bold>) Localizer tasks. The MD localizer (top) included a hard condition (memorizing positions of eight squares appearing two at a time) and an easy condition (memorizing positions of four squares appearing one at a time).

The functional localization approach obviates the reliance on the much-criticized âreverse inferenceâ reasoning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Poldrack, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Poldrack, 2011</xref>), whereby functions are inferred from coarse macro-anatomical landmarks. Instead, we can directly interpret code-evoked activity within functionally defined regions of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Mather et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, localization of the MD and language networks is performed in individual participants, which is important given substantial variability in their precise locations across individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Fedorenko and Blank, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Shashidhara et al., 2019b</xref>) and leads to higher sensitivity and functional resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Nieto-CastaÃ±Ã³n and Fedorenko, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Third, to draw general conclusions about code comprehension, we investigate two very different programming languages: Python, a popular general-purpose programming language, and ScratchJr, an introductory visual programming language for creating animations, designed for young children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bers and Resnick, 2015</xref>). In the Python experiment, we further examine two problem types (math problems and string manipulation) and three basic types of program structure (sequential statements, <italic>for</italic> loops, and <italic>if</italic> statements). Comprehension of both Python and ScratchJr code requires retrieving the meaning of program tokens and combining them into statements, despite the fact that the visual features of the tokens in the two languages are very different (text vs. images). If a brain system is involved in code comprehension, we expect its response to generalize across programming languages and problem types, similar to how distinct natural languages in bilinguals and multilinguals draw on the same language regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Kroll et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these design features of our study allow us to draw precise and generalizable conclusions about the neural basis of code comprehension.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Participants performed a program comprehension task inside an MRI scanner. In each trial, participants, all proficient in the target programming language, read either a code problem or a content-matched sentence problem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and were asked to predict the output. In Experiment 1 (24 participants, 15 women), code problems were written in Python, a general-purpose text-based programming language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Sanner, 1999</xref>). In Experiment 2 (19 participants, 12 women), code problems were written in ScratchJr, an introductory graphical programming language developed for children aged 5â7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bers, 2018</xref>). Both experiments were conducted with adults to facilitate result comparison. Good behavioral performance confirmed that participants were proficient in the relevant programming language and engaged with the task (Python: 99.6% response rate, 85% accuracy on code problems; ScratchJr: 98.6% response rate, 79% accuracy on code problems; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref> for detailed behavioral results). Participants additionally performed two functional localizer tasks: a hard vs. easy spatial working memory task, used to define the MD system, and a sentence vs. nonword reading task, used to define the language system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; see Materials and methods for details).</p><p>We then contrasted neural activity in the MD and language systems during code problem comprehension with activity during (a) sentence problem comprehension and (b) the nonword reading condition from the language localizer task. Sentence problem comprehension requires simulating the same operations as code problem comprehension (mathematical operations or string manipulation for Python, video simulation for ScratchJr), so contrasting code problems with sentence problems allows us to isolate neural responses evoked by code comprehension from responses evoked by processing problem content. Nonword reading elicits weak responses in both the language system and the MD system (in the language system, this response likely reflects low-level perceptual and/or phonological processing; in the MD system, it likely reflects the basic task demands associated with maintaining attention or reading pronounceable letter strings). Because the nonword response is much weaker than responses to the localizer conditions of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Fedorenko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Mineroff et al., 2018</xref>), nonword reading can serve as a control condition for both the MD and language systems, providing a more stringent baseline than simple fixation. Given the abundant evidence that the MD system and the language system are each strongly functionally interconnected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Blank et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Mineroff et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Paunov et al., 2019</xref>), we perform the key analyses at the system level.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>MD system exhibits robust and generalizable bilateral responses during code comprehension</title><p>We found strong bilateral responses to code problems within the MD system in both Experiments 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). These responses were stronger than responses to both the sentence problem condition (Python: Î²Â =Â 1.03, p&lt;0.001, ScratchJr: Î²Â =Â 1.38, p&lt;0.001) and the control nonword reading condition (Python: Î²Â =Â 2.17, p&lt;0.001; ScratchJr: Î²Â =Â 1.23, p&lt;0.001). The fact that code problems drove the MD system more strongly than content-matched sentence problems (despite the fact that sentence problems generally took longer to respond to; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>) demonstrates that the MD system responds to code comprehension specifically rather than simply being activated by the underlying problem content.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Main experimental results.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Candidate brain systems of interest. The areas shown represent the âparcelsâ used to define the MD and language systems in individual participants (see MaterialsÂ andÂ methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

In the MD system, we see strong responses to code problems in both hemispheres and to both programming languages; the fact that this response is stronger than the response to content-matched sentence problems suggests that it reflects activity evoked by code comprehension per se rather than just activity evoked by problem content. In the language system, responses to code problems elicit a response that is substantially weaker than that elicited by sentence problems; further, only in Experiment 1Â do we observe responses to code problems that are reliably stronger than responses to the language localizer control condition (nonword reading).

Responses to ScratchJr were significantly stronger than responses to sentence problems in 6 of the 10 left hemisphere MD fROIs (the effect was not significant in the fROIs in superior frontal gyrus, the dorsal part of the precentral gyrus, the medial frontal cortex, and the insula) and in 8 of the 10 right hemisphere MD fROIs (the effect was not significant in the fROIs in the medial frontal cortex and the insula; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for all fROI statistics). These analyses demonstrate that code processing is broadly distributed across the MD system rather than being localized to a particular region or to a small subset of regions.</p><p>Overall, we show that MD responses to code are strong, do not exclusively reflect responses to problem content, generalize across programming languages and problem types, and are observed across most MD fROIs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>No MD fROIs are selective for code comprehension</title><p>To determine whether any fROIs were driven selectively (preferentially) by code problems relative to other cognitively demanding tasks, we contrasted individual fROI responses to code problems with responses to a hard working memory task from the MD localizer experiment. Three fROIs located in the left frontal lobe (âprecentral_Aâ, âprecentral_Bâ, and âmidFrontalâ) exhibited stronger responses to Python code problems than to the hard working memory task (Î²Â =Â 1.21, p&lt;0.001; Î²Â =Â 1.89, p&lt;0.001; and Î²Â =Â 0.79, p=0.011, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>). However, the magnitude of the code problemsÂ &gt;Â sentence problems contrast in these regions (Î²Â =Â 1.03, 0.95, 0.97) was comparable to the average response magnitude across all MD fROIs (average Î²Â =Â 1.03), suggesting that the high response was caused by processing the underlying problem content rather than by code comprehension per se. Furthermore, neither these nor any other MD fROIs exhibited higher responses to ScratchJr code compared to the hard working memory task (in fact, the âprecentral_Aâ fROI did not even show a significant code problemsÂ &gt;Â sentence problems effect). We conclude that code comprehension is broadly supported by the MD system (similar to, e.g., intuitive physical inference; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Fischer et al., 2016</xref>), but no MD regions are functionally specialized to process computer code.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Language system responses during code comprehension are weak and inconsistent</title><p>The responses to code problems within the language system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>) were weaker than responses to sentence problems in both experiments (Python: Î²Â =Â 0.98, p&lt;0.001; ScratchJr: Î²Â =Â 0.99, p&lt;0.001). Furthermore, although the responses to code problems were stronger than the responses to nonword reading for Python (Î²Â =Â 0.78, p&lt;0.001), this was not the case for ScratchJr (Î²Â =Â 0.15, p=0.29), suggesting that the language system is not consistently engaged during computer code comprehension.</p><p>We further tested whether responses to Python code problems within the language system may be driven by the presence of English words. Our stimuli were constructed such that half of the Python problems contained meaningful identifier names, and in the other half, the English identifiers were replaced with their Japanese translations, making them semantically meaningless for non-speakers of Japanese. For this analysis, we divided our participants into two groups â those with no reported knowledge of Japanese (NÂ =Â 18) and those with some knowledge of Japanese (NÂ =Â 6) â and compared responses within their language regions to code problems with English vs. Japanese identifiers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We found no effect of identifier language (Î²Â =Â 0.03, p=0.84), knowledge of Japanese (Î²Â =Â 0.03, p=0.93), or interaction between them (Î²Â =Â 0.09, p=0.71), indicating that the language systemâs response to Python code was not driven by the presence of semantically transparent identifiers. This result is somewhat surprising given the language systemâs strong sensitivity to word meanings (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Binder et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Fedorenko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Fedorenko et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Pereira et al., 2018</xref>). One possible explanation is that participants do not deeply engage with the wordsâ meanings in these problems because these meanings are irrelevant to finding the correct solution.</p><p>Finally, we investigated whether the responses to Python code problems within the language system were driven by code comprehension specifically or rather by the underlying problem content. When examining responses in the MD system, we could easily disentangle the neural correlates of code comprehension vs. the processing of problem content using univariate analyses: the code problemsÂ &gt;Â sentence problems contrast isolated code-comprehension-related processes, and the sentence problemsÂ &gt;Â nonword reading contrast isolated responses to problem content. In the language system, however, the sentence problemsÂ &gt;Â nonword reading response is additionally driven by language comprehension (unlike the MD system,Â whichÂ does not respond to linguistic input in the absence of task demands, as evidenced by its low responses during sentence reading; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Blank and Fedorenko, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Diachek et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, responses to Python code might be evoked both by problem content and by the language-like features of Python code. To determine the relative contributions of these two factors, we computed voxel-wise spatial correlations within and between the code problem and sentence problem conditions, as well as correlations between these conditions and the sentence/nonword reading conditions from the language localizer task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). We reasoned that if a system is driven by problem content, the activation patterns for code and sentence problems should be similar; in contrast, if a system is driven by code comprehension per se, the activation patterns for code and sentence problems should differ. We found that the activation patterns were highly correlated between the code and sentence problems (rÂ =Â 0.69, p&lt;0.001). These correlation values were higher than the correlations between code problems and sentence reading (0.69 vs. 0.65; p&lt;0.001), although lower than the correlations within the code problem condition (0.69 vs. 0.73; p&lt;0.001). The fact that code and sentence problem responses are correlated over and above code problem and sentence reading responses indicates that the language system is sensitive to the content of the stimulus rather than just the stimulus type (code vs. words). Moreover, similar to the MD system, problem content can account for a substantial portion of the response in the language regions (ÎrÂ =Â 0.04). Note that a similar spatial correlation analysis in the MD system mirrored the result of univariate analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, in both MD and language systems, response to Python code is driven both by problem content and by code-specific responses.</p><p>Overall, we found that the language system responded to code problems written in Python but not in ScratchJr. Furthermore, Python responses were driven not only by code comprehension, but also by the processing of problem content. We conclude that successful comprehension of computer code can proceed without engaging the language network.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>No consistent evidence of code-responsive regions outside the MD/language systems</title><p>To search for code-responsive regions that might fall outside the MD and language systems, we performed a whole-brain GSS analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Fedorenko et al., 2010</xref>).

We searched for areas of activation for the code problemsÂ &gt;Â sentence problems contrast (separately for Python and ScratchJr) that were spatially similar across participants. We then examined the response of such regions to code and sentence problems (using an across-runs cross-validation procedure; e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Nieto-CastaÃ±Ã³n and Fedorenko, 2012</xref>), as well as to conditions from the two localizer experiments.

For Python, any region that responded to code also responded to the spatial working memory task (the MD localizer). In case of ScratchJr, some fROIs responded more strongly to code problems than to the spatial working memory task; these fROIs were located in early visual areas/ventral visual stream and therefore likely responded to low-level visual properties of ScratchJr code (which includes colorful icons, objects, etc.).

Here, we tested the role of two candidate neural systems in computer code comprehension: the domain-general MD system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Duncan, 2010</xref>),Â which has been linked to diverse executive demands and implicated in math and logic (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amalric and Dehaene, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Goel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Monti et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Monti et al., 2009</xref>), and the language-selective system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Fedorenko et al., 2011</xref>),Â which has been linked to lexical and combinatorial linguistic processes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bautista and Wilson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Fedorenko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Fedorenko et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Fedorenko et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Keller et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Mollica et al., 2020</xref>). We found robust bilateral responses to code problems within the MD system, a pattern that held across two very different programming languages (Python and ScratchJr), types of problems (math and string manipulation), and problem structure (sequential statements, <italic>for</italic> loops, and <italic>if</italic> statements). In contrast, responses in the language system were substantially lower than those elicited by the content-matched sentence problems and exceeded responses to the control condition (nonwords reading) only for one of the two programming languages tested.</p><p>Our work uniquely contributes to the study of computer programming in the mind and brain by addressing two core issues that made it difficult to interpret results from prior studies. First, we disentangle responses evoked by code comprehension from responses to problem content (which is often not code-specific) by contrasting code problems with content-matched sentence problems. Our findings suggest that earlier reports of left-lateralized code-evoked activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Siegmund et al., 2014</xref>) may reflect processing program content rather than code comprehension per se. This distinction should also be considered when interpreting results of other studies of programming effects on brain activity, such as debugging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Castelhano et al., 2019</xref>), variable tracking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ikutani and Uwano, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Nakagawa et al., 2014</xref>), use of semantic cues or program layout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Fakhoury et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Siegmund et al., 2017</xref>), program generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Krueger et al., 2020</xref>), and programming expertise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ikutani et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Second, we analyze responses in brain areas that are functionally localized in individual participants, allowing for straightforward interpretation of the observed responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Mather et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Saxe et al., 2006</xref>). This approach stands in contrast to the traditional approach, whereby neural responses are averaged across participants on a voxel-by-voxel basis, and the resulting activation clusters are interpreted via âreverse inferenceâ from anatomy (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Poldrack, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Poldrack, 2011</xref>). Functional localization is particularly important when analyzing responses in frontal, temporal, and parietal association cortex, which is known to be functionally heterogeneous and variable across individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Blank et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Braga et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Fedorenko and Kanwisher, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Frost and Goebel, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Shashidhara et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Tahmasebi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">VÃ¡zquez-RodrÃ­guez et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The results of our work align well with the results of another recent study on program comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). Liu et al. investigated the neural correlates of program comprehension by contrasting Python code problems with fake code. The code problem condition was similar to ours, whereas the fake code condition involved viewing scrambled code, followed by a visual recognition task. The code problemsÂ &gt;Â fake code contrast is broader than ours: it includes both code comprehension (interpreting Python code) and the processing of problem content (manipulating characters in a string). Our results show that the MD system is involved in both processes, but Python code comprehension is bilateral, whereas the processing of problem content is left-lateralized. We would therefore expect the code problemsÂ &gt;Â fake code contrast to activate the MD system, engaging the left hemisphere more strongly than the right due to the demands of problem content processing. This is precisely what Liu et al. found. Further, similar to us, Liu et al. conclude that it is the MD regions, not the language regions, that are primarily involved in program comprehension.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>MD systemâs engagement reflects the use of domain-general resources</title><p>The fact that the MD system responds to code problems over and above content-matched sentence problems underscores the role of domain-general executive processes in code comprehension. Although cognitive processes underlying code interpretation bear parallels to logic and math tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Papert, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Pennington and Grabowski, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Perkins and Simmons, 1988</xref>) and to natural language comprehension/generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Fedorenko et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Hermans and Aldewereld, 2017</xref>), the neural activity we observe primarily resembles activity observed in response to domain-general executive tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Assem et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Duncan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Fedorenko et al., 2013</xref>). In particular, code comprehension elicits bilateral responses within the MD system, in contrast to math and logic tasks that tend to elicit left-lateralized responses within the MD system, and in contrast to language tasks that elicit responses in the spatially and functionally distinct language system.</p><p>We found that responses in the MD system were driven both by the processing of problem content (e.g., summing the contents of an array) and by code comprehension (e.g., identifying variables referring to an array and its elements, interpreting a <italic>for</italic> loop, realizing that the output of the program is the variable being updated inside the <italic>for</italic> loop). Both of these processes plausibly require attention, working memory, inhibitory control, planning, and general flexible relational reasoning âÂ cognitive processes long linked to the MD system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Duncan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Duncan, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Duncan and Owen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Miller and Cohen, 2001</xref>) in both humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Assem et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Shashidhara et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Woolgar et al., 2018</xref>) and non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Freedman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Miller et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Mitchell et al., 2016</xref>). A recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Huang et al., 2019</xref>) reported neural overlap between operations on programming data structures (which require both code comprehension and the processing of problem content) and a mental rotation task (which requires spatial reasoning). The overlap was observed within brain regions whose topography grossly resembles that of the MD system. In our study, all code-responsive brain regions outside the visual cortex also responded robustly during a spatial memory task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">4</xref>), similar to the results reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Huang et al., 2019</xref>. However, the MD system is not specifically tuned to spatial reasoning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Duncan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Fedorenko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Michalka et al., 2015</xref>), so the overlap between code comprehension and spatial reasoning likely reflects the engagement of domain-general cognitive processes, like working memory and cognitive control, as opposed to processes specific to spatial reasoning.</p><p>Furthermore, given that no regions outside of the MD system showed code-specific responses, it must be the case that code-specific knowledge representations are also <italic>stored</italic> within this system (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Hasson et al., 2015</xref>, for a general discussion of the lack of distinction between storage and computing resources in the brain). Such code-specific representations would likely include both knowledge specific to a programming language (e.g., the syntax marking an array in Java vs. Python) and knowledge of programming concepts that are shared across languages (e.g., <italic>for</italic> loops). Much evidence suggests that the MD system can flexibly store task-relevant information in the short term (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Fedorenko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Freedman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Shashidhara et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Wen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib150">Woolgar et al., 2011</xref>). However, evidence from studies on processing mathematics (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amalric and Dehaene, 2019</xref>) and physics (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Cetron et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Fischer et al., 2016</xref>) further suggests that the MD system can store some domain-specific representations in the long term, perhaps for evolutionarily late-emerging and ontogenetically late-acquired domains of knowledge. Our data add to this body of evidence by showing that the MD system stores and uses information required for code comprehension.</p><p>We also show that, instead of being concentrated in one region or a subset of the MD system, code-evoked responses are distributed throughout the MD system. This result seems to violate general metabolic and computational efficiency principles that govern much of the brainâs architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Chklovskii and Koulakov, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Kanwisher, 2010</xref>): if some MD neurons are, at least in part, functionally specialized to process computer code, we would expect them to be located next to each other. Three possibilities are worth considering. First, selectivity for code comprehension in a subset of the MD network may only emerge with years of experience (e.g., in professional programmers). Participants in our experiments were all proficient in the target programming language but most had only a few years of experience with it. Second, code-selective subsets of the MD network may be detectable at higher spatial resolution, using invasive methods like electrocorticography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Parvizi and Kastner, 2018</xref>) or single-cell recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Mukamel and Fried, 2012</xref>). And third, perhaps the need to flexibly solve novel problems throughout oneâs life prevents the âcrystallizationâ of specialized subnetworks within the MD cortex. AllÂ that said, it may also be the case that some subset of the MD network is causally important for code comprehension even though it does not show strong selectivity for it, similar to how damage to some MD areas (mostly, in the left parietal cortex) appears to lead to deficits in numerical cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ardila and Rosselli, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Kahn and Whitaker, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Lemer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Rosselli and Ardila, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Takayama et al., 1994</xref>), even though these regions do not show selectivity for numerical tasks in fMRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Pinel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Shuman and Kanwisher, 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The language system is functionally conservative</title><p>We found that the language system does not respond consistently during code comprehension in spite of numerous similarities between code and natural languages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Fedorenko et al., 2019</xref>). Perhaps the most salient similarity between these input types is their syntactic/combinatorial structure. Some accounts of language processing claim that syntactic operations that support language processing are highly abstract and insensitive to the nature of the to-be-combined units (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Berwick et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Fitch et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Fitch and Martins, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Hauser et al., 2002</xref>). Such accounts predict that the mechanisms supporting structure processing in language should also get engaged when we process structure in other domains, including computer code. Prior work has already put into question this idea in its broadest form: processing music, whose hierarchical structure has long been noted to have parallels with linguistic syntax (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Lerdahl and Jackendoff, 1996</xref>; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Jackendoff, 2009</xref>), does not engage the language system (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Fedorenko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Rogalsky et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). Our finding builds upon the results from the music domain to show that compositional input (here, variables and keywords combining into statements) and hierarchical structure (here, conditional statements and loops) do not necessarily engage language-specific regions.</p><p>Another similarity shared by computer programming and natural language is the use of symbols â units referring to concepts âout in the worldâ. Studies of math and logic, domains that also make extensive use of symbols, show that those domains do not rely on the language system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amalric and Dehaene, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Cohen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Fedorenko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Monti et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Monti et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Pinel and Dehaene, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Varley et al., 2005</xref>), a conclusion consistent with our findings. However, these priorÂ results might be explained by the hypothesis that mathematics makes use of a different conceptual space altogether (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cappelletti et al., 2001</xref>), in which case the symbol-referent analogy would be weakened. Our work provides an even stronger test of the symbolic reference hypothesis: the computer code problems we designed are not only symbolic, but also refer to the same conceptual representations as the corresponding verbal problems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This parallel is particularly striking in the case of ScratchJr: each code problem refers to a sequence of actions performed by a cartoon character âÂ a clear case of reference to concepts in the physical world. And yet, the language regions do not respond to ScratchJr, showing a clear preference for language over other types of meaningful structured input (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ivanova et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The third similarity between code and natural language is the communicative use of those systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allamanis et al., 2018</xref>). The programming languages we chose are very high-Â level, meaning that they emphasize human readability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Buse and Weimer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Klare, 1963</xref>) over computational efficiency. ScratchJr is further optimized to be accessible and engaging for young children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Sullivan and Bers, 2019</xref>). Thus, code written in these languages is meant to be read and understood by humans, not just executed by machines. In this respect, computer code comprehension is similar to reading in natural language: the goal is to extract a meaningful message produced by another human at some point in the past. And yet the communicative nature of this activity is not sufficient to recruit the language system, consistent with previous reports showing a neural dissociation between language and other communication-related activities, such as gesture processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Jouravlev et al., 2019</xref>), intentional actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Pritchett et al., 2018</xref>), or theory of mind tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Apperly et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Dronkers et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Jacoby et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Paunov et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Varley and Siegal, 2000</xref>).</p><p>Of course, the lack of consistent language system engagement in code comprehension does not mean that the mechanisms underlying language and code processing are completely different. It is possible that both language and MD regions have similarly organized neural circuits that allow them to process combinatorial input or map between a symbol and the concept it refers to. However, the fact that we observed code-evoked activity primarily in the MD regions indicates that code comprehension does not load on the same neural circuits as language and needs to use domain-general MD circuits instead.</p><p>More work is required to determine why the language system showed some activity in response to Python code. The most intuitive explanation posits that the language system responds to meaningful words embedded within the code; however, this explanation seems unlikely given the fact that the responses were equally strong when reading problems with semantically meaningful identifiers (English) and semantically meaningless identifiers (Japanese; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Another possibility is that participants internally verbalized the symbols they were reading (where âverbalizeâ means to retrieve the word associated with a certain symbol rather than a simple reading response, since the latter would be shared with nonwords). However, this account does not explain the fact why such verbalization would be observed for Python and not for ScratchJr, where many blocks have easy labels, such as âjumpâ. It is also inconsistent with observations that even behaviors that ostensibly require subvocal rehearsal (e.g., mathematical operations) do not engage the language system (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amalric and Dehaene, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Fedorenko et al., 2011</xref>). Finally, the account that we consider most likely is that the responses were mainlyÂ driven by processing underlying problem content and thus associated with some aspect(s) of computational thinking that were more robustly present in Python compared to ScratchJr problems. Further investigations of the role of the language system in computational thinking have the potential to shed light on the exact computations supported by these regions.</p><p>Finally, it is possible that the language system may play a role in learning to program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Prat et al., 2020</xref>), even if it is not required to support code comprehension once the skill is learned. Studies advocating the âcoding as another languageâ approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bers, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bers, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Sullivan and Bers, 2019</xref>) have found that treating coding as a meaning-making activity rather than merely a problem-solving skill had a positive impact on both teaching and learning to program in the classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Hassenfeld et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Hassenfeld and Bers, 2020</xref>). Such results indicate that the language system and/or the general semantic system might play a role in learning to process computer code, especially in children, when the language system is still developing. This idea remains to be empirically evaluated in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Limitations of scope</title><p>The stimuli used in our study were short and only included a few basic elements of control flow (such as <italic>for</italic> loops and <italic>if</italic> statements). Furthermore, we focused on code comprehension, which is a necessary but not sufficient component of many other programming activities, such as code generation, editing, and debugging. Future work should investigate changes in brain activity during the processing and generation of more complex code structures, such as functions, objects, and large multi-component programs. Just like narrative processing recruits systems outside the regions that support single sentence processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baldassano et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Blank and Fedorenko, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ferstl et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Jacoby and Fedorenko, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Lerner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Simony et al., 2016</xref>), reading more complex pieces of code might recruit an extended, or a different, set of brain regions. Furthermore, as noted above, investigations of expert programmers may reveal changes in how programming knowledge and use are instantiated in the mind and brain as a function of increasing amount of domain-relevant experience.</p><p>Overall, we provide evidence that code comprehension consistently recruits the MD systemÂ âÂ which subserves cognitive processing across multiple cognitive domainsÂ âÂ but does not consistently engage the language system, in spite of numerous similarities between natural and programming languages. By isolating neural activity specific to code comprehension, we pave the way for future studies examining the cognitive and neural correlates of programming and contribute to the broader literature on the neural systems that support novel cognitive tools.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>For Experiment 1, we recruited 25 participants (15 women, mean ageÂ =Â 23.0 years, SDÂ =Â 3.0).

ScratchJr is a language designed to teach programming concepts to young children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bers, 2018</xref>): users can create events and sequences of events (stories) with a set of characters and actions. The full list of problems used in the study can be found on the paperâs website. Each participant saw 24 problems, and any given participant saw only one version of a problem. Furthermore, problems varied in the complexity of the code snippet (three levels of difficulty; eight problems at each level).</p><p>During each trial, participants were presented with a fixation cross for 4 s, followed by a description (either a code snippet or a sentence) to read for 8 s. The presentation of the description was followed by 5â9 s of fixation, and then by a video (average duration: 4.13 s, SD: 1.70 s) that either did or did not match the description. Participants had to indicate whether the video matched the description by pressing one of two buttons on a button box in the scanner. The response window started with the onset of the video and included a 4 s period after the video offset. A trial lasted, on average, 27.46 s (SDÂ =Â 2.54 s; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>, for a schematic of trial structure). Each run consisted of six trials (three per condition), and a 10 s fixation at the beginning and end of the run. A run lasted, on average, 184.75 s (SDÂ =Â 3.86 s); each participant completed four runs. Condition order was counterbalanced across runs and participants.</p><p>The spatial working memory task was conducted in order to identify the MD system within individual participants. Participants had to keep track of four (easy condition) or eight (hard condition) sequentially presented locations in a 3Â ÃÂ 4 grid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Fedorenko et al., 2011</xref>). In both conditions, they performed a two-alternative forced-choice task at the end of each trial to indicate the set of locations they just saw. The hardÂ &gt;easy contrast has been previously shown to reliably activate bilateral frontal and parietal MD regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Assem et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Blank et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Fedorenko et al., 2013</xref>). Numerous studies have shown that the same brain regions are activated by diverse executivelyÂ demanding tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Duncan and Owen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Fedorenko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Hugdahl et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Shashidhara et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib150">Woolgar et al., 2011</xref>). Stimuli were presented in the center of the screen across four steps. Each step lasted 1 s and revealed one location on the grid in the easy condition, and two locations in the hard condition. Each stimulus was followed by a choice-selection step, which showed two grids side by side. One grid contained the locations shown across the previous four steps, while the other contained an incorrect set of locations. Participants were asked to press one of two buttons to choose the grid that showed the correct locations. Condition order was counterbalanced across runs. Experimental blocks lasted 32 s (with four trials per block), and fixation blocks lasted 16 s. Each run (consisting of four fixation blocks and 12 experimental blocks) lasted 448 s. Each participant completed two runs.</p><p>The language localizer task was conducted in order to identify the language system within individual participants. Participants read sentences (e.g., NOBODY COULD HAVE PREDICTED THE EARTHQUAKE IN THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY) and lists of unconnected, pronounceable nonwords (e.g., U BIZBY ACWORRILY MIDARAL MAPE LAS POME U TRINT WEPS WIBRON PUZ) in a blocked design. Each stimulus consisted of twelve words/nonwords. For details of how the language materials were constructed, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Fedorenko et al., 2010</xref>. The materials are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://web.mit.edu/evelina9/www/funcloc/funcloc_localizers.html">http://web.mit.edu/evelina9/www/funcloc/funcloc_localizers.html</ext-link>. The sentencesÂ &gt;Â nonword lists contrast isolates processes related to language comprehension (responses evoked by, e.g., visual perception and reading are subtracted out) and has been previously shown to reliably activate left-lateralized fronto-temporal language processing regions, be robust to changes in task and materials, and activate the same regions regardless of whether the materials were presented visually or auditorily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Fedorenko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Mahowald and Fedorenko, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Scott et al., 2017</xref>). Further, a similar network emerges from task-free resting-state data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Braga et al., 2020</xref>). Stimuli were presented in the center of the screen, one word/nonword at a time, at the rate of 450 ms per word/nonword. Each stimulus was preceded by a 100 ms blank screen and followed by a 400 ms screen showing a picture of a finger pressing a button, and a blank screen for another 100 ms, for a total trial duration of 6 s. Participants were asked to press a button whenever they saw the picture of a finger pressing a button. This task was included to help participants stay alert. Condition order was counterbalanced across runs. Experimental blocks lasted 18 s (with three trials per block), and fixation blocks lasted 14 s. Each run (consisting of 5 fixation blocks and 16 experimental blocks) lasted 358 s. Each participant completed two runs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>fMRI data acquisition</title><p>Structural and functional data were collected on the whole-body, 3 Tesla, Siemens Trio scanner with a 32-channel head coil, at the Athinoula A. Martinos Imaging Center at the McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT. T1-weighted structural images were collected in 176 sagittal slices with 1 mm isotropic voxels (TRÂ =Â 2,530 ms, TEÂ =Â 3.48 ms). Functional, blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD), data were acquired using an EPI sequence (with a 90<sup>o</sup> flip angle and using GRAPPA with an acceleration factor of 2), with the following acquisition parameters: thirty-one 4 mm thick near-axial slices acquired in the interleaved order (with 10% distance factor), 2.1 mmÂ ÃÂ 2.1 mm in-plane resolution, FoV in the phase encoding (AÂ &gt;&gt;Â P) direction 200 mm and matrix size 96 mmÂ ÃÂ 96 mm, TRÂ =Â 2,000 ms and TEÂ =Â 30 ms.

Each participantâs data were motion corrected and then normalized into a common brain space (the Montreal Neurological Institute [MNI] template) and resampled into 2 mm isotropic voxels. The data were then smoothed with a 4 mm FWHM Gaussian filter and high-pass filtered (at 128 s). Effects were estimated using a General Linear Model (GLM) in which each experimental condition was modeled with a boxcar function convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF). For the localizer experiments, we modeled the entire blocks. For the Python program comprehension experiment, we modeled the period from the onset of the code/sentence problem and until the button press (the responses were modeled as a separate condition; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>); for the ScratchJr program comprehension experiment, we modeled the period of the code/sentence presentation (the video and the response were modeled as a separate condition; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Defining MD and language functional regions of interest (fROIs)</title><p>The fROI analyses examined responses in individually defined MD and language fROIs.

The parcels delineate the expected gross locations of activations for a given contrast based on prior work and large numbers of participants and are sufficiently large to encompass the variability in the locations of individual activations. For the MD system, we used a set of 20 parcels (10 in each hemisphere) derived from a group-level probabilistic activation overlap map for the hardÂ &gt;easy spatial working memory contrast in 197 participants. The parcels included regions in frontal and parietal lobes, as well as a region in the anterior cingulate cortex. For the language system, we used a set of six parcels derived from a group-level probabilistic activation overlap map for the sentencesÂ &gt;Â nonwords contrast in 220 participants. The parcels included two regions in the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG, LIFGorb), one in the left middle frontal gyrus (LMFG), two in the left temporal lobe (LAntTemp and LPostTemp), and one extending into the angular gyrus (LAngG). Both sets of parcels are available on the paperâs website; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref> for labeled images of MD and language parcels.

For each fROI in each participant, we averaged the responses across voxels to get a single value for each of the conditions (the responses to the localizer conditions were estimated using an across-runs cross-validation procedure, where one run was used to define the fROI and the other to estimate the response magnitudes, then the procedure was repeated switching which run was used for fROI definition vs. response estimation, and finally the estimates were averaged to derive a single value per condition per fROI per participant). We then ran a linear mixed-effect regression model to compare the responses to the critical code problem condition with (a) the responses to the sentence problem condition from the critical task, and (b) the responses to the nonword reading condition from the language localizer task. We included <italic>condition</italic> as a fixed effect and <italic>participant</italic> and <italic>fROI</italic> as random intercepts.

relies primarily on domain-general executive resources&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Timothy Behrens as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: William Matchin (Reviewer #1); Ina Bornkessel-Schlesewsky (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>First, thank you for taking part in the review process.</p><p>As you know, <italic>eLife</italic> is invested in changing scientific publishing and experimenting to embody that change, even if that involves a degree of risk in order to find workable changes. In this spirit, the remit of the co-submission format is to ask if the scientific community is enriched by the data presented in the co-submitted manuscripts together more so than it would be by the papers apart, or if only one paper was presented to the community. In other words, are the conclusions that can be made are stronger or clearer when the manuscripts are considered together rather than separately? We felt that despite significant concerns with each paper individually, especially regarding the theoretical structures in which the experimental results could be interpreted, that this was the case.</p><p>We want to be very clear that in a non-co-submission case we would have substantial and serious concerns about the interpretability and robustness of the Liu et al. submission given its small sample size. Furthermore, the reviewers' concerns about the suitability of the control task differed substantially between the manuscripts. We share these concerns. However, despite these differences in control task and sample size, the Liu et al. and Ivanova et al. submissions nonetheless replicated each other â the language network was not implicated in processing programming code. The replication substantially mitigates the concerns shared by us and the reviewers about sample size and control tasks. The fact that different control tasks and sample sizes did not change the overall pattern of results, in our view, is affirmation of the robustness of the findings, and the value that both submissions presented together can offer the literature.</p><p>In sum, there were concerns that both submissions were exploratory in nature, lacking a strong theoretical focus, and relied on functional localizers on novel tasks. However, these concerns were mitigated by the following strengths. Both tasks ask a clear and interesting question. The results replicate each other despite task differences. In this way, the two papers strengthen each other. Specifically, the major concerns for each paper individually are ameliorated when considering them as a whole.</p><p>In your revisions, please address the concerns of the reviewers, including, specifically, the limits of interpretation of your results with regard to control task choice, the discussion of relevant literature mentioned by the reviewers, and most crucially, please contextualize your results with regard to the other submission's results.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript is well-written and the methods are clear and rigorous, representing a clear advance on previous research comparing computer code programming to language. The conclusions with respect to which brain networks computer programming activates are compelling and well conveyed. This paper is useful to the extent that the conclusions are focused on the empirical findings: whether or not code activates language-related brain regions (answer: no). However, the authors appear to be also testing whether or not any of the mechanisms involved in language are recruited for computer programming. The problem with this goal is that the authors do not present or review a theory of the representations and mechanisms involved in computer programming, as has been developed for language (e.g. Adger, 2013; Bresnan, 2001; Chomsky, 1965, 1981, 1995; Goldberg, 1995; Hornstein, 2009; Jackendoff, 2002; Levelt, 1989; Lewis and Vasishth, 2005; Vosse and Kempen, 2000).</p><p>1) &quot;The fact that coding can be learned in adulthood suggests that it may rely on existing cognitive systems.&quot; &quot;Finally, code comprehension may rely on the system that supports comprehension of natural languages: to successfully process both natural and computer languages, we need to access stored meanings of words/tokens and combine them using hierarchical syntactic rules (Fedorenko et al., 2019; Murnane, 1993; Papert, 1993) â a similarity that, in theory, should make the language circuits well-suited for processing computer code.&quot; If we understand stored elements and computational structure in the broadest way possible without breaking this down more, many domains of cognition would be shared in this way. The authors should illustrate in more detail how the psychological structure of computer programming parallels language. Is there an example of hierarchical structure in computer code? What is the meaning of a variable/function in code, and how does this compare to meaning in language?</p><p>2) &quot;Our findings, along with prior findings from math and logic (Amalric and Dehaene, 2019; Monti et al., 2009, 2012), argue against this possibility: the language system does not respond to meaningful structured input that is non-linguistic.&quot; This is an overly simple characterization of the word &quot;meaningful&quot;. The meaning of math and logic are not the same as in language. Both mathematics and computer programming have logical structure to them, but the nature of this structure and the elements that are combined in language are different. Linguistic computations take as input complex atoms of computation that have phonological and conceptual properties. These atoms are commonly used to refer to entities &quot;in the world&quot; with complex semantic properties and often have rich associated imagery. Linguistic computations output complex, monotonically enhanced forms. So cute + dogs = cute dogs, chased + cute dogs = chased cute dogs, etc. This is very much unlike mathematics and computer programming, where we typically do not make reference to the &quot;real world&quot; using these expressions to interlocuters, and outputs of an expression are not monotonic, structure-preserving combinations of the input elements, and there is no semantic enhancement that occurs through increased computation. This bears much more discussion in the paper, if the authors intend to make claims regarding shared/distinct computations between computer programming and language.</p><p>3) More importantly, even if there were shared mechanisms between computer code programming and language, I'm not sure we can use reverse inference to strongly test this hypothesis. As Poldrack, 2006, pointed out, reverse inference is sharply limited by the extent to which we know how cognition maps onto the brain. This is a similar point to Poeppel and Embick, 2005, who pointed out that different mechanisms of language could be implemented in the brain in a large variety of ways, only one of which is big pieces of cortical tissue. In this sense, there could in fact be shared mechanisms between language and code (e.g. oscillatory dynamics, connectivity patterns, subcortical structures), but these mechanisms might not be aligned with the cortical territory associated with language-related brain regions. The authors should spend much additional time discussing these alternative possibilities.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This carefully designed fMRI study examines an interesting question, namely how computer code â as a &quot;cognitive/cultural invention&quot; â is processed by the human brain. The study has a number of strengths, including: use of two very different programming languages (Python and Scratch Jr.) in two experiments; direct comparison between code problems and &quot;content-matched sentence problems&quot; to disentangle code comprehension from problem content; control for the impact of lexical information in code passages by replacing variable names with Japanese translations; and consideration of inter-individual differences in programming proficiency. I do, however, have some questions regarding the interpretation of the results in mechanistic terms, as detailed below.</p><p>1) Code comprehension versus underlying problem content</p><p>I am generally somewhat sceptical in regard to the use of functional localisers in view of the assumptions that necessarily enter into the definition of a localiser task. In addition, an overlap between the networks supporting two different tasks doesn't imply comparable neural processing mechanisms. With the present study, however, I was impressed by the authors' overall methodological approach. In particular, I found the supplementation of the localiser-based approach with the comparison between code problems and analogous sentence problems rather convincing.</p><p>However, while I agree that computational thinking does not require coding / code comprehension, it is less clear to me what code comprehension involves when it is stripped of the computational thinking aspect. Knowing how to approach a problem algorithmically strikes me as a central aspect of coding. What, then, is being measured by the code problem versus sentence problem comparison? Knowledge of how to implement a certain computational solution within a particular programming language? The authors touch upon this briefly in the Discussion section of the paper, but I am not fully convinced by their arguments. Specifically, they state:</p><p>&quot;The process of code comprehension includes retrieving code-related knowledge from memory and applying it to the problems at hand. This application of task-relevant knowledge plausibly requires attention, working memory, inhibitory control, planning, and general flexible reasoning-cognitive processes long linked to the MD system [â¦].â</p><p>Shouldn't all of this also apply (or even apply more strongly) to processing of the underlying problem content rather than to code comprehension per se?</p><p>According to the authors, the extent to which code-comprehension-related activity reflects problem content varies between different systems. They conclude that &quot;MD responses to code [â¦] do not exclusively reflect responses to problem content&quot;, while they argue on the basis of their voxel-wise correlation analysis that &quot;the language system's response to code is largely (although not completely) driven by problem content. However, unless I have missed something, the latter analysis was only undertaken for the language system but not for the other systems under examination. Was there a particular reason for this? Also, what are the implications of observing problem content-driven responses within the language system for the authors' conclusion that this system is &quot;functionally conservative&quot;?</p><p>Overall, the paper would be strengthened by more clarity in regard to these issues â and specifically a more detailed discussion of what code comprehension may amount to in mechanistic terms when it is stripped of computational thinking.</p><p>2) Implications of using reading for the language localiser task</p><p>Given that reading is also a cultural invention, is it really fair to say that coding is being compared to the &quot;language system&quot; here rather than to the &quot;reading system&quot; (in view of the visual presentation of the language task)? The possible implications of this for the interpretation of the data should be considered.</p><p>3) Possible effects of verbalisation?</p><p>It appears possible that participants may have internally verbalised code problems â at least to a certain extent (and likely with a considerable degree of inter-individual variability). How might this have affected the results of the present study? Could verbalisation be related to the highly correlated response between code problems and language problems within the language system?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58906.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[â¦] In your revisions, please address the concerns of the reviewers, including, specifically, the limits of interpretation of your results with regard to control task choice, the discussion of relevant literature mentioned by the reviewers, and most crucially, please contextualize your results with regard to the other submission's results.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the editor and the reviewers for their thoughtful evaluation.

We agree that the main value of our paper is examining the contributions of the two brain networks to computer programming. Unfortunately, the theories of representations/computations involved in computer code comprehension are quite underdeveloped and have very little experimental support. Thus, the main mechanistic distinction we investigate in this work is a high-level distinction between code comprehension and the processing of problem content. We have adjusted the framing and the title of our manuscript to tone down and/or clarify our theoretical stance (see responses to specific points below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) &quot;The fact that coding can be learned in adulthood suggests that it may rely on existing cognitive systems.&quot; &quot;Finally, code comprehension may rely on the system that supports comprehension of natural languages: to successfully process both natural and computer languages, we need to access stored meanings of words/tokens and combine them using hierarchical syntactic rules (Fedorenko et al., 2019; Murnane, 1993; Papert, 1993) â a similarity that, in theory, should make the language circuits well-suited for processing computer code.&quot; If we understand stored elements and computational structure in the broadest way possible without breaking this down more, many domains of cognition would be shared in this way.

We agree that it is important to clarify what we mean by âmeaningâ. We therefore significantly expanded the section in question to clarify our statement:</p><p>âAnother similarity shared by computer programming and natural language is the use of symbols â units referring to concepts âout in the worldâ. [â¦] And yet the communicative nature of this activity is not sufficient to recruit the language system, consistent with previous reports showing a neural dissociation between language and gesture processing (Jouravlev et al., 2019), intentional actions (Pritchett et al., 2018) or theory of mind tasks (Apperly et al., 2006; Dronkers et al., 1998; Jacoby et al., 2016; Paunov et al., 2019; Varley and Siegal, 2000).â</p><p>Note that this section addresses the comments about reference to external entities and the communicative intent (which, as we state above, we think are partially shared between language and code). The paragraph preceding these (see point 1) also addresses the point about compositionality, at least in its most basic definition. We agree that language has both semantic and compositional properties that make it âspecialâ (rich associations, imagery, semantic enhancement), all of which might account for the high functional selectivity of the language regions. However, we think that the discussion of such possibly unique properties of language is outside the scope of this paper and therefore limit ourselves to listing the putative <italic>shared</italic> properties of language and code.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) More importantly, even if there were shared mechanisms between computer code programming and language, I'm not sure we can use reverse inference to strongly test this hypothesis. As Poldrack, 2006, pointed out, reverse inference is sharply limited by the extent to which we know how cognition maps onto the brain. This is a similar point to Poeppel and Embick, 2005, who pointed out that different mechanisms of language could be implemented in the brain in a large variety of ways, only one of which is big pieces of cortical tissue. In this sense, there could in fact be shared mechanisms between language and code (e.g. oscillatory dynamics, connectivity patterns, subcortical structures), but these mechanisms might not be aligned with the cortical territory associated with language-related brain regions. The authors should spend much additional time discussing these alternative possibilities.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right in that we here focus on one way in which two cognitive functions might share resources (through cortical overlap; though note that our whole-brain analyses rule out overlap at the subcortical level, too). It is absolutely true that functionally distinct cortical areas could still (a) implement similar computations, and/or (b) interact, e.g., via oscillatory dynamics. We have addressed this point in a separate paragraph.</p><p>âOf course, the lack of consistent language system engagement in code comprehension does not mean that the mechanisms underlying language and code processing are completely different. [â¦] However, the fact that we observed code-evoked activity primarily in the MD regions indicates that code comprehension does not load on the same neural circuits as language and needs to use domain-general MD circuits instead.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[â¦] I do, however, have some questions regarding the interpretation of the results in mechanistic terms, as detailed below.</p><p>1) Code comprehension versus underlying problem content</p><p>I am generally somewhat sceptical in regard to the use of functional localisers in view of the assumptions that necessarily enter into the definition of a localiser task. In addition, an overlap between the networks supporting two different tasks doesn't imply comparable neural processing mechanisms. With the present study, however, I was impressed by the authors' overall methodological approach. In particular, I found the supplementation of the localiser-based approach with the comparison between code problems and analogous sentence problems rather convincing.</p><p>However, while I agree that computational thinking does not require coding / code comprehension, it is less clear to me what code comprehension involves when it is stripped of the computational thinking aspect. Knowing how to approach a problem algorithmically strikes me as a central aspect of coding. What, then, is being measured by the code problem versus sentence problem comparison? Knowledge of how to implement a certain computational solution within a particular programming language?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right â it will be helpful to provide further clarifications of what it means to process problem content vs. process code in the Discussion section (in addition to the definition we provide in the Introduction). We address the specific points below. Additionally, prompted by the comments from reviewer 1, we added some more information about the putative cognitive processes underlying code comprehension and their possible parallels with language processing (see reviewer 1, points 1 and 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors touch upon this briefly in the Discussion section of the paper, but I am not fully convinced by their arguments. Specifically, they state:</p><p>&quot;The process of code comprehension includes retrieving code-related knowledge from memory and applying it to the problems at hand. This application of task-relevant knowledge plausibly requires attention, working memory, inhibitory control, planning, and general flexible reasoning-cognitive processes long linked to the MD system [â¦].</p><p>Shouldn't all of this also apply (or even apply more strongly) to processing of the underlying problem content rather than to code comprehension per se?</p></disp-quote><p>This paragraph indeed applies to both processes. We have adjusted it below, including examples of processing code vs. problem content:</p><p>âWe found that responses in the MD system were driven both by the processing of problem content (e.g., summing the contents of an array) and by code comprehension (e.g., identifying variables referring to an array and its elements, interpreting a for-loop, realizing that the output of the program is the variable being updated inside the for-loop). [â¦] The overlap was observed within brain regions whose topography grossly resembles that of the MD system.â</p><p>We also added a sentence about processes specific to code comprehension to the next paragraph:</p><p>âFurthermore, given that no regions outside of the MD system showed code-specific responses, it must be the case that code-specific knowledge representations are also <italic>stored</italic> within this system (see Hasson et al., 2015, for a general discussion of the lack of distinction between storage and computing resources in the brain). Such code-specific representations would likely include both knowledge specific to a programming language (e.g. the syntax marking an array in Java vs. Python) and knowledge of programming concepts that are shared across languages (e.g. <italic>for</italic> loops).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>According to the authors, the extent to which code-comprehension-related activity reflects problem content varies between different systems. They conclude that &quot;MD responses to code [â¦] do not exclusively reflect responses to problem content&quot;, while they argue on the basis of their voxel-wise correlation analysis that &quot;the language system's response to code is largely (although not completely) driven by problem content. However, unless I have missed something, the latter analysis was only undertaken for the language system but not for the other systems under examination. Was there a particular reason for this?</p></disp-quote><p>The reason is that, for the MD system, we can make this inference based on the univariate analyses alone, but for the language system we cannot. To clarify this point, we have added an explanation to the section motivating the spatial correlation analysis and clarified our conclusion to highlight that both MD and language systems are sensitive to problem content. Finally, for completeness, we have also added a supplementary figure showing the spatial correlation plot for the MD system.</p><p>âFinally, we investigated whether the responses to Python code problems within the language system were driven by code comprehension specifically or rather by the underlying problem content. [â¦] Thus, in both MD and language systems, response to Python code is driven both by problem content and by code-specific responses.</p><p>Overall, we found that the language system responded to code problems written in Python but not in ScratchJr. Furthermore, Python responses were driven not only by code comprehension, but also by the processing of problem content. We conclude that successful comprehension of computer code can proceed without engaging the language network.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, what are the implications of observing problem content-driven responses within the language system for the authors' conclusion that this system is &quot;functionally conservative&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for drawing our attention to the fact that we do not explicitly discuss the possible explanations of the language systemâs responses to Python code. We have added a paragraph to the Discussion section to fill this gap. It mentions both the content-driven responses and possible verbalization confounds (addressing point 3):</p><p>âMore work is required to determine why the language system showed some activity in response to Python code. [â¦] Further investigations of the role of the language system in computational thinking have the potential to shed light on the exact computations supported by these regions.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, the paper would be strengthened by more clarity in regard to these issues â and specifically a more detailed discussion of what code comprehension may amount to in mechanistic terms when it is stripped of computational thinking.</p><p>2) Implications of using reading for the language localiser task</p><p>Given that reading is also a cultural invention, is it really fair to say that coding is being compared to the &quot;language system&quot; here rather than to the &quot;reading system&quot; (in view of the visual presentation of the language task)? The possible implications of this for the interpretation of the data should be considered.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that we are examining the language system rather than the reading system because (a) we are restricting our analysis to left hemisphere fronto-temporal parcels that encompass language-related activity (cf. the ventral visual areas that specifically support reading; Baker et al., 2007), (b) we are defining the fROIs based on the sentences vs. pronounceable nonwords contrast (both of these conditions involve reading, but only sentences have linguistic structure + meaning). Moreover, these regions have been previously shown to respond to both spoken and written language (Deniz et al., 2019; Fedorenko et al., 2010; Nakai et al., 2020; Regev et al., 2013; Scott et al., 2017), and damage to these regions leads to linguistic difficulties in both reading and listening (for comprehension), and writing and speaking (for production).</p><p>To clarify, we have added more information about the language system in the main text:</p><p>âThese regions respond robustly to linguistic input, both visual and auditory (Deniz et al., 2019; Fedorenko et al., 2010; Nakai et al., 2020; Regev et al., 2013; Scott et al., 2017). However, they show little or no response to tasks in non-linguistic domainsâ</p><p>âThe sentences &gt; nonword-lists contrast isolates processes related to language comprehension (responses evoked by, e.g., visual perception and reading are subtracted out) and has been previously shown to reliably activate left-lateralized fronto-temporal language processing regions, be robust to changes in task and materials, and activate the same regions regardless of whether the materials were presented visually or auditorily (Fedorenko et al., 2010; Mahowald and Fedorenko, 2016; Scott et al., 2017).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Possible effects of verbalisation?</p><p>It appears possible that participants may have internally verbalised code problems â at least to a certain extent (and likely with a considerable degree of inter-individual variability). How might this have affected the results of the present study? Could verbalisation be related to the highly correlated response between code problems and language problems within the language system?</p></disp-quote><p>Internal verbalization is indeed an important confound to keep in mind when trying to dissociate the neural correlates of language and other cognitive functions. It is not a major threat to claims that the language system is <italic>not</italic> engaged in code comprehension, so our main conclusion is not affected by this potential confound. However, the reviewer is right in pointing out that verbalization may underlie the language systemâs responses to Python code. While this is possible, we think such an explanation is unlikely, since ScratchJr problems would have been even easier to verbalize, and yet they do not evoke language responses. We have included a section addressing verbalization in the Discussion; this text is also included in the response to point (1).</p><p>âMore work is required to determine why the language system showed some activity in response to Python code. [â¦] It is also inconsistent with observations that even behaviors that ostensibly require subvocal rehearsal (e.g., mathematical operations) do not engage the language system (see e.g., Amalric and Dehaene, 2019; Fedorenko et al., 2011).â</p></body></sub-article></article>
