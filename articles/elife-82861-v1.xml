Despite decades of investigation, the molecular mechanism of TCR activation is still controversial. One of the leading activation hypotheses is the allosteric model. This model posits that binding of pMHC at the extracellular domain triggers a dynamic change in the transmembrane (TM) domain of the TCR subunits, which leads to signaling at the cytoplasmic side. We sought to test this hypothesis by creating a TM ligand for TCR. Previously we described a method to create a soluble peptide capable of inserting into membranes and binding to the TM domain of the receptor tyrosine kinase EphA2 (Alves et al., eLife, 2018). Here, we show that the approach is generalizable to complex membrane receptors, by designing a TM ligand for TCR. We observed that the designed peptide caused a reduction of Lck phosphorylation of TCR at the CD3ζ subunit in T cells. As a result, in the presence of this peptide inhibitor of TCR (PITCR), the proximal signaling cascade downstream of TCR activation was significantly dampened. Co-localization and co-immunoprecipitation in diisobutylene maleic acid (DIBMA) native nanodiscs confirmed that PITCR was able to bind to the TCR. AlphaFold-Multimer predicted that PITCR binds to the TM region of TCR, where it interacts with the two CD3ζ subunits. Our results additionally indicate that PITCR disrupts the allosteric changes in the compactness of the TM bundle that occur upon TCR activation, lending support to the allosteric TCR activation model. The TCR inhibition achieved by PITCR might be useful to treat inflammatory and autoimmune diseases and to prevent organ transplant rejection, as in these conditions aberrant activation of TCR contributes to disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>peptide</kwd><kwd>membrane biophysics</kwd><kwd>T cell receptor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM140846</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barrera</surname><given-names>Francisco N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35CA242462</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DiMaio</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32AI055403</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Buckley</surname><given-names>Patrick M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation Predoctoral Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE- 2139841</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Buckley</surname><given-names>Patrick M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014455</institution-id><institution>University of Tennessee</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ye</surname><given-names>Yujie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A designer peptide inhibits the T cell receptor through allosteric binding to the transmembrane region.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>T cells are central players in the adaptive immune response. Different types of T cells recognize the presence of pathogenic organisms and cancer cells and orchestrate diverse immune activities intended to kill the damaging cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Courtney et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ganti et al., 2020</xref>). The T cell receptor (TCR) is a protein complex present at the membrane of T cells that allows detection of foreign molecules. The TCR engages with antigen-presenting cells (APCs), where peptide fragments are displayed at the major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chakraborty and Weiss, 2014</xref>). Recognition of pMHC by the TCR triggers an intricate signaling cascade that activates the T cell response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Courtney et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kuhns and Davis, 2008</xref>). In αβ T cells, pMHC binding occurs at the TCRαβ subunits. The TCR complex additionally contains four types of CD3 subunits: ε, γ, δ, and ζ, forming the TCR-CD3 complex (referred herein as TCR). The dominant stoichiometry of TCR is composed of TCRαβ-CD3εγ-CD3εδ-CD3ζζ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Call et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mariuzza et al., 2020</xref>). The CD3 subunits relay the information of the pMHC binding event across the membrane, initiating TCR proximal signaling. The TCR downstream signaling cascade starts by phosphorylation of ITAMs (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs) present in all CD3 subunits, particularly at ζ, which leads to a transient increase in calcium levels in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Au-Yeung et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lo et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Despite decades of effort, there is not yet a clear understanding of how TCR is activated after recognition of pMHC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mariuzza et al., 2020</xref>). A number of different activation modes have been proposed, namely the aggregation/clustering model, the segregation model, the mechanosensing model, and the allosteric model. In this latter functional hypothesis, the signal resulting from binding of pMHC to the extracellular region of the TCRαβ is dynamically transmitted across the transmembrane (TM) region into the ITAMs. While there is growing evidence supporting the allosteric model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schamel et al., 2019</xref>), the molecular mechanism of the allosteric triggering of TCR-CD3 is not clear. Recent reports provide a plausible mechanistic framework on how allosteric changes affect the TM helical bundle: TCR activation involves a quaternary relaxation of the TM helical bundle, whereby in the active state there is a loosening in the interaction between the TM helices of the TCRβ and CDζ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lanz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Prakaash et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Here, we have used a rational design approach to develop a peptide (PITCR) to target the TM region of TCR. PITCR comprises the TM domain of the ζ subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Call et al., 2006</xref>) modified by the addition of acidic residues to convert it to a conditional TM sequence. The PITCR peptide is used to test the allosteric relaxation model, as its binding to the TM region of TCR can be reasonably expected to alter the conformation and/or dynamics/packing of the helical bundle. We observed that PITCR robustly inhibited the activation of the TCR. The results obtained in this work support the allosteric relaxation activation model and provide new mechanistic insights into TCR activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PITCR decreases phosphorylation of the ζ chain upon TCR activation</title><p>We recently reported an approach to transform the isolated TM domains of human receptors into peptides that function as conditional TM sequences: they are highly soluble in water, while they have the ability to insert into the membrane in the TM orientation that allows the peptide to interact laterally with their natural binding partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alves et al., 2018</xref>). We applied this approach to the CD3ζ TM, to generate the PITCR peptide. To this end we introduced glutamic acid residues in positions which are not expected to hinder interactions with other TCR subunits, according to cryoEM structures of the TCR.</p><p>Biophysical experiments in synthetic lipid vesicles showed that the design for PITCR was successful, as it was soluble in aqueous solution and able to insert into membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The TCR at the surface of human Jurkat T cells is activated upon binding of the monoclonal antibody (mAb) OKT3, which has been widely applied to study T cell signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lo et al., 2019</xref>).

We employed super-resolution confocal microscopy with lightning deconvolution to investigate PITCR680 co-localization with TCR, as detected with an anti-CD3 ɛ antibody.

In these cases, PITCR exhibited c-SMAC localization together with TCR-pMHC complexes. Although the image resolution was insufficient to definitively confirm molecular binding between PITCR and the TCR-pMHC complex, their co-localization is suggestive of interaction. We note that PITCR is a partial TCR inhibitor, and thus is not expected to significantly block c-SMAC formation or activation in these primed mouse T cells due to their extreme sensitivity to antigen. Additionally, TM-TM interactions are often highly sensitive to mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">He et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Westerfield et al., 2021</xref>).

It has been recently proposed that TCR activation involves a change in robustness of the TM helical bundle. This allosteric change can be detected by immunoprecipitation after solubilization in DDM, as a loose complex is less resistant to this detergent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lanz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Prakaash et al., 2021</xref>). We optimized this assay for our experimental conditions and investigated the interaction between the ζ chain and rest of the TCR complex.

We observed the targeted bands in the immunoblot results for anti-CD3ɛ-IP, and no bands in the negative control IgG-IP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). These results suggest that our protocol successfully IPs the TCR complex. Once we validated our method, we tested the effect of OKT3 stimulation and PITCR treatment. We observed that OKT3 increased the levels of CD3ζ when compared to both TCRβ2 and CD3ɛ (ζ /β2 and ζ /ɛ) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). These results suggested a more robust ζζ interaction with the rest of complex in response to OKT3 stimulation. Based on this result, we reasoned that PITCR could act by reversing the changes in quaternary robustness that occur in the membrane region upon TCR activation. In agreement with our hypothesis, we observed that the ζ /β2 ratio was decreased when cells were incubated with PITCR and OKT3. However, ζ /ɛ did not change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).

To address this question, we employed AlphaFold-Multimer (AlFoM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Evans et al., 2022</xref>) to predict the binding site of PITCR in the TCR complex. We first assessed if this artificial intelligence program generated robust predictions of the TCR. When we used AlFoM to predict the de novo structure of TCR, we found that it generated a structural model of the TCR that agrees closely (RMSD &lt;1.3 Å) with the cryoEM structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>), after the system was modified, as detailed in the Materials and methods section, to incorporate an experimental constraint, that is, homodimerization of the ζ chains.</p><p>Once we optimized AlFoM for TCR, we generated an AlFoM prediction that included PITCR. In the model, PITCR binds to the TM region of TCR, where it interacts tightly with the two ζ chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Interestingly, AlFoM predicted that PITCR induced a conformational change in both ζ chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). Specifically, the CD3ζ that is closer to CD3εγ – z (εγ) − underwent a maximum displacement of ~8 Å, while ζ (εδ) was displaced a maximum of ~6 Å (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig9sdata1">Figure 9—source data 1</xref>). To evaluate if this effect was specific, we repeated AlFoM in the presence of the inactive PITCRG41P variant. While the control peptide was predicted to bind to a similar site in TCR, it adopted a different orientation and it did not cause the displacement of the ζ chains observed for PITCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig9sdata1">Figure 9—source data 1</xref>). Furthermore, several PITCR residues within ~3 Å of a CD3ζ chain were not predicted to interact in the case of PITCRG41P (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig9sdata1">Figure 9—source data 1</xref>). When we applied AlFoM to a second negative control peptide, pHLIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), we observed similar results to PITCRG41P. pHLIP docked into a similar site in TCR, where it interacted weakly with the ζ chains without significantly affecting their position in TCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). To further evaluate if the ζ chain conformational change was specific to PITCR, we also performed AlFoM with the TYPE7 peptide. TYPE7 is a pH-responsive TM peptide that it is not expected to interact with TCR, since it specifically binds to the TM region of the human EphA2 receptor, causing activation of this receptor tyrosine kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alves et al., 2018</xref>). AlFoM predicted that TYPE7 localizes to a different face of the TCR TM helical bundle and causes minimal displacement of the zeta chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>).

The design of PITCR involved strategically introducing glutamic acid residues into the TM sequence of the human CD3ζ chain, as previously described for TYPE7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alves et al., 2018</xref>). We additionally introduced small and polar residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). PITCR selectively inserted into synthetic lipid vesicles at acidic pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, we observed that TCR activation in Jurkat cells was severely disrupted by acidic pH (data not shown). We therefore performed experiments at physiological pH, where we observed that PITCR efficiently targeted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This observation is not unexpected. The acidity-responsive peptide TYPE7 also targeted cellular membranes at neutral pH because the presence in the membrane of its target receptor shifts the pH responsiveness to cause membrane insertion at pH 7.4. We suggest that a similar situation might occur for TCR. However, we speculate that PITCR will more effectively inhibit T cells that reside and survive in acidic environments. The solubility of PITCR is a useful property to facilitate delivery to diseased tissues. Furthermore, the pH responsiveness of PITCR could potentially be used for targeted therapies in pathologies that are characterized by acidic extracellular environments, including inflammatory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andreev et al., 2007</xref>) and autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marunaka, 2015</xref>), and solid tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheng et al., 2015</xref>). PITCR could also be used to overcome a critical limitation of allogeneic CAR T cell therapy, since TCR inhibition is required to prevent graft-versus-host disease as a side effects of this therapy. The use of PITCR would additionally overcome the risk resulting from genetic manipulation (i.e., by viral gene transfer) of allogeneic T cells before injection into patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Michaux et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>PITCR caused robust inhibition throughout the signaling cascade that is triggered when TCR is activated, from phosphorylation of the ζ chain to calcium influx. Upon TCR ligation, immunoblot analysis showed that PITCR inhibited phosphorylation at multiple sites in Zap70, LAT, SLP76, and PLCγ1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), but not of Lck (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The observed specific inhibition of TCR downstream signaling suggests that PITCR is unlikely to inhibit/activate a broad range of kinases or phosphatases. Rather, PITCR is likely to specifically inhibit TCR triggering, while maintaining Lck association with coreceptors and its phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashouri et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guy et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The results of the immunoprecipitation experiments in the presence of DDM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) showed that upon TCR activation with OKT3, ζζ strengthened its association with the β subunit. We observed that PITCR caused the opposite effect. This result shows that PITCR acts by reversing the allosteric changes in TM compactness induced by OKT3 activation. However, there was an interesting difference in the interaction with the ε subunit, which increased with OKT3 activation but was not altered by PITCR. This observation suggests that not all the TM interactions are equally important with regard to contributing to TCR activation by OKT3. Moreover, our results suggest that the interface between the ζ and β subunits is a target for pharmacological inhibition of the TCR.</p><p>We based the DDM immunoprecipitation assay on a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lanz et al., 2021</xref>), but our protocol contains significant differences. We performed the immunoprecipitation for the Jurkat TCR, while the previous protocol involved IP of an HA-tagged TCR, which was also activated by different means to ours. Probably as a result of these differences, our DDM immunoprecipitation result showed an opposite effect into how TCR activation affected the association of TCRαβ with ζζ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brazin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lanz et al., 2021</xref>). Nevertheless, the two experimental lines of evidence still agree in showing changes in the quaternary stability of the TCR upon activation, and support that this effect could be an important element of the allosteric activation of the TCR. Overall, our data indicate that binding of PITCR to the TM region of TCR results in different allosteric changes to those that occur upon TCR activation, and we propose this effect reduces signal transduction into the intracellular region. However, caution must be exercised when interpreting experiments when TCR is activated with the anti-CD3 antibody OKT3, since we cannot rule out that differences might exist in the allosteric changes caused by activation with OKT3 or pMHC.</p><p>Even though the activation of TCR is an intricate process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chai, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mariuzza et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reinherz, 2019</xref>), significant progress has been made in understanding the conformational changes it entails. For example, in response to TCR engagement, the juxtamembrane domains of the ζζ homodimer have been experimentally reported to switch from a divaricated to a parallel conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). TCR activation additionally involves a conformational change of the ITAMs of CD3ɛ that releases the interaction of basic residues in the intracellular domain of CD3ζ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>) and CD3ɛ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xu et al., 2008</xref>) giving access to Lck for phosphorylation. The AlFoM model identifies the ζ chain TM domains as the binding site of PITCR, and it is plausible that this interaction may hinder the activating conformational change in ζζ. This hypothesis might further explain the observed decrease of ζ/β2 in the PITCR-treated Jurkat cells upon TCR activation.</p><p>The human adaptive immune system contains numerous types of T cells. T cells present a broad repertoire of TCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Davis and Bjorkman, 1988</xref>). For example, in human peripheral blood samples, 10<sup>4</sup> varieties of TCRβs can be found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kidman et al., 2020</xref>), while more than 10<sup>15</sup> combinations of TCRαβ could theoretically be formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Davis and Bjorkman, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wong et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Freeman et al., 2009</xref>). The TCR repertoire plays a critical role in the adaptive immune response, but it also brings challenges to achieve immunosuppression to treat inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Our data show that PITCR interacts with different types of TCRs: it inhibited TCR signaling in Jurkat-wild-type (WT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), and co-localized with the cSMAC structure formed by TCR(AND) in primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Furthermore, PITCR reduced CD69 upregulation in OT1-TCR Jurkat cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These results suggest that PITCR may possess the ability to interact with a broad range of TCR types. We hypothesized that this would be possible because the PITCR design is based on targeting the TM region of the TCR, a sequence that is largely conserved. However, it is important to point out that since we employed different types of T cells for our experiments, our data does not rule out that differences exist in the effect of PITCR on different subtypes of TCR.</p><p>Taken together, we report the rational design of a membrane ligand that inhibits TCR activation. PITCR has potential clinical value to treat autoimmune and inflammatory diseases or to avoid transplant rejection. The strategy used to design PITCR can be applied to develop targeted ligands for other receptors causative of disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines</title><p>Human male leukemic Jurkat T cells (Clone E6-1, TIB-152) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA).

Cells interacted with the bilayer for 20 min before acquiring snapshots to analyze for NFAT activation state. Cells transduced with reporter proteins were identified using the LAT signal in the 488 TIRF channel to minimize bias in which cells were imaged and subsequently analyzed. Single sets of RICM, 488 TIRF, and 561 epifluorescence images were taken for at least 30 fields of view and at least 50 live cells 20–50 min after adding cells to the SLB. Three z-positions were acquired for 561 epifluorescence at 0, 3, and 6 µm above the TIRF plane in order to clearly resolve each cell’s nucleus and the distribution of NFAT-mCherry between the cytoplasm and nucleus. Only cells with substantial contact with the bilayer, as defined by the RICM footprint, were included in the analysis of the fraction of activated cells. Cells were defined as active if the NFAT-mCherry signal in the nucleus was equal to or greater than the signal in the cytoplasm, assessed manually, indicating that the NFAT-mCherry reporter protein was translocating to the nucleus. The fraction of activated cells was determined for each bilayer density and pre-treatment condition and error bars denote the standard error of the mean. The density of pMHC on each bilayer was determined before the addition of cells. Snapshots of pMHC in at least 20 fields of view were taken in the 640 TIRF channel at 20 mW power at the source and 20 ms exposure time. Particles were counted using TrackMate and density was determined as the particle count divided by the total area of all fields of view.

We installed LocalColabFold 1.5.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mirdita et al., 2022</xref>), which uses AlphaFold v2.3.0, on a Yale Center for Research Computing Linux cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Evans et al., 2022</xref>). The random seed used was 0, and amber relaxation was enabled. Predictions of the TCR were generally consistent with the cryoEM structure of TCR, except for one of the CD3ζ chains, which detached from the complex as it lacked the stabilization that results from the native disulfide bond that connects the two ζ chains. In order to force the CD3ζ homodimer to adopt a physiologically relevant conformation, one chain of the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain of GCN4 (amino acid sequence RMKQLEDKVEELLSKNYHLENEVARLKKLVGER) was appended immediately C-terminal to each CD3ζ TM domain, after residue Arg57 (UniProtKB #P20963). CD3ζ residues C-terminal to Arg57 were removed. Polyglycine linkers of two different lengths (four and ten) were used separately to connect the bZIP domains to CD3ζ with optimal alignment. Multiple ranks were created for each prediction, and the highest ranking structure where the peptide approaches the side of the TCR TM domains was selected for further analysis. The predicted IDDT scores for all structures are shown on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s3">Figure 9—figure supplement 3</xref>. Predicted structures were visualized using Mol* and distances between peptide side chain atoms and CD3ζ side chain or backbone atoms were calculated using the measurements tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sehnal et al., 2021</xref>). For displacement distances, the Mol* measurements tool was used to calculate the maximum distance between all corresponding residues in each model after superimposing the TCRα chains. ChimeraX was used to calculate root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pettersen et al., 2021</xref>). The matchmaker command was employed to align pairs of amino acids from corresponding chains and then calculate the RMSD based on the α-carbons. The TCRα chain was used as a consistent reference in RMSD alignments and calculations so that CD3ζ chains could be compared between no peptide and plus peptide structures.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses of experiments were performed using GraphPad Prism 9.4.0. p-Values are provided as exact values. 95% confidence level was used to determine statistically significance in all experiments and ns stands for not significant.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Michael L Dustin (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers agree that the findings are potentially significant but the evidence to support the conclusions is incomplete, as listed in the individual critiques.</p><p>There are 4 issues that should be addressed:</p><p>1. Different cells were used in different measurements and the results are combined in the model. More experiments may be needed to link the results from the different experiments.</p><p>2. Why zeta was selected should be discussed.</p><p>3. Anti-CD3 was used for stimulation in most experiments but the results are discussed in the context of pMHC activation. Does anti-CD3 cause the same allosteric changes as pMHC? If this is an issue, the extrapolation to pMHC should be toned down.</p><p>4. The hypothesis is that the peptide inhibitor, which resembles the CD3 zeta TM domain and might be expected to displace zeta, actually inhibits allosteric activation. This model really needs structural studies (such as NMR) to confirm. However, we recognize that such studies are likely beyond the scope of the paper, or what could be achieved in a 2-3 month period. The paper would be strengthened if additional data or information could be provided regarding the mechanism of interaction between the peptide and the TCR.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The study has some sophisticated elements to address an important question. Limitations include a lack of explanation of the process to arrive at this candidate, the relatively small effect size, and the use of only a single strong control, a peptide with a proline inserted in the place of glycine in one of the already substituted positions. There are a couple of general issues to address and then a number of issues with the data.</p><p>1. There is little indication of why zeta was selected as the model and why a screen of all 6 unique TM domains in the complex was not undertaken to arrive at an optimal PITCR. Even if published already, an explanation of the strategy to generate these conditional TM peptides would be helpful. For example, the strategy seems to involve inserting charged residues into the TM domain and generally decreasing the pI. At which point the membrane insertion is suggested to be dependent on lowering the pH and charge. Given that the TCR zeta TM already had a charge in the TM domain (as do all TCR sTM domains) does this make the TCR more or less challenging to engineer in this way? Given that the charges in the TM domain of the TCR are highly significant for their function, does this make the addition of extra charges problematic if the intention is for them to insert into the complex?</p><p>2. The modelling of the insertion of the PITCR into a space between the natural zeta and the epsilon complexed to the α subunit. What is the basis of this? Is this resulting in a displacement of zeta from interactions with this copy of epsilon TM? Can figure 9 be redrawn to show the TCR TM configuration with and without the PITCR?</p><p>3. The conditions for stimulation appear to be 1 µM OKT3. This is a very high concentration. This might exceed the optimal concentration for cross-linking TCR and may paradoxically be a sub-optimal condition that would be easier to block. Did the authors do a dose-response to assess this?</p><p>4. In Figure 3, the data is not convincing as the PITCR-treated condition in A appears very similar to the OKT3 controls in B and C. So the no peptide response to OKT3 in A looks like an outlier. I don't see how the repeats in D could be so tight with this kind of variability in a single experiment.</p><p>5. In Figure 5 I have a hard time seeing how the co-localization could be so high. Clearly, there are relatively few strong PITCR signals and lots of additional CD3e signals. So you have a high chance of finding TCR within PITCR. It might also be best to focus on plasma membrane signals as you might expect PITCR to insert into intracellular complexes and this might lead to partial complexes without zeta.</p><p>6. In Figure 6, there appears to be some PITCR signal in the supported bilayer. This doesn't surprise me as it's very hard to prevent lipophilic probes from transferring to the bilayer. This suggests to me that the PITCR may be acting just like a membrane probe, which will always show central accumulation in a T cell synapse due to polarization. Therefore, a stronger control is needed. I think a critical control would be a labelled version of the G41P mutated PITCR peptide to ensure that the signal is related to TCR association and not just membrane insertion. It would also be more convincing to show the signal in peripheral microclusters than in the central SMAC, which contains lots of membranes, vesicles, organelles, etc, within the TIRF field. Quantification of the result would also be critical, although results in Figure 5 suggest this will be challenging.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Direct evidence is needed to support the claim that the designed peptides interact with or bind to the TM region of the TCRs. Similarly, evidence should also be provided for mutated peptides that serve as negative controls.</p><p>2. Experiments should be better described, including the rationale for the choices of cells.</p><p>3. Discussion should be included on how to interpret and consolidate findings from different measurements using different T cells, considering the potential differences between the cell types used.</p><p>4. Data or discussion should be included on whether activation by anti-CD3 induces the same allosteric changes as activation by pMHC.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82861.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are 4 issues that should be addressed:</p><p>1.

We initially selected the zeta chain and chose to focus on the peptide generated from its sequence (PITCR) since (i) robust inhibitory effect was observed using multiple techniques, and (ii) it could be used as a model that generates biological insights by allowing us to test the proposed allosteric activation mechanism of TCR. It is possible that peptides derived from other chains would have similar characteristics, but testing this possibility is outside of the scope of this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

The updated manuscript significantly improves on the prediction of the binding site to TCR, which is presented in the new Figure 9 and four supplementary figures (Figure 9 —figure supplementary 1-4).</p><p>Our first step was to apply AlFoM to the full-length TCR in the absence of added peptide. After an optimization step (described in the Methods section), we were able to obtain an AlFoM model that did an outstanding job predicting the structure of the protein complex; the root mean square deviation between the cryo-EM structure and AlFoM prediction was only 1.27 Å (Figure 9 —figure supplementary 1). Once we validated the approach, we applied AlFoM to predict the binding site of PITCR in the receptor. AlFoM predicted that PITCR docks to the two zeta chains of TCR. Importantly, PITCR binding is predicted to displace both zeta chains, particularly ζ(εγ), which shifts up to 8 Å. Such conformational change can be reasonably expected to hinder allosteric changes that occur during TCR activation. To ensure that the data were robust, we repeated the modeling with the negative control mutant peptide PITCRG41P, which does not inhibit signaling (Figure 3). AlFoM predicts that this inactive peptide binds to the same binding site, but it interacts only weakly with TCR -while six amino acids in PITCR interacted with TCR, only two PITCRG41P residues establish contacts, as shown in Figure 9 —figure supplementary 2-. Similar results were obtained with a second negative control peptide, pHLIP. The data showed that neither of the two peptides caused large displacement of the zeta chains. To further benchmark the approach, we included an additional negative control, the TYPE7 peptide, which targets the unrelated EphA2 receptor. AlFoM predicts that this peptide does not bind to TCR and does not cause a conformational change in TCR.</p><p>To summarize, the new AlFoM model not only provides a data-based atomic prediction of the binding site of the peptide in the receptor complex, but additionally provides new insights on the mechanism that underpins the effect of PITCR, namely that it displaces the zeta chain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The conditions for stimulation appear to be 1 µM OKT3. This is a very high concentration. This might exceed the optimal concentration for cross-linking TCR and may paradoxically be a sub-optimal condition that would be easier to block. Did the authors do a dose-response to assess this?</p></disp-quote><p>When we used a lower concentration of OKT3, 0.5 µM, we observed less consistent changes in the phosphorylation of Zap70. As a result, we used the higher concentration, which has been used in prior TCR studies. Regardless of the OKT3 concentration used, this approach still represents a somewhat artificial -although widely used- model of TCR activation. However, we are confident about the inhibitory capacity of PITCR, as it inhibited activation of TCR by peptide presentation in antigen-presenting cells (Figure 4), which is a more physiologically-relevant activation mode.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In Figure 3, the data is not convincing as the PITCR-treated condition in A appears very similar to the OKT3 controls in B and C. So the no peptide response to OKT3 in A looks like an outlier. I don't see how the repeats in D could be so tight with this kind of variability in a single experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment; in retrospect, that data that we presented were not the clearest in representing the effect of PITCR inhibiting calcium signals. We have therefore revised Figure 3 to include a different replicate that more clearly shows the inhibitory role of PITCR.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In Figure 5 I have a hard time seeing how the co-localization could be so high. Clearly, there are relatively few strong PITCR signals and lots of additional CD3e signals. So you have a high chance of finding TCR within PITCR. It might also be best to focus on plasma membrane signals as you might expect PITCR to insert into intracellular complexes and this might lead to partial complexes without zeta.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed an unbiased analysis of co-localization in the confocal images, which yielded very significant co-localization using the Mander’s coefficient (~0.8-0.9), and Pearson’s (~0.4); maybe this second parameter, contained in Figure 5 Figure supplementary 1, is closer to the reviewer expectation of degree of co-localization. While this study can be informative, co-localization on itself is rarely conclusive. However, the combination between co-localization observed in figures 5 and 6 with the co-IP results make for a compelling case of interaction. It would be indeed useful to identify co-localization in the plasma membrane. However, the close opposition of the plasma membrane with endocytic vesicles severely complicates performing this analysis with light microscopy, since both can be located just a few nm away. To avoid providing biased data, we did not try this approach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In Figure 6, there appears to be some PITCR signal in the supported bilayer. This doesn't surprise me as it's very hard to prevent lipophilic probes from transferring to the bilayer. This suggests to me that the PITCR may be acting just like a membrane probe, which will always show central accumulation in a T cell synapse due to polarization. Therefore, a stronger control is needed. I think a critical control would be a labelled version of the G41P mutated PITCR peptide to ensure that the signal is related to TCR association and not just membrane insertion. It would also be more convincing to show the signal in peripheral microclusters than in the central SMAC, which contains lots of membranes, vesicles, organelles, etc, within the TIRF field. Quantification of the result would also be critical, although results in Figure 5 suggest this will be challenging.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not agree that the PITCR that appears to be cSMAC-localized is in the supported bilayer. We are using very low pMHC densities so there is essentially no drag on the bilayer itself to push PITCR to a central location. Furthermore, even PITCR in the plasma membrane would not be expected to be driven centrally. We have shown that pMHC:TCR is uniquely strongly coupled to the cytoskeleton and that even other large molecules (like LFA) are not dragged to the c-SMAC. Please see, for example Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 2009, 106, 31, 12729-12734: “Cluster size regulates protein sorting in the immunological synapse” , where we show that it takes large-scale clustering of other molecules to render them competitive with pMHC:TCR for c-SMAC localization. While we do not claim that our observations are proof, on their own, that PITCR is TCR associated, the c-SMAC localization is a piece of evidence that PITCR is feeling a force that is rather selectively transmitted to the pMHC:TCR complex. We also know, from many of our published experiments, that centralized c-SMAC driving forces do not non-specifically couple to molecules including lipid probes in either the supported membrane or in the T cell membrane itself.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

Data or discussion should be included on whether activation by anti-CD3 induces the same allosteric changes as activation by pMHC.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated the manuscript to discuss that differences might exist in TCR activation by OKT3 and pMHC, as suggested by the reviewer. Figure 8 shows that the levels of co-IP in the presence of detergent are altered by OKT3 activation of TCR. It has recently been established (PMID: 34260912) that this assay allows investigation of allosteric changes that contribute to the activation of TCR. We think that this evidence is supportive of allosterism in TCR activation. Additionally, the TCR proximal signaling is similar when Jurkat T cells are activated by OKT3 and when TCR is activated by pMHC. We can reasonably argue that the peptide acts similarly in both conditions, since the peptide also exerts an inhibitory effect in T cells activated by antigen-presenting cells (Figure 4).</p></body></sub-article></article>
