However, the undesired stress response associated with GA causes delayed recovery and even increased morbidity in the clinic. Here, a core hypothalamic ensemble, corticotropin-releasing hormone neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons), is discovered to play a role in regulating sevoflurane GA. Chemogenetic activation of these neurons delay the induction of and accelerated emergence from sevoflurane GA, whereas chemogenetic inhibition of PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons accelerates induction and delays awakening. Moreover, optogenetic stimulation of PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons induce rapid cortical activation during both the steady and deep sevoflurane GA state with burst-suppression oscillations. Interestingly, chemogenetic inhibition of PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons relieve the sevoflurane GA-elicited stress response (e.g., excessive self-grooming and elevated corticosterone level). These ﬁndings identify PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons modulate states of anesthesia in sevoflurane GA, being a part of anesthesia regulatory network of sevoflurane.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>general anesthesia</kwd><kwd>stress response</kwd><kwd>paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus</kwd><kwd>corticotropin-releasing hormone</kwd><kwd>sevoflurane</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>STI2030-Major Projects-2021ZD0203400</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Zhi-Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key Laboratory Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021YFC2501400</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qu</surname><given-names>Wei-Min</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82020108014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Zhi-Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32070984</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Zhi-Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82071491</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qu</surname><given-names>Wei-Min</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81671317</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Chang-Rui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012543</institution-id><institution>Shanghai Science and Technology Development Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>201409001800</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Zhi-Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Shanghai Municipal Youth Science and Technology Star Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018SHZDZX01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Zhi-Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Discovery of critical brain nodes explaining how sevoflurane-induced general anesthesia works and how the post-anesthesia stress responses appear.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the past century, volatile general anesthetics have gained worldwide popularity in clinics owing to their favorable properties, including a more pleasant odor, higher potency, low toxicity, and rapid recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Robinson and Toledo, 2012</xref>). General anesthesia (GA) is a combination of behavioral and physiological states induced and maintained primarily by pharmacologic agents. As an ideal volatile anesthetic agent, sevoflurane is commonly used for rapid and smooth induction and maintenance for GA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brioni et al., 2017</xref>). However, undesirable excessive stress responses of patients toward sevoflurane GA may result in prolonged rehabilitation and long-term prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marana et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>There is increasing evidence supporting the ‘shared circuits hypothesis’ of GA and sleep, in which different GA drugs may exert hypnotic effect through a shared brain network with wake–sleep regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lydic, 1996</xref>). The paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH) is one of the pivotal wake-promoting nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2021</xref>), which has dense reciprocal connections with numerous neuroanatomical sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2021</xref>) that promote both wakefulness and emergence from inhaled GA, including the lateral septum (LS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2021a</xref>), paraventricular thalamus (PVT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ao et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ren et al., 2018</xref>), and parabrachial nucleus (PB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Luo et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xu et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaur et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Qiu et al., 2016</xref>). The PVH mainly consists of glutamatergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Qin et al., 2018</xref>). Specifically activating PVH glutamatergic neurons using chemogenetic approaches potently enhances the proportion of wakefulness, while lesions of PVH glutamatergic neurons have been shown to lead to serious hypersomnia in both mice and patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2021</xref>). As a subgroup of PVH glutamatergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xu et al., 2020b</xref>), corticotropin-releasing hormone neurons in the PVH (PVH<sup>CRH</sup>) neurons are involved in hypothalamic circuitry underlying stress-induced insomnia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2020</xref>). Mild optogenetic stimulation of PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons evoked persistent wakefulness, which mimicked insomnia elicited by restraint stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2020</xref>). Collectively, this evidence suggests that PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons may play a role in regulating states of consciousness in GA.</p><p>The perioperative stress response is a spectrum of physiological changes occurring throughout different systems in the body, including neuroendocrine, metabolic, immunological, and hematological changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Iwasaki et al., 2015</xref>), as well as behavioral changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jöhr, 2002</xref>). A prolonged stress response may stimulate excess cortisol release, immunosuppression, and an increase in proteolysis, which delays postoperative recovery and even leads to increased morbidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huiku et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Desborough, 2000</xref>). As an important contributing factor of perioperative stress, GA-related stress has been neglected. Accumulated evidence has shown that the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis is actively involved in the surgical stress during and after anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Besnier et al., 2017</xref>). Post-operatively elevated cortisol secretion is considered a part of the surgical stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gögenur et al., 2007</xref>). Distinct from other hypnotic agents, sevoflurane influences the endocrine response by increasing adrenocorticotrophic hormone and cortisol levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mizutani et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kostopanagiotou et al., 2010</xref>). Notably, PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons serve as the initial node of the HPA axis, transducing the neuronal stress signal into a glucocorticoid secretion signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ramot et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesize that PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons may also act as a crucial node modulating the stress response of sevoflurane GA.</p><p>To test our hypothesis, we first performed global screening of active neurons during the post-anesthesia period in the mouse brain. We found that PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons were preferentially active during the post-anesthesia period. After observing changes in calcium signals in PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons during the induction and maintenance of, and recovery from sevoflurane GA along with a robust post-anesthesia stress response, we used chemogenetic and optogenetic manipulations to demonstrate how PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons modulate sevoflurane GA. The results showed that the activation of PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons conferred resistance to sevoflurane GA. Strikingly, inhibition of PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons facilitated induction of sevoflurane GA and alleviated post-anesthesia stress responses. Hence, our findings uncover a vital brain site that modulates the state of consciousness as well as the stress response in sevoflurane GA.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of activated neurons during the post-anesthesia period</title><p>Initially, to gain access to the active neurons during the post-anesthesia period, we subjected the mice to either sevoflurane-oxygen anesthesia (sevo) or oxygen exposure alone (control) for 30 min, followed by examining the whole-brain c-fos expression 3 hr later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Considering the time of the post-anesthesia stress response and the peak time of c-fos protein expression (2–3 hr) after neuronal activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xiu et al., 2014</xref>), a higher level of immunoreactivity to c-fos was observed in the PVH of sevo mice than that in control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref>). Increased immunoreactivity was also observed in the anterior olfactory nucleus, LS, ventromedial preoptic nucleus, locus coeruleus, and nucleus of the solitary tract (Sol) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, the PVH, traditionally considered a classic stress center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Godoy et al., 2018</xref>), was the brain region with the highest relative expression in the sevo group. In contrast, other stress-related brain regions, such as the nucleus accumbens, the ventral tegmental area, and the central amygdaloid nucleus, did not exhibit robust c-fos immunoreactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>). Additionally, the medioventral periolivary nucleus showed decreased c-fos levels after inhalation of sevoflurane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). To confirm specific markers for the c-fos-positive neurons in the PVH, we labeled PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons by injecting a Cre-dependent adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing mCherry into the PVH of CRH-Cre mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1s3sdata1 fig1s3sdata2">Figure 1—figure supplement 3—source data 1 and 2</xref>), and found that mCherry-expressing neurons showed high proportion of CRH immunoreactivity in the PVH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <italic>top panel</italic>). As shown by the colocalization of c-fos- and CRH-immunoreactive neurons, approximately 65.71% of activated PVH neurons were CRH neurons, and approximately 73.91% of CRH neurons in the PVH were activated after exposure to sevoflurane GA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <italic>bottom panel</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

We found that chemogenetic inhibition of PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons ameliorated the short-term memory impairment caused by 30-min exposure to sevoflurane GA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7s1sdata1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>), suggesting PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons may involve in modulating sevoflurane-induced postoperative delirium.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, applying cutting-edge techniques, we found that PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neuronal activity decreased during sevoflurane induction and gradually increased during the emergence phase, followed by hyperactivities with increased stress levels in mice after termination of sevoflurane administration. Furthermore, the modulation of PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons bidirectionally altered the induction and recovery of sevoflurane GA. More importantly, chemogenetic inhibition of this population attenuated the post-anesthesia stress response, supporting the role of PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons in mediating states of consciousness and stress response associated with sevoflurane GA.</p><p>The reversible loss of consciousness induced by sevoflurane GA has been reported to be the result of mutual regulation of numerous nuclei, including several wake-promoting ensembles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bao et al., 2023</xref>), such as dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Song et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gui et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Taylor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kenny et al., 2015</xref>), glutamatergic neurons in the PVT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2022</xref>) and PB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xu et al., 2020a</xref>), and neurons expressing dopamine D1 receptors (D1R) in the NAc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bao et al., 2021</xref>), as well as sleep-promoting populations, such as GABAergic neurons in the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vlasov et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). In our study, we identified a new brain region involved in sevoflurane GA – PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons – the activation of which prolongs the induction time and shortens the emergence time of sevoflurane GA, and modulates the neural inertia of the central nervous system (a tendency to resist behavioral state transitions between conscious and unconscious states) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Friedman et al., 2010</xref>). EEG is used to monitor the depth of anesthesia, and the EEG activity is linked to behavioral states of GA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shalbaf et al., 2015</xref>). Burst-suppression is a phenomenon that occurs at deep anesthesia and is caused by the interaction of the hyperexcitable cortex with a refractory phase after the burst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferron et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nguyen and Postnova, 2021</xref>). This hyperexcitability is favored by reduced inhibition of anesthetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferron et al., 2009</xref>). Notably, photostimulation of PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons effectively elicited cortical activation and behavioral emergence during steady sevoflurane GA state but only caused cortical activation during burst-suppression oscillations. Compared to the potent effect of optical stimulation of NAc D1R neurons during burst-suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bao et al., 2021</xref>), our results indicate that optogenetic activation of PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons is insufficient to reverse the reduced inhibition. Furthermore, similar to the ‘Arousal-Action Model’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu and Dan, 2019</xref>), GA-inhibiting neurons can also be classified into two categories referred to as ‘arousal neurons’ and ‘action neurons.’ Activation of the arousal neurons promotes EEG desynchronization but is insufficient to cause EMG activation during GA. In contrast, stimulation of action neurons causes both EEG desynchronization and behavioral emergence during GA. Based on this model, PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons can be classified as the arousal neurons, while NAc D1R neurons belong to the action neurons. Furthermore, it has been reported that preoperative anxiety increases the anesthetic requirements intraoperatively and prolongs recovery from anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kil et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2021b</xref>), indicating that stress may induce abnormal neuronal activity, which influences the effect of anesthetic drugs and alters the induction of and emergence from GA. Given the vital role of PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons in the stress response regulation, it is also possible that PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons modulate sevoflurane GA through influencing stress levels.</p><p>The postoperative stress response is commonly associated with GA combined with surgery trauma. HPA activation during and after surgeries can result from multiple factors aside from anesthesia, including pain, anxiety, inflammation. Effective modulation of the stress response is of great importance in reducing the incidence of complications. As a predominant presentation of the post-anesthesia stress response, sevoflurane-induced EA is common, with an incidence of up to 80% in clinical reports, and is characterized by hyperactivity, confusion, delirium, and emotional agitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dahmani et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lim et al., 2016</xref>). Such responses pose the risk of neurotoxicity, delayed neurological development, and even cognitive deficits. However, a broad consensus on animal models mimicking this post-anesthesia stress response has yet to be established. Stress often leads to grooming and other repetitive behaviors, such as digging and circling in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Troisi, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Langen et al., 2011</xref>), and self-grooming is frequently observed and believed to contribute to post-stress de-arousal with adaptive value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Song et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kalueff et al., 2016</xref>). In this study, we observed increased self-grooming and a series of other stress-related behavioral parameters during the post-anesthesia period, combined with an elevated serum CORT level, which may indicate the high stress level and support these measures as indicators of post-anesthesia stress responses in animal models. Of note, the hyperactivity of PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons and behavior (e.g., excessive self-grooming) in mice could partly recapitulate the observed agitation and underlying mechanisms during the emergence from sevoflurane GA in patients. Our findings may further help us to understand the underlying mechanism related to post-anesthesia stress responses observed in patients, leading to the development of strategies to prevent or treat the post-anesthesia stress response. However, considering the differences in species, duration of exposure, and surgical intensity could account for the observed discrepancies, our results may not directly translate to human surgical procedures.</p><p>Of particular note, the PVH is canonically viewed as the key endocrine controller of the stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Denver, 2009</xref>) and complex behavior after stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bressers et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Füzesi et al., 2016</xref>), including self-grooming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kruk et al., 1998</xref>). A recent study found that this role of the PVH was instructed by glutamatergic inputs from the lateral hypothalamus (LH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mangieri et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, multiple lines of evidence have also demonstrated that PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons are not only responsible for launching the endocrine component of the mammalian stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Denver, 2009</xref>) but also for orchestrating post-stress behavior, including grooming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Füzesi et al., 2016</xref>). For example, empirical evidence proposed that the ‘PVH<sup>CRH</sup>-the caudal part of the spinal trigeminal nucleus-spinal’ descending pathway translates stress-related stimuli into motor actions of self-grooming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xie et al., 2022</xref>). In our study, we observed elevated PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neuronal activity along with excessive self-grooming during the post-anesthesia period. Inspiringly, chemogenetic inhibition of PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons significantly alleviated these responses, underscoring the crucial role of PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons in sevoflurane GA-induced self-grooming. Across the whole GA process, PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons were greatly suppressed under sevoflurane GA but were recruited to control stress responses with rebound excitation after cessation of sevoflurane GA, and therefore evoked self-grooming and other behaviors to facilitate the reduction in stress level. Therefore, our data contribute to an emerging view that PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons also play a key role in mediating the post-anesthesia stress responses.</p><p>Interestingly, we found that sevoflurane GA-induced self-grooming exhibited exclusive features different from other grooming models, and the LH, which provides glutamatergic inputs to the PVH in grooming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mangieri et al., 2018</xref>), was not activated during the post-anesthesia period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>), implying the existence of other functional pathways. PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons received direct long-range GABAergic inputs from multiple brain regions, such as the LS, raphe magnus nucleus, and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yuan et al., 2019</xref>). Meanwhile, it has been demonstrated that the neuronal activity of the suprachiasmatic nucleus negatively regulates the activity of PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons by GABA release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ono et al., 2020</xref>). This evidence provides a possible explanation for the hyperactivity of PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons in the post-anesthesia period, whereby sevoflurane GA suppresses activity of these brain areas, and therefore disinhibits PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons by decreasing GABAergic inputs. Further research is required to fully understand this mechanism.</p><p>In conclusion, we have identified a significant node modulating the effect of sevoflurane GA in both during- and post-anesthesia stages: the PVH<sup>CRH</sup> neurons. These neurons play a potent role in modulating anesthesia states in sevoflurane GA and are part of sevoflurane’s anesthesia regulatory network.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Wild-type C57BL/6 and CD-1 mice were obtained from the Experimental Animal Management Department, Institute of Family Planning Science, Shanghai. Mice were group-housed in a soundproof room, with an ambient temperature of 22 ± 0.5°C and a relative humidity of 55% ± 5%. The mice were provided with adequate amounts of food and water, and were housed under an automatic 12 hr light/12 hr dark cycle (illumination intensity 100 lux, lights on at 07:00). Adult C57BL/6 male mice (CRH-Cre and wild-type mice, 8–10 weeks old, 20–30 g) were used for all experiments; adult CD-1 male mice (4–6 months old, 40–50 g) were used for the direct attack-induced model. All behavioral experiments were performed during the daytime (7:00–19:00). Animals were randomly divided into the experimental groups and control group. CRH-Cre mice were used in calcium fiber photometry recordings, chemogenetic and optogenetic manipulations, and wild-type mice were used for the identification of active neurons and the characterization of self-grooming during the post-anesthesia period. All experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Fudan University (certificate number: 20160225-073). All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and discomfort and to reduce the number of animals required to produce reliable scientific data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Surgery</title><p>Mice were anesthetized with 2% pentobarbital sodium (45 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection and placed on a stereotaxic frame (RWD Life Science, China).

During this experiment, mice were first placed in a cylindrical acrylic glass chamber connected to a sevoflurane vaporizer (VP 300; Beijing Aeonmed, China). The concentration of sevoflurane was monitored by an anesthesia monitor (Vamos, Drager, China) connected to the chamber. In the dose-dependent experiments, after recording the baseline signals of awake mice during a 20-min adaption period, different concentrations of sevoflurane (1.2%, 1.6%, or 2.0%) were continuously delivered by 1.5 l/min flow of 100% oxygen for 20 min. The group inhaling 100% oxygen was set as the control group. As for the observation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals during the post-anesthesia period, the baseline signals of awake mice were recorded for 30 min before 30 min delivery of 1.6% of sevoflurane.

To determine the sensitivity of sevoflurane, mice experienced stepwise increasing exposure to sevoflurane, initially delivered at 1.2% and increased every 10 min in increments of 0.1%. The righting reflex of each animal was assessed after 10 min at each concentration, ensuring both brain and chamber balance. If a mouse successfully returned to the prone position twice in a row, then it was considered to have a complete righting reflex. Otherwise, the righting reflex was determined not to be present. The induction and emergence experiments were conducted as follows. Each mouse was intraperitoneally administered saline or CNO (3 mg/kg, i.p.) 1 hr before the experiment. Next, 30 min 2% sevoflurane was delivered with 1.5 l/min 100% oxygen after 20-min habituation. Following exposure to 2% sevoflurane for 30 min, the mouse was removed from the glass chamber and kept in the supine position in the indoor air. The time to induction was defined as the interval between the time when the mouse was put into the glass chamber full of 2% sevoflurane to the time when the mice exhibited LORR. The time to emergence was defined as the interval between the time when the mouse was removed from the chamber to the time when it regained the righting reflex with all four paws touching the floor.

In brief, a baseline EEG/EMG was recorded after habituation in the acrylic glass chamber for 10 min. Next, the sevoflurane vapor was turned on and the mice were subjected to sevoflurane with an initial 2.5% sevoflurane for 20 min and then placed in a supine position and then the sevoflurane concentration was reduced to 1.4%. If the animals showed any signs of LORR, the concentration was increased by 0.1% until the LORR maintained at a constant concentration for at least 20 min. Photostimulation (5 ms pulses at 30 Hz for 60 s) was applied through a laser stimulator (SEN-7103, Nihon Kohden, Japan) when EEG patterns showed characteristics of steady sevoflurane GA state (low-frequency, high-amplitude activity) for at least 5 min. As for the burst-suppression period, a baseline EEG/EMG was recorded during habituation in the acrylic glass chamber for 10 min. Next, we delivered 2% sevoflurane with pure oxygen at a speed of 1.5 l/min for induction initially. After entering a continuous and steady burst-suppression oscillation mode for at least 5 min, we applied blue-light stimulation (5 ms pulses at 30 Hz) for 60 s. A power meter (PM10, Coherent, USA) was used to measure the power intensity of the blue light before experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>EEG/EMG analysis</title><p>SleepSign software (Kissei Comtec, Japan) was used to record and analyze all EEG/EMG signals. EEG/EMG signals were magnified and filtered (EEG, 0.5–30 Hz; EMG, 20–200 Hz), and were digitized at a 128 Hz sampling rate. Subsequently, fast-Fourier transformation was used to calculate the EEG power spectra for successive 4 s epochs in the frequency range of 0–25 Hz. EEG frequency bands (delta, 0.5–4.0 Hz; theta, 4.0–10 Hz; alpha, 10–15 Hz; beta, 15–25 Hz) were established in view of previous research, and relative variations in aggregate power were calculated. In the optogenetic experiments during steady sevoflurane GA state, a total of 120 s EEG signals were analyzed (before and during acute light stimulation). As for optogenetic tests during burst-suppression oscillations, a total of EEG signals from 180 s epochs were calculated (before, during, and after acute light stimulation). The BSR was calculated by the percentage of suppression in the time spans of 1 min before, during, or after photostimulation. Raw EEG data recorded by SleepSign software were converted to text format for further analysis of BSR using MATLAB as demonstrated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bao et al., 2021</xref>). The minimum duration of burst and suppression periods was set to 0.5 s.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>The immunohistochemistry test was conducted according to the previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Luo et al., 2018a</xref>). To confirm the correct injection sites, after finishing all related experiments, each mouse was anesthetized with chloral hydrate (360 mg/kg) and then perfused intracardially with 30 ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 30 ml 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). The brains of the mice were removed and postfixed in 4% PFA overnight and then incubated in 30% sucrose phosphate buffer at 4°C until they sank. Coronal sections (30 μm) were cut on a freezing microtome (CM1950, Leica, Germany), and the fluorescence of injection sites was examined to locate the PVH according to the histology atlas of Paxinos and Franklin (2001, The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates 2nd edn [San Diego, CA: Academic]) using a microscope (Fluoview 1200, Olympus, Japan).</p><p>For immunostaining of c-fos, mice were sacrificed at set time according to different experiments and perfused with PBS followed by 4% PFA in 0.1 M phosphate buffer. The brain was then dissected and fixed in 4% PFA at 4°C overnight. Fixed samples were sectioned into 30 μm coronal sections using a freezing microtome (CM1950, Leica, Germany). Brain sections were washed in PBS three times (5 min each time) and incubated for 48 hr with primary antibody in PBST (containing 0.3% Triton X-100) on a 4°C agitator using rabbit anti-c-fos (1:8000, Abcam, USA) antibody, or rabbit anti-CRF (1:800, Immunostar 20084, bilateral intracerebroventricular infusion of colchicine (total 20 μg in 500 nl saline, coordinates from Bregma: AP = –0.22 mm, ML = ±1.15 mm, DV = 2.06 mm) 24 hr before perfusion) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antoni et al., 1983</xref>). Next, brain sections were washed in PBS three times (5 min each time) and incubated with a donkey-anti-rabbit Alexa488 secondary antibody (1:1000, Abcam, USA) in PBST for 2 hr at room temperature. Finally, the sections were mounted on glass slides, dried, dehydrated, and cover-slipped. Fluorescence images were collected with an Olympus VS120 automated slide scanner. Only data from mice in whom the AAV infection and optical fiber location were confirmed were included. The number of animals that were excluded because of poor virus expression or misplaced optical fibers are as follow: jGCaMP7b, <italic>n</italic> = 5; hM3Dq, <italic>n</italic> = 7; hM4Di, <italic>n</italic> = 10; mCherry, <italic>n</italic> = 5; ChR2, <italic>n</italic> = 12; wrong optical fiber location, <italic>n</italic> = 12.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Behavior experiments</title><sec id="s4-8-1"><title>Righting reﬂex assessment</title><p>GA was defined by the loss of the righting reflex, a widely used surrogate measure in rodents. All mice were placed in the air-tight, temperature-controlled, 200 ml cylindrical chambers with 100% oxygen flowing at a speed of 1.5 l/min for 10 min for the sake of habitation. To determine the EC<sub>50</sub> of LORR, the initial concentration of sevoflurane was set at 1.0%, and the concentrations were increased by 0.1% every 15 min. During the last 2 min of every 15 min, the chambers were rotated 180° to observe whether the righting reflex of the mice was present, and the number of animals that lost their righting reflex at each concentration was recorded. To determine the EC<sub>50</sub> of RORR, all the mice were anesthetized with 2.0% sevoflurane for 30 min, and the concentration was decreased in decrements of 0.1% until all the mice had recovered their righting reflex. The number of mice that had recovered their righting reflex at each concentration was counted. Mice experienced stepwise increasing and diminishing exposure to sevoflurane, with 15 min taken at each step, during which and an electric blanket was used to maintain the chamber temperature at 36°C. The righting reflex of each animal was assessed after 15 min at each concentration, ensuring both brain and chamber balance. If a mouse successfully returned to the prone position twice in a row, then it was considered to have a complete righting reflex. Otherwise, the righting reflex was determined not to be present.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Arousal scoring</title><p>Arousal responses were scored according to the methods of previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bao et al., 2021</xref>). Spontaneous movements of the limbs, head, and tail were scored by the movements’ intensity as three levels: absent (0), mild (1), or moderate (2). Righting was scored as 0 if the mouse remained LORR, and 2 if the mouse recovered its righting reflex. Walking was scored as follows: 0 = no further movements; 1 = crawled without raising the abdomen off the chamber bottom; and 2 = walked with all four paws and the abdomen off the chamber bottom. The total score for each mouse was defined as the sum of all categories during the photostimulation period.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Assessment of self-grooming</title><p>The behavior of the animals was recorded in a test chamber (cylindrical acrylic glass, 15 cm diameter, 20 cm height) in a quiet and sound-proof room by a video camera (HIKVISION, US). Mice were habituated in the test chamber for 20 min before testing. For the spontaneous grooming model, the mouse was placed into the test chamber and spontaneous activities were recorded over a 20-min period. For restraint stress-induced grooming, the mouse was restrained in a stainless-steel tube (5 cm diameter, 10 cm length) for 20 min and then placed immediately into the test chamber for 20 min video recording. For direct attack-induced grooming, a C57BL/6 mouse was placed directly into the home cage of a larger and aggressive CD-1 mouse for 5 min with the aggressor present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Golden et al., 2011</xref>). Immediately afterward, the C57BL/6 mouse was placed in the test chamber, and its behavior was recorded for 20 min. For water spray-induced grooming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mangieri et al., 2018</xref>), the mouse was sprayed with a spray bottle prefilled with sterile water (25°C) directed to the face, belly, and back, before placing the mouse in the test chamber for 20 min of video recording. For swimming-induced grooming, the mouse was placed into a plastic cylinder filled with water at 22–26°C and allowed them to freely swim for 5 min. Excess water was then removed before the animal was placed into the test chamber for video recording for 20 min.</p><p>The self-grooming behavior was manually quantified by observers blinded to the experimental conditions. Self-grooming was defined as when the mouse licked its own body parts, including the paws legs, tail, and genitals, or stroked its own nose, eyes, head, body, with the front paws (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kalueff et al., 2016</xref>). An interruption of 6 s or more separated two individual bouts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kalueff et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kalueff and Tuohimaa, 2005</xref>). The number of grooming bouts, the mean bout duration, and the total grooming time spent in the test period were evaluated. For the analysis of the patterns and microstructures of grooming behavior, the time spent on grooming different body parts and the transitions between different phases were calculated based on previous protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kalueff et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kalueff and Tuohimaa, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mu et al., 2020</xref>). The following scaling systems based on grooming stages were used: no grooming (0), paw licking (1), nose/face/head wash (2), body grooming (3), leg licking (4), and tail/genitals grooming (5). Correct transitions were defined as the following progressive transitions between the grooming stages: 0–1, 1–2, 2–3, 3–4, 4–5, and 5–0. Incorrect transitions were characterized by skipped (e.g., 0–5, 1–5) or reversed (e.g., 3–2, 4–1, 5–2) stages. Interrupted grooming bout was considered if at least one interruption was recorded during the transition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Open field test</title><p>The OFT is one of the most widely used behavioral tests to evaluate anxiety-like behavior in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mu et al., 2020</xref>). In the OFT, a camera was used to record the movement of mice in a 50 × 50 cm area. The middle square (30 × 30 cm) of the box was considered the central area. The entire device was surrounded by 40 cm high walls and its inner surface was painted black. In a quiet and sound-proof room with dim light (≈20 lx), a mouse was placed in the middle of the arena and allowed to move freely for 10 min. An automatic video tracking system (Tracking Master V3.0, Shanghai Vanbi Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd) was used to record the ambulatory activity of the mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhong et al., 2022</xref>). After each test, the apparatus was wiped clean with 75% alcohol to avoid the influence of the previous mouse. The total and central travel distances were quantified.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Elevated plus-maze test</title><p>The EPM test is commonly used to measure anxiety-like behavior in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mu et al., 2020</xref>). The device consists of two open arms (20 × 6 × 0.5 cm) and two closed arms (20 × 6 × 30 cm), which lie across each other with an intersection part of 6 × 6 × 0.5 cm. The open arms have insignificant walls (0.5 cm) to reduce the frequency of falls, whereas the closed arms are surrounded by high walls (30 cm). The whole device was 70 cm above the floor. The camera was placed above the EPM in the behavioral test room. Each mouse was placed in the behavioral testing room 1 hr before the test for adaption. During the test, the mouse was placed in the intersection area of the maze, facing an open arm. After exploring the maze freely for 5 min, the mouse was removed from the EPM and returned to its home cage. The maze was cleaned with a spray bottle and paper towel before testing the next mouse. An automatic video tracking system (Tracking Master V3.0, Shanghai Vanbi Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd) was used to analyze the movement data of the mouse. An entry was defined when half of the mouse’s body entered an area.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Y-maze test</title><p>The Y-maze test for evaluating learned behavior was conducted as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xu et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Peng et al., 2016</xref>). Initially, the test mouse was placed at the start of one arm, facing away from the center, and allowed to explore the apparatus freely for 5 min while another arm was blocked. After this period, the mouse was returned to its home cage. Subsequently, the block was removed, and the mouse was allowed to explore all arms freely for another 5 min. The discrimination index, which is the time spent in the novel arm divided by the time spent in both arms, was used to assess spatial memory.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Novel object recognition test</title><p>The novel object recognition test was conducted in the same arena as the OFT. During the habituation session, the test mouse was placed in the arena to explore for 10 min. Following habituation, two objects of similar size but different shape and color were placed in opposite corners of the arena. The test mouse was then placed in the center and allowed to explore for 10 min. After this exploration, all mice were exposed to 2.0% sevoflurane for 30 min and then returned to their home cages. Thirty minutes later, saline or CNO was injected. One hour after the injection, one of the objects was replaced, and the same test mouse was allowed to explore for another 10 min. Interactions with each object (defined as sniffing and/or having the head within 2–3 cm of the object) were recorded for analysis. Mice that did not reach a minimum of 20 s of exploration time for both objects during either of the two 10-min trials were excluded from analysis, as it could not be confirmed that they spent enough time exploring to learn or discriminate between the objects. The time spent interacting with the novel object, divided by the time spent interacting with both objects, was used to describe the preference for the novel object.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Measurement of CRH and CORT levels</title><p>Mice were decapitated immediately at 1 hr after the mice received either saline or CNO (3 mg/kg, C2041, LKT) treatment, respectively.

PVHCRH neurons showed elevated calcium activity during the post-anesthesia period. Optogenetic activation of these PVHCRH neurons during sevoflurane anesthesia shifts the EEG from burst-suppression to a seemingly activated state (an apparent arousal effect), although without a behavioral correlate. Chemogenetic activation of the PVHCRH neurons delays sevoflurane-induced loss of righting reflex (another apparent arousal effect). On the other hand, chemogenetic inhibition of PVHCRH neurons delays recovery of righting reflex and decreases sevoflurane-induced stress (an apparent decrease in the arousal effect). The authors conclude that PVHCRH neurons &quot;integrate&quot; sevoflurane-induced anesthesia and stress. The authors also claim that their findings show that sevoflurane itself produces a post-anesthesia stress response that is independent of any surgical trauma, such as an incision. In its revised form, the article does not achieve its intended goal and will not have impact on the clinical practice of anesthesiology nor on anesthesiology research.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The manuscript uses targeted manipulation of the PVHCRH neurons with state-of-the-art methods and is technically sound. Also, the number of experiments is substantial.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The most significant weaknesses remain: (a) overinterpretation of the significance of their findings (b) the failure to use another anesthetic as a control, (c) a failure to compellingly link their post-sevoflurane measures in mice to anything measured in humans, and (d) limitations in the novelty of the findings. These weaknesses are related to the primary concerns described below:</p><p>Concerns about the primary conclusion that PVHCRH neurons integrate the anesthetic effects and post-anesthesia stress response of sevoflurane GA:</p><p>It is important to compare the effects of sevoflurane with at least one other inhaled ether anesthetic as one step towards elevating the impact of this paper to the level required for a journal such as eLife. Isoflurane, desflurane, and enflurane are ether anesthetics that are very similar to each other, as well as being similar to sevoflurane. For example, one study cited by the authors (Marana et al. 2013) concludes that there is weak evidence for differences in stress-related hormones between sevoflurane and desflurane, with lower levels of cortisol and ACTH observed during the desflurane intraoperative period. It is important to determine whether desflurane activates PVHCRH neurons in the post-anesthesia period, and whether this is accompanied by excess grooming in the mice because this will distinguish whether the effects of sevoflurane generalize to other inhaled anesthestics, or, alternatively, relate to unique idiosyncratic properties of this gas that may not be a part of its anesthetic properties.</p><p>Concerns about the clinical relevance of the experiments:</p><p>In anesthesiology practice, perioperative stress observed in patients is more commonly related to the trauma of the surgical intervention, with inadequate levels of antinociception or unconsciousness intraoperatively and/or poor post-operative pain control. The authors seem to be suggesting that the sevoflurane itself is causing stress because their mice receive sevoflurane but no invasive procedures, but there is no evidence of sevoflurane inducing stress in human patients. It is important to know whether sevoflurane effectively produces behavioral stress in the recovery room in patients that could be related to the putative stress response (excess grooming) observed in mice. For example, in surgeries or procedures which required only a brief period of unconsciousness that could be achieved by administering sevoflurane alone (comparable to the 30 min administered to the mice), is there clinical evidence of post-operative stress? It is also important to describe a rationale for using a 30 min sevoflurane exposure. What proportion of human surgeries using sevoflurane use exposure times that are comparable to this?</p><p>It is the experience of one of the reviewers that human patients who receive sevoflurane as the primary anesthetic do not wake up more stressed than if they had had one of the other GABAergic anesthetics. If there were signs of stress upon emergence (increased heart rate, blood pressure, thrashing movements) from general anesthesia, this would be treated immediately. The most likely cause of post-operative stress behaviors in humans is probably inadequate anti-nociception during the procedure, which translates into inadequate post-op analgesia and likely delirium. It is the case that children receiving sevoflurane do have a higher likelihood of post-operative delirium. Perhaps the authors' studies address a mechanism for delirium associated with sevoflurane, but this is barely mentioned. Delirium seems likely to be the closest clinical phenomenon to what was studied. As noted by the Besnier et al (2017) article cited by the authors, surgery can elevate postoperative glucocorticoid stress hormones, but it generally correlates with the intensity of the surgical procedure. Besnier et al also note the elevation of glucocorticoids is generally considered to be adaptive. Thus, reducing glucocorticoids during surgery with sevoflurane may hamper recovery, especially as it relates to tissue damage, which was not measured or considered here. This paper only considers glucocorticoid release as a negative factor, which causes &quot;immunosuppression&quot;, &quot;proteolysis&quot;, and &quot;delays postoperative recovery and...leads to increased morbidity&quot;.</p><p>It is also the case that there are explicit published findings showing that mild and moderate surgical procedures in children receiving sevoflurane (which might be the closest human proxy to the brief 30 minute sevoflurane exposure used here) do not have elevated cortisol (Taylor et al, J Clin Endocrinol Metab, 2013). This again raises the question of whether the enhanced grooming or elevated corticosterone observed in the mice here has any relevance to humans.</p><p>Concerns about the novelty of the findings:</p><p>The key finding here is that CRH neurons mediate measures of arousal, and arousal modulates sevoflurane anesthesia induction and recovery. However, CRH is associated with arousal in numerous studies. In fact, the authors' own work, published in eLife in 2021, showed that stimulating the hypothalamic CRH cells lead to arousal and their inhibition promoted hypersomnia. In both papers the authors use fos expression in CRH cells during a specific event to implicate the cells, then manipulate them and measure EEG responses. In the previous work, the cells were active during wakefulness; here- they were active in the awake state the follows anesthesia (Figure 1). Thus, the findings in the current work are incremental and not particularly impactful. Claims like &quot;Here, a core hypothalamic ensemble, corticotropin-releasing hormone neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, is discovered&quot; are overstated. PVHCRH cell populations were discovered in the 1980s. Suggesting that it is novel to identify that hypothalamic CRH cells regulate post-anesthesia stress is unfounded as well: this PVH population has been shown over four decades to regulate a plethora of different responses to stress. Anesthesia stress is no different. Their role in arousal is not being discovered in this paper. Even their role in grooming is not discovered in this paper.</p><p>The activation of CRH cells in PVH has already been shown to result in grooming by Jaideep Bains (a paper cited by the authors). Thus, the involvement of these cells in this behavior is not surprising. The authors perform elaborate manipulations of CRH cells and numerous analyses of grooming and related behaviors. For example, they compare grooming and paw licking after anesthesia with those after other stressors such as forced swim, spraying mice with water, physical attack and restraint. The authors have identified a behavioral phenomenon in a rodent model that does not have a clear correlation with a behavior state observed in humans during the use of sevoflurane as part of an anesthetic regimen. The grooming behaviors are not a model of the emergence delirium or the cognitive dysfunction observed commonly in patients receiving sevoflurane for general anesthesia. Emergence delirium is commonly seen in children after sevoflurane is used as part of general anesthesia and cognitive dysfunction is commonly observed in adults-particularly the elderly -- following general anesthesia.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.90191.4.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Shan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Fudan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Shanghai</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Lu</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Fudan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Shanghai</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Qu</surname><given-names>Wei-Min</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Fudan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Shanghai</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Zhi-Li</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Fudan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Shanghai</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Chang-Rui</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Fudan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Shanghai</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public reviews</bold></p><p>This study describes a group of CRH-releasing neurons, located in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, which, in mice, affects both the state of sevoflurane anesthesia and a grooming behavior observed after it. PVHCRH neurons showed elevated calcium activity during the post-anesthesia period. Optogenetic activation of these PVHCRH neurons during sevoflurane anesthesia shifts the EEG from burst-suppression to a seemingly activated state (an apparent arousal effect), although without a behavioral correlate. Chemogenetic activation of the PVHCRH neurons delays sevoflurane-induced loss of righting reflex (another apparent arousal effect). On the other hand, chemogenetic inhibition of PVHCRH neurons delays recovery of righting reflex and decreases sevoflurane-induced stress (an apparent decrease in the arousal effect). The authors conclude that PVHCRH neurons &quot;integrate&quot; sevoflurane-induced anesthesia and stress. The authors also claim that their findings show that sevoflurane itself produces a post-anesthesia stress response that is independent of any surgical trauma, such as an incision. In its revised form, the article does not achieve its intended goal and will not have impact on the clinical practice of anesthesiology nor on anesthesiology research.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the reviews. Please see our responses to the following comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The most significant weaknesses remain:</p><p>a) overinterpretation of the significance of their findings</p><p>b) the failure to use another anesthetic as a control,</p><p>c) a failure to compellingly link their post-sevoflurane measures in mice to anything measured in humans, and</p><p>d) limitations in the novelty of the findings. These weaknesses are related to the primary concerns described below:</p><p>Concerns about the primary conclusion that PVHCRH neurons integrate the anesthetic effects and post-anesthesia stress response of sevoflurane GA</p><p>(1) After revision, their remain multiple places where it is claimed that PVHCRH neurons mediate the anesthetic effects of sevoflurane (impact statement: we explain &quot;how sevoflurane-induced general anesthesia works...&quot;; introduction: &quot;the neuronal mechanisms that mediate the anesthetic effects...of sevoflurane GA remain poorly understood&quot; and &quot;PVHCRH neurons may act as a crucial node integrating the anesthetic effect and stress response of sevoflurane&quot;).The manuscript simply does not support these statements. The authors show that a short duration exposure to sevoflurane inhibits PVHCRH neurons, but this is followed by hyperexcitability of these neurons for a short period after anesthesia is terminated. They show that the induction and recovery from sevoflurane anesthesia can be modulated by PVHCRH neuronal activity, most likely through changes in brain state (measured by EEG). They also show that PVHCRH neuronal activity modulates corticosterone levels and grooming behavior observed post-anesthesia (which the authors argue are two stress responses).These two things (effects during anesthesia and effects post-anesthesia)may be mechanistically unrelated to each other. None of these observations relate to the primary mechanism of action for sevoflurane. All claims relating to &quot;anesthetic effects&quot; should be removed. Even the term &quot;integration&quot; seems wrong-it implies the PVH is combining information about the anesthetic effect and post-anesthesia stress responses.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have removed all claims related to ‘anesthetic effects’ or ‘integration’. Please see the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) lt is important to compare the effects of sevoflurane with at least one other inhaled ether anesthetic as one step towards elevating the impact of this paper to the level required for a journal such as eLife. Isoflurane, desflurane, and enflurane are ether anesthetics that are very similar to each other, as well as being similar to sevoflurane. For example, one study cited by the authors (Marana et al.2013) concludes that there is weak evidence for differences in stress-related hormones between sevoflurane and desflurane, with lower levels of cortisol and ACTH observed during the desflurane intraoperative period. It is important to determine whether desflurane activates PVHCRH neurons in the post-anesthesia period, and whether this is accompanied by excess grooming in the mice, because this will distinguish whether the effects of sevoflurane generalize to other inhaled anesthestics, or, alternatively, relate to unique idiosyncratic properties of this gas that may not be a part of its anesthetic properties.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your insightful comments and suggestions. Regarding your request for additional experiments, we acknowledge the value they could add to our study. However, investigating whether the effects of sevoflurane generalize to other inhaled anesthetics is beyond the scope of our current study. There is evidence indicating the prevalence of anesthetic stress caused by inhaled ether anesthetics1,2. The post-anesthesia stress-related behaviors caused by sevoflurane administration are reminiscent of delirium observed clinically. Notably, studies have shown that the use of desflurane for maintenance of anesthesia did not significantly affect the incidence or duration of delirium compared to sevoflurane administration3. This suggests that our observations likely represent a generalized response to inhaled ether anesthetic rather than being specific to sevoflurane.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Concerns about the clinical relevance of the experiments</p><p>In anesthesiology practice, perioperative stress observed in patients is more commonly related to the trauma of the surgical intervention, with inadequate levels of antinociception or unconsciousness intraoperatively and/or poor post-operative pain control. The authors seem to be suggesting that the sevoflurane itself is causing stress because their mice receive sevoflurane but no invasive procedures, but there is no evidence of sevoflurane inducing stress in human patients. It is important to know whether sevoflurane effectively produces behavioral stress in the recovery room in patients that could be related to the putative stress response (excess grooming) observed in mice. For example, in surgeries or procedures which required only a brief period of unconsciousness that could be achieved by administering sevoflurane alone (comparable to the 30 min administered to the mice), is there clinical evidence of post-operative stress? It is also important to describe a rationale for using a 30 min sevoflurane exposure. What proportion of human surgeries using sevoflurane use exposure times that are comparable to this?</p><p>It is also the case that there are explicit published findings showing that mild and moderate surgical procedures in children receiving sevoflurane (which might be the closest human proxy to the brief 30 minutes sevoflurane exposure used here) do not have elevated cortisol (Taylor et al, J Clin Endocrinol Metab, 2013). This again raises the question of whether the enhanced grooming or elevated corticosterone observed in the mice here has any relevance to humans.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comments. Most ear, nose, and throat surgeries in children involve a short period of anesthesia with sevoflurane alone4-6, which is similar to the 30-minute exposure in our mouse study. In clinical settings, emergence delirium and agitation are common in young children undergoing sevoflurane anesthesia7, often accompanied by troublesome excitation phenomena during induction and awakening8. These clinical observations align with the post-operative stress response (e.g., excessive grooming) we identified in our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is the experience of one of the reviewers that human patients who receive sevoflurane as the primary anesthetic do not wake up more stressed than if they had had one of the other GABAergic anesthetics. If there were signs of stress upon emergence (increased heart rate, blood pressure, thrashing movements) from general anesthesia, this would be treated immediately. The most likely cause of post-operative stress behaviors in humans is probably inadequate anti-nociception during the procedure, which translates into inadequate post-op analgesia and likely delirium. It is the case that children receiving sevoflurane do have a higher likelihood of post-operative delirium. Perhaps the authors' studies address a mechanism for delirium associated with sevoflurane, but this is barely mentioned. Delirium seems likely to be the closest clinical phenomenon to what was studied. As noted by the Besnier et al (2017) article cited by the authors, surgery can elevate postoperative glucocorticoidstress hormones, but it generally correlates with the intensity of the surgical procedure. Besnier et al also note the elevation of glucocorticoids is generally considered to be adaptive. Thus, reducing glucocorticoids during surgery with sevoflurane may hamper recovery, especially as it relates to tissue damage, which was not measured or considered here. This paper only considers glucocorticoid release as a negative factor, which causes &quot;immunosuppression&quot;, &quot;proteolysis&quot;, and &quot;delays postoperative recovery and leads to increased morbidity&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comments. We agree that the post-anesthetic stress behaviors mentioned in our manuscript are similar to the clinical phenomenon of delirium, which were defined in Cheng Li’s study as ‘sevoflurane-induced post-operative delirium’9. Therefore, we conducted additional behavioral tests for cognitive function, including the Y-maze and novel object recognition test, in mice administrated 30-minute sevoflurane anesthesia. The results demonstrate that chemogenetic inhibition of PVHCRH neurons ameliorated the short-term memory impairment in mice exposed to 30-minute sevoflurane GA (Figure 7-figure supplement 9), suggesting PVHCRH neurons may involve in modulating sevoflurane-induced postoperative delirium.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Concerns about the novelty of the findings:</p><p>The key finding here is that CRH neurons mediate measures of arousal, and arousal modulates sevoflurane anesthesia induction and recovery. However, CRH is associated with arousal in numerous studies. In fact, the authors' own work, published in eLife in 2021, showed that stimulating the hypothalamic CRH cells lead to arousal and their inhibition promoted hypersomnia. In both papers the authors use fos expression in CRH cells during a specific event to implicate the cells, then manipulate them and measure EEG responses. In the previous work, the cells were active during wakefulness; here- they were active in the awake state the follows anesthesia (Figure1). Thus, the findings in the current work are incremental and not particularly impactful. Claims like &quot;Here, a core hypothalamic ensemble, corticotropin-releasing hormone neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, is discovered&quot; are overstated. PVHCRH cell populations were discovered in the 1980s. Suggesting that it is novel to identify that hypothalamic CRH cells regulate post-anesthesia stress is unfounded as well: this PVH population has been shown over four decades to regulate a plethora of different responses to stress. Anesthesia stress is no different. Their role in arousal is not being discovered in this paper. Even their role in grooming is not discovered in this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comments. As requested, we have revised our manuscript by removing overstated sentences. Please see the revised manuscript. In terms of novelty, our study reveals that PVHCRH neurons are implicated not only in the induction and emergence of sevoflurane general anesthesia but also in sevoflurane-induced post-operative delirium. This finding represents a novel contribution to the field, as it has not been previously reported by other studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The activation of CRH cells in PVH has already been shown to result in grooming by Jaideep Bains (a paper cited by the authors). Thus, the involvement of these cells in this behavior is not surprising. The authors perform elaborate manipulations of CRH cells and numerous analyses of grooming and related behaviors. For example, they compare grooming and paw licking after anesthesia with those after other stressors such as forced swim, spraying mice with water, physical attack and restraint. The authors have identified a behavioral phenomenon in a rodent model that does not have a clear correlation with a behavior state observed in humans during the use of sevoflurane as part of an anesthetic regimen. The grooming behaviors are not a model of the emergence delirium or the cognitive dysfunction observed commonly in patients receiving sevoflurane for general anesthesia. Emergence delirium is commonly seen in children after sevoflurane is used as part of general anesthesia and cognitive dysfunction is commonly observed in adults-particularly the elderly-- following general anesthesia. No features of delirium or cognitive dysfunction are measured here.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, behavioral tests for cognitive function have been conducted and displayed in Figure 7-figure supplement 9.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other concerns:</p><p>In Figure 2, cFos was measured in the PVH at different points before, during and after sevoflurane. The greatest cFos expression was seen in Post 2, the latest time point after anesthesia. However, this may simply reflect the fact that there is a delay between activity levels and expression of cFos (as noted by the authors, 2-3 hours). Thus, sacrificing mice 30 minutes after the onset of sevoflurane application would be expected to drive minimal cFos expression, and the cFos observed at 30 minutes would not accurately reflect the activity levels during the sevoflurane. Also, the authors state that the hyperactivity, as measured by cFos, lasted &quot;approximately 1 hours before returning to baseline&quot;, but there is no data to support this return to baseline.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comments. We apologize that the protocol we used for c-fos staining may not accurately reflect the activity levels, so we have removed Figure 2F. The sentence ‘lasted approximately 1 hours before returning to baseline’ refers to the calcium signal but not c-fos level.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 7, the number of animals appears to change from panel to panel even though they are supposed to show animals from the same groups. For example, cort was measured in only 3 saline-treated O2 animals (Fig 7E), but cFos and CRH were assessed in 4 (Fig C,D). Similarly, grooming time and time spent in open arms was measured in 6 saline-treated O2 controls (Fig 7F, H) but central distance was measured in 8(Fig 7G). There are other group number discrepancies in this figure--the number of data points in the plots do not match what is reported in the legend for numerous groups. Similarly, Figure 4 has a mismatch between the Ns reported in the legend and the number of points plotted per bar. For example, there were 10 animals in the hM3Di group; all are shown for the LORR and time to emergence plots, but only8 were used for time to induction. The legends reported N=7 for the mCherry group, yet 9 are shown for the time to emergence panel. No reason for exclusions is cited. These figures (and their statistics) should be corrected.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comments.
