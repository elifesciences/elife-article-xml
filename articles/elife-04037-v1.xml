<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/home/">Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</ext-link> seeks to address growing concerns about reproducibility in scientific research by conducting replications of 50 papers in the field of cancer biology published between 2010 and 2012. This Registered Report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from ‘Widespread potential for growth-factor-driven resistance to anticancer kinase inhibitors’ by Wilson and colleagues, published in Nature in 2012 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Wilson et al., 2012</xref>). The experiments that will be replicated are those reported in Figure 2B and C. In these experiments, Wilson and colleagues show that sensitivity to receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitors can be bypassed by various ligands through reactivation of downstream signaling pathways (Figure 2A; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Wilson et al., 2012</xref>), and that blocking the receptors for these bypassing ligands abrogates their ability to block sensitivity to the original RTK inhibitor (Figure 2C; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Wilson et al., 2012</xref>).

The effectiveness of therapies targeting specific mutations in receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) is limited by the acquisition of resistance to the drugs over the course of treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Mok et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Camidge et al., 2014</xref>). Resistance can be acquired through new mutations that block the action of the RTK inhibitors or their uptake and/or genetic amplification of downstream target genes of the RTK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen and Fu, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Garrett and Arteaga, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Sequist et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Gainor and Shaw, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Yang, 2013</xref>). Several studies, including this work by Wilson and colleagues, elucidated another mechanism for this acquisition of resistance: the engagement of parallel RTK signaling pathways that converge on common downstream survival signals via signals from the tumor microenvironment. In this study, Wilson and colleagues examined several cancer cell lines for ligand-mediated drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Wilson et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In Figure 2B/C, Wilson and colleagues demonstrated that resistance to primary kinase inhibitor treatment can be induced by the addition of rescuing ligands that activate the PI(3)K–AKT and MAPK pro-survival signaling pathways. This resistance can be overcome with the addition of an appropriate secondary kinase inhibitor. Three different cancer cell line models were used to demonstrate this phenomenon. Treatment of A204 (a <italic>PDGFR</italic> amplified rhabdomyosarcoma cell line) with the ligand FGF activated pFRS2 and pERK, inducing resistance to sunitinib. The addition of a secondary kinase inhibitor, PD173074, blocked FGF-induced pFRS2 and pERK activation, restoring sensitivity to sunitinib. The treatment of M14 (a <italic>BRAF</italic>-mutated melanoma cell line) with the ligand NRG1 activated pHER3 and pAKT, inducing partial resistance to PLX4032. The addition of a secondary kinase inhibitor, lapatinib, blocked NRG1-induced pHER3 and pAKT activation, restoring sensitivity to PLX4032. Treatment of KHM-3S (an <italic>EGFR</italic>-mutated small cell lung cancer cell line) with the ligand HGF activated pMET and pERK, inducing resistance to Erlotinib. The addition of a secondary kinase inhibitor, crizotinib, blocked HGF-induced pMET and pERK activation, restoring sensitivity to erlotinib.</p><p>The cell viability assays examining drug sensitivity and the Western blots examining levels of phosphorylated kinases in Figures 2B and 2C, respectively, are the key experiments that demonstrate that growth factor ligands can reactivate downstream signaling components important for cancer cell survival, causing resistance to anticancer kinase inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Wilson et al., 2012</xref>). These experiments are replicated in Protocols 1 and 2.</p><p>Two studies published around the same time as the work of Wilson and colleagues also support the proposed mechanism of acquired resistance to RTK inhibition by signaling from the tumor microenvironment. Straussman and colleagues demonstrated that HGF signaling derived from the tumor microenvironment could bypass EGFR inhibition by activation of MET signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Straussman et al., 2012</xref>, also included for replication in the Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology), and Harbinski and colleagues, in an approach similar to Wilson and colleagues, showed that multiple growth factor ligands could ‘bypass’ inhibitor-targeted RTKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Harbinski et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Since the publication of Wilson and colleagues' work, several publications have reported similar results to those being replicated in Protocols 1 and 2. Similar to the experiments with A204 cells above, Welti and colleagues demonstrated that FGF ligands could induce resistance to sunitinib, which could be reversed by the addition of PD173074 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Welti et al., 2011</xref>). These experiments were performed in HUVEC cells, whereas A204 cells were used in the study being replicated. Similar to the experiments on M14 cells above, Montero-Conde and colleagues showed that NRG1 ligand could activate pHER3 and pAKT in the presence of PLX4032, and this activation could be reversed by the addition of lapatinib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Montero-Conde et al., 2013</xref>). These experiments were performed in 8505C cells, whereas M14 cells were used in the study being replicated. Similar to the experiments performed on KHM-S3 cells above, several groups have demonstrated that HGF ligand can induce resistance to erlotinib and that this resistance can be reversed by the addition of crizotinib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Nakagawa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Nakade et al., 2014</xref>). These experiments were performed in PC-9 and HCC827 cells, whereas KHM-3S cells were used in the study being replicated.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Unless otherwise noted, all protocol information was derived from the original paper, references from the original paper, or information obtained directly from the authors.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Tony Hunter (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>1) The experimental design to test the reproducibility of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Wilson et al. (2012)</xref> is thorough and well-articulated, with some exceptions. First, it will be important to perform positive controls to assess the performance of the growth factors or the kinase inhibitors that will be used.</p><p>2) Second, given that the western blots in the original manuscript are not quantified and that quantification is derived from the published work, the authors should describe how they are going to determine whether the data are “reproducible” or not.</p><p>3) Third, it is not immediately clear whether the distribution of the data (IC50 for Protocol 1 and band intensity for Protocol 2) will exhibit any skew. Therefore, at the time of analysis, it may be useful to plot histograms of the data to examine their distributions, and, if necessary, consider suitable transformations (for example, the Box–Cox family of transformations) of the data to obtain (approximately) symmetric distributions so that the testing procedures are valid.</p><p>4) Lastly, the authors should either include or explain the reason for excluding in the replication study the role of HGF-MET signaling in resistance to BRAF inhibition that was observed in some melanomas in the original study and other reports.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04037.003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The experimental design to test the reproducibility of</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20"><italic>Wilson et al (2012)</italic></xref> <italic>is thorough and well-articulated, with some exceptions. First, it will be important to perform positive controls to assess the performance of the growth factors or the kinase inhibitors that will be used</italic>.</p><p>We agree that verifying the activity of the reagents prior to their use in our experiments is an important step. We have three classes of reagent: primary RTK inhibitors, growth factor ligands, and secondary RTK inhibitors. Each cohort includes a positive control where the cell line of interest is treated solely with its cognate primary RTK inhibitor. This should demonstrate that the drug is active as anticipated, and the quality control data (for both primary and secondary RTK inhibitors) provided by the manufacturers will be included in the materials publicly available through the Open Science Framework. However, as indicated by the reviewers, there is known lot-to-lot variation in growth factors, so we have added steps to test the growth factors we are using for activity. In Protocol 2, we have added in additional cell lines that have a known response to treatment with the ligand alone, as evidenced by phosphorylation of downstream targets. We will treat these positive control cell lines with the growth factors and assess phosphorylation of their cognate target by Western blot. The manuscript has been updated to reflect this additional work.</p><p><italic>2) Second, given that the western blots in the original manuscript are not quantified and that quantification is derived from the published work, the authors should describe how they are going to determine whether the data are “reproducible” or not</italic>.</p><p>We will present both the original data and replication data for side-by-side comparison. We will plot the mean value of our replication data along with the 95% confidence interval. We will then include the original data point (IC<sub>50</sub> or quantified Western blot band intensity) on the same plot to demonstrate if the original data falls within the 95% confidence interval of the replication data. We have also updated the language of the manuscript to reflect this change.</p><p><italic>3) Third, it is not immediately clear whether the distribution of the data (IC50 for Protocol 1 and band intensity for Protocol 2) will exhibit any skew. Therefore, at the time of analysis, it may be useful to plot histograms of the data to examine their distributions, and, if necessary, consider suitable transformations (for example, the Box–Cox family of transformations) of the data to obtain (approximately) symmetric distributions so that the testing procedures are valid</italic>.</p><p>Thank you for this suggestion. At the time of analysis, we will generate a histogram of all the data to determine if it follows a Gaussian distribution or not. If it is skewed, we will perform the appropriate transformation in order to proceed with the proposed statistical analysis. We will note any changes or transformations made. We have also updated the manuscript to address this point.</p><p><italic>4) Lastly, the authors should either include or explain the reason for excluding in the replication study the role of HGF-MET signaling in resistance to BRAF inhibition that was observed in some melanomas in the original study and other reports</italic>.</p><p>We agree that all of the experiments included in the original study are important, and choosing which experiments to replicate has been one of the great challenges of this project. In this case, the RP:CB core team felt that the most impactful information in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Wilson et al., 2012</xref> was that bypassing RTK inhibition by ligand-mediated activation of parallel signaling pathways was a mechanism applicable to many different types of cancer, each with its own constellation of addictive mutations and cognate inhibitors. The experiments addressing the role of HGF in activating MET signaling to bypass EGFR inhibition provide a more detailed exploration of this mechanism in one specific cancer type scenario, and support the larger conclusion drawn from the experiments we chose for replication. As such, we will restrict our analysis to the experiments being replicated and will not include discussion of experiments not being replicated in this study.</p></body></sub-article></article>
