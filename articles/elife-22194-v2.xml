The long-held thought that animal complexity is related to the number of genes that are in the animal’s DNA has now been largely dismissed; simple animals like sponges and cnidarians (for example, jellyfish, anemones and corals) have comparable gene numbers to vertebrates, insects, mollusks and other complicated bilaterians (animals that feature a plane of symmetry, meaning that they have a top, a bottom, a front and a back). This observation led to the idea that gene regulation (how and when genes are turned off and on) is responsible for the evolution of animal diversity.</p><p>Genomic DNA packs into cells by winding around proteins called histones. Histones themselves can bear certain chemical marks, which in turn determine if the genes contained in the DNA associated with the histones are going to be turned on or off. In bilaterians and cnidarians these marks substantially contribute to gene regulation. Some of these marks predate the evolution of multicellular animals from single-celled organisms. However, the origin of the marks that associate with the gene regulatory elements that are essential for animals to be multicellular remained unknown. In other words, does the evolution of histone marks underpin animal complexity?</p><p>Gaiti et al. turned to the marine sponge <italic>Amphimedon queenslandica</italic> to address this question. Sponges are one of the morphologically simplest animals, lacking a gut, nerves and muscles. By analyzing histone marks in this sponge, Gaiti et al. found they were remarkably similar to the networks of histone marks seen in more complex animals. This is consistent with this form of gene regulation being present at the dawn of the animal kingdom. Indeed, this mode of gene regulation may have been necessary for multicellular animals to first evolve.</p><p>It now appears that most of the genes and regulatory mechanisms underlying the formation of complex animals, like ourselves, had an unexpected early origin – probably as early as the first steps in the evolution of multicellular animals from single-celled organisms. Further studies of animals that are close relatives of sponges, such as comb jellies, and their single-celled cousins, may further improve our understanding of how these simple single-celled organisms became multicellular animals.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22194.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22194.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>A. queenslandica</kwd><kwd>evolution of multicellularity</kwd><kwd>histone modifications</kwd><kwd>cis-regulation</kwd><kwd>enhancers</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FL110100044</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Degnan</surname><given-names>Bernard M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The complex chromatin-based genomic regulatory system controlling developmental gene expression in complex bilaterians predates the evolution of morphological complexity and may have been a prerequisite for the evolution of the first simple multicellular animals.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Animals rely on genomic regulatory systems to direct the dynamic spatiotemporal and cell type-specific gene expression that is essential for the development and maintenance of a multicellular lifestyle.

Other regulatory features, such as <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory DNA and combinatorial patterns of histone covalent post-translational modifications (PTMs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Davidson and Peter, 2015</xref>), would have been instrumental to direct differential gene expression in the first multicellular animals. For instance, recent analysis of the genome of <italic>Capsaspora</italic>, one of the closest unicellular relatives of animals, reveals a lack of chromatin repressive marks, developmental promoter types and distal <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements (enhancers) typically present in complex animals (<italic>i.e.</italic>, eumetazoans) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Sebé-Pedrós et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The development of high-throughput chromatin assays like chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Robertson et al., 2007</xref>) has allowed the dissection of chromatin-encoded information beyond the primary DNA sequence, especially the systematic examination of histone PTMs and their role(s) in transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib157">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Thurman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Kundaje et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012</xref>).

Here, following on from our recent transcriptomic studies that revealed that the sponge <italic>Amphimedon queenslandica</italic> (herein <italic>Amphimedon</italic>) has dynamic developmental gene expression akin to eumetazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Gaiti et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Fernandez-Valverde et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Levin et al., 2016</xref>), we set out to determine whether this transcriptional complexity is paralleled by regulatory complexity encoded by combinatorial histone PTM patterns. By analysing an extensive ChIP-seq compendium of histone H3 PTMs in this sponge, we show that a complex gene regulatory landscape comprised of combinatorial histone modifications was already in place at the dawn of animals. Moreover, we provide evidence for the evolution and expansion of distal <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory genomic capabilities at the origin of the animal kingdom.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Amphimedon</italic> key regulatory chromatin states are shared with eumetazoans</title><p>We carried out chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) on sexually reproducing <italic>Amphimedon</italic> adults and larvae using antibodies against specific histone H3 PTMs that have been used to define chromatin states in model bilaterians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib157">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ho et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Uniquely mapped reads were subsequently used to identify a set of distinct chromatin states based on the five different histone H3 PTMs we assayed. Specifically, chromatin states were predicted throughout the genome training a multivariate Hidden Markov Model with different <italic>a priori</italic> defined states (from 5 to 15) (Materials and methods). We elected to use a 9-state model for all further analyses as it covered all major gene coding and regulatory components (promoter, enhancer, gene body) that we expected to resolve with this selection of histone H3 PTMs. Despite the inherent cellular heterogeneity of our starting material, we were able to resolve specificities towards gene components between these nine chromatin states. They fell into two broad categories: one that correlated with actively transcribed genes that include active promoters (‘TssA’) and enhancers (‘TxEnhA’, ‘EnhWk’), and 5’ and 3’ boundaries of transcribed genes (‘TxFlnk’); and another category with genes with no or little detectable transcription; these include bivalent or poised regulatory (‘BivTx’, ‘EnhP’), repressed Polycomb (‘ReprPC’, ‘ReprPCWk’), and quiescent (‘Quies’) states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>). The nine chromatin states differentially associated with specific <italic>Amphimedon</italic> genomic features. For instance, the ‘TssA’ state (defined by the presence of H3K4me3) was enriched around transcription start sites (TSSs) of active genes. ‘TxEnhA’ state (defined by H3K4me1, H3K27ac, and H3K36me3 enrichment) associated with coding exons and introns that correspond to potential <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements and short intergenic regions, which are common in the <italic>Amphimedon</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Kundaje et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Fernandez-Valverde et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Kowalczyk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Ritter et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Singer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Birnbaum et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">Zentner and Scacheri, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib155">Zentner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Fernandez-Valverde and Degnan, 2016</xref>).

By generating the first, to our knowledge, comprehensive genome-wide maps of histone H3 PTMs and putative enhancer elements in a non-eumetazoan animal, we determine that this transcriptional complexity is paralleled by regulatory complexity encoded by combinatorial histone H3 PTM patterns in this sponge.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Histone H3 PTMs have conserved role(s) in the modulation of gene expression across metazoans</title><p>Despite <italic>Amphimedon</italic>’s morphological simplicity, we find strong evidence in this sponge for the existence of a range of regulatory states that underlie eumetazoan development. For instance, the genome-wide promoter analysis of H3K4me3 – the canonical and widespread eukaryotic histone H3 PTM of active transcription – reveals a complex correlation between H3K4me3-containing nucleosome occupancy and gene expression in <italic>Amphimedon</italic> adults and larvae, consistent with an active and finely tuned role for H3K4me3 in modulating transcriptional activity and expression variability of developmental genes. Unexpectedly, we identify a small subpopulation of highly and specifically expressed genes that challenge this premise and are transcribed in the absence of H3K4me3 in <italic>Amphimedon</italic> and <italic>Nematostella</italic>. This subpopulation of genes differs from most other developmentally-expressed genes that possess the H3K4me3 mark, in having much more stage-restricted expression profiles; in this analysis, most are expressed only in one stage of development. Although it could be argued that this apparent absence of H3K4me3 is the consequence of the expression of regulated genes being spatially confined to specific cell populations, thus potentially limiting our detection sensitivity with our cell admixture ChIP-seq, these results run parallel to the recent finding by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Pérez-Lluch et al.

As the expression of the developmentally regulated genes is required only for a limited period, the absence of H3K4me3 mark would allow their rapid on-off switching. Alternative mechanisms, such as the transient binding of transcription factors, appear to play a major role in regulating the expression of these genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Pérez-Lluch et al., 2015a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">2015b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Model of an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of PRC2-mediated gene silencing</title><p>Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) primarily trimethylates histone H3 on lysine 27 and has been conserved throughout opisthokonts evolution, with its core subunits (E(z), SU(z)12, ESC and Nurf55) being present in animals, choanoflagellates and multicellular fungi, but absent in <italic>Capsaspora</italic>, and budding and fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Sebé-Pedrós et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Margueron and Reinberg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Shaver et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Jamieson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Connolly et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ikeuchi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib150">Whitcomb et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Specifically, MACS2 was used in broadpeak mode with a broadpeak <italic>P</italic>-value threshold of 0.1 and a narrowpeak threshold of 0.01 (-p 0.01, --broad, --nomodel, --extsize 146, -g 1.45e8). Enriched regions were scored on individual replicates (R1 and R2), pooled data (reads pooled across biological replicates) (P) and on subsampled pseudoreplicates (obtained by pooling reads from biological replicates and randomly subsampling, without replacement, two pseudoreplicates with half the total number of pooled reads) (PR1 and PR2). For each histone PTM, we defined ‘R’ as the set of peaks in P that overlap peaks in R1 and R2, and ‘PR’ as the set of peaks in P that overlap peaks in PR1 and PR2. Next, we defined ‘M’ as the set of peaks that match exactly in R and PR, and ‘T’ as the set of peaks that match exactly in R and PR as well as those that are unique to R or unique to PR. For a statement about reproducibility we required the M-to-T ratio to be at least 0.5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 1—source data 4</xref>). To obtain reliable regions of enrichment, we restricted all further analyses to enriched regions identified using pooled data that were also independently identified in both replicates and pseudoreplicates (the ‘M’ set). These regions of enrichment can be interpreted as high confidence regions, representing reproducible events across true biological replicates. For H3K27ac, for which no replication was available, we used the <italic>P</italic>-value column to rank peaks and only retained peaks with a p-value&lt;0.001. We used the gappedPeak representation for the histone PTMs with relatively compact enrichment patterns, including H3K4me3, H3K27ac and H3K4me1. The gapped peaks are broad domains (passing <italic>P</italic>-value 0.1) that contain at least one narrow peak passing a <italic>P</italic>-value of 0.01. For the diffused histone PTMs – H3K36me3 and H3K27me3 – we used the broadPeak representation. RNAPII peaks were detected using the peakzilla software (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_007471">SCR_007471</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bardet et al., 2013</xref>), using input DNA reads as control (-c 1.5, –s 3).

For each ChIP-seq data set, read counts were computed in non-overlapping 200 bp bins across the <italic>Amphimedon</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Srivastava et al., 2010</xref>). Each bin was discretised into two levels, one indicating enrichment and 0 indicating no enrichment. The binarization was performed by comparing ChIP-seq read counts to corresponding input DNA control read counts within each bin and using a Poisson <italic>P</italic>-value threshold of 1e-4 (the default discretization threshold in ChromHMM). We trained several models in parallel mode with the number of states ranging from 5 states to 15 states and chose a 9-state model as the best model that captures all the key interactions between the chromatin marks and cover all possible genomic locations (promoter, enhancer, gene body) that we expected to resolve given the selection of histone PTMs we used (H3K4me3, H3K27ac, H3K36me3, H3K4me1, H3K27me3 in adult; and H3K4me3, H3K27ac, H3K4me1, H3K27me3 in larva). To assign biologically meaningful mnemonics to the nine states, ChromHMM was used to compute the overlap and neighborhood enrichments of each state relative to various types of functional annotations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). State enrichment in different genomic features was calculated dividing the percentage of nucleotides occupied by a state in a particular genomic feature by the percentage of nucleotides that this genomic feature represents in the entire genome. For the overlap enrichment plots in the figures, the enrichments for each genomic feature (column) across all states is normalized by subtracting the minimum value from the column and then dividing by the max of the column. So, the values always range from 0 (white) to 1 (dark blue) (<italic>i.e.</italic>, a column wise relative scale). For the neighborhood positional enrichment plots, the normalization is done across all columns (<italic>i.e</italic>., the minimum value over the entire matrix is subtracted from each value and divided by the maximum over the entire matrix). The functional annotations used were as follows: (1) CpG islands obtained using Hidden Markov Models as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib152">Wu et al. (2010)</xref>.

(3) Expressed and repressed genes, their TSSs and TESs.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Robb Krumlauf as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Veronica Hinman (Reviewer #1); Ulrich Technau (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The consensus opinion of the reviewers is that this study is of great potential interest and could make a significant contribution to the field. These analyses could bridge the gap between published studies on <italic>Nematostella</italic> and on <italic>Capsaspora</italic> because in the latter case there was no evidence for enhancer/promoter landscapes. Therefore, the study deals with an important question, is well-designed, and has potential for both high relevant study and impact. However, there are two major weaknesses that dampen enthusiasm: a) an important part of the paper is the epigenetic analysis but the quality of H3K4me1 data is poor and b) and the marks of the lincRNAs is weak. These issues must be addressed in a revision before the paper can be considered further. We normally like to see revisions made within two months but we appreciate that the issues raised may require a longer time period and we are willing to allow you the additional time if needed. This may mean that the resubmission is given a new manuscript number but we will make every effort to ensure that it is handled by the same initial reviewers.</p><p>A) Epigenetics: The H3K4me1 and H3K27ac data is of poor quality and there are a variety of issues with the technical aspects of the paper. This includes missing ChIP-qPCR validations, questionable antibody quality and an absence of supplementary figures dealing with data integrity.</p><p>Some of the reviewers feel it would be important to perform additional replicates of H3K4me1 and H3K27ac ChIPs. If this is possible it could enhance the paper and address the weakness of the existing data. However, we are willing to stop short of this request because of the time involved and instead request that more analysis and data be provided to confirm existing peaks. Minimally, you need to provide more thorough statistical analysis and test the effects of different thresholds on the chromatin states. This will not eliminate the issues associated with data noisiness (only new ChIPs can do that) but will allow the reader to gain a better insight into the quality of the data that was used to reach the conclusions. This involves:</p><p>1) Extensive qPCR (20 – 25 targets / ChIP) validations (including a number of negative controls).</p><p>2) Heatmaps (not average profiles) followed by HCL or K-means clustering of their ChIP-seq data over various genomic features (TSS, genes, newly identified chromHMM features), including both replicates side by side.</p><p>3) Thorough comparisons of the ChIP-seq data (correlation of signal in genomic bins for all the datasets and all replicates).</p><p>4) BAM files and signal files (BigWig) should be uploaded to GEO and made available for reviewers to independently assess data quality.</p><p>5) For all the relevant genomic examples (named above), both experimental replicates should be shown.</p><p>6) This paper, and all conclusions, rely entirely on the use of off-the-shelf antibodies. All of the data analyses derive from experiments with these antibodies. Therefore, I think these need to be &quot;gold standard experiments.&quot; It’s reassuring that the proteins are 100% identical in the region that the antibody recognizes, but this does not indicate that these antibodies are specific. A great control would be to perform ChiP-PCR or western blot on control versus some stage treated with a histone methylation/acetylation inhibitors. This would confirm specificity.</p><p>7) Data for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. There needs to be some statistical analysis for the statement for the significance of the reduced H3K4me3 in dynamically expressed vs. stable. I don't agree with the finding for the sponge is similar to <italic>Nematostella</italic> (Figure 3AvsC). The difference between the top bin and the bottom bin is striking in <italic>Nematostella</italic> and much more modest, perhaps even not significant, in the sponge. This however is where a genuine statistical analysis is needed to make the stronger point. If this is a qualitative analysis the authors should be clear about this in the discussion of this data. I also wonder here is this analysis is confounded by inclusion of the many genes for which the one peak of expression is in the adult (Figure 3-1) These could be genes that are nonetheless very stably expressed in the adult, but the resolution of the time-course assigns &quot;adult&quot; as one time equivalent to very restricted developmental stages. This analysis might be better done by considering only the developmental stages, and might provide a better significance.</p><p>B) lincRNAs: There is a concern about the ability to reach conclusions the lincRNA aspect of the study based on figures presented. This could simply be omitted.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22194.055</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The consensus opinion of the reviewers is that this study is of great potential interest and could make a significant contribution to the field.

We also agree that additional ChIPs would not be necessary, especially given the larval ChIPs corroborate the adult ChIPs despite being a different stage comprised of different cell types with markedly overall different transcriptional profiles. We agree that without this confirmation additional replicates would be necessary. In the revision, we have made sure that we highlight, wherever possible, the consistencies between larval and adult ChIP results. Nonetheless, as outlined below, we have undertaken a range of new validations and we have extended our statistical analyses, and included new figure plates and statements.</p><p><italic>This involves:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Extensive qPCR (20 – 25 targets / ChIP) validations (including a number of negative controls).</italic> </p><p>As per request of the reviewers, we have now performed ChIP-qPCRs validations of our ChIP-seq data sets for H3K27ac (n =20 targets) and H3K4me1 (n =21 targets) to confirm existing peaks. In addition, we have validated a subset of H3K4me3 (n =10 targets) and H3K27me3 (n =10 targets) peaks. For each of these four histone PTMs, ChIP-qPCRs confirmed our ChIP-seq findings for &gt;80% of the targets, compared to negative controls (two different intergenic regions not bound by our histone PTMs of interest). Importantly, in the great majority of the cases, we observed high signal when corrected for background.</p><p>Specifically, in the case of H3K4me3, we designed primers to target regions of enrichment at transcription start sites (TSSs) of genes identified using our peak calling strategy. We were able to validate 90% of the targets. For H3K27me3, we designed primers to target transcriptionally silenced regions of enrichment and validated 80% of them. Most importantly, for H3K4me1 and H3K27ac we designed primers to predominantly target regions of enrichment corresponding to our <italic>in-silico</italic> predicted enhancer elements, and were able to successfully validate &gt;85% and &gt;95% of them, respectively.</p><p>At the end of this response letter, we provide the methods on how these experiments were performed. We also have added to this revision, as a ‘Related Manuscript File’, a file that shows the ChIP-qPCR results. We have elected not to include these data in the paper as such confirmation experiments for histone H3 modifications are not typically found in equivalent reports from basal metazoans (i.e., <italic>Nematostella</italic>) or unicellular holozoans (i.e., <italic>Capsaspora</italic>). If requested, we can add these data to the manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) Heatmaps (not average profiles) followed by HCL or K-means clustering of their ChIP-seq data over various genomic features (TSS, genes, newly identified chromHMM features), including both replicates side by side.</italic> </p><p>In addition to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, where we have shown the TSS-centred average input DNA-normalised read coverage heatmaps of RNAPII, H3K27ac, H3K36me3, H3K4me1 and H3K27me3 across <italic>Amphimedon</italic>protein-coding genes, and heatmaps in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, showing the input DNA-normalised coverage of H3K4me1, H3K4me3 and their ratio in adult <italic>Amphimedon</italic>across TSSs of lincRNAs, we have now added heatmaps over the newly identified activated enhancer elements in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>. This demonstrates the higher enrichment of H3K4me1 and H3K27ac over H3K4me3 in active enhancers, a typical biochemical signature of eumetazoan enhancers (Schwaiger et al. 2014), and also represents an independent confirmation of H3K4me1 signal over background.</p><p><italic>3) Thorough comparisons of the ChIP-seq data (correlation of signal in genomic bins for all the datasets and all replicates).</italic> </p><p>We re-evaluated reproducibility of high-throughput experiments by measuring consistency between the biological replicates within our ChIP-seq experiments. First, Pearson’s correlation coefficients (Pearson’s r) of genome-wide fold enrichment (FE) signals was computed for biological replicates and a minimum threshold of 0.5 was required. In addition, to ensure consistency between biological replicates, we further required an Irreproducible Discovery Rate (IDR) of at least 0.5, as described in the modENCODE and ENCODE guidelines (Landt et al. 2012). ChIP-seq data sets that met these criteria were then merged across biological replicates. This is now stated in the Materials and methods section:</p><p>“Pearson’s correlation coefficients (Pearson’s r) of genome-wide fold enrichment (FE) signals (see below) was computed for biological replicates and a minimum threshold of 0.5 was required, as per Ho et al. (Ho et al., 2014). In addition, to ensure consistency between biological replicates, we further required an Irreproducible Discovery Rate (IDR) of at least 0.5 (see below), as described in the modENCODE and ENCODE guidelines (19, 127-129). ChIP-seq data sets that met these criteria were then merged across biological replicates (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 1—source data 4</xref>).”</p><p>A complete summary statistics and quality metrics of the ChIP-seq datasets used in this study is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 1—source data 4</xref>.</p><p>In addition, we have now incorporated a supplementary figure addressing data integrity. Specifically, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> we have now shown Pearson correlation coefficients between adult histone modifications and RNA Polymerase II experiments and input DNA-normalized coverage of each biological replicate (R1 and R2) for each of the different histone modifications side by side. Note that H3K36me3 was flagged for low signal to noise, potentially explaining the somewhat high correlation with H3K27me3, and RNAPII replicate 1 did not pass the quality threshold required so it has been excluded from all further analyses. However, this does not affect the conclusions of the paper in any way. Lastly, as explained in detail in comment #1 above, we have performed ChIP-qPCRs validations of our ChIP-seq data sets for H3K4me3, H3K27ac, H3K4me1 and H3K27me3.</p><p>Together, this evidence provides further support for the quality of the data that we used to reach the main conclusions of our study.</p><p><italic>4) BAM files and signal files (BigWig) should be uploaded to GEO and made available for reviewers to independently assess data quality.</italic> </p><p>GEO GSE79645 has now been updated as requested. Please note that GEO does not accept alignment files (BAM) as processed data, as indicated at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/info/seq.html">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/info/seq.html</ext-link> [the further processed data (e.g., wig/peak files) should be supplied instead]. As per GEO guidelines, all raw data files (fastq) along with peak files (BED), and signal files (wig) are now available at the following link, allowing review of record GSE79645 while it remains in private status: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?token=qxyhmmiajrolnqt&amp;acc=GSE79645">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?token=qxyhmmiajrolnqt&amp;acc=GSE79645</ext-link> (Last accessed February 25, 2017).</p><p><italic>5) For all the relevant genomic examples (named above), both experimental replicates should be shown.</italic> </p><p>As mentioned above in comment #3, we have now incorporated these into a supplementary figure addressing data integrity. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> we have now shown input DNA-normalized coverage of each biological replicate (R1 and R2) for each of the different histone modifications side by side for five different genomic regions, either transcriptionally active or silenced. Apart from RNAPII replicate 1, which did not pass the quality threshold required so it has been excluded from all further analyses, we obtained highly reproducible data sets. In addition, in all relevant genomic examples presented in the figures, only the high confidence regions of enrichment representing reproducible events across true biological replicates are shown. For these reasons, we do not think it is necessary to show both experimental replicates in each and every one of the genomic examples.</p><p><italic>6) This paper, and all conclusions, rely entirely on the use of off-the-shelf antibodies. All of the data analyses derive from experiments with these antibodies. Therefore, I think these need to be &quot;gold standard experiments.&quot; It’s reassuring that the proteins are 100% identical in the region that the antibody recognizes, but this does not indicate that these antibodies are specific. A great control would be to perform ChiP-PCR or western blot on control versus some stage treated with a histone methylation/acetylation inhibitors. This would confirm specificity.</italic> </p><p>We have followed current approaches adopted by previous studies in non-bilaterian model organisms (<italic>e.g.</italic>, Schwaiger et al. 2014; Sebé-Pedrós et al. 2016) where sequence conservation has been deemed sufficient to justify the usage of antibodies against the N-terminal tail of histone H3 in these organisms. In fact, the antibodies used in our study recognize the correct epitopes in even more distantly related eukaryotes, where their usage has been successfully reported [e.g., <italic>Capsaspora</italic>(Sebé-Pedrós et al. 2016), <italic>Phaseolusvulgaris</italic>(Barraza et al. 2015), yeast (Harmeyer et al. 2015), and <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>(Liu et al. 2007)]. Although we agree with the reviewers that the conservation of the entire amino acids sequence of histone H3, along with the relevant histone methyltransferase and acetyltransferase, which we also show, does not per seindicate that the antibodies used for chromatin immunoprecipitation are specific, we believe that the ‘gold standard’ had already been set by rich body of literature that had not attracted any major criticisms over the years.</p><p><italic>7) Data for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. There needs to be some statistical analysis for the statement for the significance of the reduced H3K4me3 in dynamically expressed vs. stable. I don't agree with the finding for the sponge is similar to Nematostella (Figure 3AvsC). The difference between the top bin and the bottom bin is striking in Nematostella and much more modest, perhaps even not significant, in the sponge. This however is where a genuine statistical analysis is needed to make the stronger point. If this is a qualitative analysis the authors should be clear about this in the discussion of this data. I also wonder here is this analysis is confounded by inclusion of the many genes for which the one peak of expression is in the adult (Figure 3-1) These could be genes that are nonetheless very stably expressed in the adult, but the resolution of the time-course assigns &quot;adult&quot; as one time equivalent to very restricted developmental stages. This analysis might be better done by considering only the developmental stages, and might provide a better significance.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that a genuine statistical analysis is needed to make the stronger point. We have now compared the log2(H3K4me3/input DNA) distributions between regulated and stable genes in both <italic>Amphimedon</italic>and <italic>Nematostella</italic>and performed a Mann-Whitney U test to show that the difference in H3K4me3 enrichment between stable and regulated genes is statistically significant. This is now mentioned in the main text. Specifically:</p><p>“Although stable and regulated genes had similar levels of RNAPII and total histone H3 (Figure 3—figure supplement 2A, 2B), the stable genes were strongly marked by H3K4me3 and the regulated genes had significantly lower levels of H3K4me3 (Mann-Whitney U test, P-value =7.431e-05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), suggesting that reduction in H3K4me3 levels does not affect expression of the regulated genes (Perez-Lluch et al., 2015).”</p><p>And:</p><p>“Additionally, as shown in <italic>Drosophila</italic>(Perez-Lluch et al., 2015), regulated genes showed higher levels of H3K27me3 (Mann-Whitney U test, P-value &lt;6.517e-06) and lower levels of H3K36me3 (Mann-Whitney U test, P-value &lt;9.235e-08) than did stable genes (Figure 3—figure supplement 2C, 2D). Analyzing RNA-seq–based gene expression through the development of the cnidarian <italic>Nematostellavectensis</italic>(Helm et al., 2013) and previously published ChIP-seq data sets in <italic>Nematostella</italic>adult female polyps (Schwaiger et al., 2014), we obtained the same pattern (Mann-Whitney U test, P-value &lt;2.2e-16; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).”</p><p><italic>B) lincRNAs: There is a concern about the ability to reach conclusions the lincRNA aspect of the study based on figures presented. This could simply be omitted.</italic> </p><p>We have now expanded this analysis by performing additional statistical analysis and showed that the difference in H3K4me1-to-H3K4me3 signal is significantly different between the two predicted subpopulations of lincRNAs in <italic>Amphimedon</italic>. Specifically:</p><p>“Similarly to Ilott et al. (Ilott et al., 2014), we arbitrarily adopted a H3K4me1-to-H3K4me3 ratio of &gt;1.2 and &lt;0.8 to define elincRNAs and plincRNAs, respectively. […] Lastly, 43 (20%) lincRNAs could not be assigned to either group, that is, 0.8&lt;H3K4me1-to- H3K4me3&lt;1.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A-D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9-data">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).”</p><p>These results strongly resemble those recently found in <italic>Capsaspora</italic>lincRNAs (Sebé-Pedrós et al. 2016), where similar subpopulations of lincRNAs have been identified based on their H3K4me1- to-H3K4me3 signatures, and we think represent interesting findings that are worth reporting in the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
