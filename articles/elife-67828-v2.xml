homeostasis can lead to renal failure. Likewise, common genetic disorders associated with abnormal cytoskeletal dynamics in the kidney collecting ducts and perturbed calcium and cAMP signaling in the ciliary compartment contribute to chronic kidney failure. We show that collecting ducts in mice lacking the A-Kinase anchoring protein AKAP220 exhibit enhanced development of primary cilia. Mechanistic studies reveal that AKAP220-associated protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) mediates this phenotype by promoting changes in the stability of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) with concomitant defects in actin dynamics. This proceeds through a previously unrecognized adaptor function for PP1 as all ciliogenesis and cytoskeletal phenotypes are recapitulated in mIMCD3 knock-in cells expressing a phosphatase-targeting defective AKAP220-ΔPP1 mutant. Pharmacological blocking of local HDAC6 activity alters cilia development and reduces cystogenesis in kidney-on-chip and organoid models. These findings identify the AKAP220-PPI-HDAC6 pathway as a key effector in primary cilia development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Inner medullary collecting duct</kwd><kwd>primary cilia</kwd><kwd>AKAP</kwd><kwd>protein phosphatase 1</kwd><kwd>histone deacetylase 6</kwd><kwd>polycystic kidney disease</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01DK105542</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scott</surname><given-names>John D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01DK119192-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scott</surname><given-names>John D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM007270</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gopalan</surname><given-names>Janani</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32DK121415</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Omar</surname><given-names>Mitchell H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007812</institution-id><institution>University of Washington</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Lara Nowak Macklin Research Fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Omar</surname><given-names>Mitchell H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UG3TR002158</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Himmelfarb</surname><given-names>Jonathan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK117914</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Freedman</surname><given-names>Benjamin S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An anchored phosphatase-deacetylase complex participates in primary cilia development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Kidneys recycle about 180 liters of fluid every day to partition nutrients and remove toxins from blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Saborio et al., 2000</xref>). Water reabsorption from luminal fluid is triggered by the hormone arginine vasopressin via phosphorylation-dependent translocation of aquaporin-2 water pores to the apical surface of kidney collecting ducts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bankir et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Noda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yui et al., 2012</xref>). Not surprisingly, defects in renal water homeostasis have pathophysiological consequences. Approximately 35 million Americans suffer from chronic kidney diseases, characterized as a gradual loss of renal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hemmelgarn et al., 2006</xref>). Polycystic kidney diseases are disorders where the collecting ducts become enlarged with fluid filled cysts that reduce glomerular filtration rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wilson, 2004</xref>). Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 600 people, is a common genetic disorder associated with end-stage renal failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Halvorson et al., 2010</xref>). Clinical evidence indicates that primary cilia function is altered in ADPKD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ma et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ma et al., 2017</xref>). Hence this chronic renal disorder is classified as a ciliopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Badano et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fliegauf et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The primary cilium is a microtubule-based organelle protruding from the surface of most mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Satir et al., 2010</xref>). In the kidney, primary cilia respond to fluctuations in fluid-flow through collecting ducts. They convert mechanical stimuli into biochemical signals to elicit developmental and regulatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mukhopadhyay et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Somatilaka et al., 2020</xref>). Disease causing mutations in the ciliary transmembrane proteins polycystin 1 (<italic>PKD1</italic>) and polycystin 2 (<italic>PKD2</italic>) underlie ADPKD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hughes et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mochizuki et al., 1996</xref>). Both proteins are components of a receptor-channel complex that responds to local second messenger signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harris and Torres, 2014</xref>). Accordingly, a ciliary hypothesis has been formulated that implicates defective calcium and cAMP signaling in the ciliary compartment as a factor in disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ma et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Winyard and Jenkins, 2011</xref>).</p><p>A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) spatially constrain second messenger regulated kinases, protein phosphatases, and GTPase effector proteins within subcellular compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bucko and Scott, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Langeberg and Scott, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Omar and Scott, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Smith et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Taskén and Aandahl, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Whiting et al., 2015</xref>). Several AKAPs participate in renal signaling, yet only a few anchoring proteins reside in cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Choi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gopalan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">May et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stefan et al., 2007</xref>). Ciliary AKAPs are postulated to position protein kinase A (PKA) as a negative regulator of hedgehog signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Breslow et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mukhopadhyay et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Somatilaka et al., 2020</xref>). AKAP220 is a multifunctional anchoring protein that sequesters PKA, GSK3, the Rho GTPase effector IQGAP-1, and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Logue et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schillace and Scott, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Whiting et al., 2015</xref>). Each AKAP220-binding partner is implicated in local signaling events that potentiate ADPKD. PKA and PP1 bi-directionally control signaling in the ciliary compartment, whereas reduced Rho GTPase activity contributes to expansion of renal cysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Parnell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ye et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Here, we show that AKAP220KO mice exhibit enhanced development of primary cilia. Mechanistic studies reveal that AKAP220 associated PP1 drives this phenotype by promoting changes in actin dynamics and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) stability. Changes in local HDAC6 activity alters cilia development and reduces cystogenesis in cellular models of ADPKD. These findings point toward the AKAP220-PPI-HDAC6 pathway as a signaling center for the control of ciliary development and a potential target for the HDAC6 inhibitor drug tubacin.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Loss of AKAP220 promotes renal cilia assembly</title><p>AKAP220 modulates cytoskeletal signaling events through its ability to recruit kinases, phosphatases and the small GTPase effector protein, IQGAP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Logue et al., 2011</xref>).

Immunoblot analysis confirmed the loss of AKAP220 in two independent clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>, top panel, lanes 2 and 3). GAPDH was used as loading control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>, bottom panel). Immunofluorescent detection of primary cilia in each AKAP220KO clone measured an 8- to 10-fold increase in the percentage of ciliated cells in comparison to wild-type mIMCD3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L–O</xref>). Quantification is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1O</xref>. Serum starvation is typically used to ciliate mIMCD3 cells in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Westlake et al., 2011</xref>). However, serum starvation of AKAP220KO cell lines enhanced detection of multi-ciliated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–G</xref>). This made single cell quantification less accurate. For this reason, all further analyzes were conducted in asynchronous cultures. Rescue experiments allowed us to attribute the increases in cilia to loss of AKAP220 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1P–U</xref>). AKAP220KO cells were transfected with a GFP-tagged AKAP220 construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1P</xref>). Immunofluorescent detection of Arl13b (red) detected cilia and GFP-fluorescence confirmed rescue with the anchoring protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Q and R</xref>). GFP served as a control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1S and T</xref>). Quantification from three independent experiments confirmed that rescue with AKAP220 dramatically reduced the number of ciliated cells as compared to rescue with GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1U</xref>).</p><p>Since another anchoring protein AKAP150 has been detected in primary cilia, it was important to establish if this AKAP also contributed to primary cilia development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Choi et al., 2011</xref>). Gene-editing was used to generate mIMCD3 cells lacking AKAP150. Double knockout cells lacking AKAP150 and AKAP220 were also produced. Immunofluorescent detection of ARl13b (green) and acetyl-tubulin (red) as ciliary markers revealed that the loss of AKAP150 alone had no effect on cilia development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A &amp; B</xref>). Yet, a pronounced increase in the ciliated population was observed in AKAP220/150 double knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C &amp; D</xref>). These additional studies indicate that AKAP150 signaling does not support renal ciliogenesis.</p><p>Renal spheroids recapitulate features of ductal architecture for disease modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Giles et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1V</xref>).

Hence, we reasoned that the enhanced detection of acetylated tubulin in AKAP220KO cells may be a consequence of reduced HDAC6 activity. Five complementary methods tested this postulate. First, immunofluorescent detection of HDAC6 (cyan) confirmed its enhanced compartmentalization at the base of primary cilia in wild-type mIMCD3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Conversely, the subcellular distribution of HDAC6 was altered in AKAP220KO mIMCD3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This is most apparent in the gray scale images representing HDAC6 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F &amp; H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B &amp; D</xref>). Second, immunoblot analysis of HDAC6 protein in mIMCD3 cell lysates detected reduced levels of the deacetylase in cells that lack AKAP220, as compared to wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>, top panel, lane 2). GAPDH served as a loading control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>, bottom panel). Amalgamated data from five independent experiments indicated that deletion of AKAP220 correlated with a 50% reduction of total HDAC6 in mIMCD3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). This argues that interface with AKAP220 serves to stabilize HDAC6.</p><p>Third, proximity ligation assay (PLA) detected AKAP220-HDAC6 complexes in situ. This approach identifies protein-protein interactions that occur within a range of 40–60 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Whiting et al., 2015</xref>). PLA puncta indicative of AKAP220/HDAC6 complexes were detected in cells transfected with V5-tagged AKAP220 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). Gray scale image emphasizes the distribution of AKAP220/HDAC6 complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). In contrast, PLA puncta were reduced in control experiments performed in untransfected cells or in the absence of HDAC6 or V5 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M &amp; N</xref>, Sup <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–I</xref>). GFP was a transfection marker.

Cell lysates were prepared at selected time points (0–4 hr; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2P</xref>). Immunoblot detection of HDAC6 (top panel) and acetylated tubulin (mid panel) monitored the stability and activity of the de-acetylase over time. GAPDH served as a loading control (bottom panel). In wild-type mIMCD3 cells, HDAC6 protein was relatively constant and acetylated tubulin levels were low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2P</xref>, lanes 1–3). Conversely, upon loss of the anchoring protein, HDAC6 levels were markedly reduced over time and acetylated tubulin levels were elevated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2P</xref>, lanes 4–6). Densitometric analysis of HDAC6 levels in wild-type (gray) and AKAP220KO (green) from three independent experiments are presented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Q</xref>). These results show a significant decrease in HDAC6 stability in the absence of the anchoring protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2P &amp; Q</xref>). Finally, overexpression of murine HDAC6 (cyan) abrogated primary cilia formation in AKAP220KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2R &amp; S</xref>). In contrast, expression of a catalytically inactive HDAC6 mutant (H216A, H611A) had no effect on cilia formation in the AKAP220 null background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2T &amp; U</xref>). Amalgamated data from three experiments are presented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2V</xref>). Collectively, these studies implicate HDAC6 activity in AKAP220-mediated control of primary cilia development. Mechanistically, dephosphorylation of HDAC6 favors its degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ran et al., 2020</xref>). Protein phosphatase 1(PP1) is a well-characterized binding partner of AKAP220 that also interacts with this deacetylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brush et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, we reasoned that PP1 may serve as an adaptor protein that bridges HDAC6 to AKAP220 at the ciliary compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2W</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>AKAP220-anchored protein phosphatase one alters primary cilia turnover</title><p>Protein phosphatase one interacts with AKAP220 primarily through its KVQF motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schillace and Scott, 1999</xref>) and has recently been implicated in trafficking of polycystin-1 to cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Luo et al., 2019</xref>).

GAPDH was a loading control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, bottom panel). Next, we investigated if loss of the principal phosphatase targeting motif from AKAP220 alters its ability to interact with HDAC6. Immunoprecipitation of HDAC6 from wild-type mIMCD3 cells results in co-fractionation of AKAP220 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, lane 1). Importantly, co-fractionation of the anchoring protein is markedly reduced when experiments are performed in cells expressing AKAP220-ΔPP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, lane 2).

The AKAP220-associated kinase GSK3 phosporylates HDAC6 on serine 22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2010</xref>). Thus recruitment into AKAP220 signaling islands would optimally position HDAC6 for control by reversible phosphorylation. We monitored the phosphoryaltion status of Ser22 on HDAC6 in wild-type and AKAP220-ΔPP1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A &amp; B</xref>). Immunoblot detection of pSer22 HDAC6 was robust in wild-type mIMCD3 cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>, upper panel, lane 1). Importantly, the p-HDAC6 signal was reduced in cell lysates from AKAP220-ΔPP1 mIMCD3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>, upper panel, lane 2). Control experiments confirmed equivalent amounts of total HDAC6 in cell lysates from both genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>, upper panel both lanes). Thus phospho-HDAC6 levels are reduced in AKAP220-ΔPP1.</p><p>Immunofluorescence detection of p-HDAC6 provided independent confirmation of this notion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C–I</xref>). mIMCD3 cells were stained for pHDAC6 (red), AKAP220 (green). Acetyl tubulin (magenta) was used as a ciliary marker and DAPI (blue) marked nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C &amp; F</xref>). In wild-type cells, co-distribution of AKAP220 and p-HDAC6 was detected at the base of cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>, arrow). In contrast, the p-HDAC6 signal was reduced in AKAP220-ΔPP1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2G</xref>, arrow). Quantification of p-HDAC6 levels at the base of cilia in multiple cells is presented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2I</xref>). These data are consistent with dissociation of HDAC6 from the anchored kinase-phosphatase signaling complex in a manner that promotes a concomitant loss of regulation via protein phosporylation.</p><p>Next, we investigated the impact of AKAP220-ΔPP1 on ciliogenesis. Immunofluorescence experiments revealed that loss of a mere four-residue motif that enables PP1-anchoring to AKAP220 correlated with dramatically increased cilia numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E &amp; F</xref>). Arl13b (red) and acetyl tubulin (green) were used as ciliary markers and nuclei were detected by DAPI (blue). This striking phenotype is clearly portrayed in the gray scale images of Arl13b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G &amp; H</xref>). Additionally, the differential width of the three-dimensional surface plots show that primary cilia morphology is altered in the AKAP220-ΔPP1 cells, as compared to wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I &amp; J</xref>). Results from at least three independent experiments are quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3O</xref>). Parallel analyses established that acetyl-tubulin was elevated in AKAP220-ΔPP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K &amp; L</xref>). This is highlighted in insets and 3D surface plots of acetylated tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M &amp; N</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that PP1 anchoring to AKAP220 is necessary for regulation of ciliary development and its loss is sufficient to drive enhanced ciliation. We reasoned that PP1 may serve as an adaptor protein that incorporates histone deacetylase six into AKAP220 signaling complexes.</p><p>A fluorometric assay monitored HDAC6 activity in each cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3P</xref>). As expected, HDAC6 activity was reduced in AKAP220KO and AKAP220-ΔPP1, as compared to the wild-type mIMCD3 cells. Amalgamated data from four experiments are presented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3P</xref>). These findings suggest that the loss of HDAC6 activity and elevated acetylated tubulin correlate with persistence of primary cilia.</p><p>This led to a working hypothesis that AKAP220-targeted HDAC6 modulates primary cilia development. The HDAC6-selective inhibitor tubacin was used as a tool to evaluate the contribution of this enzyme activity in our mIMCD3 cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haggarty et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Q</xref>). This drug was applied to test if blocking anchored-HDAC6 activity enhanced ciliary development. In wild-type cells, application of tubacin (2 µM) increased the number of ciliated cells as assessed by immunofluorescent detection of Arl13b (red) and acetylated tubulin (green; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3R &amp; S</xref>). The gray scale image and quantification of three independent experiments reveal a 3.2-fold increase in percent ciliated cells upon pharmacologically targeting HDAC6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3T &amp; X</xref>). Co-staining with both cilia markers was necessary to delineate between cilia and acetyl-tubulin at the midbodies of dividing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3S</xref>). Importantly, no change in cilia number occurred when AKAP220-ΔPP1 cells were treated with tubacin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3U–Y</xref>). Similarly, AKAP220KO cells were unresponsive to the drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A–D</xref>). This raises the intriguing possibility that an HDAC6-PP1-AKAP220 signaling axis is the intracellular target for the drug tubacin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Z</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>AKAP220 signaling impacts cortical actin dynamics</title><p>The cytoskeleton maintains cell shape and structure by synchronizing the assembly and disassembly of actin, intermediate and tubulin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Janke and Magiera, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Klymkowsky, 1999</xref>). Covalent modification of these elements is an important facet of cytoskeletal regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Portran et al., 2017</xref>). For example, HDAC6 deacetylates the actin-binding protein cortactin to relocate it from the nucleus to its sites of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ran et al., 2015</xref>). Since HDAC6 activity is impaired in AKAP220KO and AKAP220-ΔPP1 cells, it was important to evaluate if nuclear accumulation of acetylated cortactin was enhanced. Immunofluorescent detection of acetyl-cortactin (green) was more prominent in the nuclei of AKAP220KO and AKAP220-ΔPP1 mIMCD3 cells, as compared to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,C &amp; E</xref>). This is emphasized in insets and corresponding surface plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,D &amp; F</xref>). Amalgamated data from three experiments are presented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Next, we investigated if AKAP220 signaling influences actin filament morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H–M</xref>). Immunofluorescent analyses show that AKAP220KO and AKAP220-ΔPP1 cells exhibit dramatic changes in the actin cytoskeleton (red) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H,J &amp; L</xref>). Line plot analyses (40–50 cells) reveal that total loss of the anchoring protein or disruption of HDAC6-PP1 attachment correlates with enhanced accumulation of cortical actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I,K &amp; M</xref>). These findings pointed towards defects in actin dynamics. Additionally, the distribution of unmodified cortactin was normal in mutant cells, and in a manner consistent with actin.

This sophisticated tissue-engineering approach was used to evaluate cilia development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>).

Arl13b recovery upon photobleaching was monitored over a time course of 2.5 s in wild-type (gray; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6P</xref>); AKAP220KO (green; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6Q</xref>) and AKAP220-ΔPP1(blue; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6R</xref>) mIMCD3 cells. In wild-type cells, the rate of GFP-Arl13b recovery was steady over this time-course. FRAP was more rapid and robust in AKAP220KO and AKAP220-ΔPP1 cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6S</xref>). Total Arl13b recovered in AKAP220KO is increased 22.35 ± 3% (n = 120 cilia; green; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6T</xref>) over wild-type (n=60 cilia; gray; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6T</xref>).

These studies suggest that there is a larger mobile pool of Arl13b trafficking into the mutant cilia. One plausible mechanism is that cilia in AKAP220KO and AKAP220-ΔPP1 cells lack an architectural checkpoint that gates protein movement into this organelle. A likely candidate is an f-actin barrier at the base of the cilium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6V</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>HDAC6 inhibition attenuates renal cyst formation</title><p>Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is associated with mutations in <italic>PKD1</italic> and <italic>PKD2,</italic> changes in apical actin and cilia dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Halvorson et al., 2010</xref>). This pathology is characterized by fluid-filled cysts that replace normal renal parenchyma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

We have discovered signaling events proceeding through AKAP220 that temper cilia development in kidney collecting ducts. Although it may seem paradoxical that disruption of local signaling can positively impact organellar development, it is important to note that a few AKAPs mitigate signaling events in other cellular contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bucko and Scott, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Langeberg and Scott, 2015</xref>). At neuronal synapses, tonic phosphatase activity constrained by AKAP79/150 attenuates the phosphorylation status and activity of excitatory ionotropic glutamate receptors that contribute to learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hoshi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tunquist et al., 2008</xref>). In cardiomyocytes, AKAP18 anchored phosphodiesterase-3 degrades cAMP that sustains excitation-contraction coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lygren et al., 2007</xref>). Likewise, AKAP220 binding partners repress aquaporin-2 shuttling to apical membranes of kidney collecting ducts to maintain renal water homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Whiting et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Our imaging analysis of tissue sections from AKAP220KO mice and cell lines indicate that loss of this anchoring protein enhances cilia development. Interestingly, AKAP79/150 has been implicated as a modulator of renal ciliary signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Choi et al., 2011</xref>). However, proximity proteomic approaches identify AKAP220 in cilia, and knockout of the AKAP79/150 ortholog in mIMCD3 cells and mice does not impact cilia development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">May et al., 2020</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). In contrast, our in vivo and in vitro data strongly implicate AKAP220 signaling in the modulation of aquaporin-2 trafficking and ciliogenesis. This could occur through one of two mechanisms- either the cellular signals that attenuate aquaporin-2 trafficking and diminish cilia development are processed through the same macromolecular complex, or, distinct signaling islands of AKAP220-binding partners are assembled to control each process.</p><p>A unifying principle of our study is that AKAP220-binding partners affect the development of primary cilia by enacting cytoskeletal changes at the level of actin polymerization and tubulin acetylation. This implicates deacetylation as a fundamental signal termination process that checks the rate of cilia development. Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) that targets the cytoskeletal elements alpha tubulin and cortactin has been identified as a driver of cilia disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ran et al., 2015</xref>). In concordance with this notion, data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2V</xref> show that rescue upon overexpression of HDAC6 in an AKAP220KO background restores control of ciliation. Several lines of evidence suggest a role for AKAP220 in this process. Data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> indicate that this deacetylase is more labile in the absence of the anchoring protein. While phosphorylation protects HDAC6 from ubiquitination, and dephosphorylation favors proteasomal degradation, it has been unclear how this enzyme is maintained in proximity of developing cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ran et al., 2020</xref>). Our findings point towards a previously unrecognized adaptor function for protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). This reasoning is predicated on evidence that AKAP220 is a conventional PP1-targeting subunit that utilizes a KVxF motif to contact the phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bollen et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Although the mechanism of HDAC6 interaction with PP1 is less clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brush et al., 2004</xref>), it appears that the anchored phosphatase retains the capacity to function as an adaptor protein and recruit this additional binding partner. Several lines of evidence prompted us to investigate this further- pulse-chase data showing that HDAC6 protein stability is compromised in AKAP220KO cells and proximity-ligation data detecting HDAC6 in AKAP220-signaling islands presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I–O</xref>. Further, co-immunoprecipitation experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> argue that removal of the principle PP1-interaction motif on AKAP220 negatively impacts association with HDAC6. Hence, loss of PP1-anchoring uncouples HDAC6 association with AKAP220 signaling islands.</p><p>However, our findings are equally consistent with the notion that removal of the KVXF motif on AKAP220 impedes, but does not fully abolish, PP1-anchoring. As mentioned earlier, we previously identified three secondary PP1 interactive surfaces on AKAP220 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schillace and Scott, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schillace et al., 2001</xref>). Subsequently, the notion of multisite contact between serine/threonine phosphatases and their binding partners has become a standard view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hoermann et al., 2020</xref>). Since it is not technically feasible to remove all four PP1 interactive surfaces on AKAP220 and retain a properly folded protein, we can only conclude that there is a reduced association of the PP1-HDAC6 sub complex in the context of cells expressing AKAP220-ΔPP1. Two plausible mechanistic explanations that support this conclusion. First, removal of the primary PP1 targeting motif on AKAP220 lessens binding of the PP1-HDAC6 subcomplex. Second, mutation of the KVXF motif could expose secondary HDAC6 binding determinants that could reside within AKAP220 or any of its other binding partners. Irrespective of either mechanism, we have definitively shown that HDAC6 interacts with AKAP220. Moreover, loss of PP1 anchoring significantly impacts maintenance of HDAC6 within AKAP220 signaling islands. Thus, AKAP220-PP1 subcomplexes create a platform for the targeting of HDAC6 to repress tubulin acetylation during ciliogenesis. This may represent a homeostatic mechanism that enables cells to enter mitosis.</p><p>Mutations in the ciliary phosphoproteins polycystin 1 and 2 are linked to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hughes et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mochizuki et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Streets and Ong, 2020</xref>). Trafficking of polycystin-1 to the ciliary membrane is dependent on local PP1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Parnell et al., 2012</xref>). Likewise, bi-directional phosphorylation-dependent control of polycystin-2 channel conductance is modulated by an anchored PKA-PP1 component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Streets et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, local dephosphorylation events are key to the termination of mechanotransduction signals that govern primary cilia action in ADPKD. Using the AKAP220-ΔPP1 knock-in mutant as a mechanistic probe, we have uncovered a new non-catalytic role for anchored-PP1 in the regulation of cytoskeletal events that underlie renal cilia biogenesis. The striking changes observed in actin remodeling and cilia morphology presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> can solely be attributed to disruption of the KVXF motif in AKAP220 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schillace and Scott, 1999</xref>). Concomitant effects on HDAC6 location not only enhance cortactin acetylation, but also enact changes in actin dynamics. An additional factor to consider is that cortactin may also contribute to ciliogenesis via mechanisms that are complementary to signals proceeding through AKAP220 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bershteyn et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Such cytoskeletal reorganization at defined sites is a prelude to cilia extension. Data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F–N</xref> indicate that these effects appear to be more pronounced in live cell experiments and within the pseudo physiological environment of the kidney-on-a-chip. Focal adhesion proteins attach the basal body to actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Drummond et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). This initiates clearing of the local actin barrier to commence microtubule nucleation. In keeping with this notion, data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> show that the actin depolymerizing drug Cytochalasin D enhances cilia persistence and length, whereas the actin-stabilizing compound Jasplakinolide has the opposite effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Casella et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Holzinger, 2009</xref>). These pharmacological tools highlight the action of AKAP220-associated enzymes at the level of the actin barrier. This substructure is part of a ‘ciliary necklace’ that acts as a physical checkpoint for proteins moving into the cilium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Long and Huang, 2019</xref>). This is supported by photobleaching studies showing that Arl13b moves more readily in AKAP220-ΔPP1 mutant cilia and these organelles are approximately two fold longer than wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Thus, it is plausible that AKAP220-associated PP1 participates in maintenance of an actin barrier close to the basal body of the cilium, the loss of which leads to unhindered protein movement into the developing organelle.</p><p>Although lesions in cilia and polycystins are linked to Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD), the molecular details remain unclear and are inherently paradoxical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hughes et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mochizuki et al., 1996</xref>). Thus, searching for therapeutic approaches that modify local protein acetylation to restore functional primary cilia is a rationale behind our concluding studies in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. There are several important caveats to consider. How primary cilia can be pro-cystogenic in one context yet anti-cystogenic in another context remains a conundrum in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kolb and Nauli, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ma et al., 2013</xref>). This apparent ‘cilia paradox’ limits our ability to accurately predict how pharmacological agents targeting cilia might affect cellular models of cystogenesis or more sophisticated in vivo models. Nonetheless, HDAC6 inhibitors have been used by other groups to target cyst size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cebotaru et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yanda et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, mechanisms by which tubacin may act to inhibit cystogenesis could be less than straightforward. Particularly, given the multitude of functions for HDAC6 including control of cell morphology, cell adhesion, cell migration and tumor metastasis. Interestingly, these are known sites of action of the AKAP220 signaling complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boyault et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Logue et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wong and Scott, 2004</xref>). Thus, it is reasonable to speculate that tubacin could target the AKAP220-PP1-HDAC6 axis in these cellular contexts. On the other hand, HDAC6 also modulates a variety of cellular processes independently of the anchoring protein. Thus, we propose that tubacin action at multiple sites including the AKAP220-PP1-HDAC6 axis could impact the anti-proliferative effect on cyst formation. Therefore, pharmacologically targeting anchored-HDAC6 may not only enhance cilia development, but also interfere with certain downstream signaling events that contribute to cystogenesis. Finally, the AKAP-targeting concept has recently been used to restrain kinase inhibitor drugs at defined subcellular locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bucko et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bucko et al., 2020</xref>). We intend to expand this approach toward developing a precision pharmacology strategy to selectively deliver HDAC6 inhibitors to the base of primary cilia for the treatment of ciliopathies including chronic polycystic kidney diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

id="s4-1-1"><title>Knockout vector</title><p>The KO vector was generated using a Bacmid (Children’s Hospital Oakland Research Institute, clone RP23-239B21). Vega Biolabs engineered a retrieval plasmid containing arms of homology flanking the target sequence to capture ∼14 kb of genomic <italic>Akap11</italic> locus. LoxP sites were added to intronic regions surrounding exons 6 and 7 and a Neo cassette flanked by two Frt sites (removed by breeding with mice expressing FLP recombinase). <italic>HSV-TK</italic>I cassette served as negative selection marker (outside the <italic>Akap11</italic> genomic sequence). ES cell clones were grown in the presence of fialuridine. Southern blot band shift identified incorporation of BamHI and StuI sites into genomic DNA. Further details of ES cell electroporation, Cell screening, chimera production and FRT-FLP and Cre-lox breeding of AKAP220KO mice can be found in our earlier publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Whiting et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-2"><title>Genotyping</title><p>Genotyping the floxed <italic>Akap11</italic> allele was done with primers used in ES cell screening.

Full genotyping of global KO animals requires the WT and collapsed PCR reactions. Heterozygous animals have PCR products present in both reactions, whereas homozygotes are positive for only the WT or collapsed allele.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Tissue section immunofluorescent staining</title><p>Wild-type and AKAP220KO mice kidneys were fixed in 10% (vol/vol) buffered formalin (4°C), embedded in paraffin and 4-μm-thick sections collected.

The viral particles generated are filtered and added to mIMCD3 cells. After 24 hr of incubation, the cells were selected in zeocin (400 ug/ml) for the next 2 weeks. After selection, the cells were trypsinized and plated at a low density of about 1 cell/well in 96-well plate, expanded and tested for expression of Arl13b-GFP by western blotting and immunofluorescence.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Immunoblotting and blot analysis</title><p>Cells were grown to the desired confluence and washed once with PBS at room temperature. Cold lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES, [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% triton X-100 in water) was added along with protease and phosphatase inhibitors and the plate was rocked gently at 4°C for 10 min. The cell lysate was then scarped into a pre-chilled tube and cleared at 12,000*g for 10 min at 4°C. A BCA assay (Pierce) was used to determine protein concentrations, and 30 µg of protein was loaded onto a Bolt 4–12% bis-Tris gel (Life Technologies). The cleared lysate was boiled in 2X SDS loading buffer for 10 min before loading. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and blocked in either 5% milk. The blot was incubated in primary antibody at 1:1000 or as specified by the manufacturer overnight at 4°C. Immunoblots were washed (three times, 10 min each) in TBST before incubation in a 1:10,000 secondary antibody for 1 hr at room temperature. Immunoblots were washed again in TBST (three times, 10 min each) before imaging on an iBright FL1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with SuperSignal Dura ECL reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Densitometry for blot quantification was done using thermo fisher’s software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Sample preparation</title><p>Cells were seeded on acid-washed coverslips in 12-well plates.

After fixation, the cells were permeabilized in PBS+0.1%Triton x-100+1%BSA for 12 min, blocked with 2%BSA for 30 min and treated with the respective primary antibodies overnight. After thorough washing in PBS the next day (three times, 5 min each), secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa fluor dyes were added for 2 hr. After two washes in PBS, DAPI along with or without the actin probe (based on the experiment) was added for 10 min.

Transfections were performed according to manufacturer’s protocol for Mirus-LT1 reagent. Twenty-four hrs after transfection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 15 min. Cells were then subjected to PLA according to manufacturer’s instructions (Duolink Proximity Ligation Assay, Sigma). V5 (Invitrogen, #R960-25, 1:500) and HDAC6 (Proteintech, #12834–1-AP, 1:200) antibodies were used to probe the samples. Z-stacks of fluorescent images were collected using a Keyence BZ-X710 with relevant filter cubes. Maximum intensity projections were made for each image and regions of interest (ROIs) were selected based on EGFP expression. Puncta number and fluorescence intensity were measured by automation using Keyence hybrid cell counter set to detect thresholded puncta between 0 and 1.0 µm in diameter.

revisions, shown below. We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>The initial observation that kicks off this interesting work, that AKAP220 loss of function increases ciliogenesis, is particularly dramatic. This result is important in itself, as negative regulators of ciliogenesis have been a subject of study, but mechanisms limiting ciliogenesis, particularly in vivo, are not well understood. The revised work bolsters the finding that AKAP220 controls HDAC6 function via PP1. This module, with PP1 as a structural component of a ternary complex, limits ciliation, at least in the collecting duct. Arriving at new insights into the regulators of ciliogenesis and ciliary PKD1/2 signaling in the kidney will be important both for understanding the variety of ciliary signaling modes, and for arriving at the biological insights that will underpin effective therapies for polycystic kidney disease.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Targeting an anchored phosphatase-deacetylase unit restores renal ciliary homeostasis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Philip Cole as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this summary to help you prepare a revised submission. The reviewers were in consensus that this work may be suitable for publication with substantial revision. They appreciated the importance of the central finding that AKAP220 knockout collecting duct cells display increased ciliation. However, there were shared concerns that data in support of AKAP220 controlling HDAC6 function via PP1 were absent. In addition, key information regarding PLA, gene editing, and kidney samples, for example, was missing from the methods section. While there was appreciation of the insight that AKAP220 limits ciliation, the clinical and translational significance of these findings was, in their minds, unclear. Therefore, their consensus was that this work will require an extensive revision before publication. We have listed four key essential revisions, below, and other points from the reviewers are included as they will be of assistance in revising this work.</p><p>Essential Revisions (for the authors):</p><p>1) Provide evidence that AKAP220 interacts with HDAC6, directly or indirectly, using means complementary to PLA.</p><p>2) Demonstrate that HDAC6 fails to bind AKAP220-deltaPP1.</p><p>3) It should be noted that, as Tubacin is an anti-proliferative agent with some toxicity and HDAC6 may function independently of AKAP22, it remains unclear whether effects on cyst growth in vitro are mediated through the identified AKAP22-HDAC6 mechanism.</p><p>4) Add the requested information missing from the methods section.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In investigating the origins of increased ciliation, the authors detect reduced levels of the deacetylase in cells that lack AKAP220. At least by PLA, the authors detect AKAP220-HDAC6 complexes in cells and a role for AKAP220 in stabilizing HDAC6. The authors generate a mutant form of AKAP220, AKAP220-deltaPP1, that reduces HDAC6 activity and levels. The authors advance a model that AKAP220 interacts with PP1, which activates HDAC6 (through what they assert to be an &quot;adaptor&quot; non-enzymatic mechanism) to deacetylate tubulin and inhibit cilium biogenesis. Curiously, the authors do not reference Pugacheva et al., who first demonstrated roles for HDAC6 in negatively regulating cilium biogenesis. In support of this model, the authors observe no change in cilia biogenesis when HDAC6 is inhibited in AKAP220-ΔPP1 cells, suggesting that it may already be inhibited.</p><p>HDAC6 has previously been reported to deacetylate cortactin and promote cortical actin formation. At Figure 4, the authors switch to investigating dramatically increased nuclear acetylated cortactin and enhanced accumulation of cortical actin in AKAP220 mutant cells. Whether this increase in cortactin acetylation is mediated by HDAC6 is not tested.</p><p>Cortactin has previously been shown to be a negative regulator of cilium formation, but this work by Bershteyn et al. is also not referenced. As shown previously by still others, pharmacological modulation of actin can impact ciliation and pharmacological inhibition of cortical actin increases cilium formation. This result, confirmed by the authors, would seem to imply that the increased cortical actin observed in AKAP220 mutant cells is not sufficient to account for the increased ciliation. However, I did not read where the authors come to this conclusion.</p><p>In Figure 6, the authors switch to investigating the speed of trafficking ARL13B into cilia. AKAP220 mutant cells show long cilia. FRAP of the cilia tip for ARL13B shows increased recovery in AKAP220 mutant cells. The authors conclude that there may be increased trafficking of ARL13B from the cell body in these mutants. However, to make this inclusion, the authors should FRAP the entire cilium, not a portion of the cilium.</p><p>For Figure 7, the authors return to the subject of acetylation and show that an HDAC6 inhibitor decreases cyst formation by Pkd2-/- organoids. Whether this effect is due to increased ciliation, increased tubulin acetylation, or increased cortactin acetylation is not examined.</p><p>There is a lot of data in this work, but the central point of this paper that AKAP220 may physically interact with HDAC6 (directly or indirectly) and stabilizes it. (The effects of HDAC6 downregulation secondary to loss of AKAP220 are largely in support of Ran et al. and others previous findings that HDAC6 regulates ciliogenesis, and tubulin and cortactin acetylation.) The authors don't firmly establish the central point (AKAP220 interacts with and stabilizes HDAC6). For example, the authors conflate mutation of the PP1 binding site in AKAP220 with &quot;disruption of HDAC6-PP1 attachment&quot; without ever showing that HDAC6 fails to bind the mutant form of AKAP220, AKAP220-deltaPP1. Similarly, although depicted in models, the authors never establish whether this interaction is direct or indirect, or, if indirect as depicted, via PP1.</p><p>Other concerns regarding the experimental data are:</p><p>In Figure 1L, mutant and control conditions appear to be at different confluencies, a condition that is known to affect ciliogenesis. Differences in confluency are even more apparent in Figure 2A. The authors should control for cell confluence as this variable may be affecting ciliation.</p><p>Is AKAP220-deltaPP1 expressed at similar levels as AKAP220?</p><p>The authors claim that three-dimensional surface plots show that primary cilia morphology is altered in the AKAP220-ΔPP1 cells. However, it is not apparent from the image provided that this difference is consistent, there is no quantitation of this difference, and it is not clear that the imaging is of sufficient resolution to distinguish subtle differences in morphology.</p><p>In Figure 2, Western blot is used to argue that acetylated tubulin levels are affected by AKAP220 loss, whereas in Figure 3, imaging is used to argue that acetylated levels are affected by AKAP220 mutation. I suspect that the Western blot is more quantitative, so should be used in Figure 3. Regardless, consistency of approach would allow the reader to distinguish whether AKAP220 KO and deltaPP1 have similar or distinct effects on tubulin acetylation.</p><p>The effect of AKAP220 mutations on acetylated cortactin is impressive. Does AKAP220 affect total cortactin levels and distribution?</p><p>I'm unclear how, as reported in the text, 1.75 sec is 0.85 sec less than 1.6 sec (Figure 4R). Moreover, the text reports that the FRAP recovery t<sub>1/2</sub> is 1.6 sec for wild type and 0.9 sec for AKAP220 KO cells. Based on Figure 4R, I think the text may have these values reversed.</p><p>The authors reveal that Cytochalasin D increased the percentage of ciliated wild type cells and then assert that, &quot;Similar effects were observed in AKAP220KO cells (Figure 5G-L).&quot; However, an increase in the AKAP220KO cells is not apparent and not quantified.</p><p>The authors hypothesize that AKAP220-associated PP1 promotes the formation of an actin barrier close to the basal body of the cilium. Is this actin barrier observed in the actin staining? Is this barrier disrupted in the mutant cells?</p><p>The authors assert, &quot;HDAC6 mediated deacetylation of tubulin controls cilia depolymerization.&quot; However, the authors do not measure cilia depolymerization.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The study showcases a great number of different techniques, but in its current form the methods section is not sufficiently detailed. Specifically, technical details on the proximity ligation assay are absent, and little information is provided concerning gene editing approaches including establishing the AKAP220deltaPP1 mIMCD3 cell line, and this would need to be improved.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The translational angle significantly weakens the manuscript as currently written. Both the introduction and an important part of the discussion are focused on the relevance of this study's findings to PKD, and yet the one result supporting this is inconsistent with their model (that inactivation of the AKAP220/HDAC6 pathway enhances ciliogenesis and ciliary function). At a minimum, the authors should propose an explanation for how blocking ciliogenesis in an ADPKD model attenuates disease whereas in their studies promoting ciliogenesis achieves the same effect. Alternatively, the authors might consider dropping the last experiment and refocus the study on its relevance to basic ciliary biology, or add more studies to more convincingly show the relevance of their pathway to modulating cyst growth (genetic studies in organoids and in vivo). If they pursue the latter option, they still should provide an explanation for how boosting ciliogenesis can improve disease whereas the published studies suggest the opposite.</p><p>2. The study by Sun et al., is not accurately described in the manuscript. The authors cite Sun et al. as evidence that aberrant HDAC6 activity has been implicated in cyst growth. This is not the case---the authors used a broad, multi-class HDAC inhibitor in their studies and never specifically reference HDAC6 as the likely target.</p><p>3. Some of the methods are not well described. For example, we are not told how many kidney samples, from how many mice, at what age mutants and controls were studied, and how fields were selected for analysis. For the organoid studies, they should describe the age of the organoids prior to initiating treatments and how fields were selected for quantitation given the known variability in the phenotype.</p><p>4. It appears that the authors accidentally flipped the results in their description of the FRAPing studies on pages 17-18. Both the data in Figure 4 and the movies show that the WT sections recover more quickly than do the mutant ones but the text describes the opposite.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.67828.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions (for the authors):</p><p>1) Provide evidence that AKAP220 interacts with HDAC6, directly or indirectly, using means complementary to PLA.</p><p>2) Demonstrate that HDAC6 fails to bind AKAP220-deltaPP1.</p></disp-quote><p>Points 1 and 2 can be addressed together. Our response is in three parts:</p><p>a) New biochemical data in figure 3D (lane 1) shows that immunoprecipitation of HDAC6 from mIMCD3 cells results in co-fractionation of AKAP220. Importantly, co-fractionation of the anchoring protein is markedly reduced when experiments are performed in cells expressing AKAP220-∆PP1 (Figure 3D, lane 2). Immunoblot detection of AKAP220 (top), HDAC6 (mid) and GAPDH loading controls (bottom) reveal equivalent levels of all proteins in mIMCD3 cell lysates (Figure 3D). These new data indicate that removal of the principle PP1-interaction motif on AKAP220 negatively impacts association with HDAC6. This is compatible with data from Shenolikar and colleagues reporting that PP1 directly interacts with HDAC6 (Brush et al., 2004). Hence, loss of PP1-anchoring uncouples HDAC6 association with AKAP220 signaling islands.</p><p>However, our findings are equally consistent with the notion that removal of the KVXF motif on AKAP220 impedes, but does not fully abolish, PP1-anchoring. As mentioned in the original text we previously identified three secondary PP1-interactive surfaces on AKAP220 (Schillace and Scott, 1999; Schillace et al., 2001). Our 2001 report was a seminal observation of multiple contacts between PP1 and its targeting subunits. Subsequently the notion of multisite contact between serine/threonine phosphatases and their binding partners has become a standard view (Hoermann et al., 2020).</p><p>Since it is not technically feasible to remove all four PP1-interactive surfaces on AKAP220 and express a functional protein, we can only conclude that there is a reduced association of the PP1-HDAC6 sub complex in cells expressing AKAP220-∆PP1. Two plausible mechanisms support this conclusion. First, removal of the primary PP1-targeting motif on AKAP220 lessens binding of the PP1-HDAC6 subcomplex. Second, mutation of the KVXF motif could expose secondary HDAC6 binding determinants that could reside within AKAP220 or any of its other binding partners. Irrespective of either mechanism, we have definitively shown that HDAC6 interacts with AKAP220. Moreover, loss of PP1-anchoring significantly impacts maintenance of HDAC6 within AKAP220 signaling islands. These new results are introduced on page 14, line 18 of the results and expanded upon on page 34, line 20 in the discussion.</p><p>b) HDAC6 is a phosphoprotein. The AKAP220-associated kinase GSK3 phosporylates HDAC6 on serine 22 (Chen et al., 2010). Thus recruitment into AKAP220 signaling islands would optimally position HDAC6 for control by reversible phosphorylation. With this in mind (and in response to reviewer comments) we monitored the phosphoryaltion status of Ser22 on HDAC6 in wildtype and AKAP220-∆PP1 cells (Figure 3—figure supplement 2A and B). Immunoblot detection of pSer22 HDAC6 was robust in wildtype mIMCD3 cell lysates (Figure 3—figure supplement 2A, upper panel, lane 1). Importantly, p-HDAC6 signal is reduced in cell lysates from AKAP220-∆PP1 IMCD3 cells (Figure 3—figure supplement 2A, upper panel, lane 2). Control experiments confirm equivalent amounts of total HDAC6 in cell lysates from both genotypes (Figure 3—figure supplement 2B, upper panel). Thus phospho-HDAC6 levels are reduced in cells engineered to express AKAP220-∆PP1. This result is consistant with dissociation of HDAC6 from the anchored kinase-phosphatase signaling complex in a manner that promotes a concomitant loss of regulation by protein phosporylation. These new data are intorduced on page 15, line 3.</p><p>c) Immunofluorescence detection of phospho Ser 22-HDAC6 provided independent confirmation of this later notion (Figure 3—figure supplement 2C-I). mIMCD3 cells were stained for p-HDAC6 (red), AKAP220 (green). Acetyl tubulin (magenta) was used as a ciliary marker and DAPI (blue) marked nuclei (Figure 3—figure supplement 2C and F). In wildtype cells, co-distribution of AKAP220 and p-HDAC6 was evident at the base of cilia (Figure 3—figure supplement 2D, arrow). In contrast, p-HDAC6 signals were reduced in AKAP220-∆PP1 cells (Figure 3—figure supplement 2G, arrow). Quantification of p-HDAC6 levels at the base of cilia in multiple cells is presented Figure 3—figure supplement 2I. Please note antibody compatabilty issues prevented us from measuring total HDAC6 in situ.</p><p>The new data shows that HDAC6 is a component of AKAP220 signaling islands by two methods complimentary to PLA. Also, HDAC6 binding is reduced in mIMCD3 cells engineered to express AKAP220-∆PP1. This information has been incorporated into Figure 3D, and Figure 3—figure supplement 2A-I. The results are discussed in detail beginning on page 34, line 20.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It should be noted that, as Tubacin is an anti-proliferative agent with some toxicity and HDAC6 may function independently of AKAP22, it remains unclear whether effects on cyst growth in vitro are mediated through the identified AKAP22-HDAC6 mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a valid point. HDAC6 modulates a variety of cellular functions including control of cell morphology, cell adhesion and migration and tumor metastasis. Interestingly these are known sites of action of the AKAP220 signaling complexes (Boyault et al., 2007; Logue et al., 2011; Wong and Scott, 2004). Thus, it is reasonable to speculate that tubacin could target the AKAP220-PP1-HDAC6 axis in these cellular contexts.</p><p>These points notwithstanding, the reviewers are correct in asking us to acknowledge that HDAC6 also modulates a variety of cellular processes independently of the anchoring protein. These are likely to include control of immune cell interactions and modulation of the unfolded protein response (Hideshima et al., 2016). We hope that qualifying our conclusions by stating that the AKAP220-PP1-HDAC6 axis is a new, but not the only molecular target for Tubacin satisfactorily responds to the reviewer concerns. Also, we now state that tubacin action at multiple sites could impact the anti-proliferative effect on cyst formation. These statements are introduced on page 31, line 7 of the results and expanded upon on page 37, line 6 of the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Add the requested information missing from the methods section.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the requested information in the methods, in particular details about the proximity ligation assays, cell lines generated by CRISPR Cas9 gene editing, production of the mouse knock out and culturing of iPSC organoids.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In investigating the origins of increased ciliation, the authors detect reduced levels of the deacetylase in cells that lack AKAP220.

The primary cilium is a microscopic structure. Thus, a recognized to caveat of this approach is that photobleaching the entire cilium can negatively affect the base of the organelle (Blasius et al., 2019). To limit damage, we chose to selectively photobleach the tips of cilia. This method also allowed us to target only the region of interest and ensure that we were measuring protein recovery at the correct location. Another advantage to this method is that it by-passes artifacts that can be introduced because extended regions of the primary cilia can drift in and out of focus during the time course of the experiment.

(The effects of HDAC6 downregulation secondary to loss of AKAP220 are largely in support of Ran et al. and others previous findings that HDAC6 regulates ciliogenesis, and tubulin and cortactin acetylation.) The authors don't firmly establish the central point (AKAP220 interacts with and stabilizes HDAC6). For example, the authors conflate mutation of the PP1 binding site in AKAP220 with &quot;disruption of HDAC6-PP1 attachment&quot; without ever showing that HDAC6 fails to bind the mutant form of AKAP220, AKAP220-deltaPP1. Similarly, although depicted in models, the authors never establish whether this interaction is direct or indirect, or, if indirect as depicted, via PP1.</p></disp-quote><p>This important issue fully addressed in the response to essential revisions 1 and 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other concerns regarding the experimental data are:</p><p>In Figure 1L, mutant and control conditions appear to be at different confluencies, a condition that is known to affect ciliogenesis. Differences in confluency are even more apparent in Figure 2A. The authors should control for cell confluence as this variable may be affecting ciliation.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an important point about cell confluence affecting ciliation. The three cell types used in the study were consistently plated at the same density and treated with drugs/imaged under the same conditions. We noted early on that the AKAP220KO or AKAP220-∆PP1 appear less confluent and cover the entire coverslip faster than wildtype. This phenomenon appears to involve differential coupling to the integrins and cadherins that is the topic a separate manuscript currently in preparation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is AKAP220-deltaPP1 expressed at similar levels as AKAP220?</p></disp-quote><p>New data presented Figure 3D shows that AKAP220 and AKAP220-deltaPP1 are expressed at comparable levels. This is discussed on page 14, line 18.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors claim that three-dimensional surface plots show that primary cilia morphology is altered in the AKAP220-ΔPP1 cells. However, it is not apparent from the image provided that this difference is consistent, there is no quantitation of this difference, and it is not clear that the imaging is of sufficient resolution to distinguish subtle differences in morphology.</p></disp-quote><p>We recognize that the 3D plots are challenging to interpret. Yet, differences in height and width of the plotted data between wildtype and AKAP220-deltaPP1 concisely indicate the morphological differences between two cell types. We now emphasize this point on page 16, line 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 2, Western blot is used to argue that acetylated tubulin levels are affected by AKAP220 loss, whereas in Figure 3, imaging is used to argue that acetylated levels are affected by AKAP220 mutation. I suspect that the Western blot is more quantitative, so should be used in Figure 3. Regardless, consistency of approach would allow the reader to distinguish whether AKAP220 KO and deltaPP1 have similar or distinct effects on tubulin acetylation.</p><p>The effect of AKAP220 mutations on acetylated cortactin is impressive. Does AKAP220 affect total cortactin levels and distribution?</p></disp-quote><p>Cortactin distribution is also altered in the AKAP220 mutant cells. This is now mentioned in the text on page 20, line 21.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I'm unclear how, as reported in the text, 1.75 sec is 0.85 sec less than 1.6 sec (Figure 4R). Moreover, the text reports that the FRAP recovery t<sub>1/2</sub> is 1.6 sec for wild type and 0.9 sec for AKAP220 KO cells. Based on Figure 4R, I think the text may have these values reversed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for catching this. The word “reduction” should have been “increase”. We have changed the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors reveal that Cytochalasin D increased the percentage of ciliated wild type cells and then assert that, &quot;Similar effects were observed in AKAP220KO cells (Figure 5G-L).&quot; However, an increase in the AKAP220KO cells is not apparent and not quantified.</p></disp-quote><p>While cytochalasin D treatment led to a modest increase in AKAP220KO and AKAP220-∆PP1 cilia numbers, these cells displayed developed longer cilia upon drug treatment (Figure 6G-M and Figure 6—figure supplement 1). This leads us to consider if actin depolymerization also elongates cilia by allowing proteins to move freely into the organelle. We have altered the text on page 24, line 12 to reflect the difference between the cell types more accurately.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors hypothesize that AKAP220-associated PP1 promotes the formation of an actin barrier close to the basal body of the cilium. Is this actin barrier observed in the actin staining? Is this barrier disrupted in the mutant cells?</p></disp-quote><p>Visualizing the actin barrier at the base of the cilium has been a challenge as actin is so prevalent in the cell. However, we note of actin redistribution is altered in the mutants, there is slower recovery of actin after photobleaching and ARL13b tracks more rapidly into mutant cilia. Taken together these observations allow us to postulate that changes in actin at the base of cilia may contribute to the extended cilia phenotypes that we are reporting. This is something we are interested in pursuing as a future line of investigation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors assert, &quot;HDAC6 mediated deacetylation of tubulin controls cilia depolymerization.&quot; However, the authors do not measure cilia depolymerization.</p></disp-quote><p>With all due respect to reviewer 1 we cannot find this statement in the text or figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The study showcases a great number of different techniques, but in its current form the methods section is not sufficiently detailed. Specifically, technical details on the proximity ligation assay are absent, and little information is provided concerning gene editing approaches including establishing the AKAP220deltaPP1 mIMCD3 cell line, and this would need to be improved.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for bringing this up. We have improved the ‘methods’ section. (See response 4 to the essential revisions) The expanded methods section begins on page 53.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. The translational angle significantly weakens the manuscript as currently written. Both the introduction and an important part of the discussion are focused on the relevance of this study's findings to PKD, and yet the one result supporting this is inconsistent with their model (that inactivation of the AKAP220/HDAC6 pathway enhances ciliogenesis and ciliary function). At a minimum, the authors should propose an explanation for how blocking ciliogenesis in an ADPKD model attenuates disease whereas in their studies promoting ciliogenesis achieves the same effect. Alternatively, the authors might consider dropping the last experiment and refocus the study on its relevance to basic ciliary biology, or add more studies to more convincingly show the relevance of their pathway to modulating cyst growth (genetic studies in organoids and in vivo). If they pursue the latter option, they still should provide an explanation for how boosting ciliogenesis can improve disease whereas the published studies suggest the opposite.</p></disp-quote><p>We respect the reviewer’s opinion that <bold>“</bold>translational angle significantly weakens the manuscript” and have softened aspects of the abstract, introduction and discussion (see public response to reviewer 3). These sections have been amended to deemphasize a link to Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. As mandated in the essential revisions we now state that tubacin is an anti-proliferative agent with some toxicity. We further acknowledge that pools of HDAC6 not associated with AKAP220 will be suspectable to the drug. Thus, targeting the AKAP220-PP1-HDAC6 axis may represent one of several pharmacological effects associated with this drug. We hope that these changes beginning on line 1 of the abstract, page 3, line 10 of the introduction, page 31, line 7 of the results and page 37, line 6 of the discussion reflect reviewer 3’s concern that we over emphasized the “translational aspects “of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The study by Sun et al., is not accurately described in the manuscript. The authors cite Sun et al. as evidence that aberrant HDAC6 activity has been implicated in cyst growth. This is not the case---the authors used a broad, multi-class HDAC inhibitor in their studies and never specifically reference HDAC6 as the likely target.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included a more appropriate reference that specifically substantiates our point about aberrant activity HDAC6 in cyst growth.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Some of the methods are not well described. For example, we are not told how many kidney samples, from how many mice, at what age mutants and controls were studied, and how fields were selected for analysis. For the organoid studies, they should describe the age of the organoids prior to initiating treatments and how fields were selected for quantitation given the known variability in the phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added more details about our mice and organoid experiments to bolster the methods section beginning on page 53.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. It appears that the authors accidentally flipped the results in their description of the FRAPing studies on pages 17-18. Both the data in Figure 4 and the movies show that the WT sections recover more quickly than do the mutant ones but the text describes the opposite.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for catching this. The word “reduction” should have been “increase”. This has been corrected in the text.</p></body></sub-article></article>
