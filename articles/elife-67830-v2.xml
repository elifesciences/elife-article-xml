The specificity of Watson–Crick–Franklin base pairing, its tunable affinity, the well-defined structural properties of the double helix, and its modular nature make the DNA scaffold highly engineerable. A wide array of functional DNA-based nanodevices have been deployed in vivo both for quantitative chemical imaging and also as programmable carriers that deliver encapsulated cargo upon receipt of a molecular cue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chakraborty et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chakraborty et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jani et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krishnan and Bathe, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Modi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Narayanaswamy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Saha et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sharma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Surana et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Thekkan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Veetil et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhao et al., 2012</xref>). However, in most contexts, the site for payload action ideally needs to be confined to the desired organ or tissue. Thus, if DNA nanodevices can be targeted tissue-specifically in a live, multicellular organism, it would significantly expand their potential utility in biomedicine and fundamental biology.</p><p>Nature solves the problem of transporting poorly permeable molecules across membrane barriers, either releasing or enriching them tissue-specifically, by membrane trafficking. DNA nanostructures are particularly amenable to endosomal trafficking, which has in part led to an array of synthetic DNA nanostructures being presently deployed in living systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bujold et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chakraborty et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krishnan et al., 2020</xref>). Endosomal trafficking is ubiquitous: it regulates the internalization, sorting, and intracellular transport of diverse cargo, and is pivotal to development, signaling, and homeostasis. The significance and impact of endocytosis in health and disease is underscored by the observation that perturbations in endosomal trafficking are linked to multiple diseases, including neurodegeneration, cancer, and cardiovascular disease, and further, distinct cell types differ in their susceptibility to disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maxfield, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mellman and Yarden, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mukherjee et al., 1997</xref>). By leveraging membrane trafficking as well as taking advantage of biological barriers present in the whole organism, we show that DNA nanodevices can be targeted tissue-specifically and with organelle-level precision in the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>.</p><p>Most studies that use DNA nanostructures as reporters or payload carriers describe their functionality primarily in cultured cells that express scavenger receptors for which DNA is the natural ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Modi et al., 2009</xref>). In vivo studies in multicellular organisms have also exploited scavenger receptor-mediated endocytosis to target DNA architectures to phagocytic cells such as coelomocytes in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Surana et al., 2011</xref>) or microglia in <italic>Danio rerio</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Veetil et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). However, since most cells and tissues do not endogenously express scavenger receptors, targeting DNA nanostructures to such cell types in vivo remains challenging. In cultured cells, this problem is circumvented by exploiting naturally occurring receptor-ligand interactions. The natural ligand is chemically conjugated to a DNA nanodevice, which then binds its cognate receptor on the cell surface and gets internalized and transported within the cell along the trafficking route adopted by the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhatia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jani et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Modi et al., 2013</xref>). Alternately, a synthetic receptor-ligand interaction has been used where the receptor is a sequence-specific, DNA-binding protein based on a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Modi et al., 2013</xref>). When the scFv is fused to a trafficking protein such as furin, and the chimera is expressed in cells, furin displays the synthetic scFv receptor on the cell surface. Thus, DNA nanodevices with an scFv-binding sequence engage the scFv domain of the chimera and get trafficked to specific organelles within the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Modi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Saminathan et al., 2021</xref>). Despite these in cellulo demonstrations, there is still no evidence that DNA nanostructures can be targeted to tissues lacking scavenger receptors in multicellular organisms.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic of strategies to target DNA devices to different cell types.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) DNA nanodevices are intrinsically targeted to coelomocytes via the endogenously expressed scavenger receptors. (<bold>b</bold>) DNA nanodevices that display a dsRNA (green) domain are targeted to intestinal epithelial cells by engaging endogenously expressed SID-2 receptors.

We have focused on two tissues where endosomal trafficking has been linked to critical physiological functions, namely, the intestine and the nervous system. In the first instance, we exploit the presence of endogenous SID-2 receptors on the intestine to target a DNA nanostructure along the endo-lysosomal pathway in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). In the second, we present a generalizable route to target DNA nanostructures to cells lacking both scavenger receptors or SID-2 receptors. Here, we use a synthetic receptor, namely, a newly identified, recombinant, single-domain antibody (9E) that tightly binds a specific 4-nt sequence of dsDNA. When 9E is fused to the synaptic vesicle protein synaptobrevin-1 (SNB-1) and selectively expressed in neurons, the SNB-1::9E chimera binds DNA nanodevices having the cognate 4-nt domain and localizes them in trafficking endosomes in neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).</p><p>By leveraging the amenability of <italic>C. elegans</italic> to transgenesis, we demonstrate the molecular adaptability of this strategy. By expressing SNB-1::9E under promoters expressing in specific sets of neurons, we show that DNA nanodevices can be targeted to trafficking endosomes in specific neurons. We then demonstrate subcellular control over targeting afforded by this synthetic system. We further show that post-targeting, DNA nanodevices retain their functionality as reporters for chemical imaging. DNA nanodevices can be displayed on the neuronal surface without invoking their entry into organelles. When 9E is genetically fused to the transmembrane odorant receptor ODR-2 and expressed under a neuron-specific promoter, it binds and positions a DNA nanodevice on the neuronal surface. The small size, stability, and pH insensitivity of 9E make this two-component system immediately suitable for a multitude of DNA architectures bearing the cognate 4-nt sequence. Moreover, it offers a versatile route to target diverse proteins or track endosomal transport trajectories in different cell types in vivo, especially in model organisms amenable to transgenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Targeting DNA nanodevices to IECs</title><p>The intestine is one of the major organs of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, comprising a third of the total somatic mass with 20 large epithelial cells positioned with bilateral symmetry, forming a long tube around a lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altun and Hall, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McGhee, 2007</xref>). IECs contain prominent, birefringent gut granules that are known as lysosome-related organelles (LROs). Distinguished by lysosomal markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coburn and Gems, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dell’Angelica et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hermann et al., 2005</xref>), LROs play important roles in production and storage of melanin, immune defense, and neurological function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huizing et al., 2008</xref>). We first sought to target a simple DNA nanodevice comprising a 38-bp double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) bearing a 5′ Alexa-647 (A647), denoted D<sup>38</sup>, to label LROs in the intestinal epithelia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We reasoned that the biological barrier between the intestinal lumen and the pseudocoelom would effectively preclude D<sup>38</sup> from access to coelomocytes, as seen whenever DNA nanodevices are microinjected in the pseudocoelom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhatia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Surana et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>We therefore utilized a liquid-feeding method to introduce 1 μM of D<sup>38</sup> into the intestinal lumen of 1-day adult worms (M&amp;M). We leveraged the high autofluorescence of LROs at shorter wavelengths to regions of interest (ROIs) to evaluate the efficacy of D<sup>38</sup> uptake. The mean intensity corresponding to D<sup>38</sup> uptake, compared to control mock-fed worms, was very low, indicating low or no intrinsic targetability of DNA nanodevices to IECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b</xref>). We therefore varied the size of the DNA nanodevice to test whether increasing the number of base pairs (bp) and/or negative charges improved targeting, the sequences of which are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. Using the same liquid-feeding method, we repeated uptake experiments with 50- or 100-bp-long dsDNA (D<sup>50</sup> or D<sup>100</sup>). Again, there was no enhancement in nanodevice targeting to IECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>).

All dsRNAs carried a fluorescent Alexa647 label at their 5′ termini. Interestingly, when worms were liquid-fed either R<sup>100</sup> or R<sup>50</sup> we observed that uptake efficiency by intestinal epithelia increased approximately two fold compared to their DNA analogues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>).</p><p>We therefore sought to test whether covalently attaching R<sup>100</sup> or R<sup>50</sup> to a DNA nanodevice would promote nanodevice entry into the intestinal epithelia via the SID-2 receptor, and potentially label LROs. Using click chemistry, we conjugated R<sup>100</sup> to DNA nanodevices D<sup>38</sup>, D<sup>50</sup>, or D<sup>100</sup> bearing Alexa647 labels to give chimeric RNA-DNA nanodevices denoted R<sup>100</sup>D<sup>38</sup>, R<sup>100</sup>D<sup>50</sup>, and R<sup>100</sup>D<sup>100</sup>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c,d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jewett et al., 2010</xref>). When nematodes were liquid-fed the above chimeras and then imaged, we found that overall conjugating R<sup>100</sup> to DNA nanodevices improved uptake of the latter by IECs. However, interestingly, we observed that the length of the dsDNA scaffold had no significant effect on uptake efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d,e</xref>). Thus, it is possible to target DNA nanodevices to IECs using a DNA-RNA chimera.</p><p>Closer scrutiny revealed that R<sup>50</sup>D<sup>n</sup> nanodevices internalized by intestinal epithelia localized to LROs, readily identified by their high autofluorescence at low wavelengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Soukas et al., 2013</xref>), as well as colocalization with LAMP-1::GFP and GLO::1-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schroeder et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Soukas et al., 2013</xref>). In order to confirm the identity of the receptor responsible for the uptake of the chimeric nanodevices into LROs, we repeated uptake assays in worms carrying mutant alleles for <italic>sid-1</italic> and <italic>sid-2</italic>, two critical players of the RNAi pathway. Homozygous animals for the <italic>sid-1(qt9</italic>) null allele are systemically resistant to RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Winston et al., 2002</xref>). The s<italic>id-2</italic> locus is embedded within an intron of another gene (<italic>dyf-2</italic>), and the only available strong loss-of-function allele (<italic>gk505</italic>) for <italic>sid-2</italic> contains a 403-bp deletion, which removes the first <italic>sid-2</italic> exon and the 12th <italic>dyf-2</italic> exon. As a control for the <italic>dyf-2&amp;ZK520.2(gk505)</italic> strain (referred to here as, <italic>sid-2&amp;dyf-2)</italic>, we used animals carrying the <italic>dyf-2(gk678</italic>) mutant allele that selectively disrupts the <italic>dyf-2</italic> gene . Wild-type (N2 strain), <italic>dyf-2, sid-1,</italic> and <italic>sid-2&amp;dyf-2</italic> worms were tested for their ability to uptake R<sup>100</sup>D<sup>50</sup> as previously described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d,e</xref>). We found that uptake was reduced in <italic>sid-2&amp;dyf-2</italic> mutants, but not in <italic>sid-1(qt9</italic>), <italic>dyf-2(gk678</italic>), or wild-type worms. Our results are consistent with SID-2 being localized on the extracellular surface, acting as a receptor that binds and endocytoses dsRNA, while SID-1 is resident in endosomes, where it binds dsRNA cargo and transports it into the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jose and Hunter, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McEwan et al., 2012</xref>).

However, neurons do not express either scavenger receptors or SID proteins, complicating the targeting of DNA nanodevices to these cell types. We therefore developed a DNA-binding, recombinant, humanized V<sub>H</sub>H as a synthetic receptor for DNA nanodevices. This offers the advantage of tagging endogenously expressed proteins in any cell of choice rather than ectopically expressing canonical DNA-binding proteins that could have unknown biological effects. The small size of these antibodies, the ability to select them by display technologies, and tune their affinity, stability, and expression by molecular evolution have led to a plethora of in vivo applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Winter et al., 1994</xref>). Humanized V<sub>H</sub>H antibodies lack a light chain altogether, and the heavy chain itself is sufficient to form the antigen-binding pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hamers et al., 1993</xref>), leading to their utility in therapeutics as well as cell biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harmsen and De Haard, 2007</xref>).

Next, 160 clones were randomly selected, grown in 96-well plates, and the corresponding phage bound V<sub>H</sub>H antibodies were expressed and screened for dsDNA binders. Nearly 70% displayed DNA-binding properties, of which 40 bound DNA regardless of whether it was double- or single-stranded.

These corresponded to the full 41-mer dsDNA target and three shorter dsDNA regions R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, and R<sub>M</sub> on the target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Region R<sub>1</sub> corresponded to a 17-bp region at the 3′ terminus of the biotinylated ssDNA oligonucleotide (nucleotides in red and blue font), R<sub>2</sub> corresponded to a 17-bp region on the 5′ end of the oligonucleotide (nucleotides in green font), while R<sub>M</sub> corresponded to a 17-bp overlapping the 5′ end of R<sub>1</sub> and the 3′ of R<sub>2</sub> shown in italics. Of the 42-dsDNA-binding V<sub>H</sub>H antibodies tested, nearly 80% specifically bound region R<sub>1</sub>, albeit with varying affinities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To pinpoint the epitope on the 17-bp region R<sub>1</sub>, partial duplexes were tested covering this region with a sliding window of 4-bp from the 3′ end of the biotinylated oligonucleotide to form dsDNAs R<sub>3</sub> and R<sub>6</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). This strategy ensured that the epitope could be narrowed down to at least 4-bp. ELISAs revealed that each of the 42 V<sub>H</sub>H antibodies required only the first 4-bp at the 3′ end of region R<sub>1</sub> (ATAA, nucleotides in red) for binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). When this 4-bp sequence is present not at the terminus, but in the middle of the dsDNA duplex, as in R<sub>6</sub>, it was no longer a ligand for any of the 42 V<sub>H</sub>H antibodies. This clearly demonstrated that the minimal binding epitope for all 42 V<sub>H</sub>H antibodies isolated was a terminal d(ATAA) motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Furthermore, since endocytic events are accompanied by lumenal pH changes, it is crucial to test whether binding between the V<sub>H</sub>H antibody to its cognate DNA epitope is pH-independent. From a pH-dependent ELISA screen, we identified that the V<sub>H</sub>H 9E was disrupted the least by acidification, demonstrating ~82% binding even at pH 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Finally, based on ELISA, we estimated that the relative binding affinity of V<sub>H</sub>H 9E to its target epitope was ~200 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref><bold>,</bold> Materials and methods). Cumulatively, our findings show that the recombinant, humanized V<sub>H</sub>H antibody 9E binds with high specificity to a 3′ terminal, d(ATAA) region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Pan-neuronal expression of the SNB-1::9E chimera in <italic>C. elegans</italic></title><p>Next, we tested whether DNA nanodevices could be targeted to neuronal endosomes by genetically fusing 9E, the DNA-binding V<sub>H</sub>H antibody identified above, with a protein such as synaptobrevin-1 (SNB-1), that is expressed in neurons and undergoes endosomal trafficking. Our choice of synaptobrevin-1 as a carrier protein was guided by it being an integral membrane protein present in multiple copies in synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dittman and Ryan, 2009</xref>). It has a low molecular weight (~16 kDa) and its N-terminal cytoplasmic domain interacts with target membrane SNARE (t-SNARE) proteins to facilitate neurotransmitter exocytosis, while its C-terminus has a hydrophobic patch that anchors it to vesicular membranes. The C-terminus ends in a short tail that extends into the vesicular lumen and is exposed to the synaptic cleft during exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hanson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Südhof, 1995</xref>).

Thus, if DNA nanodevices bearing a terminal d(ATAA) motif were present in the pseudocoelom, they could bind the V<sub>H</sub>H domain (blue) of the chimera at the synaptic cleft and get trafficked along the endosomal pathway (Scheme 1).

The strain <italic>otIs355 [rab-3p(prom1)::2xNLS::TagRFP]</italic> expresses nuclear RFP pan-neuronally, whereas <italic>otIs45 [unc-119::GFP]</italic> expresses cytosolic GFP pan-neuronally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altun-Gultekin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nguyen et al., 2016</xref>). The <italic>jsIs682 [rab-3p::GFP::rab-3 + lin-15(+)]</italic> strain expresses GFP::RAB-3 in most neurons, which is localized primarily to synaptic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mahoney et al., 2006</xref>). Hermaphrodites carrying the p<italic>snb-1::snb-1::9E</italic> transgene were crossed with each of the aforementioned reporter strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Interestingly, nD<sup>A647N</sup> containing puncta do not exclusively colocalize with GFP::RAB-3-positive puncta within the same axon. To evaluate colocalization, we plotted line profiles for ROIs drawn perpendicular to long axis of different neurons, which revealed ~80% colocalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). This suggests that in addition to the synaptic regions of neurons, nD<sup>A647N</sup> might be labeling trafficking endosomal compartments or synaptic vesicles that are being recycled. Similar colocalization experiments of nD<sup>A647N</sup> with other neuronal markers such as <italic>otIs355 [rab-3p(prom1)]::2xNLS::TagRFP</italic> and <italic>otIs45 [unc-119::GFP]</italic> further confirmed that nD<sup>A647N</sup> indeed labeled neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Normally when DNA nanodevices are introduced into the pseudocoelom, they are taken up by scavenger receptors present on coelomocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chakraborty et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Narayanaswamy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Surana et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Veetil et al., 2017</xref>). A key characteristic of nanodevice uptake via this pathway is that uptake is easily abolished in the presence of 10 equivalent molar excess of maleylated BSA as the latter competes for scavenger receptors due to its anionic nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haberland and Fogelman, 1985</xref>). Importantly, even in the presence of 10 equivalents excess of maleylated BSA, neuronal labeling of p<italic>snb-1::snb-1::9E</italic> worms with nD<sup>A647N</sup> was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c–i</xref>). This indicates that nD<sup>A647N</sup> uptake into neurons does not occur via scavenger receptors. When the terminal d(ATAA) motif in nD<sup>A647N</sup> was removed to give a DNA nanodevice denoted nD2<sup>A647</sup>, we observed no such neuronal labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4cii</xref>). These results show that DNA nanodevices can be targeted to neurons in worms only if the former incorporate a d(ATAA) motif and if the latter express the SNB-1::9E chimera in neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Targeting DNA nanodevices with cellular and subcellular precision</title><p>To assess the precision over targeting using our method, we sought to localize DNA nanodevices in endosomes of specific neuron types. We therefore expressed the SNB-1::9E chimera under two different neuronal promoters. We focused on the cholinergic subset of motor neurons since acetylcholine is the most broadly used neurotransmitter in the nematode nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pereira et al., 2015</xref>). Cholinergic motor neurons in the ventral nerve cord are divided into six classes: DA, DB, AS, VA, VB, and VC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kerk et al., 2017</xref>). Since the acetylcholine receptor subunit ACR-2 is expressed in four of the six classes of cholinergic motor neurons (DA, DB, VA, VB), we used the <italic>acr-2</italic> promoter region to target these subsets of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kratsios et al., 2011</xref>). Transgenic p<italic>acr-2::snb-1::9E</italic> worms were generated using the previously described <italic>pha-1</italic> strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Granato et al., 1994</xref>). When nD<sup>A647N</sup> (1 µM) was introduced into the pseudocoelom of these nematodes, we observed that it localized in several, linearly arranged punctate structures resembling synapses and/or neuronal endosomes, around the mid-section of the worm body corresponding to the axons of the VA and VB neurons of the ventral nerve cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). The DA and DB neurons extend their axons to the dorsal nerve cord and form synapse with dorsal muscle. However, we did not observe any labeling with nD<sup>A647N</sup> in the dorsal nerve cord of p<italic>acr-2::SNB-1::9E</italic> worms. Thus, our strategy selectively labels VA and VB neurons over DA and DB classes of neurons. Such selective labeling could arise from the differential cell-surface levels of SNB-1::9E in VA and VB neurons, or greater accessibility of their synapses to cargo in the pseudocoelom, or both.</p><p>Next, we targeted head neurons and a distinct set of cholinergic motor neurons, namely the SAB class, located proximal to the pharynx that innervates the head muscles. In order to target nD<sup>A647N</sup> to these neurons, we chose the promoter of the glutamate receptor family protein GLR-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feng et al., 2006</xref>) since this protein is known to be expressed in the head neurons and the SAB, and DA9 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brockie et al., 2001</xref>; “glr-4 (gene) - WormBase: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nematode Information Resource, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hills et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kratsios et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rothaug et al., 2014</xref>). When nD<sup>A647N</sup> (1 µM) was introduced into the pseudocoelom of these nematodes, we observed that it localized in punctate structures arranged around the pharynx, corresponding to the putative synapses of head neurons expressing GLR-4, and ventral neuromuscular synapses belonging to the SAB neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). Again, just as in the previous case of the DA and DB neurons, the DA9 neurons at the tail of the worm did not show labeling, revealing that this method led to the preferential labeling of SAB neurons. Taken together, our results show that DNA nanodevices can be targeted to synapses and/or trafficking endosomes of specific neuron types expressing SNB-1::9E.</p><p>We then tested whether our method provides subcellular-level precision in terms of targeting individual neurons. Therefore, we tested whether we could target a DNA nanodevice to neurons, and yet not allow neuronal entry, thereby keeping the DNA nanodevice immobilized on the neuronal surface. We therefore genetically fused 9E to the ODR-2 protein and expressed it under the pan-neuronal p<italic>snb-1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). ODR-2 is a GPI-anchored, membrane-associated signaling protein that plays important roles in nematode chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chou et al., 2001</xref>). ODR-2 is highly expressed in sensory neurons, motor neurons, and interneurons, and is particularly enriched in axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gottschalk and Schafer, 2006</xref>). Using the <italic>pha-1</italic> selection strategy described earlier, we obtained transgenics stably expressing the ODR-2::9E chimera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). When these transgenics were injected with nD<sup>A647N</sup> (1 µM), we observed that in all worms the DNA nanodevice labels neuronal axons corresponding to the ventral and the dorsal nerve cords (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). In these transgenics, a near-uniform pattern of plasma membrane labeling was observed that is reminiscent of ODR-2 staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chou et al., 2001</xref>), and is in stark contrast to the punctate labeling that was observed in p<italic>snb-1::snb-1::9E</italic> worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Taken together, our experiments show that the synthetic receptor-ligand strategy shown here is generalizable to cell-surface membrane proteins and can be used to label specific membrane domains and/or endosomal compartments across neurons in vivo. Additionally, this design is applicable to a range of functional DNA nanostructures provided they harbor a d(ATAA) tag, opening up new avenues for the cell-specific application of DNA nanodevices in biological systems.</p><p>To demonstrate application of a functional nanodevice to sensing local environments in neurons, we used <italic>pHlava-9E,</italic> a modified version of a DNA-based pH reporter developed recently that uses pHrodo(O) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Veetil et al., 2020</xref>). To enable ratiometric quantification, <italic>pHlava-9E</italic> contains pH-insensitive dye, ATTO 647N (R), on one of its strands. To enable internalization by 9E, <italic>pHlava-9E</italic> includes a terminal d(ATAA) sequence. Device formation was characterized by gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). <italic>pHlava-9E</italic> is designed to provide a digital output of compartmentalization, that is, its pH profile is such that even if it is internalized into a mildly acidic vesicle, the pH readout is as high as one would observe with a lysosome. The in vitro pH performance curve of <italic>pHlava-9E</italic> shows a maximum fold change in O/R of 2.5 from pH 8 to pH 6, indicating that <italic>pHlava-9E</italic> is particularly accurate to measure neutral or near neutral pH and well positioned to measure pH between pH 6 and 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). It is also designed such that any compartments with acidities ranging from pH 4 to 6 will all show the maximum O/R ratio. This is so that only two states are available for O/R values in order to assess how much of <italic>pHlava-9E</italic> is present on the surface versus in a compartment. Thus <italic>pHlava-9E</italic> gives an unambiguous readout of surface-immobilized to endocytosed fractions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Mapping the pH of cell-surface versus internalized nanodevices using <italic>pHlava-9E</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Representative images of <italic>pHlava-9E</italic> labeled compartments in neurons (nrn) and coelomocytes (clm) of p<italic>snb-1::snb-1::9E</italic> worms and neurons in p<italic>snb-1::odr-2::9E</italic>, acquired in the TMR (O) and ATTO 647N (R) channels.

Our knowledge of subcellular dynamics and organization of endocytic and recycling pathways stems largely from investigations in cultured cellular systems. However, in vivo, endocytosis in single cells and their functional outcomes are sculpted by molecular interactions with their neighboring cells, occurring in the presence of multiple biochemical cues originating from other tissues. Thus, the ability to study endocytic pathways in vivo, at the single-cell level and in their native context, would illuminate our understanding of this core cellular process at the whole organism level.</p><p>There is now a rich repertoire of investigative tools based on DNA nanodevices that either probe or manipulate endosomal trafficking pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krishnan et al., 2020</xref>). However, in order to tap the full potential of DNA-based nanodevices in vivo, it is essential to develop strategies for precise targeting to specific tissues. Here, we leverage both endogenous as well as synthetic nucleic acid-binding receptors to specifically target simple DNA nanodevices to two kinds of tissues: IECs and neurons in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><p>Our results show that, unlike what has been observed for coelomocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chakraborty et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Narayanaswamy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Surana et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Veetil et al., 2017</xref>), simply introducing DNA nanodevices into the worm intestine and circumventing the relevant biological barrier does not lead to nanodevice targeting to IECs. This is due to the lack of an appropriate IEC surface receptor for DNA. However, by exploiting the endogenous dsRNA receptor SID-2 in IECs, we could target DNA nanodevices to these cells. We achieved this by conjugating a dsRNA domain to DNA nanodevices, where the dsRNA domain engaged the SID-2 receptor such that the DNA nanodevice underwent receptor-mediated endocytosis and was subsequently trafficked to LROs. Furthermore, since mutations in the <italic>sid-2</italic> gene, but not <italic>sid-1</italic>, abrogated DNA nanodevice uptake, we could pinpoint that nanodevice targeting occurs via the endogenous SID-2 receptor. Our results show that DNA nanodevices can be targeted tissue-specifically by exploiting relevant endogenously expressed cell-surface receptors and displaying the cognate ligand on the DNA nanodevice. Should new knowledge of cell type-specific nucleic acid receptors emerge, this strategy could be used to expand the targeting of DNA nanodevices to other classes of cells.</p><p>In the absence of such knowledge, we have developed a synthetic receptor-ligand strategy to target DNA nanodevices in a generalizable way so that it can be adapted to a variety of cellular and molecular contexts in vivo. We therefore identified a sequence-specific, DNA-binding recombinant humanized V<sub>H</sub>H antibody, denoted 9E, by phage display. 9E binds a specific 4-nt sequence, namely d(ATAA), when it is present at the 3′ end of the DNA nanodevice with high affinity (~200 nM), irrespective of the environmental pH.</p><p>By fusing 9E to proteins that are expressed on the target cell under appropriate tissue-specific promoters, we can target DNA nanodevices with cellular- and subcellular-level precision. For example, since SNB-1 is ubiquitously expressed in all neurons, we expressed a SNB-1::9E fusion protein under the pan-neuronal promoter p<italic>snb-1</italic> and targeted a DNA nanodevice displaying the 3′ terminal d(ATAA) sequence, specifically to neurons. Interestingly, nanodevices labeled endosomes not only at the synapses but all along the axon within the relevant neurons. Neuronal targeting required both SNB-1 fused to the 9E antibody and the DNA nanodevice to have the 3′ d(ATAA) sequence. This established that cell-specific targeting was contingent upon the interaction between the synthetic receptor and its cognate DNA epitope. DNA nanodevices could be targeted to specific subsets of neurons by expressing the SNB-1::9E chimera under promoters of genes expressed in specific neuronal classes. Thus, when SNB-1::9E was expressed under <italic>pacr-2</italic> or <italic>pglr-4</italic> promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kratsios et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kratsios et al., 2011</xref>), DNA nanodevices were internalized by cholinergic ventral cord neurons or SAB head motor neurons, respectively.</p><p>We showed that targeting of DNA nanodevices could be achieved with subcellular-level precision using this strategy. Fusing 9E to the transmembrane odorant receptor, ODR-2, which does not undergo significant endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chou et al., 2001</xref>), enabled the immobilization of a DNA nanodevice at the neuronal surface, rather than being endocytosed into intracellular vesicles. This suggests that DNA nanodevices may be localized with subcellular precision using a synthetic receptor and cognate ligand strategy in vivo. By using a functional DNA nanodevice, <italic>pHlava-9E,</italic> we showed that the punctate neuronal labeling observed in p<italic>snb-1::snb-1::9E</italic> worms is predominantly in internal compartments.</p><p>To interrogate organelle dynamics and function in vivo, the development of robust technologies with molecular specificity that enables access to discrete cell types is critical. The modular system described here has the capability to interface with and harness the power of nucleic acid nanotechnology to probe and modulate specific organelles in vivo. The methodology described here is confined to addressing those organelles that exchange membrane content with the plasma membrane, namely endocytic organelles. To target DNA nanodevices to organelles on the secretory pathway, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, new strategies that co-opt retrograde trafficking pathways are required. Further, this method currently cannot localize DNA nanodevices to the cytoplasm, the nucleoplasm, or within the mitochondria. Nevertheless, these targeting strategies open up an array of possible applications where DNA nanodevices can be readily applied in the multicellular context, positioning them to deliver key insights into complex biological phenomena.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Oligonucleotides</title><p>All fluorescently labeled DNA oligonucleotides were HPLC-purified and obtained from IBA-GmBh (Germany) and IDT (Coralville, IA).

Briefly, L4 for hermaphrodite worms of various fluorescently labeled transgenic lines were crossed with N2 males and the male progeny containing a fluorescent label were selected for the next step. Fluorescently labeled male worms were crossed with p<italic>snb-1::snb-1::9E</italic> containing L4 hermaphrodites. 10–12 hermaphrodite progeny from this step were singled out at the L4 developmental stage based on the presence of a fluorescent marker. These worms were allowed to self-fertilize and five of their progenies were used to perform single-worm PCRs to identify which plates contain worms with both 9E and the fluorescent neuronal markers. Single-worm PCRs were performed using standard methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Single worm PCR, 2019</xref>). Briefly, five worms from each plate were placed into a tube containing 5 µL of worm lysis buffer (WLB: 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris pH 8.3, 2.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.8% Tween-20, 0.01% gelatin) and 100 μg/mL proteinase K. Worms are frozen at –80°C for at least 1 hr. The tube is immediately treated at 60°C for 60 min after which proteinase K is inactivated by heating to 95°C for 15 min. The PCR mix is then added directly to the digested heat-inactivated sample. The PCR product was then confirmed by gel electrophoresis for 9E. Actin was used as a control.

The emission spectra for <italic>pHrodoRed</italic> (O) and ATTO 647 (R) were collected from 570 to 620 nm and 650–750 nm, respectively. The ratio of fluorescence intensity at 580 nm and 660 nm were plotted as a function of pH to obtain a calibration curve. For the neuronal pH measurements, <italic>pHlava-9E</italic> (1 μM) was microinjected in the dorsal side in the pseudocoelom, just opposite the vulva, of 1-day-old hermaphrodites. Injected worms were then placed in a new nematode growth medium (NGM) agar-containing Petri plate at room temperature for 1 hr for maximum labeling of neurons and coelomocyte lysosomes.

The filter wheel, shutter, and CCD camera were controlled using Metamorph Premier Version 7.8.12.0 (Molecular Devices) (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_002368">SCR_002368</ext-link>) as appropriate for the fluorophore used.

All images were background subtracted using the mean intensity calculated from an adjacent cell-free area. The regions of cells containing neurons/lysosomes in each Alexa 647 (R) image were identified and marked in the ROI plugin in ImageJ (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_003070">SCR_003070</ext-link>). The same regions were identified in the TMR image recalling the ROIs and appropriate correction factor for chromatic aberration if necessary. The ROI for neuron was selected by drawing a line with a length of 5 µm parallel to the maximum intensity region of the neurons. Mean fluorescence intensity was measured in TMR (O) and Alexa 647 channels. The ratio of the O/R intensities was calculated from these values. The mean O/R obtained from the coelomocytes (internal calibrator) was taken as the value corresponding to pH 5.5. The fold change in the O/R value relative to this value calculated from the calibration plot was used for the determination of pH of neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s3-21"><title>Confocal microscopy and image analysis</title><p>Confocal images were captured with a Leica TCS SP5 II STED laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Inc) (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_018714">SCR_018714</ext-link>) equipped with 63×, 1.4 NA, oil immersion objective. Alexa 488 was excited using an Argon ion laser for 488 nm excitation, Alexa 647 using He-Ne laser for 633 excitation. Images on the same day were acquired under the same acquisition settings. All the images were background subtracted prior to any image analysis, which was carried out using ImageJ ver.1.49d (NIH).</p><p>Image analysis for quantification of uptake during intestinal labeling was done using custom MATLAB code. For each worm, the most focused plane was manually selected in the Alexa 647 channel. To determine the location of the endosome, first a low threshold was used to select the entire field. Only the area within the cell was subsequently considered for vesicle selection. ROIs corresponding to individual vesicle were selected in the Alexa 647 channel by adaptive thresholding using Sauvola’s method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sauvola and Pietikäinen, 2000</xref>). The initial selection was further refined by watershed segmentation and size filtering. After segmentation, ROIs were inspected in each image and selection errors were corrected manually. Using this, we measured the mean fluorescence intensity for ~500 vesicles from ~10 animals and the background intensity corresponding to that field was subtracted.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s4" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>None</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>none</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>Reviewing editor, <italic>eLife</italic></p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Validation, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Validation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Methodology, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Funding acquisition, Project administration, Resources, Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Funding acquisition, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Validation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s5" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Table listing all oligonucleotides used in this study.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-67830-supp1-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-67830-transrepform1-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analysed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files.</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Verenice S Noyola for assistance in drawing schemes for figures, and Anand Saminathan for his valuable comments related to functional nanodevice application and analysis.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Piali Sengupta as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. We all felt that this manuscript is interesting and is potentially suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However both reviewers identified similar major revision request.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There needs to be a demonstration of the utility of this method.

While fluorescence intensity data was well quantified, quantification of colocalization data by PCC or similar methods was lacking. Something appears wrong with the unc-119::gfp labeling in Supp Figure 7b.

I was anticipating some sort of functional demonstration in either the intestinal or neuronal delivery example perhaps based on other successful dsDNA probes utilized in the worm by the authors in previous studies (Devany 2018, Narayanaswamy 2019, Dan 2019, Chakraborty 2017 to name a few). Since this current manuscript only shows the fate of the Alexa dye, one wonders if the dsDNA is stable and functional under these conditions. The authors may be convinced that this is a non-issue, but they should either provide a bit of experimental evidence or a more convincing discussion of this point.</p><p>2. While the colocalization of the A647 dye and LMP-1::GFP appeared convincing from the example shown in Supplemental Figure 1, the GLO-1::GFP colocalization was much less convincing. The data is anecdotal without providing some sort of quantification such as the percentage of LMP-1 and/or GLO-1 positive LROs containing A647 dye signal (perhaps buffer control vs R100D38). Even something simplistic like Pearson correlation would help support the claim that the dsDNA was successfully delivered specifically to LROs. A similar criticism of the RAB-3 colocalization in Figure 4 could be made as well. Presumably this can be done with images the authors have already collected and would not require any new experiments.</p><p>3. I was impressed by the SNB-1::9E experiment and even without image quantification, it is clear that the authors have successfully recruited a dsDNA probe to neurites. Because there is a significant fraction of SNB-1 on the neuronal plasma membrane at steady state (both endogenous and over-expressed), and this surface SNB-1 is both synaptic and extrasynaptic, the dsDNA capture is likely to occur over the entire surface of neurons expressing the nanobody. Although the A647 dye signal looks somewhat punctate, we don't know whether this is surface or internal signal. Nor do we know with any quantitative precision where these enrichments are relative to synapses. Even plasma membrane proteins can appear to have a somewhat punctate distribution due to geometric effects (like the larger surface area of boutons) and surface lipid/protein heterogeneity. I think the claims made in this part of the manuscript are a bit over-stated since the degree to which the signal can be localized to subcellular compartments or even to somewhere besides the surface of the neurite is limited and unconvincing. All of this could be better handled with improved image analysis and some discussion of the these complicating factors. Perhaps FRAP experiments or pH-sensitive probes could clarify surface versus internal pools, but I do not think these experiments are necessary for publication. The authors also claim that some of the puncta are retrogradely transported vesicles. Is this anecdotal? Is there evidence provided for this claim in the manuscript? Given that SNB-1::9E decorates the entire neuronal surface, one could imagine internalized A647 would not necessarily be synaptic to begin with regardless of the transport fate of those compartments.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.67830.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There needs to be a demonstration of the utility of this method.

Even something simplistic like Pearson correlation would help support the claim that the dsDNA was successfully delivered specifically to LROs.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our last two responses to Reviewer 1.</p><p>In addition, we clarify the issue with GLO-1::GFP colocalization<italic>.</italic> We kept uniform washing times throughout for all the strains used in this study. At these washing times, GLO-1::GFP worms showed lower clearance of the intestinal lumen compared to all the other strains. Hence, most Glo-1::GFP images showed residual fluorescence in their lumens due to uncleared nanodevices. We now provide another representative image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>) where the lumen is not visible due to the orientation of the worm, which shows nanodevice uptake more clearly.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>a) Representative images showing colocalization between LRO marker, GLO-1::GFP and R<sup>50</sup>D<sup>38</sup> nanodevices uptaken by intestinal epithelial cells b) Pearson’s correlation coefficient (PCC) calculated of the colocalization between R<sup>50</sup>D<sup>38</sup> (red) and GLO-1 (green) in GLO-1::GFP worms.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-67830-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A similar criticism of the RAB-3 colocalization in Figure 4 could be made as well.

I was impressed by the SNB-1::9E experiment and even without image quantification, it is clear that the authors have successfully recruited a dsDNA probe to neurites. Because there is a significant fraction of SNB-1 on the neuronal plasma membrane at steady state (both endogenous and over-expressed), and this surface SNB-1 is both synaptic and extrasynaptic, the dsDNA capture is likely to occur over the entire surface of neurons expressing the nanobody. Although the A647 dye signal looks somewhat punctate, we don't know whether this is surface or internal signal. Nor do we know with any quantitative precision where these enrichments are relative to synapses. Even plasma membrane proteins can appear to have a somewhat punctate distribution due to geometric effects (like the larger surface area of boutons) and surface lipid/protein heterogeneity. I think the claims made in this part of the manuscript are a bit over-stated since the degree to which the signal can be localized to subcellular compartments or even to somewhere besides the surface of the neurite is limited and unconvincing. All of this could be better handled with improved image analysis and some discussion of the these complicating factors. Perhaps FRAP experiments or pH-sensitive probes could clarify surface versus internal pools, but I do not think these experiments are necessary for publication.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to this reviewer for raising an excellent point, addressing which significantly improved our manuscript. We designed a nanodevice denoted <italic>pHlava</italic>, which reports on internalized nanodevices versus surface-displayed nanodevice.</p><p>We included a new Figure 5 in our manuscript describing a series of experiments with controls to show that surface labeling upon binding snb-1::9E in neurons is negligible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors also claim that some of the puncta are retrogradely transported vesicles. Is this anecdotal? Is there evidence provided for this claim in the manuscript? Given that SNB-1::9E decorates the entire neuronal surface, one could imagine internalized A647 would not necessarily be synaptic to begin with regardless of the transport fate of those compartments.</p></disp-quote><p>See response to the point above. The puncta in which DNA devices are internalized are acidic. Further, fluorescently labeled anti-GFP has been shown to be enriched in compartments that are retrogradely transported where the Koushika group used labeled Anti-GFP which bound to SNB-1::GFP et al.(Murthy , 2011).</p><p>We now drop the claim that vesicles containing DNA nanodevices are retrogradely transported despite observing these vesicles moving retrogradely. This is because we feel that adding more data to demonstrate retrograde transport would distract from the main message of the paper – that DNA nanodevices can be targeted tissue-specifically and with sub-cellular precision.</p></body></sub-article></article>
