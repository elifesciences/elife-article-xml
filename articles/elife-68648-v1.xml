3′ kinase (PI3K)‐related kinase ATR is crucial for mammalian meiosis. ATR promotes meiotic progression by coordinating key events in DNA repair, meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI), and checkpoint-dependent quality control during meiotic prophase I. Despite its central roles in meiosis, the ATR-dependent meiotic signaling network remains largely unknown. Here, we used phosphoproteomics to define ATR signaling events in testes from mice following chemical and genetic ablation of ATR signaling. Quantitative analysis of phosphoproteomes obtained after germ cell-specific genetic ablation of the ATR activating 9-1-1 complex or treatment with ATR inhibitor identified over 14,000 phosphorylation sites from testes samples, of which 401 phosphorylation sites were found to be dependent on both the 9-1-1 complex and ATR. Our analyses identified ATR-dependent phosphorylation events in crucial DNA damage signaling and DNA repair proteins including TOPBP1, SMC3, MDC1, RAD50, and SLX4. Importantly, we identified ATR and RAD1-dependent phosphorylation events in proteins involved in mRNA regulatory processes, including SETX and RANBP3, whose localization to the sex body was lost upon ATR inhibition. In addition to identifying the expected ATR-targeted S/T-Q motif, we identified enrichment of an S/T-P-X-K motif in the set of ATR-dependent events, suggesting that ATR promotes signaling via proline-directed kinase(s) during meiosis. Indeed, we found that ATR signaling is important for the proper localization of CDK2 in spermatocytes. Overall, our analysis establishes a map of ATR signaling in mouse testes and highlights potential meiotic-specific actions of ATR during prophase I progression.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ATR</kwd><kwd>meiosis</kwd><kwd>sex body</kwd><kwd>9-1-1</kwd><kwd>prophase I</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-HD095296</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weiss</surname><given-names>Robert S</given-names></name><name><surname>Smolka</surname><given-names>Marcus B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Spanish Ministry of Innovation Science and Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PID2019-109222RB-I00</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Freire</surname><given-names>Raimundo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007757</institution-id><institution>Agencia Canaria de Investigación</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ProID2020010109</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Freire</surname><given-names>Raimundo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01HD097987</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cohen</surname><given-names>Paula E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An in-depth map of ATR signaling during mouse meiosis is revealed using a combination of genetic and pharmacological approaches coupled to quantitative mass spectrometry.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Meiosis is a specialized cellular process whereby a single round of DNA replication is followed by two successive rounds of cell division to produce haploid gametes. To ensure proper chromosome segregation at the first meiotic division, meiotic cells must undergo a series of highly regulated processes, including programmed double-strand break (DSB) formation, recombination, and chromosome synapsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Keeney et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baudat et al., 2013</xref>). The serine/threonine-protein kinase ATR (ataxia telangiectasia and Rad-3 related protein) has well-characterized roles in maintaining genome stability in mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yazinski and Zou, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Saldivar et al., 2017</xref>). In mammals, ATR also plays an essential role in spermatogenesis by promoting meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI), a process that is required for silencing of the X and Y chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Royo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pacheco et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Widger et al., 2018</xref>). Impairment of ATR activity results in insufficient MSCI and germ cell elimination at the mid-pachytene stage of prophase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Widger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Royo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Turner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Menolfi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fedoriw et al., 2015</xref>). A major readout of ATR activity during MSCI is the phosphorylation of the histone variant H2AX within the dense heterochromatin domain of the nucleus that houses the X and Y chromosomes known as the sex body. Additionally, ATR regulates the sex body localization of several other DNA damage response proteins such as MDC1 and BRCA1, ultimately resulting in MSCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Royo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Turner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ichijima et al., 2012</xref>). Loss of ATR protein in spermatocytes results in defects in DSB repair and chromosome synapsis, implying that ATR regulates several aspects of meiotic progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Menolfi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fedoriw et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Widger et al., 2018</xref>). Despite the importance of ATR in meiosis, the mechanisms by which meiotic ATR signaling coordinates meiotic progression remain limited due to the complexity and interdependence of meiotic DNA repair, chromosome synapsis, and silencing of unsynapsed chromatin.</p><p>ATR activation is relatively well understood in somatic cells, and some of the molecular determinants of ATR activation are shared in meiosis. In mitotic cells, ATR is activated at sites of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) that arise during replication or DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lovejoy and Cortez, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lempiäinen and Halazonetis, 2009</xref>). ATR is recruited to RPA-coated ssDNA via interaction with ATRIP (ATR interacting protein) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zou and Elledge, 2003</xref>), while the 9A-1-1 (RAD9A-RAD1-HUS1) checkpoint clamp is independently loaded at the dsDNA-ssDNA junction by the RAD17-RFC clamp loader (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Delacroix et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eichinger and Jentsch, 2011</xref>). The ATR activating protein, TOPBP1 (topoisomerase binding protein 1), then interacts with the c-terminal tail of RAD9A and directly activates ATR via its ATR activation domain (AAD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burtelow et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Takeishi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roos-Mattjus et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Thada and Cortez, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kumagai et al., 2006</xref>). Conditional depletion of TOPBP1 in germ cells results in defective MSCI as well as loss of ATR and H2AX phosphorylation in the sex body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">ElInati et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Perera et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jeon et al., 2019</xref> ). The results suggest a prominent role for TOPBP1 in mediating the strong ATR signaling observed during pachynema. Recently, a second ATR activating protein, ETAA1 (Ewing’s tumor-associated antigen 1), was identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Feng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Haahr et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bass et al., 2016</xref>). ETAA1 can directly activate ATR at RPA-coated ssDNA at replication forks and is thought to be important for ATR activation during unchallenged DNA replication and unlikely to function in meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">ElInati et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bass and Cortez, 2019</xref>). Once activated, ATR preferentially phosphorylates proteins at S/T-Q motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">O’Neill et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bastos de Oliveira et al., 2015</xref>). In mitotic cells, ATR-mediated phosphorylation of the histone variant H2AX (hereafter referred to as γH2AX) and the scaffold protein MDC1 contributes to checkpoint activation by enhancing ATR phosphorylation of the downstream kinases CHK1/CHK2, resulting in checkpoint-mediated cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown and Baltimore, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lou et al., 2003</xref>). In meiosis, ATR also phosphorylates H2AX and MDC1, but, intriguingly, this strong induction of ATR activity observed during normal spermatogenesis is compatible with the progression of the meiotic cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kolas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fernandez-Capetillo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ichijima et al., 2011</xref>). How ATR signaling in meiotic cells coordinates meiotic progression without imposing a checkpoint arrest remains a fundamental unanswered question.</p><p>While hundreds of ATR targets have been characterized using quantitative phosphoproteomics mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bass and Cortez, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lanz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wagner et al., 2016</xref>), much less is understood about ATR signaling in meiosis. A comprehensive dataset of meiotic ATR-dependent phosphorylation events is necessary to further our understanding of the mechanisms by which ATR coordinates DNA repair, chromosome synapsis, checkpoint, and MSCI pathways during meiosis. To define the network of phosphorylation events mediated by ATR in meiotic cells, we performed extensive phosphoproteomic analyses of testes derived from mice with two independent methods of impairing ATR signaling. Given that ATR depletion results in embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown and Baltimore, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown and Baltimore, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Klein et al., 2000</xref>), we used a genetic model of impairing ATR signaling whereby the 9-1-1 component RAD1 is conditionally depleted under the germ cell-specific <italic>Stra8-Cre</italic>. Depletion of RAD1 in germ cells is anticipated to disrupt all potential 9-1-1 complexes, including those that could form with the testes-specific paralogs Hus1b and <italic>Rad9b</italic> , and therefore significantly impair ATR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pereira et al., 2021</xref>). In parallel, we collected testes from mice treated with ATR inhibitor (AZ20) and vehicle-treated controls. We reasoned that by using both a genetic and pharmacological method of inhibiting ATR we would take advantage of both the tissue specificity in the RAD1 conditional knockout as well as the acute effects of rapid ATR inhibition after treatment with ATR inhibitors. By only considering phosphorylation events that are depleted in both the <italic>Rad1</italic> cKO and ATR inhibitor-treated mice, we eliminated pleiotropic effects caused by long-term loss of RAD1, including changes in cellular composition of the testes. After collecting testes from <italic>Rad1</italic> cKO and control mice as well as ATR inhibitor-treated and vehicle control mice, we processed these tissues to isolate phosphorylated peptides, labeled them with amino reactive tandem mass tag reagents (TMT) followed by mass spectrometry to generate phosphoproteomic datasets. By combining these datasets, and after data filtering, we were able to identify a set of 401 phosphorylation events that were dependent on both ATR and RAD1, including phosphorylation of crucial DNA damage signaling and DNA repair proteins at the preferential motif for ATR phosphorylation (S/T-Q). Interestingly, the localization of several of these targets to the sex body, such as Senataxin and RANBP3, was found to be disrupted after ATR inhibition. Finally, the set of ATR- and RAD1-dependent phosphorylation events included enrichment for phosphorylation at the S/T-P-X-K motif, suggesting that ATR promotes signaling of proline-directed kinase(s) in meiosis. Consistent with this model, ATR signaling was important for the proper localization of CDK2 in spermatocytes. Overall, our analysis establishes a comprehensive map of ATR signaling in spermatocytes and highlights potential meiotic-specific actions of ATR during prophase I progression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A combined pharmacological and genetic approach to map ATR-dependent signaling in spermatocytes</title><p>Despite the central role of ATR in prophase I of mammalian meiosis, the meiotic ATR signaling network remains largely unknown.

This finding is consistent with our rationale that Q1 would contain phosphorylation events that reflect indirect or pleiotropic events caused by long-term depletion of RAD1, leading to the impairment of processes downstream of meiosis I and loss of cell populations.

We detected 29 MDC1 phosphorylation sites, including 8 sites in Q2 (ATR- and RAD1-dependent) and 21 sites that were not dependent on ATR phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>). We also probed the phosphorylation of MDC1 at threonine 4 using a phospho-specific antibody on meiotic spreads and observed a significant loss of signal at the sex body upon 4 hr of ATRi treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B and C</xref>). These data confirm the effectiveness of the 4 hr ATRi treatment, provide a positive control supporting that Q2 sites contain expected markers of ATR signaling, and reveal that MDC1 undergoes both ATR-dependent and -independent modes of regulation. Furthermore, the identification of MDC1 phosphosites that do not change upon ATR inhibition suggests that the phosphorylation changes in Q2 are unlikely due to changes in MDC1 protein abundance. Notably, we were able to detect at least one phosphorylation site that did not change between the control and reduced ATR activity condition (nonregulated) in over 60% of the proteins containing a phosphorylation site detected in Q2, which indicates that the majority of phosphorylation events in Q2 are not likely due to protein abundance changes, but rather regulated phosphorylation events. Nonetheless, for proteins whose phosphorylation sites are only detected in Q2, it remains possible that protein abundance change may be the underlying cause of the observed change in phosphopeptide abundance.

The finding that most phosphorylation sites in Q2 are not in the S/T-Q motif suggests that ATR is able to phosphorylate other motifs and/or directly or indirectly regulate the activity of other kinases or phosphatases during meiosis. To better characterize the set of non-S/T-Q phosphorylation events that are dependent on ATR and RAD1, we searched for other motifs enriched in Q2 in the datasets of both 4 hr and 2.5–3 days of ATR inhibition. First, analysis of the amino acid at the +1 position following the phosphorylated S/T residue revealed that a large fraction of phosphorylation sites contain a proline at the +1 position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Interestingly, the proportion of S/T-P sites in Q2 increased from ~42% in the 4 hr ATRi dataset to over 65% in the 2.5–3-day ATRi dataset, suggesting that these sites could represent the impairment of downstream signaling events mediated indirectly by a kinase or phosphatase regulated by ATR, and would therefore take longer to be impaired after ATR inhibition. Since S/T-P is a rather common motif in the phosphoproteome, we searched for a more specific motif that could reveal the potential identify of the kinase or phosphatase involved. We computed the relative proportion of each amino acid at the ±6 positions surrounding the identified phosphorylation sites, comparing their prevalence in Q2 (ATR and RAD1-dependent sites) versus center (unregulated or not-differentially phosphorylated sites) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). The matrices for both the 4 hr and 2.5–3-day ATRi treatment datasets revealed enrichment for K at +3 position in the set of ATR and RAD1-dependent sites. Close inspection of the group of ATR and RAD1-dependent phosphosites with K at +3 revealed that most contain a P at the +1 position, both for the 4 hr and 2.5–3-day ATRi datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>), suggesting the enrichment of an S/T-P-X-K motif. Indeed, comparison of the prevalence of S/T-P-X-K motifs in Q2 (ATR- and RAD1-dependent) to the set of unregulated phosphosites found in the center of the dataset revealed substantial enrichments of the S/T-P-X-K motif in both the 4 hr and 2.5–3-day ATRi Q2 datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The enrichment was greater in the 2.5–3-day ATRi dataset, reaching over 15% of all Q2 sites, as compared to comprising only 3% in the center (unregulated) sites. These results suggest that ATR is regulating the activity of one or more kinases that have a preference for S/T-P-X-K motif. Notably, this motif fits the canonical preferential motif for the master cell cycle kinases CDK1 and CDK2. We were able to obtain an antibody against CDK2 that allowed us to visualize the localization of this kinase in meiotic chromosome spreads. We observed that CDK2 localizes to the core as well as to the ends of chromosomes, similar to previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tu et al., 2017</xref>). Image analysis revealed that autosomal localization of CDK2 is significantly disrupted by ATRi, and surprisingly, this effect could be observed already at 4hr after ATRi treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). Importantly, 4 hr of ATRi treatment does not result in major changes in cellular composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A and B</xref>), supporting that the changes in S/T-P-X-K sites observed at 4 hr after ATRi are likely due to specific alterations in an ATR signaling axis rather than indirect effects due to gross changes in testis cellularity. These results are consistent with the finding that the several phosphorylation events at the canonical S/T-P-X-K motif were depleted after ATRi. The identification of more Q2 S/T-P-X-K sites in the 2.5–3-day ATRi dataset when compared to the 4 hr ATRi dataset suggests that different downstream S/T-P-X-K are likely under distinct dynamics of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation following ATRi. CDK2 has established roles in cell cycle regulation and, in the context of meiosis, is critical for meiotic prophase I progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berthet et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ortega et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chauhan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Palmer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Singh et al., 2019</xref>). Consistent with the model that CDK2 activity is impaired by ATRi and RAD1 loss of function, gene ontology analysis of proteins with S/T-P-X-K motif phosphorylation in quadrant 2 revealed a significant enrichment for genes involved in regulation of the cell cycle, including CDC20 and RBL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). A range of S/T-P sites without K at +3 are also present in Q2 and could still reflect other potential substrates of CDK2, CDK1, or other proline-directed kinases regulated by ATR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1 supp3">Supplementary files 1 and 3</xref>). While the loss of proper CDK2 localization at pachynema in ATRi-treated mice supports a potential mechanistic link between ATR and CDK2, further work will be needed to understand the role of meiotic ATR signaling in regulating CDK2.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Enrichment of S/T-P-X-K phosphorylation motif in the set of ATR and RAD1-dependent signaling events.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Bar graph depicting the count of Q2 phosphopeptides with the indicated amino acids at the +1 position.

Several phosphoproteomic databases have been generated to characterize the targets of ATR during conditions of replication stress or within the context of mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bass and Cortez, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bastos de Oliveira et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wagner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lanz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schlam-Babayov et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Matsuoka et al., 2007</xref>). These resources have been useful not only to mechanistically dissect the different roles of ATR, but also to gain a more comprehensive understanding of its multifaceted action in genome metabolism. In the context of meiosis, much less is understood about ATR signaling, and although previous reports have catalogued phosphorylation events in mouse testis using phosphoproteomics, these datasets lack experimentally established kinase-substrate relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">MacLeod et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Castillo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Qi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Given the utmost importance of defining the ATR-mediated signaling events in mammalian meiosis for allowing mechanistic dissection of its function and mode of action, here we performed an in-depth phosphoproteomic analysis of ATR signaling in testes. The success of our work mostly relied on a two-part approach for identifying high-confidence ATR-dependent phosphorylation events. By combining the datasets from the <italic>Rad1</italic> cKO genetic mouse model and ATR inhibitor-treated mice, we enhanced our confidence in identifying meiosis-enriched ATR-dependent signaling events. Importantly, this dual approach allowed us to remove phosphorylation events changing as a result of loss of spermatocyte and sperm populations in <italic>Rad1</italic> cKO testes. Importantly, we did not observe gross changes in cellular composition after 4 hr of ATRi treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A and B</xref>), supporting that the observed changes in phosphorylation events correspond to specific impacts on ATR-mediated signaling axis rather than pleiotropic changes in testis cellularity or persistent cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, the choice of AZ20 as the ATR inhibitor in this study allowed us to specifically study the effect of loss of ATR signaling without altering ATM or DNA-PKcs signaling, as AZ20 is a highly selective inhibitor of ATR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Foote et al., 2013</xref>). As validation of our dataset, we detected known ATR targets such as MDC1 in the set of ATR and RAD1-dependent signaling events. Additionally, we observed the expected enrichment for DNA metabolism, DNA repair, and cell cycle gene ontology categories. While we did not detect phosphorylation events in some established targets of ATR such as CHK1, this is likely a reflection of the limitations of generating complete coverage from whole mouse testis and the low abundance of some checkpoint proteins. Another limitation is the intrinsic variability of the dataset, mainly in the datasets of ATRi-treated testes. While the <italic>Rad1</italic> cKO datasets clustered tightly together in a principal component analysis (PCA), the ATRi conditions showed more variability along principal component 2, which could reflect the difficulties in reproducibly delivering ATR inhibitors to the testis via oral/systemic administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Despite these noted limitations, we anticipate that the dataset presented here will serve as a framework for the meiosis community to mechanistically dissect distinct actions of meiotic ATR.</p><p>Our findings revealed interesting new connections between ATR and RNA metabolism, as illustrated by the detection of ATR- and RAD-dependent phosphorylation in Senataxin and RANBP3. It is tempting to speculate that these are direct functional targets since they were phosphorylated at the S/T-Q motif and their localization to the XY body was compromised during ATR inhibition. Since RNA metabolism and ATR signaling are both closely linked to the establishment of transcriptional silencing at the XY, our data suggest that ATR-mediated phosphorylation of Senataxin, RANBP3, and other RNA processing factors may play central roles in promoting proper silencing and proper meiotic progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3D</xref>). The connection of ATR to RNA metabolism is not completely surprising since it was previously reported in the context of mitotic cells, although the targets and mechanisms remain poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burger et al., 2019</xref>). Notably, given that silencing of the XY is inextricably linked to prophase I progression, it is likely that the connection of meiotic ATR signaling to RNA metabolism is even more relevant compared to its mitotic signaling. An interesting model to be explored in future work is that SETX and RANBP3 may coordinate the removal of RNA from XY DNA to establish MSCI. Further work using genetic models for phosphorylation site mutations will be needed to establish the specific role of ATR-mediated phosphorylation of these proteins and to dissect the mechanism by which ATR promotes the localization and action of Senataxin, RANBP3, and potentially other RNA metabolic proteins identified in this study.</p><p>Since our phosphoproteomic is unbiased and not only directed at the preferred S/T-Q motif, we were able to capture a range of phosphorylation events in other motifs suggesting that ATR regulates multiple downstream kinases during meiosis. Strikingly, we observed a strong enrichment for ATR-dependent phosphorylation sites at the S/T-P-X-K motif (a preferred consensus motif for CDK1 and CDK2) and found that ATR signaling is important for proper localization of CDK2 to autosomes. A simple model would predict that ATR somehow activates CDK2 during prophase I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3D</xref>), which could be tested by future phosphoproteomic analysis of testes from mice treated with CDK2 inhibitors. We were unable to test the effect of ATR inhibition on the localization of CDK1 due to lack of a proper antibody; however, we do not exclude that similar to CDK2 the localization and action of CDK1 may also be affected by ATR inhibition. It is worth mentioning that in mitosis the canonical action of ATR in promoting DNA damage checkpoint, and consequent cell cycle arrest, is mediated via inhibition CDK activity, and consequent reduction in S/T-P phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sørensen and Syljuåsen, 2012</xref>). In this sense, the observed dependency of S/T-P-X-K motif for ATR in meiosis is the opposite to what would be predicted from mitotic cells. Since the high activity of ATR in meiosis does not result in meiotic arrest, but is actually required for meiotic progression, it is possible that our data is revealing a drastic difference in how ATR signaling is wired with downstream kinases in meiotic versus mitotic cells. In addition to S/T-P-X-K motif, several other motifs were represented in the set of ATR- and RAD1-dependent sites. We cannot exclude that the effect of ATR inhibition in depleting a range of phosphorylation events could be due, at least in part, to a function of ATR in regulating phosphatases. Importantly, phosphorylation of phosphatases, including PPM1G and PP1R7, was found to be reduced upon ATR inhibition and <italic>Rad1</italic> cKO. A potential scenario is that ATR inhibits constitutively active phosphatases, so ATR inhibition would lead to increased phosphatase activity and reduced phosphorylation of their targets. Interestingly, the fact that phosphorylation of H2AX in the sex body is drastically reduced already 4 hr after ATR inhibition strongly suggests the existence of a constant phosphorylation cycle involving ATR kinase activity and the constitutive action of phosphatases. Further investigations of this phospho-cycle could lead to important new insights about the dynamics and roles of phosphorylation circuitries during prophase I.</p><p>Overall, our work represents an initial attempt to reveal the scope of targets and processes affected by meiotic ATR signaling. As expected, the ATR signaling network in meiosis is overwhelmingly complex and multifaceted. Major challenges remain, especially to untangle the functional relevance of most of the identified signaling events, and understand how the different modes of ATR signaling are coordinated for proper control of meiotic progression. Another key outstanding question is to understand how the ATR kinase, which imposes cell cycle checkpoints in most other cell types, is so highly activated in spermatocytes without inducing cell cycle arrest. A potential explanation may lay at the specificity of ATR’s action at the sex body, which may be devoted to the regulation of checkpoint-independent processes such as the control of RNA processing during meiotic prophase I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3D</xref>), as supported by our data. Finally, there are medical implications of understanding ATR signaling in meiosis since many ATR inhibitors are currently in phase 2 clinical trials for cancer treatment and determining the impact of these inhibitors in meiotic cells will be relevant to define the effects of these treatments in patient fertility.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>ATR inhibitor treatment of mice</title><p>AZ20 was reconstituted in 10% DMSO (Sigma), 40% propylene glycol (Sigma), and 50% water.

PeptideProphet was used to validate peptide identifications, and Libra was used to quantify TMT reporter ion intensities from which quantitative ratios were calculated. The phosphoproteomic data generated in this study were deposited to the MassIVE database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://massive.ucsd.edu">http://massive.ucsd.edu</ext-link>) and received the ID: MSV000086764, doi:10.25345/C57N54, and ProteomeXchange ID: PXD023803. Following processing by Comet, PeptideProphet, Libra, and PTMProphet, phosphoproteomic datasets were exported as .xls files for further processing via R scripts. A first script calculated fold changes between TMT reporter ion channels using the median of Libra-provided values for each condition. This script eliminated any peptides that featured missing reporter ion intensity values for channels in both conditions for a given experiment. A second script normalized the fold changes and procedurally clustered phosphorylation sites if PTMProphet localized them to adjacent phosphorylatable residues. These clustered sites’ localization probabilities were summed, and if this cumulative score remained above 0.85, the phosphorylation sites were designated a valid cluster and remained in the dataset for further analysis. After quantification, normalization, and clustering of each experimental dataset, AZ20-treated and <italic>Rad1</italic> cKO experiments were compared with one another such that sites seen in both sets of experiments could have their average fold changes plotted against each other on Cartesian coordinates. Quadrants were designated as Q1–Q4 delimited by an interval of correlation correspondent to fivefold of the log2 scale. Any sites whose average ratios fell within a circle of radius of 0.7-fold change centered on the origin were designated as ‘Center’ sites and were considered unregulated. Phosphorylation sites placed into quadrants were subjected to a second filtering step to account for any inconsistent ratios between replicates of each experiment. This filter removed any site that featured at least one inverted (opposite of expected quadrant sign) experimental ratio with a magnitude greater than or equal to 0.25-fold change.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Meiotic chromosome spread immunofluorescence</title><p>Meiotic spreads were prepared as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Holloway et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, decapsulated testes tubules were incubated in a hypotonic extraction buffer (30 mM Tris pH 7.2, 50 mM sucrose, 17 mM citrate, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.1 mM PMSF) for 1 hr. 1 mm sections of tubule were dissected in 100 mM sucrose solution and then added to slides coated in 1% paraformaldehyde/0.15% Triton X and allowed to spread for 2.5 hr in a humidification chamber. Slides were then dried for 30 min and washed in 0.4% photoflo (Kodak)/PBS solution for 5 min. Slides were immediately processed for immunofluorescence or frozen at –80°C. For staining, slides were washed in a solution of 0.4% photoflo/PBS for 10 min, 0.1% Triton X/PBS for 10 min and blocked in 10% antibody dilution buffer (3% BSA, 10% goat serum, 0.0125% Triton X)/PBS for 10 min. Primary antibodies were diluted in antibody dilution buffer at the indicated dilution and incubated with a strip of parafilm to spread the antibody solution in a humidification chamber at 4°C overnight. After primary antibody incubation, the slides are washed with 0.4% photoflo/PBS for 10 min, 0.1% Triton X for 10 min, and blocked with 10% antibody dilution buffer. Secondary antibodies were diluted as indicated and incubated on slides with a parafilm strip at 37°C for 1 hr. Slides were then washed in 0.4% photoflo/PBS for 10 min twice followed by 0.4% photoflo/H<sub>2</sub>O for 10 min twice and allowed to dry before mounting with DAPI/antifade. Slides were imaged on a Leica DMi8 Microscope with a Leica DFC9000 GTC camera using the LAS X (Leica Application Suite X) software. For every condition, a minimum of 50 images from three independent mice were acquired. To quantify florescence intensity, the LAS X software quantification tool was used. Briefly, a region of interest (ROI) line was drawn over the sex body and mean intensity of the underlying pixels was recorded. Additionally, two ROI lines of equal length were placed over two autosome cores and the mean pixel intensity was also recorded to serve as an internal control for background florescence. The sex body ROI intensity was then normalized to the average of the two autosomal ROI intensities for each individual cell. For the autosomal signal CDK2, a ROI was drawn along each autosomal core as identified by SYCP3 staining. The signal intensity for each autosome was then averaged per cell. For the <italic>Rad1</italic> cKO mice<italic>,</italic> where a true sex body does not form, a line was drawn over chromosomes that were best morphologically identified as the sex chromosomes by SYCP3 staining.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Hematoxylin and eosin staining</title><p>Adult testes were dissected and incubated in Bouin’s fixative for 7 hr, washed 4× in 70% ethanol and embed in paraffin. 5 mM sections were mounted on slides and rehydrated in SafeCear Xylene Substitute followed by decreasing amounts of ethanol.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Phosphoproteomics of ATR Signaling in Prophase I of Mouse Meiosis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Akira Shinohara as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The Reviewing Editor and other two reviewers all acknowledge the importance of this work and recommend possible publication in <italic>eLife</italic> as a &quot;Tools and Resource&quot; paper. However, we all agree that you need a major revision of your paper, particularly in respect to the relationship with the co-submitted paper with Dr. Weiss.</p><p>Since using the same data sets in co-submitted papers is unusual, we ask you to integrate most of the ATR-dependent phospho-proteomic data described in Figure 6 (and possibly Figure 7 since there is little insight on the role of ATR-dependent phosphorylation of Smc3) from the accompanying paper by Weiss into your paper. Importantly, to strengthen your conclusion in the paper, we recommend you to re-analyze your data sets. Below are the list of experiments and additional analysis that we would like you to add in the revised version. We would like revisions to be returned within two months. If the revisions take a lot longer, you may want to resubmit as a new manuscript, and we will make sure that it goes to the same editors and reviewers.</p><p>Essential points (experiments):</p><p>1. One major issue is on the different cellular compositions between controls and Rad1-conditonal knockout (cKO) testes. The authors likely detected developmental changes in phosphorylation sites in spermatogenesis, and the authors are aware of this caveat (Line 160-165). To circumvent this issue, the authors may perform phosphoproteomics of first-wave Rad1-cKO testes (~ postnatal day 14 or 15), where the cellular composition of Rad1-cKO testes was not grossly changed from that of controls. They should also show the testicular section data and confirm the cellular composition of the testis they analyze. You may add these data set as Supplement; Duplicate would be preferred, but not essential.</p><p>2. There are two different experiments for ATRi-treated mice (2 pairs after 2.5-3 days of treatment and 2 pairs 4 hours after a single dose). However, these results are not distinguished in the analysis, and there is no evaluation of testicular morphology in both cases after the ATRi treatment. The authors should analyze these data separately as the experiments were distinct. Also, they should show the testicular morphology after the ATRi treatment and discussed the difference a little bit more.</p><p>3. It is very interesting hypothesis raised by the authors that ATR may control the activity of other kinases and phosphatases which will be responsible for most of the phosphorylation site changes observed in this study. To follow up on this, the author may check the localization of CDK1/2, MAK, NEK1, PKMYT1, PPM1G, and/or PP1R7 in control, ATRi-treated, and RAD1cKO spermatocytes?

One major issue is on the different cellular compositions between controls and Rad1-conditonal knockout (cKO) testes. The authors likely detected developmental changes in phosphorylation sites in spermatogenesis, and the authors are aware of this caveat (Line 160-165). To circumvent this issue, the authors may perform phosphoproteomics of first-wave Rad1-cKO testes (~ postnatal day 14 or 15), where the cellular composition of Rad1-cKO testes was not grossly changed from that of controls. They should also show the testicular section data and confirm the cellular composition of the testis they analyze. You may add these data set as Supplement; Duplicate would be preferred, but not essential.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We agree that the differences in cellular composition is a convoluting factor when comparing the <italic>Rad1</italic> cKO and WT testes. We believe that our dual approach of only considering sites that are depleted in <italic>both</italic> the <italic>Rad1</italic> cKO <italic>as well as the 4 hour ATRi treated mice</italic> (which do not have changes in cellular composition) (see point 2) addresses this concern. We do acknowledge that it would be ideal to perform the phosphoproteomic experiments in <italic>Rad1</italic> cKO 14 day-old mice, before significant cell loss has occurred. Unfortunately, the amount of tissue required to perform phosphoproteomic analysis on first-wave <italic>Rad1</italic> cKO testes would be prohibitive and we were not able to perform this experiment. However, with the limited number of <italic>Rad1</italic> cKO mice available to us, we were able to confirm that SETX and RANBP3 localization in 14-day old <italic>Rad1</italic> cKO testes was not different compared to 8-12 week <italic>Rad1</italic> cKO animals from our initial analysis, supporting the validity of our approach (please see Figure 4—figure supplement 1D and Figure 4—figure supplement 2D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. There are two different experiments for ATRi-treated mice (2 pairs after 2.5-3 days of treatment and 2 pairs 4 hours after a single dose). However, these results are not distinguished in the analysis, and there is no evaluation of testicular morphology in both cases after the ATRi treatment. The authors should analyze these data separately as the experiments were distinct. Also, they should show the testicular morphology after the ATRi treatment and discussed the difference a little bit more.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this important suggestion. We have now analyzed the 2.5-3 day ATRi treatment separately from the 4 hr ATRi datasets. Importantly, we repeated the 4 hr treatment condition (now five replicates) to enhance our confidence in this dataset. We have included the 2.5-3 day ATRi dataset analysis in separate supplemental figures and tables, and have used it for the analysis of the S/T-P-X-K motif and to compare the changes in this motif over the 4hr and 2.5-3 day inhibition period. We have confirmed that tubule morphology and cellular composition is not altered in the 4 hr ATRi treatment condition and have added this data to the supplement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. It is very interesting hypothesis raised by the authors that ATR may control the activity of other kinases and phosphatases which will be responsible for most of the phosphorylation site changes observed in this study. To follow up on this, the author may check the localization of CDK1/2, MAK, NEK1, PKMYT1, PPM1G, and/or PP1R7 in control, ATRi-treated, and RAD1cKO spermatocytes? For some of these proteins, commercial antibodies are available, even for their phosphorylated forms.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the authors for the positive comment on the finding that ATR is likely regulating other downstream kinases and phosphatases. We thank the suggestion of monitoring potential localization changes of some of the kinases/phosphatases upon ATR inhibition. We performed a series of IF experiments to assess the localization of several kinases/phosphatases for which antibodies were available. Despite multiple attempts, we could not detect specific signal in meiotic spreads for several of the proteins in the vehicle or 4 hour ATRi treatment condition. Excitingly, we were able to observe specific signal for CDK2 and found that its localization in meiotic spreads was significantly reduced after 4 hours of ATRi treatment (New Figures 5C-D and Figure 5—figure supplement 2). We believe that this is an important finding that highlights the potential for ATR activity to regulate CDK localization and allow CDK-dependent phosphorylation of several targets, consistent with our finding that ATRi treatment results in the loss of several phosphorylation events at the S/T-P-X-K motif (Figure 5A-B). We have included this new data to a remodeled Figure 5 and updated the discussion accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other points (text editing etc);</p><p>1.
