Cell fate transformation in dermal fibroblasts generates a cell niche for placode induction by activation of signaling pathways WNT, EDA, and FGF in the epithelium. These successive paracrine epithelial signals initiate dermal condensation in the underlying mesenchyme. Although epithelial signaling from the placode to mesenchyme is better described, little is known about primary mesenchymal signals resulting in placode induction. Using genetic approach in mice, we show that <italic>Meis2</italic> expression in cells derived from the neural crest is critical for whisker formation and also for branching of trigeminal nerves. While whisker formation is independent of the trigeminal sensory innervation, MEIS2 in mesenchymal dermal cells orchestrates the initial steps of epithelial placode formation and subsequent dermal condensation. MEIS2 regulates the expression of transcription factor <italic>Foxd1</italic>, which is typical of pre-dermal condensation. However, deletion of <italic>Foxd1</italic> does not affect whisker development. Overall, our data suggest an early role of mesenchymal MEIS2 during whisker formation and provide evidence that whiskers can normally develop in the absence of sensory innervation or <italic>Foxd1</italic> expression.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>whisker follicle</kwd><kwd>hair follicle placode</kwd><kwd>cranial nerves</kwd><kwd>Meis2</kwd><kwd>Foxd1</kwd><kwd>Sox2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001824</institution-id><institution>Czech Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>22-10660S</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaplan</surname><given-names>Mehmet Mahsum</given-names></name><name><surname>Hudacova</surname><given-names>Erika</given-names></name><name><surname>Matejcek</surname><given-names>Miroslav</given-names></name><name><surname>Machon</surname><given-names>Ondrej</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010653</institution-id><institution>Masaryk University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MUNI/A/1598/2023</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tuaima</surname><given-names>Haneen</given-names></name><name><surname>Křivánek</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>MEYS Czech Republic</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NanoEnviCZ</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Machon</surname><given-names>Ondrej</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>MEYS Czech Republic</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LM2018124</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Machon</surname><given-names>Ondrej</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>EU Structural Funds Pro-NanoEnviCz</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_013/0001821</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Machon</surname><given-names>Ondrej</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001824</institution-id><institution>Czech Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>23-06160S</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Křivánek</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Meis2 transcription factor instructs the mesenchyme to initiate whisker formation in the epithelium.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The local cell environment provides essential cues that determine cell fate decisions, proliferation, and migration. The molecular communication between the developing epithelium and the underlying cell environment is crucial for the formation of multiple structures, which are derived from the embryonic epithelium, such as the eye lens, hair follicles (HFs) including whisker (vibrissae) follicles, teeth, taste papillae, the intestine lumen, or salivary glands. In the developing vertebrate head, these tissue cross-talks employ neural crest-derived mesenchyme with the epithelium, myogenic progenitors, or cartilage. Critical steps in whisker follicle (WF) development are very similar to normal HF development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wrenn and Wessells, 1984</xref>), which has been studied much more extensively. HF morphogenesis is initiated by thickening of the epithelium forming a placode (Pc), which subsequently induces condensation of underlying fibroblasts (Fb) termed dermal condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sennett and Rendl, 2012</xref>). Beta-catenin-dependent WNT signaling is essential for Pc induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huelsken et al., 2001</xref>), which initiates the EDA pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>), FGF20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huh et al., 2013</xref>), and SHH signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Botchkarev et al., 1998</xref>) in the epithelium. Abrogation of any of these signaling pathways leads to the arrest of HF development. However, the succession of initial inductive steps in HF formation is still unclear. Pc formation requires hitherto unknown primary signals from dermal Fb at the pre-dermal condensate (DC) stage that is characterized by expression of <italic>Foxd1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mok et al., 2019</xref>) and <italic>Prdm1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Manti et al., 2022</xref>). Recent studies employing single-cell transcriptomics helped elucidate the molecular determination of Pc and DC induction. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mok et al., 2019</xref>, described a wave of transcription factors that define cell fate trajectories, starting in dermal Fb underlying the epithelium before Pc induction (pre-DC stage), toward DC and the late DC stage when Pc invagination commences. For instance, expression of <italic>Foxd1</italic> transcription factor was detected in pre-DC Fb that are also characterized by expression of <italic>Twist2, Lef1</italic>, and <italic>Smad3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mok et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sennett et al., 2015</xref>). DC cells predominantly express <italic>Sox2</italic>, <italic>Foxd1, Ptch1,</italic> and <italic>Bmp4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gupta et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ge et al., 2020</xref>). On the other hand, DC initiation requires canonical WNT and FGF20 signaling in Pc, suggesting a reciprocal molecular cross-talk between the dermal mesenchyme and overlying epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mok et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gupta et al., 2019</xref>). Transplantation experiments suggested that mesenchymal cells modulate WNT signaling in Pc by activation of RSPO1; however, RSPO1 is not sufficient for HF induction even in combination with BMP inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mäkelä and Mikkola, 2023</xref>). Although these data comprehensively map molecular events during HF initiation, identification of the primary inductive signal for Pc induction coming from dermal Fb is still missing.</p><p>Epithelial structures such as whiskers or teeth are formed at precisely defined locations. Whiskers are arranged in an accurate rectangular pattern in five rows, each containing four to nine follicles. Each whisker is innervated by a separate whisker-to-barrel circuit that is reflected in a clear topographic organization of the barrel cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). Axons of the trigeminal (TG) nerve ending in the infraorbital nerve innervate each whisker germ in the maxillary prominence. It has been suggested that early innervation does not play a role in determining WF pattern as distribution of TG axons is widespread and random in the maxillary process, and no one-to-one spatial correlation between nerves and WFs was found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wrenn and Wessells, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davies and Lumsden, 1986</xref>). This view has been challenged by the observation of a regular pattern of the nerve plexus in the snout half a day prior to the pattern of WFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Van Exan and Hardy, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maklad et al., 2010</xref>). However, these studies do not imply whether WFs develop normally in vivo in the complete absence of innervation. Although normal vessel ring organization in the WFs of mice lacking TG sensory innervation has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oh and Gu, 2013</xref>), a comprehensive description of the WF development was not studied in this context. Therefore, while existing literature points to a scenario with an unlikely role of innervation for the WF formation and patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrés and Van der Loos, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrés and Van Der Loos, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lillesaar and Hildebrand, 1999</xref>), a more direct and conclusive in vivo study is needed to resolve this issue.</p><p>Similarly, the influence of the TG nerves for tooth development has not been conclusively demonstrated. Organ culture methods showed no involvement of TG sensory innervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lumsden and Buchanan, 1986</xref>), and tooth germs can trigger their own innervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Erdélyi et al., 1987</xref>). Along these lines, diastema tooth primordia develop and subsequently disappear with no TG innervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Løes et al., 2002</xref>). However, the existence of earlier pioneering axons in the TG system has been reported; therefore, tooth development might be initiated by interaction with the early arriving pioneering axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stainier and Gilbert, 1990</xref>). Moreover, roles of neurogenic factors have been shown during tooth development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sandor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tachibana et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moiseiwitsch and Lauder, 1996</xref>). A surgical removal of (TG) axons innervating teeth led to tooth degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adameyko and Fried, 2016</xref>). Hence, cranial nerves might deliver morphogenetic signals that orchestrate tooth maintenance. The role of innervation during tooth development was also supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kaukua et al., 2014</xref>, who showed that dental mesenchymal stem cells are recruited from the nerve-associated glial cell. Taken together, it has been suggested that innervation play a role in tooth development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duan et al., 2022</xref>). However, in a model system where innervation is completely missing, tooth development has not been analyzed.</p><p>Thus, peripheral nerves and accompanying glia contribute to the mesenchymal tooth germ niche. Nonetheless, it is still unclear what cellular mechanisms regulate precise positions of whiskers in the snout. Turing reaction-diffusion mathematical model can be applied for oscillating tissue patterning that is orchestrated by diffusion of short-range activating morphogen that triggers expression of long-range inhibitor. Reaction-diffusion-based instruction of the epithelium by combinatorial WNT, FGF, and BMP signaling is capable of HF placode induction in a highly restricted regular pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Glover et al., 2017</xref>). However, a highly specific rectangular arrangement and relatively long distance among WFs within the developing snout may indicate that other molecular determinants play a role in spatiotemporal control of WF induction. This revives the previous speculations that an axonal network may be involved in WF positioning. In this report, we assessed the scenario that the neural network is implicated in the control of accurate geometrical arrangement of WFs.</p><p>Here, we generated <italic>Meis2</italic> conditional mutants using the Wnt1-Cre2 driver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lewis et al., 2013</xref>) targeting exclusively the neural crest-derived tissues, including the dermal mesenchyme and cranial nerves, without detectable recombination in the overlying epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fabik et al., 2020</xref>). Although <italic>Meis2</italic> expression in the epithelium of Wnt1-Cre2; <italic>Meis2</italic> <sup>fl/fl</sup> (<italic>Meis2</italic> cKO) mutants was preserved, whisker development was arrested at the Pc induction stage. This is documented by failure in induction of expression of placodal genes such as <italic>Shh</italic>, <italic>Edar,</italic> and <italic>Lef1</italic>. We further show that severely affected branching of TG nerves innervating WFs cannot cause their developmental arrest because WFs form normally even in a complete absence of TG nerves. Expression of <italic>Meis2</italic> in dermal Fb is therefore necessary for induction of whisker placodes followed by dermal condensation. Protein expression analysis suggests that MEIS2 transcription factor is essential for triggering a primary inductive signal from the mesenchyme to the epithelium to initiate WF placode formation. While single-cell transcriptomics and immunohistochemical validations showed that <italic>Meis2</italic> operates upstream of <italic>Foxd1</italic>, primary pre-DC marker, we report a dispensable role of <italic>Foxd1</italic> during WF development. Overall, our data not only describe an essential role of mesenchymal <italic>Meis2</italic> for WF development but also document normal WF formation even in the complete absence of innervating axons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Meis2</italic> expression in cranial neural crest-derived cells is required for correct TG nerve projections and whisker development</title><p>To study whisker morphogenesis, we used Wnt1-Cre2; <italic>Meis2</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> conditional mutants, in which <italic>Meis2</italic> is deleted in neural crest-derived cells (hereafter, <italic>Meis2</italic> cKO). Micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) of embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5) embryos revealed severely compromised development of whiskers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Missing whiskers were also observed whole-mount embryonic heads stained with placodal marker SOX9 antibody after light-sheet microscopy scanning at as early as E13.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). It is noteworthy that we observed in some cases a small number of SOX9+ WFs in <italic>Meis2</italic> cKO. They most likely represented normal follicles that ‘escaped’ from Wnt1-Cre2-mediated deletion of <italic>Meis2</italic>. The number of WF ‘escapers’ in <italic>Meis2</italic> cKO snouts varied among samples. Some mutant embryos completely missed WFs, but some showed a reduction in their numbers. Overall, quantification of the WF number documented a reduction to 5.7 ± 2.0% at E12.5 and to 17.1 ± 5.9% at E13.5 in the mutants (n=at least 3 embryos for E12.5, n=at least 8 embryos for E13.5, mean ± sem) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Analysis of placode thickness/follicle length and DC area revealed that these escaper whiskers have normal morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). To analyze expression of <italic>Meis2</italic> in the snout, we performed fluorescent immunohistochemistry. MEIS2 protein was detected in the epithelium, in the most superficial dermis including DC. In <italic>Meis2</italic> cKO, mesenchymal expression of <italic>Meis2</italic> virtually disappeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, asterisk, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>) while its epithelial expression was maintained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, arrowheads, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), which corresponds to tissue-specific Cre recombination of Wnt1-Cre2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lewis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fabik et al., 2020</xref>). It is interesting that MEIS2 signal was also remarkably reduced around sole WF ‘escapers’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, arrow) but we cannot exclude that, due to incomplete Cre-mediated deletion, a minor expression of <italic>Meis2</italic> below the immunohistochemical detectability threshold is sufficient for WF induction. To verify the tissue specificity in the snout region, we crossed Wnt1-Cre2 mice with mTmG mouse strain, where only cells derived from the neural crest express membrane-localized GFP. Whole-mount immunofluorescence imaging confirmed the Wnt1-Cre2 activity in neural crest derivatives in the craniofacial area, midbrain, and dorsal spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In the snout, Cre activity was restricted to dermal mesenchyme without a detectable recombination in the overlying epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Moreover, branches of TG sensory nerves were labeled with GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, arrows), consistent with the previously known origin of TG neurons mainly from neural crest cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Leonard et al., 2022</xref>). Whiskers are innervated by the axons of the infraorbital nerve, a branch of the TG nerve. To examine the axonal outgrowths associated with whisker germs, we co-labeled the HF marker SOX9 with the sensory nerve marker TRKA in whole-mount heads at E13.5. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref> show that missing whiskers in mice lacking <italic>Meis2</italic> in neural crest-derived cells were accompanied by severely affected TG nerve growth and branching. Because defects in nerve branching were not limited to the infraorbital nerve and were also observed in other TG branches, this phenotype is most likely not caused by missing WFs themselves.

The latter scenario takes into account the possibility that the nerve or nerve-associated Schwann cells produce factors that are necessary for WF formation. Thus, compromised branching of sensory axons in the <italic>Meis2</italic> cKO snout might result in insufficient secretion of crucial WF-inducing factors. In order to directly assess the function of sensory innervation in WF development, we analyzed <italic>Neurog1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, which do not develop some cranial nerves, including TG nerves, and therefore lack sensory innervation of the developing whiskers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ma et al., 1998</xref>).

Lack of any TUJ1-labeled axon fascicules in the proximity of the normally developed WFs in the <italic>Neurog1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> snout further excludes the possibility of non-sensory neurons triggering WF development in the absence of sensory innervation. In order to assess the role of sensory innervation for overall whisker patterning, we stained E12.5 and E13.5 snout whole mounts with SOX9 and EDAR antibodies, marking initial stages of WF development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>), i.e., Pc formation.

EDAR staining performed at E12.5 10 µm FFPE sections further confirmed normal placodal expression of EDAR, indicating normal initiation of the WF development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

We therefore assessed canonical WNT signaling in <italic>Meis2</italic> cKO snouts by several types of WNT signaling readouts. First, we used LEF1 immunofluorescence because its expression has been widely used as proxy for WNT signaling in HF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">DasGupta and Fuchs, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matos et al., 2020</xref>) and <italic>Lef1</italic> is also required for whisker formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kratochwil et al., 1996</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matos et al., 2020</xref>, showed that dermal cells expressed <italic>Lef1</italic> broadly whereas in the epithelium, <italic>Lef1</italic> expression was concentrated in Pc cells compared to interfollicular regions. During Pc downgrowth in HF, basal Pc cells displayed LEF1 signal similarly to Shh and EDAR, in contrast to suprabasal placodal cells lacking LEF1. This is consistent with the view that high WNT activity is seen in the basal cells whereas suprabasal cells are WNT low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matos et al., 2020</xref>). In WF, we similarly detected robust LEF1 signal in Pc that was remarkably lower in interfollicular regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). However, in distal snout regions with no WFs, the epithelium showed confluent LEF1 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), suggesting that LEF1 signal is regionally dependent Pc indicator. In contrast to the epithelium, DC underneath invaginating Pc consistently displayed decreased LEF1 staining compared to peri-DC neighboring regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In <italic>Meis2</italic> cKO, we rarely detected a patterned placodal increase in LEF1 staining in the expected sites of WF positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

To validate transcriptomic data, we analyzed FOXD1 protein expression in tissue sections of wild-type snouts at E12.5 and E13.5. Similarly to HF, <italic>Foxd1</italic> expression preceded <italic>Sox2</italic> also in WF which occurred before the Pc downgrowth into the dermal niche at E12.5.

In more progressed WF germs with deeply invaginated Pc, <italic>Foxd1</italic> expression remained in peri-DC regions rather than in DC that was marked by a strong SOX2 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, right panels, arrowhead). Next, whole-mount staining of FOXD1 in the whole snout highlighted dynamic WF development along the proximo-distal axis. It started in proximal columns at E12.5, in which WF formation was more progressed, while distal snout regions initiate WF slightly later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

Mouse embryos, in which <italic>Meis2</italic> was deleted in tissues derived from neural crest cells by Wnt1-Cre2 driver, lost the majority of whiskers. The aberrant whisker phenotype in the mutants is accompanied by markedly reduced TG nerve branching in the snout. This suggests a novel function of <italic>Meis2</italic> in TG axonal growth, branching, and guidance. It may also implicate that whisker formation, or WF positional determination, may depend on early sensory innervation. We report here, however, that whisker formation is entirely independent of sensory innervation. <italic>Neurog1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice completely lack TG nerves, including their ganglions, but whisker development is not affected. Moreover, analysis of <italic>Neurog1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice at E17.5 reveals that sensory innervation is not required for the further growth and stabilization of WFs. The effect of TG innervation deficiency on postnatal WF development could not be tested because <italic>Neurog1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice are lethal within a day after birth. All these experiments exclude the possibility that the whisker phenotype in <italic>Meis2</italic> cKO embryos is an indirect consequence of decreased TG nerve branching. It rather indicates that mesenchymal <italic>Meis2</italic> is a pivotal regulator of WF formation.</p><p>Our observations suggest that nerve branching phenotype in the mutant is independent of TG ganglia development or missing whiskers, as <italic>Meis2</italic> cKO mice showed normal TG ganglia size and nerve exit from the ganglia as well as defective TG nerve branches that do not innervate whiskers. Thus, <italic>Meis2</italic> rather influences TG branching and guidance through the snout. Description of the exact nature of factors controlling TG nerve branching downstream of MEIS2 warrants further investigation. A number of molecular pathways, such as SLIT/ROBO, SEMA/NRP/PLXN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Taniguchi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schwarz et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schwarz et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ulupinar et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2001</xref>), and EPHRIN/EPH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">North et al., 2010</xref>) signaling, have been implicated during TG nerve development, and <italic>Meis2</italic> might act upstream of mesenchymal expression of ligands and/or TG expression of receptors of these pathways to control TG nerve development. One possible mechanism might involve SEMA3A, an inhibitory factor for TG nerve growth during tooth innervation, and <italic>Sema3a</italic> null mice display hyper-branched TG nerves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ulupinar et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dent et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moe et al., 2012</xref>). Our scRNA-seq datasets indicated an increase of <italic>Sema3a</italic> expression in <italic>Meis2</italic> cKO mesenchymal cell populations (data not shown), which could explain decreased nerve branching in <italic>Meis2</italic> cKO mice and could be addressed in future studies.</p><p>Essential role of <italic>Meis2</italic> in the dermal mesenchyme during very early steps of WF development is supported by several key observations. First, although epithelial expression of <italic>Meis2</italic> is preserved in <italic>Meis2</italic> cKO mice, thickening of the epithelium is rarely observed, suggesting that the release of WF Pc-inducing dermal factors is under control of mesenchymal <italic>Meis2</italic>. It is widely accepted that HF or WF formation is initiated from the dermis by a ‘first dermal signal’ that has not been identified yet. Our data show that this process is dependent on <italic>Meis2</italic>. Second, the absence of <italic>Meis2</italic> results in the loss of early placodal markers LEF1 and EDAR and pre-DC marker FOXD1 at expected WF locations. Absence of patterned upregulation of LEF1 and EDAR was documented in HFs after blocking dermal WNT signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, our analysis of WNT signaling readouts did now show remarkable changes in canonical WNT signaling in <italic>Meis2</italic> cKO dermis, indicating that normal dermal WNT signaling is not sufficient to trigger patterned LEF1 and EDAR upregulation in the epithelium when dermal MEIS2 is absent. These epithelial changes probably require additional <italic>Meis2</italic>-dependent intermediate steps, which might act either in parallel with or downstream of dermal WNT signaling to induce Pc formation. In the dermis, pre-DC marker FOXD1 expression was shown to be dependent on <italic>Fgf20</italic> expression in HF Pc and occurs after Pc formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mok et al., 2019</xref>). Our analysis of <italic>Foxd1</italic> expression in wild-type snout dermis revealed that <italic>Foxd1</italic> expression appears prior to morphologically distinguishable WF Pc. In <italic>Meis2</italic> cKO, FOXD1 signal in the dermis prior to WF Pc formation was not detected, which accords with scRNA-seq data. This all suggests that <italic>Meis2</italic> operates upstream of <italic>Foxd1</italic>. However, direct analysis of <italic>Foxd1</italic>-null mice did not reveal any phenotype in WF development. This could be explained by either no function of <italic>Foxd1</italic> in this process or by a possible functional compensation by its paralog <italic>Foxd3</italic>. Since <italic>Foxd1</italic> does not affect WF formation and therefore the absence of <italic>Foxd1</italic> cannot account for lacking WFs in <italic>Meis2</italic> cKO mice, loss of FOXD1 in these mice evidently is a result of lacking pre-DC and DC structures. Lastly, it has been shown in HF development that dermal Fb proliferate extensively prior to converting to DC cell fate. DC cells, on the other hand, exit the cell cycle and become quiescent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mok et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gupta et al., 2019</xref>). We generally observed reduced proliferation in upper dermal cells in <italic>Meis2</italic> cKO mice. Lower cell proliferation could contribute to inefficient cell fate change of Fb to DC and might also lead to insufficient expression and/or release of Pc-inducing factor in the dermis of <italic>Meis2</italic> mutants. Overall, these observations strongly suggest that the absence of <italic>Meis2</italic> in mesenchymal cells affects earliest processes of WF development, even prior to Pc formation.</p><p>It is important to note that we observed small numbers (around 18% at E13.5) of WFs in <italic>Meis2</italic> cKO expressing normal placodal and DC markers. These rarely formed WF ‘escapers’ in <italic>Meis2</italic> cKO mice had normal WF morphology, because their Pc thickness, follicle length, and DC size were comparable between controls and mutants at E12.5-E13.5. WF ‘escapers’ in mutants were probably not sensitive to Wnt1-Cre2-mediated deletion of <italic>Meis2</italic>. Although immunostaining of MEIS2 in snout sections indicated that <italic>Meis2</italic> expression around WF escapers was hardly detectable in mutants, a slight but undetectable expression of <italic>Meis2</italic> resulting from incomplete gene deletion might account for normal WF formation. On the other hand, it is also possible that <italic>Meis1</italic> paralog can partially substitute for missing <italic>Meis2</italic> in its function in the dermal mesenchyme. Alternatively, <italic>Meis2</italic> function in WF development might be restricted to a short time window as each WF develops at different time points along the proximal-distal axis. It also remains as a tentative possibility that <italic>Meis2</italic> in the whisker pad mesenchyme is required for yet an unidentified function. Therefore, the absence of whiskers could be an indirect consequence of this plausibility.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse strains</title><p>Generation and genotyping of the floxed allele of <italic>Meis2</italic> gene (<italic>Meis2</italic> <sup>fl/fl</sup>) was described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Machon et al., 2015</xref>. <italic>Meis2</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> strain was crossed with reporter mouse lines R26R-<italic>EYFP</italic> <sup>fl/fl</sup> (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:IMSR_JAX:006148">IMSR_JAX:006148</ext-link>) before crossing with the Wnt1-Cre2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lewis et al., 2013</xref>).

Briefly, dermal Fb clusters were subset and split by condition, which was followed by SCTransform normalization, where mitochondrial, ribosomal, and cell cycle genes were regressed. Seurat objects were then integrated by using the IntegrateData function with 3000 integration features. For UMAP as a nonlinear dimensional reduction embedding, 30 principal components were used. We used the Clustree package to determine the optimal resolution, which was set at 0.6 for the FindClusters function according to the developers’ instructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zappia and Oshlack, 2018</xref>). SCT assay was used to generate feature plots and violin plots. Normalized and Scaled data of the RNA assay were used to extract cluster markers using the FindAllMarkers function and to generate heatmaps. The FindMarkers function of the Seurat package was used for differential gene expression analysis between conditions with default parameters. clusterProfiler (4.6.2) was used for GO analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wu et al., 2021</xref>), where GO terms were extracted by the enrichGO function.

With ImageJ software, maximum intensity projection was applied to z-stack images. DAPI staining was used to visually identify Pc and DCs. The distance from the outer layer of epithelium in the placodal region to the epithelial-mesenchymal boundary was measured. For 2D DC size, DCs were identified by densely accumulated cells underneath the Pc. The area of the region covered by these cells was measured using ImageJ.</p><p>The number of WFs was manually counted in embryos that were used throughout the study for whole-mount immunostainings (labeled by SOX9, EDAR, and/or FOXD1 antibodies) or in situ hybridization (<italic>Shh</italic> mRNA). The numbers of WFs at both sides of the snout were pooled. The decrease in the percentage of WFs in <italic>Meis2</italic> cKO mice was calculated in comparison to their control littermates. Values from each experiment were averaged to determine the overall decrease in the percentage of WFs.</p><p>For Lef1 quantification, images of Lef1-stained 10 µm FFPE snout sections were captured with an Olympus SpinSR10 microscope and a ×20 objective. With ImageJ software, maximum intensity projection was applied to z-stack images. Local thickenings of the epithelium, Pc, were determined visually by DAPI staining. Their Lef1 positivity was determined and manually counted. Lef1 fluorescence intensity of these sites were measured by using ImageJ intensity analysis tool after manually drawing areas covering Lef1+ Pc. Similarly, Lef1 fluorescence intensity of DCs was measured with ImageJ after drawing areas covering DCs that were densely populated with DAPI-stained cells underneath the Pc. Lef1 fluorescence intensities in non-DC upper dermal regions were measured in the dermal region between the epithelium and around a 100 µm distance into the dermis between DCs.</p><p>For EdU/DAPI area measurements, images of EdU-chased and DAPI-stained 10 µm FFPE snout sections were captured with an Olympus SpinSR10 microscope equipped with a ×20 objective. With ImageJ software, maximum intensity projection was applied to z-stack images. The dermal region between the epithelium and around a 100 µm distance into the dermis was used for analysis, while DC domains were excluded. The selected dermal regions were processed separately for thresholding steps to cover EdU+ and DAPI+ regions. Threshold values were determined visually to cover specific EdU and DAPI staining. The same threshold values were used for control and <italic>Meis2</italic> cKO mutants. Total area values for EdU and DAPI were used to calculate 2D EdU coverage of the DAPI regions (EdU/DAPI).</p><p>Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 10 software.

Advanced imaging techniques effectively support the idea that Meis2 is essential for proper WF development and that nerves, while affected in Meis2 cKO, are dispensable for WF development and not the primary cause of WF developmental failure.

The authors suggest that this could be due to an early role of Meis2 in the mesenchyme because HFs develop later. Indeed, one plausible possibility is that Meis2 does not have any direct role in whisker (or hair) follicle development but is specifically required for some other function in the whisker pad mesenchyme, a function that remains unidentified in the current study as it mainly focuses on analyzing hair follicle marker expression in whisker follicles.

Advanced imaging techniques effectively support the idea that Meis2 is essential for proper WF development and that nerves, while affected in Meis2 cKO, are dispensable for WF development and not the primary cause of WF developmental failure. The study also reveals that although Meis2 significantly downregulates Foxd1 in the mesenchyme, this is not the main reason for WF development failure. The paper presents valuable data on the role of mesenchymal Meis2 in WF development. However, further quantification and analysis of the WF developmental phenotype would be beneficial in strengthening the claim that Meis2 controls early WF development rather than causing a delay or arrest in development. A deeper sequencing data analysis could also help link Meis2 to its downstream targets that directly impact the epithelial compartment.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) The authors describe a novel molecular mechanism involving Mesenchymal Meis2 expression, which plays a crucial role in early WF development.</p><p>(2) They employ multiple advanced imaging techniques to illustrate their findings beautifully.</p><p>(3) The study clearly shows that nerves are not essential for WF development.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for valuable comments that will help improve our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The authors claim that Meis2 acts very early during development, as evidenced by a significant reduction in EDAR expression, one of the earliest markers of placode development. While EDAR is indeed absent from the lower panel in Figure 3C of the Meis2 cKO, multiple placodes still express EDAR in the upper two panels of the Meis2 cKO. The authors also present subsequent analysis at E13.3, showing one escaped follicle positive for SHH and Sox9 in Figures 1 and 3. Does this suggest that follicles are specified but fail to develop? Alternatively, could there be a delay in follicle formation? The increase in Foxd1 expression between E12.5 and E13.5 might also indicate delayed follicle development, or as the authors suggest, follicles that have escaped the phenotype. The paper would significantly benefit from robust quantification to accompany their visual data, specifically quantifying EDAR, Sox9, and Foxd1 at different developmental stages. Additionally, analyzing later developmental stages could help distinguish between a delay or arrest in WF development and a complete failure to specify placodes.</p></disp-quote><p>The earliest DC (FOXD1) and placodal (EDAR, LEF1) markers tested in this study were observed only in the escaped WFs whereas these markers were missing in expected WF sites in mutants. This was also reflected in the loss of typical placodal morphology in the mutant’s epithelium. On the other hand, escaped WFs developed normally as shown by the analysis in Supp Fig 1A-B showing their normal size. These data suggest that development of escaped WFs is not delayed because they would appear smaller in size. To strengthen this conclusion, we assessed whisker development at E18.5 in <italic>Meis2</italic> cKO mice by EDAR staining and results are shown in newly added Supplementary Figure 2. This experiment revealed that whisker phenotype persisted until E18.5 therefore this phenotype cannot be explained by a developmental delay.</p><p>As far as quantification is concerned, we have already quantified the number of whiskers in controls and mutants at E12.5 and E13.5 in all whole mount experiments we did, i.e. <italic>Shh</italic> ISH and SOX9 or EDAR whole mount IFC. We pooled all these numbers together and calculated the whisker number reduction to 5.7+/-2.0% at E12.5 and 17.1+/-5.9 at E13.5. Line:132-134.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors show that single-cell sequencing reveals a reduction in the pre-DC population, reduced proliferation, and changes in cell adhesion and ECM. However, these changes appear to affect most mesenchymal cells, not just pre-DCs. Moreover, since E12.5 already contains WFs at different stages of development, as well as pre-DCs and DCs, it becomes challenging to connect these mesenchymal changes directly to WF development. Did the authors attempt to re-cluster only Cluster 2 to determine if a specific subpopulation is missing in Meis2 cKO? Alternatively, focusing on additional secreted molecules whose expression is disrupted across different clusters in Meis2 cKO could provide insights, especially since mesenchymal-epithelial communication is often mediated through secreted molecules. Did the authors include epithelial cells in the single-cell sequencing, can they look for changes in mesenchyme-epithelial cell interactions (Cell Chat) to indicate a possible mechanism?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the effect of Meis2 on cell proliferation and expression of cell adhesion and ECM markers are more general because they take place in the whole underlying mesenchyme. Our genetic tools did not allow specific targeting of DC or pre-DCs. Nonetheless, we trust that our data show that mesenchymal <italic>Meis2</italic> is required for the initial steps of WF development including Pc formation. As far as bioinformatics data are concerned, this data set was taken from the large dataset GSE262468 covering the whole craniofacial region which led to very limited cell numbers in the cluster 2 (DC): WT_E12_5 --&gt; 28, WT_E13_5 --&gt; 131, MUT_E12_5 --&gt; 19, MUT_E13_5 --&gt; 28. Unfortunately, such small cell numbers did not allow further sub-clustering, efficient normalization, integration and conclusions from their transcriptional profiles. Although a number of interesting differentially expressed genes were identified (see supplementary datasets), none of them convincingly pointed at reasonable secreted molecule candidate.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that cellchat analysis could provide robust indication of the mesenchymal-epithelial communication, however our datasets included only mesenchymal cell population (Wnt1-Cre2progeny) and epithelial cells were excluded by FACS prior to sc RNA-seq.

However, the changes described in the figures are unclear, and the phenotype appears highly variable, making it difficult to establish a connection between Meis2 and Wnt signaling. For instance, some follicles and pre-condensates are Lef1 positive in Meis2 cKO. Including quantification or providing a clearer explanation could help clarify the relationship between mesenchymal Meis2 and Wnt signaling in both epidermal and mesenchymal cells. Did the authors include epithelial cells in the sequencing? Could they use single-cell analysis to demonstrate changes in Wnt signaling?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now analyzed changes in LEF1 staining intensity in the epithelium and in the upper dermis. According to these quantifications, we observed a considerable decline in the number of LEF1+ placodes in the epithelium which corresponds to the lower number of placodes. On the other hand, LEF1 intensity in the ‘escaped’ placodes were similar between controls and mutants. LEF1 signal in the upper dermis is very strong overall and its quantification did not reveal any changes in the DC and non-DC region of the upper dermis. These data corroborate with our conclusion that <italic>Meis2</italic> in the mesenchyme is not crucial for the dermal WNT signaling but is required for induction of LEF1 expression in the epithelium. However, once ‘escaper’ placodes appear, they display normal wnt signaling in Pc, DC and subsequent development. These quantitative data have been added to the revised manuscript.

While the authors conduct a thorough analysis of WF development in Neurog KO, further supporting this notion, this point may not be central to the current work. Additionally, the claim that Meis2 influences trigeminal nerve patterning requires further analysis and quantification for validation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that analysis of the <italic>Neurogenin1</italic> knockout mice should not be central to this report.

However, the background fluorescence made it challenging to reliable quantify. Additionally, since at the point, dermal region where MEIS2 expression is relevant to induce WF formation is not known, we were unable to determine the regions to analyze. Instead, we now added three additional images from multiple regions of the snout sections stained with MEIS2 antibody in Supplementary Figure 1C.

However, the authors forget to mention that Wrenn &amp; Wessless, 1984 (reference 1 in the manuscript) made exactly the opposite conclusion and stated e.g. &quot;Nerve trunks and branches are present in the maxillary process well before any sign of vibrissa formation. Because innervation is so widespread there appears to be no immediate temporal correlation between the outgrowth of a nerve branch to a site and the generation of a vibrissa there. Furthermore, at the time just prior to the formation of the first follicle rudiment, there is little or no nerve branching to the presumptive site of that first follicle while branches are found more dorsally where vibrissae will not form until later.&quot; Therefore, I find that referring to the paper by Wrenn &amp; Wessells is somewhat misleading. Given that the whisker follicles develop in ex vivo cultured whisker pads further hints that innervation is unlikely to play a role in whisker follicle induction.</p></disp-quote><p>The Introduction also hints at the role of innervation in tooth induction but forgets to refer to the literature that shows exactly the opposite.
