ischemic injury in models of myocardial infarction. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms behind these effects remain unclear. To shed light on the molecular and cellular adaptations of the heart to IF, we conducted comprehensive system-wide analyses of the proteome, phosphoproteome, and transcriptome, followed by functional analysis. Using advanced mass spectrometry, we profiled the proteome and phosphoproteome of heart tissues obtained from mice that were maintained on daily 12- or 16 hr fasting, every-other-day fasting, or ad libitum control feeding regimens for 6 months. We also performed RNA sequencing to evaluate whether the observed molecular responses to IF occur at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional levels. Our analyses revealed that IF significantly affected pathways that regulate cyclic GMP signaling, lipid and amino acid metabolism, cell adhesion, cell death, and inflammation. Furthermore, we found that the impact of IF on different metabolic processes varied depending on the length of the fasting regimen. Short IF regimens showed a higher correlation of pathway alteration, while longer IF regimens had an inverse correlation of metabolic processes such as fatty acid oxidation and immune processes. Additionally, functional echocardiographic analyses demonstrated that IF enhances stress-induced cardiac performance. Our systematic multi-omics study provides a molecular framework for understanding how IF impacts the heart’s function and its vulnerability to injury and disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>intermittent fasting</kwd><kwd>heart</kwd><kwd>RNA sequencing</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>phosphoproteomics</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001349</institution-id><institution>National Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NMRC-CBRG-0102/2016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arumugam</surname><given-names>Thiruma V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001349</institution-id><institution>National Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NMRC/OFIRG/0036/2017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arumugam</surname><given-names>Thiruma V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001348</institution-id><institution>Agency for Science, Technology and Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gunaratne</surname><given-names>Jayantha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001215</institution-id><institution>La Trobe University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arumugam</surname><given-names>Thiruma V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Intermittent fasting orchestrates molecular shifts, yielding cardiovascular improvements, revealing novel cardioprotective mechanisms, and suggesting innovative pharmacological strategies for cardiovascular disease prevention and treatment.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the developed world, the average calorie intake has steadily risen, as have associated age-related diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lahey and Khan, 2018</xref>). Intermittent fasting (IF) eating patterns include frequent periods of 12–24 hr with little or no energy intake sufficient to trigger a metabolic switch from the utilization of liver-derived glucose to fatty acids and ketones. Such IF eating patterns increase health span and lifespan and delay or prevent age-associated diseases in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Cabo and Mattson, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mattson et al., 2017</xref>).

However, it is unknown whether similar molecular and cellular mechanisms underlie the beneficial effects of IF on the cardiovascular system.</p><p>System-wide interrogation using large-scale omics technologies has proven powerful in capturing snapshots of molecular abundances in an unbiased manner. Previous studies have extensively focused on understanding the metabolic rewiring associated with different modes of fasting and feeding responses in the liver, the primary metabolic and secretory organ, and adipose tissues that functions as a fat sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ng et al., 2019</xref>). Though transcriptomics remained the go-to technology for many of the earlier works in this arena, recent technological advancements have positioned mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics as a rational choice to simultaneously track the dynamic behavior of thousands of proteins, the prime orchestrators of cellular processes, in a global manner. Accordingly, proteotypes underlying various metabolic diseases, dietary milieu, and fasting regimens including time-restricted feeding or IF have been probed to get holistic molecular portraits of altered metabolic states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shaik et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hatchwell et al., 2020</xref>). Protein post-translational modifications, especially phosphorylation, underlie several energy sensor pathways, glucose homeostasis mechanisms, and insulin secretion process, and hence deconvolution of phosphorylation networks is key to understanding signaling alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sacco et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sacco et al., 2016</xref>). While the importance of IF in improving cardiovascular health has been extensively documented, a global investigation documenting the molecular players driven by the metabolic switch would be highly desirable.</p><p>In order to understand molecular and cellular remodeling of the heart during IF, we employed advanced mass spectrometry for system-wide profiling of the proteome and phosphoproteome of heart tissues obtained from mice with daily fasting for 12 hr (IF12), 16 hr (IF16) or EOD as well as AL control feeding. We also performed transcriptome analyses using RNA sequencing to evaluate whether the observed molecular responses to IF occur at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional levels. Our results indicated that IF profoundly modifies pathways involved in metabolism, cell signaling, and epigenetic reprogramming in the heart. Of note, we observed that protein network remodeling during IF occurred in an IF duration time-dependent manner, with IF16 and EOD having the most significant effects. In addition, functional studies indicated that IF improves cardiac function compared to AL feeding. Our findings provide novel insight into the genetic and proteomic changes by which IF improves cardiac health and provide a resource for investigators in the fields of metabolism and cardiovascular disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Animals and IF procedures</title><p>All in vivo experimental procedures were approved by the National University of Singapore (Ethics approval number: R15-1568) and La Trobe University (Ethics approval number: AEC21012) Animal Care and Use Committees and performed according to the guidelines set forth by the National Advisory Committee for Laboratory Animal Research (NACLAR), Singapore, and Australian Code for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes (8th edition) and confirmed NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All efforts were made to minimize suffering and the number of animals used. All sections of the manuscript were performed in accordance with ARRIVE guidelines. Animals were anaesthetized in 1–2% isoflurane, and anesthesia was confirmed by abolished pain reflexes. Animals were euthanized by cervical dislocation, and the chest was then opened to extract the heart. C57BL/6 male mice were purchased at 2 months of age (InVivos, Singapore; ARC, Australia) and housed in the animal facility at the National University of Singapore and La Trobe University. The animals were exposed to light from 07:00-19:00 (12 hr light: 12 hr dark cycle) and were fed with pellets for rodents which consisted of 58%, 24%, and 18% of calories originating from carbohydrate, protein, and fat, respectively (Teklad Global 18% Protein rodent diet #2918; Envigo, Madison, WI, USA). Water was provided ad libitum to all dietary groups. At the age of 3 months, the mice were randomly assigned to the four different dietary intervention groups: IF12 (N=20), IF16 (N=60), EOD (Every Other Day fasting) (N=20), and AL group as a control (N=60). The mice in the IF12, IF16, and EOD groups fasted for 6 months daily 12 hr (19:00-07:00), 16 hr (15:00-07:00), or 24 hr (a whole day fasting followed by an entire day feeding). The AL group was supplied with food pellets ad libitum. The body weight was regularly measured. Blood glucose and ketone levels using FreeStyle Optium Neo system with FreeStyle Optium blood glucose and ketone test strips (Abbott Laboratories, Berkshire, UK) were measured in the morning before IF animals received food (N=20 in each experimental group). After 6 months, animals were anesthetized and euthanized. EOD mice were euthanized on a food-deprivation day. All mice were euthanized under isoflurane anesthesia between 7 a.m. and noon. All mice were perfused with cold PBS. The chest cavity was rapidly opened, and the heart was removed and rinsed in two washes of ice-cold saline.

Next, second-strand cRNA synthesis was performed using DNA polymerase I and RNase H. AMPure XP beads (Beckman Colter Life Sciences, Indianapolis, IN, USA) were used to purify the double-stranded cDNA. By using exonuclease/polymerase activities, the remaining overhangs of the purified double-stranded cDNA were transformed into blunt ends. The 3’ ends of the DNA fragments were adenylated, followed by ligation of the NEBNext adaptor with a hairpin loop structure to prepare for hybridization. The library fragments were purified with the AMPure XP system to select cDNA with the base pair length of 150–200. Lastly, the library was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the PCR products were purified using AMPure XP beads.

A total of 48.5 million clean reads were generated per sample, and 43.7 million reads (90.1% of total clean reads) per sample were mapped to the reference genome. HTSeq v.0.6.1 was used for the quantification of gene expression levels to count the read numbers mapped of each gene. Then FPKMs of each gene were calculated based on the length of the gene and reads count mapped to the same gene. DESeq R Package v.1.10.1 was used to perform differential expression analysis.

The pooled ad libitum was included as an internal reference for the TMT sets as our focus was on inferring proteome abundance changes and associated biological pathways across the different IF regimens in comparison with the control ad libitum group. Protein abundances across all the channels were first normalized for equal total protein intensities before obtaining log2 ratios of each protein against the normalized intensity of the respective reference channel. After combining the two TMT sets, only those proteins that were quantified in at least three biological replicates within each group were retained for subsequent analysis. For differential expression analysis of proteins regulated with IF, the replicates from the two TMT sets were grouped, and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed with followed by Dunnett’s post hoc tests at adjusted p-value &lt;0.01 to test for pairwise significance testing against AL control group. Protein annotations for gene ontology (GO) terms (biological process, cellular component, and molecular function) and KEGG pathways were obtained, and functional enrichment analysis was performed using Fisher’s exact test (FDR ≤0.05) for the modulated clusters. In addition, 1-D annotation enrichment analysis as implemented in Perseus was performed for testing the preference of protein expression values to be higher or lower in comparison to the global distribution for specific functional groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tyanova et al., 2016b</xref>).

To uncover a potential cardiac functional reserve, dobutamine-induced stress was performed after basal parameter acquisition. Dobutamine was administrated intraperitoneally in a single injection at 20 mg/kg. After the maximum increase in heart rate (generally within 4–5 min), two-dimensional and M-Mode acquisitions in long and short axes were repeated to assess ejection fraction, fractional shortening, cardiac output, stroke volume, ventricular dimensions, and strain in stress conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-17"><title>Statistics</title><p>For physiological measurements such as fasting blood glucose, ketone levels and body weights, values are indicated as mean ± SEM (n=20 mice/group).

Mice were randomly assigned to AL, daily IF12, IF16, or EOD schedules beginning at 3 months of age. The study design, including the timing of experimental interventions and blood and tissue collections, is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. To determine the extent to which IF affects energy metabolism, we measured the blood glucose and ketone levels, and body weight of all mice during the six-month dietary intervention period. Mice in the AL group exhibited a trend toward increased blood glucose levels at 3 and 6 months. In contrast, mice in the EOD group exhibited a large and highly significant decrease in blood glucose levels throughout the duration of the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Mice in the IF12 and IF16 groups exhibited glucose levels intermediate to the AL and EOD groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Ketone levels also displayed variability across different fasting regimens. On fasting days, mice in the EOD group exhibited blood ketone levels that were threefold greater than mice in the AL group. Ketone levels in mice in the IF16 and IF12 groups tended to be higher than those in the AL group but were substantially lower than in the EOD group. Notably, all IF and EOD animals exhibited significantly lower body weight than AL mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>). However, despite the differences in the fasting regimen pattern, we did not observe any difference in overall body weight between the IF and EOD groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Furthermore, no significant difference in the overall energy intake or compositional intake is observed across mice subjected to IF groups compared to the AL group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>IF modifies the heart proteome</title><p>To obtain a comprehensive perspective of the mechanisms impacted by IF in heart, we carried out proteome profiling of heart tissues from at least four biological replicates comprising each dietary group (AL = 4, IF12=5, IF16=5, EOD = 4). The AL group served as a control to compare proteomic alterations across different IF regimens. Using tandem mass tag (TMT)-based high resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis, we identified a total of 6972 proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Among the 5578 proteins quantified across all the samples, 9% of the proteins were differentially expressed among the heart tissues from different dietary regimens compared to the control AL group (Dunnett adjusted p-value = 0.01, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Among these, only 60 proteins consistently overlapped with altered protein levels across all fasting regimens and were primarily involved in processes associated with glycogen catabolism, fatty acid oxidation, and glycolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a</xref>). In comparison with IF12, the proteomes were modulated to a greater extent in the longer fasting durations, IF16 and EOD. The EOD group exhibited the most significant number of protein abundance changes, with 44% modulations exclusively occurring within this group, including apolipoproteins that are important determinants of a healthy heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liehn et al., 2018</xref>). Approximately one-third of the differentially expressed proteins in IF groups compared to AL were enzymes with catalytic activity involved in energy homeostasis pathways. In addition to the expected fatty acid metabolism and glycolytic pathways, we observed enzymes involved in hypoxia, oxidative phosphorylation, bile acid metabolism, mTOR signaling, and myogenesis to be modulated with IF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b</xref>). We observed that most of the enzymes involved in glycolysis, including the rate-limiting enzyme phosphofructokinase (PFKFKB1/2) displayed decreased expression with IF except for hexokinase 1 (HK1), indicative of suppression of glycolysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Conversely, the expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK2), which is involved in gluconeogenesis, was enhanced by IF.</p><p>Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the altered heart proteome revealed that IF12, IF16, and EOD mice had different overall protein expression patterns and co-expressed protein clusters compared to mice in the AL group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Unlike clusters in IF16 and IF12 groups, which exhibited modest differences compared to the AL group, a distinct class of proteins showed increased abundance only in the EOD group. These clusters of proteins with exclusive upregulation in the EOD (FDR &lt;0.05) group belonged to processes such as mRNA processing, fatty acid metabolism, autophagy, and stress response mechanisms. Other processes such as cholesterol transport and phospholipid efflux showed a downward trend in the EOD group. Several other metabolic processes, including oxidative phosphorylation, amine catabolism, and fatty acid oxidation, were overall reduced in all IF groups compared to AL. We also observed distinct modulations of several kinases in a regimen-specific manner, with majority of the alterations occurring only with IF16 and EOD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2c</xref>). Several of the kinases involved in the regulation of key metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis, exhibited decreased abundance in comparison with the AL group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). With EOD, major determinants of insulin sensitivity such as AKT1 and mTOR were highly expressed, and several other stress-activated kinases MAPK9 and MAPK10, showed reduced abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2c</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Impact of intermittent fasting on the heart proteome.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Hierarchical clustering of proteins significantly differentially expressed in each IF group and AL group (one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s test).

We observed upregulation of structural proteins involved processes such as focal adhesion and cell adhesion across all fasting regimens suggesting possible re-organization of the extracellular matrix interaction in heart tissues with IF. In addition, proteins regulating lipid kinase activity were observed in higher abundance in the hearts of mice from all three IF regimens compared to AL. We also observed specific signaling pathways to be selectively enriched in one IF regimen compared to the other IF regimens. For example, the IF12 group showed enrichment of proteins associated with cyclase activity, while the IF16 group displayed elevation of ERK signaling proteins. Signaling pathways involving the second messenger cAMP, however, were activated only with longer periods of fasting. This supports the notion that different IF regimens differentially modulate protein expression changes in the heart and impact signaling rewiring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Apart from components of lipid metabolism and transport that were reduced across all IF groups, our data also showed that branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism, which is known to regulate several anabolic and catabolic cellular cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gannon et al., 2018</xref>), was significantly lower in all IF groups compared to the AL group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Regimen-specific modulation of heart functional processes</title><p>The distinct and overlapping proteomic profiles for the three IF regimens suggested a progressive molecular and cellular remodeling of the heart in response to increasing fasting durations. While the overall metabolic responses were modulated across all regimens in comparison with AL, we further probed into regimen-specific differences to understand selective processes that were rewired with an increase in fasting duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–c</xref>). Compared to AL, IF12 enhanced the processes that maintain the structural integrity of the heart, such as adhesion, extracellular structure, and cytoskeletal organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). We also observed increased expression of proteins involved in the immune and stress response, and endocytosis and exocytosis events in IF12. Along with significant changes to the circulatory process, which displayed increased protein abundances, protein networks associated with heart rate regulation were also altered by IF12. As expected, proteins involved in metabolic processes such as sterol metabolism and transport, glucose utilization, and protein synthesis were downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). While the protein trafficking network was enhanced in IF16, other immune functional networks (NF-κB and Wnt signaling, innate immune response, and T cell receptor signaling) and amino acid biosynthetic processes were downregulated in IF16 in comparison with IF12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Prolonged activation of NF-κB in immune cells occurs in several major cardiovascular diseases, including cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure, and aberrant Wnt signaling contributes to cardiac hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Foulquier et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gordon et al., 2011</xref>). Changes in ion homeostasis and cardiac morphogenesis networks were also evident with an increase in fasting duration from IF12 to IF16. EOD introduced a wide spectrum of changes in the heart proteome. In addition to metabolic changes commonly, EOD led to epigenetic changes compared to IF16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Proteins associated with chromatin remodeling and organization, and those involved in histone and other protein modifications showed increased abundance. In parallel, proteins that regulate transcription initiation and termination, transcript splicing, and nuclear import were also upregulated in the hearts of EOD mice. Also, an increase in the mitotic and nuclear division regulatory networks was observed. This starkly contrasted to reductions in cell cycle-related pathways observed specifically in IF12 or IF16 groups. Additionally, DNA repair and organelle assembly protein networks were upregulated by EOD. Along with reduced immune response and ion and sterol transport, EOD exhibited a reduced abundance of components involved in mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), pyruvate metabolism, and ATP generation compared to IF16 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>).

We obtained corresponding transcript readouts using RNA sequencing for approximately 93% of the proteins that were quantified across the different regimens. Comparison of correlation across transcripts and proteins abundance across the different groups revealed only a modest correlation as expected (Pearson correlation coefficient ~0.47; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>), ruling out any regimen-specific differences. We next performed 2-D enrichment analyses to reveal correlated and non-correlated functional processes at the proteome and transcriptome levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). This revealed that structural processes such as ECM-receptor interaction and metabolic pathways involving BCAA degradation showed consistent changes in proteome and transcriptome with IF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b</xref>). Nevertheless, with increased fasting hours, mainly in the EOD group, we observed a trend shift in the direction of proteome and transcriptome abundances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Metabolic processes associated with fatty acid oxidation and monocarboxylic acid catabolic processes and immune processes related to autoimmunity and chemokine signaling showed the most noticeable drifts. On investigating the fatty acid oxidation cluster, we noticed that many of the key enzymes involved in the beta-oxidation of unsaturated (ECI1/2) and long-chain (or very long-chain) fatty acids (HADHA/B and ACADVL) showed differential transcript and protein abundances suggesting plausible buffering of protein levels beyond transcriptional regulation with IF. In comparing the enzyme abundances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2c</xref>), we found that some enzymes showed conserved correlation across different IF groups implying concerted rewiring of both transcriptome and proteome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Phospholipid phosphatase 1 (PLPP1) which is involved in the synthesis of glycerolipids and lipid uptake showed a dramatic decrease in protein abundance in the EOD group despite a modest increase in the corresponding transcript abundance. N-acetyltransferase NAT10 involved in histone acetylation and chromatin organization, ribonuclease RNASE4 participating in mRNA cleavage, and spliceosome-associated protein CWC27 involved in mRNA splicing all showed an exclusive increase only in the protein level with no observed changes in the mRNA level. Changes in these proteins were more obvious in the EOD group, and this supports extensive gene regulatory rewiring with extended fasting duration. Such discordant expression patterns at the mRNA and protein level could arise from post-transcriptional buffering that could potentially impact enzymes and kinases abundance and functions via post-translational modifications affecting protein stability or allosteric regulations that can alter activity.</p><p>With changes in metabolism closely linked to and regulated by circadian clocks, we assessed if time-restricted feeding regimens of IF12 and IF16 mice during the day (light phase) displayed any altered circadian patterns compared to AL or EOD mice by analyzing expression changes of core clock components at both the transcript and the protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).

This highlighted several tightly connected clusters that included proteins responsive to different IF regimens and showed functional preference for specific metabolic processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). The cluster that constituted proteins associated with fatty acid beta-oxidation and PPAR was the most highly enriched cluster exemplifying the impact of IF on lipid oxidation. It was evident that many of the proteins associated with this cluster tend to be downregulated during IF, particularly in EOD, except for a few proteins such as ACOT1, ACOT2, and EHHADH that showed high abundances exclusively with EOD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Indeed, cardioprotective roles have been attributed to the fatty acyl-CoA thioesterase ACOT1 via its activation of PPARα/PGC1α signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). Another lipid metabolism-associated cluster impacted by IF12, IF16, and more by EOD, included proteins involved in cholesterol efflux, triglyceride homeostasis, and chylomicron clearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). The most prominent effects of IF on lipid metabolism were on the apolipoproteins APOA1/4, APOE, and APOC1/2/3, all of which declined in the EOD group. An increase in the level of NPC2, an intracellular transporter mediating the export of cholesterol from lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pfeffer, 2019</xref>), was observed in the EOD group. PLTP, the increased activity of which is known to be associated with atherosclerosis, systolic dysfunction, obesity, and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chowaniec and Skoczyńska, 2018</xref>), was observed to be suppressed explicitly in all three IF groups.</p><p>Apart from these lipid-linked clusters, we also observed other clusters differentially modulated in an IF group-dependent manner. Signal transduction primarily via the insulin receptor and MAPK pathways emerged as one of the prominent clusters primarily comprising proteins modulated with longer fasting duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). B2M, a risk marker for cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shi et al., 2021</xref>), was found within this cluster. The network comprising RNA processing and splicing proteins mostly constituted proteins changing with EOD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). The cluster with proteins involved in ubiquitination and proteolytic processes exhibited mostly included proteins altered with IF16. Upregulated by IF16 within this cluster was LNPEP, a zinc-dependent aminopeptidase that cleaves several peptide hormones and also catalyzes the conversion of angiotensinogen to cardioprotective angiotensin IV (AT4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Stragier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yang et al., 2011</xref>). From the network, we infer that other metabolic processes such as pyruvate and amino acid metabolism and glycolysis show gradual modulations in protein abundance with increasing fasting duration (IF12&lt;IF16&lt;EOD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Further, based on their centrality, we inferred kinases including AKT1, CDC42, PKM, EGFR, and CSNK2A1 as IF-responsive hubs that effectively relay signaling modulations during IF-induced network rewiring.</p><p>To determine how the IF-induced network rewiring impacts downstream transcriptional programs, we assessed transcription factors enriched at each IF regimen using ChIP enrichment analysis (ChEA) database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Several key transcription factors with metabolic relevance including PPARα/γ, FOXA1/2, NUCKS1, HNF4A among others were found to be enriched. While some such as ELKF, TAF7L, and PPARα were modulated irrespective of the IF regimen, others, including HOXC9, YY1, and JARID1A showed exclusive enrichment in the EOD group.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Modified protein co-regulation in heart during IF</title><p>Dynamic interactions among proteins coordinate cellular homeostasis and adaptive responses to environmental challenges. To decipher the effects of IF on such protein associations, we investigated the protein co-regulation network of heart proteome for IF regimen-specific perturbations using the ‘interactome mapping by high-throughput quantitative proteome analysis’ (IMAHP) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lapek et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kosok et al., 2020</xref>). The correlation network comprised 44,966 associating protein pairs, of which a majority (34,629 pairs) involved positive co-regulations between the associated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7a-b</xref>). To identify protein associations perturbed in an IF group-dependent manner, we carried out an outlier analysis to specifically derive associations that displayed significant deviation from the overall correlation across all co-regulated proteins. This revealed higher deviations by ~40% across all IF groups than the AL group, suggestive of dynamic modulation of protein associations with IF. We identified consensus proteins that were consistently altered in protein associations across the different IF regimens (<italic>P</italic>-value &lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7c</xref>) and accordingly identified the greatest number of affected proteins in the IF16 and EOD groups, with the EOD group showing exclusive changes in 118 proteins and the IF16 group with 69 altered proteins. The IF12 group displayed only a small number of perturbed associations similar to the AL group. Also, we noticed that many protein associations affected by IF16 were similarly affected by EOD fasting. Proteins with perturbations in the AL group affected metabolic processes, including carbohydrate and glycogen metabolism, oxidation-reduction, and protein transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7c</xref>). Among these were phosphofructokinase (PFKL), lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), and kinases AKT2 and DTYMK. Unlike AKT1, which was found to be upregulated by IF, AKT2 did not vary in abundance with any IF regimen. Proteins with association perturbations in IF12 regimen mainly were localized to the mitochondria and showed an inclination towards oxidative stress mechanisms. The IF16 regimen impacted proteins in various cellular processes, including platelet activation, migration, translational control, fatty acid oxidation, and Rap1 signaling. Several association modulations involved integrins, myosin, and actin, including ITGB3 and ITGA2B, which have been linked to cardiac pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pillois and Nurden, 2016</xref>). While perturbations accompanying extended EOD fasting maintained some of the functional changes evident in IF16 hearts, such as NADH oxidation and electron transport chain, association alterations also occurred in lipid-related pathways. Importantly, we observed modulation of the PPAR signaling pathway by EOD fasting with key components PDPK1, APOA1, FABP3, PCK2, and SCP2 affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3b</xref>). This finding is interesting as PPAR modulators are currently being evaluated as therapeutic players for several cardiac diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Khuchua et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>A consistent pattern across the inferred association perturbations was that most of these involved proteins in the metabolic pathways were also localized to the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4a</xref>). We constructed a mitochondrial association network to identify the modulated associations that occurred in an IF regimen-specific manner. From the network, it was evident that many of the perturbed proteins co-associate, particularly in the EOD group, and share associations relevant to an intricate orchestration of mitochondrial functional protein associations in response to IF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7d</xref>). Among the mitochondrial proteins affected by IF, some, including UQCRC1, METAP1D, SCP2, COA7, AFG3L2, FAM162A, and COA4, were involved in associations spanning multiple functional processes suggesting coordinating rewiring of various pathways by mitochondrial functions. For instance, UQCRC1 shares IF responsivity with proteins involved in both fatty acid oxidation and carbohydrate metabolism. Overall, our data suggest the involvement of mitochondrial proteins in adaptive responses of the heart to IF.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>IF impacts phosphosignaling pathways in a cardioprotective manner</title><p>To gain deeper insight into IF-induced signaling alterations in myocardial cells, we investigated changes in the phosphorylation landscape that accompanies IF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8a</xref>).

Among the different groups, we identified 12,540 phosphorylated sites on 2931 proteins of which, ~80% and~19% sites were phosphorylated on serine and threonine respectively, with only 1% being tyrosine phosphorylated. Peptides with single phosphorylation sites represented 81% of the phosphopeptides analyzed. Among the sites identified, 66% corresponded with those curated in the PhosphoSitePlus database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hornbeck et al., 2012</xref>).

Approximately 84% of these belonged to class I phosphorylation sites with a localization probability ≥0.75, and overall displayed an average localization probability of 0.90, indicative of high phosphosite confidence. On assessing those sites that were significantly altered (Dunnett adjusted p-value &lt;0.05) with IF, we observed that phosphorylation changes varied with increasing duration of the fasting period with EOD exhibiting the greatest number of phosphosite abundance changes, similar to what was observed in the proteome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8b</xref>). However, in contrast to proteome remodeling, phosphoproteome profiling revealed increased phosphosite abundance on a majority of the differentially modulated phosphoproteins, and several of these were independent of proteome changes. This is intriguing as it points to differential exploitation of translational and post-translational mechanisms to remodel cardiac cells in response to IF. Site-specific phosphorylation changes occurred on several proteins involved in structural remodeling of the heart, such as titin, which was observed with multiple changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>)<bold>,</bold> and on regulatory proteins, including kinases, phosphatases, and enzymes in metabolic pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). For instance, phosphorylation changes were observed on several MAPK associated kinases including MAPK1/3 and MAPK12, PKC family kinases including PKC-alpha, -beta, and -theta kinases that coordinate muscle contraction, including MYLK, MYLK3, and PAK2, and sphingolipid signaling kinase SPHK2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8b</xref>). Enzymes involved in lipid metabolism such as ACOT1 and ACSL1, glycolytic enzyme triose phosphate isomerase (TPI1) and fumarate hydratase (FH) in the TCA cycle, phosphorylase kinase (PHKB) involved in glycogen breakdown, all showed IF-responsive changes in phosphosite abundance emphasizing phosphorylation-dependent remodeling of energy homeostasis pathways with IF.</p><p>While phosphorylation signatures reflect kinase activities, we noticed that only 2.8% of the phosphosites we quantified had experimentally validated kinases. Hence, we defined kinase-substrate relationships through motif mapping for each IF regimen. Accordingly, we focused on all the modulated phosphosites and identified motifs specifically enriched (p-value &lt;0.05) within distinct phosphosite expression clusters. The clustering revealed discrete patterns of phosphorylation changes that occur in response to each IF regimen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). PKA/PKC were commonly activated across all IF regimens. CSNK and p38 signaling were exclusive to the IF16 group, while AMPK, the master regulator of energy metabolism, exhibited activation in longer fasting groups. Overall, the kinase activation profiles were more pronounced in IF16 and EOD groups compared to the AL group. Pathway-based assessment of the modulated phosphoproteins highlighted the conserved modulation of pathways associated with insulin signaling, focal adhesion, and cGMP-PKG signaling across all IF groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c–d</xref>). cGMP-PKG signaling is known to mediate vasorelaxation, and activation of this pathway is regarded as cardioprotective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kukreja et al., 2012</xref>). In line with the kinase prediction, components of AMPK signaling showed significant modulation in both IF16 and EOD groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c–d</xref>). In summary, our phosphoproteome analyses revealed that IF impacts different signaling pathways that influence the heart’s structural and functional plasticity.</p><p>To further validate our proteomics data, we carried out immunoblot validation to confirm a few key findings we inferred based on IF-induced proteome and phosphoproteome alterations. For this and subsequent functional studies, we chose the IF16 group as it showed IF-specific rewiring of several kinase-induced pathway rewiring events and is also a more realistic fasting regimen in human. We evaluated the expression levels of selected proteins from various pathways, namely p-AMPKα/AMPKα, PKG-1, MYPT1, PPARγ, p-GSKαβ/GSKαβ, AKT, Insulin receptor β, and p-IRS1/IRS-1, in IF16 and AL using immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a–b</xref>). In line with our proteomic inferences, compared to the AL group, expression levels of pAMPK/AMPK, PPARγ, MYPT1, and IRS1 were significantly higher in the IF16 group. In addition, we observed increasing trends of PKG-1, AKT and decreasing trend of p-GSKαβ/GSKαβ in the IF16 group compared to the AL group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a–b</xref>).

For this, we performed echocardiographic measurements in mice that had been maintained on AL or IF16 diets for 6 months. While no differences in heart function were observed between IF and AL groups, AL mice started to show signs of age deterioration, such as prolonged E/A and shortened deceleration time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Lucia et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video1 fig6video2 fig6video3 fig6video4">Figure 6—videos 1–4</xref>).

Collectively, our comprehensive datasets provide a window into the molecular, cellular, structural, and functional remodeling of the heart in mice adapted to IF eating patterns. To address the question of how the duration of the fasting period in specific IF regimens affects the molecular remodeling of the heart, we compared the molecular effects of IF12, IF16, and EOD fasting. All three IF regimens affected the pathways that regulate cellular carbohydrate, lipid and protein metabolism, cell-cell interactions, and myocardial cell contractility. Previous findings suggested that the beneficial effects of IF on organ function and stress resistance require 2–4 weeks to be fully engaged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mager et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bruce-Keller et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Johnson et al., 2007</xref>). If and to what extent the molecular remodeling of the heart in response to IF reverts to the pre-IF state upon return to ad libitum feeding remains to be determined.</p><p>There are many similarities in the effects of aerobic exercise and IF on the cardiovascular system that beg the question of the extent of overlap in the underlying molecular mechanisms. For example, both IF and regular exercise training increase parasympathetic tone and heart rate variability, and both can protect the myocardium against ischemic injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rengo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Voulgari et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, both exercise and IF stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Marosi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Drake et al., 2016</xref>). Exercise training also stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis in myocardial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernardo et al., 2018</xref>). Studies of the effects of IF on the brain and skeletal muscle suggest that IF activates several major pathways engaged by ischemic and metabolic preconditioning, including upregulation of protein chaperones, anti-apoptotic proteins, and autophagy, and suppression of the mTOR pathway and protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Marosi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mattson and Arumugam, 2018</xref>). Previous research has led to the development of several treatments that mimic one or more effects of exercise, caloric restriction, and IF. Examples include agents that induce mild transient metabolic stress such as 2-deoxyglucose and mitochondrial uncoupling agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wan et al., 2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yu and Mattson, 1999</xref>), ketone esters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cox et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kashiwaya et al., 2013</xref>), and mTOR inhibitors such as rapamycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sciarretta et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our analysis of functional interactions and IF-induced alterations provides a global view of molecular and metabolic rewiring influencing various aspects of cardiac performance and bioenergetics. We observed IF-induced changes in expression of several enzymes functioning in key energy pathways, as well as kinases involved in cellular signaling. While IF triggered the downregulation of several lipid metabolism enzymes, thioesterases that regulate fatty acid flux, such as ACOT1, ACOT2, and ACOT7, were upregulated, especially in the EOD group. ACOT1, for instance, functions as a molecular rheostat to impede excessive fatty acid oxidation during fasting and dampens associated inflammation and oxidative stress by inducing protective PPARα signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Franklin et al., 2017</xref>). Such an induction of PPARα activity with IF is indeed supported by increased protein abundance of several of its transcriptional targets, including HMGCS2 and PDK4. It is noteworthy that signaling alterations driving such PPAR-associated modulations were also evident from IF-induced phosphorylation changes, including activation of PKA, one of the key modulators of PPAR transcriptional activity, especially in the context of lipid oxidation during fasting and exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lazennec et al., 2000</xref>). In addition to modulating fatty acid flux, PKA also triggers glycogen breakdown by activating phosphorylase kinase PHKB, which in turn triggers glycogen phosphorylase to release glucose 1 phosphate from glycogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brushia and Walsh, 1999</xref>). Our data point to an increase in phosphorylation site abundance on PHKB with IF suggesting increased turnover of glycogen with IF. The PKA effect of IF was accompanied by changes in associated cAMP signaling which also showed enhanced activation with prolonged durations of fasting as indicated by proteome modulation. The cAMP/PKA axis plays crucial modulatory roles in various aspects of cardiac physiology, including cardiomyocyte contractility via excitation–contraction coupling (ECC), control of heart rate, and downstream relay of β-adrenergic receptor signaling, is known to be perturbed in instances of heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bockus and Humphries, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Callaghan, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lissandron and Zaccolo, 2006</xref>).</p><p>AMPK emerged as another prominent signaling cascade that was activated with longer hours of fasting (IF16 and beyond) based on the modulated phosphorylation sites. We observed that the substrates of AMPK were associated with multiple aspects of energy usage that are known to enhance the metabolic flexibility of the heart. TBC1D1, another substrate that is important in AMPK-induced GLUT4 translocation, also showed a consistent increase in functional phosphorylation with increasing fasting duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jessen et al., 2011</xref>). Disruption of GLUT4 trafficking is associated with impaired glucose uptake and ensuing insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mueckler, 2001</xref>), and the phosphorylation change on TBC1D1 and GLUT4 along with the predicted increase in AKT activity suggest that IF improves insulin sensitivity in the heart by modulating glucose uptake and resetting aberrations in insulin signaling via increasing phosphorylation of such proteins. The effects of insulin signaling are primarily mediated by AKT. We identified AKT1 to be differentially expressed based on protein abundance, AKT2 to have specific alterations in IF triggered association modulations, and also predicted AKT to be induced based on substrate signatures from our phosphoproteome data. Collectively, our data suggest that AKT may be an important mediator of heart cell responses to IF. In addition, there was a striking increase in phosphorylation of epitopes on numerous proteins known to regulate heart development and cardiomyocyte contraction, particularly that is a crucial determinant of myocardial passive stiffness and whose malfunction is associated with various myopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">LeWinter and Granzier, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Makarenko et al., 2004</xref>). In all, these highlight varying degrees of kinase and metabolic rewiring in the heart induced by different durations of IF, with the most protective effects accompanying prolonged fasting.</p><p>Whilst our data provide a comprehensive molecular snapshot of the changes accompanying various courses of IF, there is a limitation that our landscape is reflective of net changes occurring across the entire heart. Thus, it is challenging to understand specific changes within the different cell types that comprise the heart. Such a limitation is exaggerated, particularly for the transcriptome analysis, as cardiomyocytes account for only 30% of cells in the mammalian heart and yet account for the majority of the cardiac mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhou and Pu, 2016</xref>). Knowledge of cell type-specific responses to IF will therefore be important to delineate distinct responses of heart cells to various IF regimens, and future studies exploring single-cell sequencing will add new dimensions to our understanding of cardiac dynamics with IF.</p><p>Further experimentation with different aspects of our study is required for detailed understanding of our findings. The timing of fasting cycles in this study may not promote synchronization of the natural circadian rhythm of nocturnal rodents, which may impact the potential for translating these to other model systems and understanding human patho-physiology. It has been established that time-restricted feeding/intermittent fasting cycles impact and can reset secondary tissue-specific peripheral clocks independent of the master circadian clock that is generally phase-locked to light-dark cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Damiola et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hara et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stokkan et al., 2001</xref>). While such mechanisms have been well documented in the context of liver and hepatic clocks, the impact of feeding on cardiac clock rhythmicity, however, remains to be deciphered. Evidence from our data suggests that fasting regimens affect circadian oscillations in heart cells, at least in part, independently of the central light-dark cycle-responsive clock. In addition, our analysis of cardiac function only included the AL and IF16 groups. We selected the IF16 fasting regimen to perform proof of principle functional experiments to further understand the functional outcome of proteomic changes observed. Echocardiographic analysis of the EOD group may provide significant information on the effect of IF, as the EOD group had the largest effect sizes from multi-omics analyses. With our study highlighting several kinase rewiring and signaling pathways impacted by IF based on modulations in proteome and phosphorylation site modulations, it will be interesting to follow-up on several of these to further assess their functional significance in the context of heart health and function. It is noteworthy that previous studies established that the EOD regimen leads to hearts with thinner walls and a lower left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmet et al., 2005</xref>) and lower blood pressure and heart rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wan et al., 2003a</xref>) than those of control animals. The latter effects of EOD were associated with cardioprotection in a rat model of myocardial infarction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmet et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, our multi-omics study was limited to mice 6–9 months old, and it is, therefore, difficult to draw conclusions as to the effects of IF on ageing heart functions. All three IF groups maintained similar average body weights throughout the study period and were significantly lower than the AL group. Therefore, the different transcriptomes, proteomes, and phosphoproteomics observed among the three IF groups were independent of body weight. Our data suggest overlapping but distinct molecular adaptations of the heart to different intermittent fasting regimens.</p><p>In conclusion, our comprehensive multi-omics analysis sheds light on the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of intermittent fasting (IF) on cardiac health and disease prevention. Our findings demonstrate that various IF regimens induce distinct and time-dependent changes in the cardiac proteome, with longer fasting periods resulting in more significant alterations. The EOD group, in particular, exhibited the most significant protein abundance changes. The unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of the altered heart proteome highlights unique protein expression patterns and co-expressed protein clusters in all IF groups compared to the AL group. Collectively, these results provide valuable insights into potential pharmacological targets for developing novel therapeutic strategies for cardiovascular diseases. Future studies may further explore these targets and the underlying pathways to advance the development of effective interventions to improve cardiac health.</p></sec></body><back><sec

The findings constitute a resource of quantitative proteomic data that sheds light on changes in cardiac function due to diet and that may be used in the future by other investigators. There are a number of key missing details that limit interpretation or present opportunities to strengthen the study. For example, the authors find that apolipoproteins are altered with fasting but it is not clear whether this is a contribution of myocardial tissue changes or systemic effects spilling into blood in cardiac tissues. Some statements in the text like &quot;Approximately one-third of the differentially expressed proteins in IF groups compared to AL were enzymes with catalytic activity involved in energy homeostasis pathways&quot; do not appear to be supported by data. It is not clear how the list of Kinases were generated for Figure 1B. Changes in chromatin or gene expression are not measured so the conclusion that EOD led to 'epigenetic changes' relative to IF16 is not well supported. There are also a number of areas where the text is vague. For example, it is not clear what is meant by 'trend shift' when discussing EOD results and Figure 3 generally could use additional information to better understands the figures. An interesting finding is that the IF16 groups showed cardiac hypertrophy (SFig 11b). This is potentially a novel finding and the text should elaborate more on this phenomenon.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id

The dobutamine stress test is not a terminal procedure, have the authors examined the cardiac function prior to 6 months to see whether there is a difference?</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely thank the reviewer for providing insightful comments and feedback on our study. The aim of our research is to gain a comprehensive understanding of molecular reprogramming in the heart during intermittent fasting using multi-omics techniques. We acknowledge the reviewer's concern regarding the selection of three different time points for intermittent fasting. Our rationale for choosing these time points was to align with the practices commonly used by researchers in the field. By doing so, we intended to explore and compare the effects of different intermittent fasting regimens on the heart. Through our study, we found that a longer fasting period resulted in the most significant changes in the proteome abundance. Though we agree that 4-hour fasting difference may not significantly alter transcriptome and proteome in terms of expressions, remarkable changes of post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation can occur during shorter time periods and this is evident based on the analyses of the modulated phosphoproteins. Hence, we included 12 hours time point also to our analysis. In fact, we would like to emphasize that all three fasting regimens had notable effects on pathways regulating cellular carbohydrates, lipid and protein metabolism, cell-cell interactions, and myocardial cell contractility. Regarding the duration of our study, we opted for a 6-month duration of intermittent fasting to investigate the impact of chronic intermittent fasting on heart transcriptome and proteome changes. While shorter-term (2-3 months) intermittent fasting studies in animals also have shown beneficial effects, we wanted to delve deeper into the molecular alterations induced by long-term intermittent fasting. We acknowledge the reviewer's observation about the dobutamine stress test not being a terminal procedure. In our manuscript, we aimed to present extensive resource data offering molecular insights into intermittent fasting-induced structural and signaling changes in the heart, focusing on various intermittent fasting time intervals. Additionally, we included the effect of cardiac function in response to intermittent fasting, specifically examining the intermittent fasting 16 hours (IF16) group, and highlighted key pathway modulations at this time point as supporting evidence. We appreciate the reviewer’s concern about examining cardiac function prior to 6-month. Although we did not perform this analysis in the current study, we fully agree that such comparison is required for a better understating of the temporal effects of molecular pathways in relation to heart functions during the course of intermittent fasting.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Lack of validation study. One interesting observation from this study is the changes of transcriptome does not reflect all the changes at protein level and there is a differential gene expression pattern in IF12, IF16 and EOD. If this is the case, the authors should select a few important targets and provide both mRNA and protein level analysis, as a proof of concept for the bioinformatics analysis accuracy.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's attention to the comparison of proteome and transcriptome data across different intermittent fasting regimens, as well as their interest in understanding any specific deviations in dietary regimens or sets of proteins. Indeed, it is well-established that post-transcriptional regulation can lead to discrepancies between mRNA and protein levels, primarily due to translational control or protein degradation mechanisms. Posttranscriptional buffering of proteins, particularly enzymes and kinases, is a plausible explanation, given their regulation through post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylations or allosteric regulations. Despite observing a modest correlation between the proteome and transcriptome data, which is generally common, we did identify certain enzymes, such as HMGC2, PDK4ACOT, CLPX, and RNASE4, with a high level of concordance between protein and mRNA abundances. These instances of agreement between the two data types suggest a coordinated regulation of these enzymes at the transcriptional and translational levels during intermittent fasting. To facilitate a clearer understanding of the correlation between proteome and transcriptome data, we have included correlation levels next to the scatter plots in our manuscript. These annotations aim to provide additional insights and aid readers in assessing the relationship between the two datasets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Poor western blot image quality. The quality of the western blot has several issues: a. the change of pAMPK/AMPK appears to be a decrease of total AMPK instead of change at p-AMPK level. Same with GSK3a/b. There appears to be an increase of total GSK3a/b. The AKT should also be blotted and quantified at phosphorylation level. The western blot should be clearly labeled, for the ones with double bands, including GSK3a/b, the author should clearly label which is GSK3a and which is GSK3b. For the IRS with non-specific band, the author should point out IRS-1 band itself.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's careful evaluation of our study and acknowledge the concerns raised regarding the quality of the western blot images. Despite revising these experiments multiple times, we acknowledge that the immunoblot images may not meet the highest quality standards. We have included the original immunoblots in the supplementary section to ensure transparency and provide additional data for reference.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>This study provides an unbiased characterization of the cardiac proteome in the setting of intermittent fasting. The findings constitute a resource of quantitative proteomic data that sheds light on changes in cardiac function due to diet and that may be used in the future by other investigators. There are a number of key missing details that limit interpretation or present opportunities to strengthen the study.</p><p>1. For example, the authors find that apolipoproteins are altered with fasting but it is not clear whether this is a contribution of myocardial tissue changes or systemic effects spilling into blood in cardiac tissues.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's consideration of the potential effect of spilling blood on our study results. While we agree that such an effect is possible, we would like to emphasize that the observed overall changes in the proteome profile, particularly in pathways regulating metabolism and other cardiac remodeling-associated processes, suggest that the alterations we observed are more likely attributed to changes within the myocardial tissues themselves. We would like to highlight that blood microparticles or extracellular proteins were not enriched in our proteome data and hence the impact of blood spilling is not a concern. In fact, the biological processes we observed were majorly associated with ECM receptor interaction, focal adhesion and signaling pathways, which are not typical for secreted or extracellular proteome encompassing blood leakage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

Changes in chromatin or gene expression are not measured so the conclusion that EOD led to 'epigenetic changes' relative to IF16 is not well supported.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's feedback. Our statement in the manuscript referred specifically to the changes observed in Figure 2, where we presented increased proteomic abundance in pathways related to chromatin remodeling, chromatin organization, gene expression regulation, and histone modification in the EOD (Every Other Day Fasting) group compared to the IF 16 (Intermittent Fasting for 16 hours) group based on functional process and pathway enrichment analysis. Our comprehensive bioinformatics analysis, depicted in Figure 2, provides intriguing insights into these pathways. We acknowledge that further validation and in-depth studies through additional experiments and functional assays are essential to strengthen the conclusion from such observations, which is beyond the scope of the current study. We thank the reviewer for such valuable suggestions that are very useful for our ongoing studies, where we aim to obtain a more robust and thorough understanding of the impact of intermittent fasting on chromatin-related processes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. There are also a number of areas where the text is vague. For example, it is not clear what is meant by 'trend shift' when discussing EOD results and Figure 3 generally could use additional information to better understands the figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to clarify that the term 'trend shift' refers to the change in the direction of protein and transcript level alterations. Based on the 2-D enrichment analyses that revealed correlated and non-correlated functional processes at the proteome and transcriptome levels, it was evident that during the early intermittent fasting 12 hours (IF12) regimen, the abundance changes of the proteins and transcripts involved in these processes were altered in the same direction (Supplementary Fig. 4b). Nevertheless, with increased fasting hours, mainly in the Every Other Day Fasting (EOD) group, we observed that the levels of proteins and transcripts involved in several of the functional processes appeared to be non-correlated as compared to the IF12 group (Fig. 2d). In Figure 3, we summarize the overall altered protein networks associated with the different intermittent fasting regimens, highlighting densely connected clusters of proteins along with their associated biological processes and pathways. Additionally, we unravel the impact of intermittent fasting on transcriptional rewiring and highlight regimen-specific alterations of specific transcriptional factors, several of which were found to have metabolic implications.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. An interesting finding is that the IF16 groups showed cardiac hypertrophy (SFig 11b). This is potentially a novel finding and the text should elaborate more on this phenomenon.</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely thank the reviewer for bringing attention to this intriguing aspect of our study. The data you have highlighted warrants further investigation, and we are committed to delving deeper into this area in our future research.</p></body></sub-article></article>
