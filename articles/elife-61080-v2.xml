of development, homeostasis, and disease. In cancer, interactions between cancer cells and stromal cells play a major role in nearly every step of carcinogenesis. Thus, the ability to record cell-cell interactions would facilitate mechanistic delineation of the role of the cancer microenvironment. Here, we describe GFP-based Touching Nexus (G-baToN) which relies upon nanobody-directed fluorescent protein transfer to enable sensitive and specific labeling of cells after cell-cell interactions. G-baToN is a generalizable system that enables physical contact-based labeling between various human and mouse cell types, including endothelial cell-pericyte, neuron-astrocyte, and diverse cancer-stromal cell pairs. A suite of orthogonal baToN tools enables reciprocal cell-cell labeling, interaction-dependent cargo transfer, and the identification of higher order cell-cell interactions across a wide range of cell types. The ability to track physically interacting cells with these simple and sensitive systems will greatly accelerate our understanding of the outputs of cell-cell interactions in cancer as well as across many biological processes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>It takes the coordinated effort of more than 40 trillion cells to build and maintain a human body. This intricate process relies on cells being able to communicate across long distances, but also with their immediate neighbors. Interactions between cells in close contact are key in both health and disease, yet tracing these connections efficiently and accurately remains challenging.</p><p>The surface of a cell is studded with proteins that interact with the environment, including with the proteins on neighboring cells. Using genetic engineering, it is possible to construct surface proteins that carry a fluorescent tag called green fluorescent protein (or GFP), which could help to track physical interactions between cells.</p><p>Here, Tang et al. test this idea by developing a new technology named GFP-based Touching Nexus, or G-baToN for short. Sender cells carry a GFP protein tethered to their surface, while receiver cells present a synthetic element that recognizes that GFP. When the cells touch, the sender passes its GFP to the receiver, and these labelled receiver cells become âgreenâ.</p><p>Using this system, Tang et al. recorded physical contacts between a variety of human and mouse cells. Interactions involving more than two cells could also be detected by using different colors of fluorescent tags. Furthermore, Tang et al. showed that, alongside GFP, G-baToN could pass molecular cargo such as proteins, DNA, and other chemicals to receiver cells.</p><p>This new system could help to study interactions among many different cell types. Changes in cell-to-cell contacts are a feature of diverse human diseases, including cancer. Tracking these interactions therefore could unravel new information about how cancer cells interact with their environment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell-cell interaction</kwd><kwd>cancer-stromal</kwd><kwd>nanobody</kwd><kwd>tumor microenvironment</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-CA175336</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Winslow</surname><given-names>Monte M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-CA207133</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Winslow</surname><given-names>Monte M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-CA230919</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Winslow</surname><given-names>Monte M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005188</institution-id><institution>Tobacco-Related Disease Research Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>27FT-0044</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tang</surname><given-names>Rui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Research Fellowship Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murray</surname><given-names>Christopher W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund10"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005492</institution-id><institution>Stanford University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Anne T. and Robert M.

Despite the explosion of interest in uncovering and understanding cellular heterogeneity in tissues and across disease states, the extent to which cell-cell interactions influence cell state, drive heterogeneity, and enable proper tissue function remains poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Konry et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Tsioris et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Zhang and Liu, 2019</xref>).

While secreted factors relaying pro- or anti-tumorigenic signals have been extensively investigated, the impact of direct physical interactions between cancer cells and stromal cells remains understudied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bendas and Borsig, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dittmer and Leyh, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nagarsheth et al., 2017</xref>).

Furthermore, how diverse cell-cell interactions differentially impact cancer cells at different stages of carcinogenesis and within different organ environments remains largely uncharacterized.</p><p>Molecular methods to profile cell state, including in situ approaches within intact tissues, largely fail to uncover the causal relationship between cell-cell interactions and the underlying biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Giladi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Halpern et al., 2018</xref>). Computational and experimental methods to characterize cell-cell interactions yield additional layers of dimensionality; however, modalities to capture cell-cell interactions are limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boisset et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Morsut et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pasqual et al., 2018</xref>).

Thus, we sought to integrate this phenomenon with fluorescent protein tagging to label cells that have undergone direct interactions. We describe a surprisingly robust system (which we term <italic>G</italic>FP-<italic>ba</italic>sed <italic>To</italic>uching <italic>N</italic>exus or G-baToN) that enables sensitive and specific interaction-dependent labeling of cancer cells and various primary stromal cells, including endothelial cells, T cells and neurons.

We initially used a published sGFP-Î±GFP pair inÂ which the Notch1 transmembrane domain links the LaG17-Î±GFP nanobody onto the receiver cell surfaceÂ and the PDGFR transmembrane domain links sGFP onto the sender cellÂ surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Morsut et al., 2016</xref>). Replacement of the Notch1 transmembrane domain of Î±GFP with different transmembrane domains allowed us to quantify their impact on GFP transfer efficiency. The VEGFR2 transmembrane domain enabled the highest transfer efficiency, resulting in about a threefold increase relative to the original design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2AâC</xref>). We next replaced the LaG17-Î±GFP nanobody with Î±GFP nanobodies with varying affinity for GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>). While nanobodies exhibiting the highest affinities performed similarly, we noted a minimal affinity required for GFP transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Overall, the efficiency of GFP transfer correlated with GFP affinity. Lastly, permutation of theÂ transmembrane domain of sGFP on the sender cell revealed that the rate of retrograde transfer of Î±GFP-VEGFR2-BFP from receiver to sender cells was influenced by the sGFP transmembrane domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2GâI</xref>). The PDGFR transmembrane domain minimized bidirectional transfer and thus was the optimal design for minimizing retrograde transfer which could generate false-positive signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2GâI</xref>).

Our data document the ability of diverse primary cell types to serve as both sender and receiver cells, suggesting that the G-baToN system is not only simple, sensitive and rapid, but also generalizable. Multicolor derivatives of G-baToN enable qualitative and quantitative analyses of higherÂ order interactions involving more than two cell types. Finally, the ability to co-transfer protein, DNA and chemical cargo suggests that this platform could be leveraged to manipulate target cell function.</p><p>Cancer cell-stromal cell interactions can be relatively stable (such as aÂ cancer cell interacts with other cancer cells or stromal cells) or transient (such as cancer cell-immune cell interactions and circulating tumor cell (CTC) interactions with endothelial cells during metastasis). The G-baToN system labels receiver cells through transfer of cell surface GFP which, due to its lability, ensures only transient labeling. This is similar to other cell-cell interaction labeling systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Transient labeling is sufficient to label stable cancer cell-stromal cell interactions and many other diverse cell-cell interactions when sender cells consistently express GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This transient labeling should allow dynamic interactions to be detected, ensuring that the labeled receiver cells either are in contact with, or have recently interacted with sender cells.</p><p>Further optimization of the G-baToN systems could allow shorter or longer term labeling within different biological systems. For example, a G-baToN system where sGFP is inducible may allow physical interactions between cancer cells and stromal cells to be captured with even more precise temporal control. Conversely, we have shown that using chemical fluorophores significantly extends label persistence within receiver cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>), which can be used for longer term labeling of receiver cells that undergo dynamic interactions. Finally, due to the intrinsic attribute of G-baToN as a cell-cell contact dependent cargo transfer system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), it should be possible to develop systems that allow for stable receiver cell labeling, perhaps through the transfer of site-specific recombinases (e.g. Cre or FLP) or programmable nucleases (e.g. Cas9) to genetically modify receiver cellsÂ uponÂ contact. There will likely be some challenges when combing NLS-signal with sGFP. Nevertheless, additional G-baToN systems will greatly facilitate study of cell-cell interaction induced cell fate determination via contact-dependent lineage tracing.</p><p>As with other cell-cell interaction reporter systems, the G-baToN system relies on cell surface ligand-receptor recognition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary files 1</xref>â<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">2</xref>). While LIPSTIC-based labeling is driven by endogenous ligand-receptor interactions, SynNotch and G-baToN systems rely on exogenous ligand-receptor pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Morsut et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pasqual et al., 2018</xref>). Consequently, these systems could stabilize normal cell-cell interactions. It is possible that tuning the affinity or expression level of the nanobody could minimize this effect. Inducible G-baToN systems may circumvent these issues, thus ensuring the recording of only bonaÂ fide interactions. Given that G-baToN-based cell-cell interaction reporter systems can be used as a discovery approach, the consequences of these interactions can be validated by orthogonal methods in the absence of exogenous ligand-receptor pairs. A recent paper used secreted cell-permeable mCherry for proximity labeling of cells. This system circumvents the problem of abnormal cell-cell interactions caused by ligand-receptor binding; however, this system labels all cells in proximity and lacks true cell-cell interaction labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ombrato et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>An interesting advantage of the G-baToN system is its ability to mediate cargo transfer. We demonstrated the feasibility of transferring small molecules (HaloTag ligand, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), functional proteins (puromycin resistant protein, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8CâD</xref>), and non-protein macromolecules (ssDNA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8EâG</xref>). Transferred cargo proteins may be able to modify receiver cell signaling or promote cell death. In the future, additional design features could allow cancer cell-stromal cell interaction dependent drug delivery, cell-cell interaction facilitated sgRNA transfer between interacting cells, and digital recording of cell-cell interaction via DNA-barcode transfer. Thus, we expect the G-baToN system to facilitate an even wider array of discoveries about cell-cell interactions in cancer, across other physiological or pathological processes, and within different model organisms.</p><p>The simplicity of this two-component system, combined with its generalizability across cell types, excellent foreground to backgroundÂ ratio, and rapid labeling, should enable facile analysis of the dynamics of cellular interaction. These types of approaches have the potential to have a broad impact on our ability to understand the outputs of cell-cell interactions in cancer and various other biological systems.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cells, plasmids, and reagents</title><p>HEK-293T, B16-F10, A549, H460, and HUVEC cells were originally purchased from ATCC; HUASMC were purchased from PromoCell (C-12500); H82 cells were kindly provided by Julien Sage (Stanford School of Medicine); <italic>KP</italic> (238N1) and <italic>KPT</italic> (2985T2) lung adenocarcinoma cells were generated previously from tumors in <italic>Kras<sup>LSL-G12D</sup>;Â p53<sup>f/f</sup> and Kras<sup>LSL-G12D</sup>;Â p53<sup>f/f</sup>;Â R26<sup>LSL-TomÂ </sup></italic>mic<italic>e</italic>.

Neurons were grown in Neurobasal media (Gibco) supplemented with B-27 serum-free supplement (Gibco), GlutaMAX (Gibco), and penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco) in a humidified incubator at 37Â°C, with 5% CO2. Half media changes were performed every 4â5 days. Primary astrocytes were dissociated from P0-P1 mouse cortices using the same papain dissociation methods as neurons, except the single-cell suspensions were then plated onto tissue culture plates without poly-L-lysine in DMEM with 10% FBS and penicillin-streptomycin. Primary astrocyte cultures were passaged using Accutase (Stemcell Technologies).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Primary human T cell cultures</title><p>Blood from healthy donors collected in leukoreduction system (LRS) chambers was separated by Ficoll-Paque density gradient to obtain peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). CD4<sup>pos</sup> and CD8<sup>pos</sup> T cells were isolated by negative selection using EasySep Human CD4+ T Cell Isolation Kit and EasySep Human CD8+ T Cell Isolation Kit (STEMCELL Technologies), respectively, according to the manufacturerâs instructions. T cells were cultured for 3 days with CD3/CD28 Dynabeads (ThermoFisher Scientific) with 40 IU/mL IL-2 and spinoculated with lentivirus for 2 hr at 400 rcf in the presence of 8 Âµg/mL polybrene. T cells were expanded following transduction for two days in the presence of CD3/CD28 Dynabeads and 300 IU/mL IL-2 prior to use in assays. Transduced or untransduced CD4<sup>pos</sup> or CD8 <sup>pos</sup> T cells were co-cultured for 24 hr together with A549 cells. Following co-culture, cells were harvested, stained with antibodies against CD45, CD4, or CD8 (BioLegend) and analyzed on a LSRFortessa flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Each condition was run in triplicate, and two independent experiments were conducted using T cells from different donors. For microscopy, A549 cells were co-cultured with CD4 <sup>pos</sup> T cells in glass-bottom plates (MatTek Corporation) and imaged on an LSM 700 confocal microscope (Zeiss).</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Sample or experiment sizes were estimated based on similar experiments previously performed in our laboratory, as well as in the literature. For the experiments in which two or more cell types are co-cultured, we used at least three samples per group for FACS analysis, at least 10 images were taken per group for image quantification. For the experiments in which cancer cells and T cells were transplanted into mice, we used at least three mice per group. In all the experiments reported in this study, no data points were excluded. No randomization was used in this study. There was no blinding method used to assign individuals to experimental groups.</p><p>Each experiment was repeated at least three times. All values are presented as meanÂ Â±Â SEM, with individual data points shown in the figure. Comparisons of parameters between two groups were made by two-tailed Studentâs t-tests. The differences among several groups was evaluated by one-way ANOVA with Tukey-Kramer post hoc evaluation. p-Values less than 0.05 and 0.01 were considered significant (*) or very significant (**), respectively.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the Stanford Shared FACS and Cell Sciences Imaging Facilities for technical support; A Orantes for administrative support, N Kipniss and YT Shue for critical reagents; D Feldser, J Sage, Y Chien, N Kipniss and members of the Winslow laboratory for helpful comments.

The authors have extensively controlled for each feature of the reporter and the data is quantitative and compelling throughout. Multiple specific kinds of cell-cell interactions are examined in this tour-de-force of proof of principle examples. Cancer cell â neuron, cancer cell â T cells, cancer cell- endothelial cells, and even neurons â astrocytes are examined here. Multi-color systems for reporting on complex interactions between 3 or more cell types are examined, which speaks to the more likely functionality one would observe in vivo. Beyond the initial nanobody design, the authors end the study with HaloTag baton systems and very interesting data reporting the co-transfer of cargo molecules into target cells, including Tomato, PuroR, and ssDNA. One could envision this system being used for a wide variety of downstream applications, in a wide variety of biological and bioengineering fields. It is that last point which makes this manuscript a compelling one to publish in <italic>eLife</italic>, as it will be of broad interest to several fields.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>I) Relevance</p><p>Cell-cell interactions play critical roles across all of biology, including during normal organismal development and disease initiation, progression, and resolution. Achieving a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of how specific cell-cell interactions are established and disentangling the biological processes that are regulated by such cell-cell interactions ultimately requires that one is able to (1) track and quantitatively measure the initiation of specific cell-cell interactions; (2) follow the fate of interacting cells over time; (3) isolate and characterize interacting cells; (4) probe interacting cells; and (5) ideally be able to do all of the above in a spatiotemporal manner. Progress in this area has been limited by the lack of faithful experimental tools that allow for rapid, specific, and ideally long-lived labeling of cell-cell interactions, particularly in the in vivo setting. Recent advances in the areas of synthetic biology (e.g. synNotch receptors; PMID: 26830878 and 27693353) and chemical biology (e.g. Sortase-based LIPSTIC labeling approaches; PMID: 29342141) have opened the door for mechanistically probing cell-cell interactions in a reasonably specific manner. More recently, a system that employed secreted fluorescent proteins (sLP-mCherry; PMID: 31462798) was developed to label neighboring groups of cells in specific niches, some of which were shown to interact directly. All of these systems have drawbacks, including the requirement for multiple complementary components expressed in each of the interacting cells and potential unspecific labeling of artificial cell-cell interactions due to inappropriate expression or activity or some of the modular components that form these systems.</p><p>II) General concept and approach</p><p>In this manuscript, Tang et al., present G-baToN, a novel cell-cell interaction platform that relies on direct cell to cell transfer of a fluorescent protein by a 'Sender' cell, which leads to rapid (but temporary) labeling of a 'Receiver' cell. G-baToN is largely based on the synNotch concept, whereby a 'Sender' cell expresses a fluorescent reporter (Surface GFP, or sGFP) in the surface and a 'Receiver' cell expresses a synthetic Notch-based nanobody that recognizes sGFP, which in turn leads to activation of the Notch pathway, intracellular cleavage and release of a transcription factor, and induction of a synthetic gene reporter. However, instead of relying on a synthetic gene reporter in 'Receiver' cells, G-baToN exploits the concept of ligand internalization, whereby a nanobody-sGFP complex is internalized into cells, leading to sGFP-based labeling of the 'Receiving' cell. Thus, G-baToN does not need an additional reporter component in 'Receiver' cells; it only requires that they express the sGFP nanobody in their surface. Furthermore, the sGFP nanobody does not need to be engineered as a synNotch receptor (i.e. it does not need to be fused to a cleavable Notch-based transcription factor). Therefore, G-baToN is a simpler and more versatile system relative to the original synNotch system and also to the Sortase-based LIPSTIC system (which relies on specific receptor-ligand pairs and in exogenous substrates for cell-cell interaction labeling).</p><p>III) Novelty and comparison to other similar methods</p><p>As mentioned above, G-baToN is largely based on the synNotch concept, relying on sGFP and anti-sGFP nanobody expression in the surface of 'Sender' and 'Receiver' cells, respectively. Therefore, G-baToN is not novel from that point of view, even though it employs carefully optimized engineered versions of these components (see Figure 2). Where G-baToN really shines is in its simplicity relative to both synNotch and LIPSTIC systems. Although G-baToN still relies on expression of specific synthetic components in the surface of 'Sender' and 'Receiver' cells, it dramatically simplifies the identification and isolation of 'Receiver' cells since (1) no reporter gene needs to be turned on in 'Receiver' cells; (2) no exogenous substrate needs to be provided in order for cell labeling to take place; and (3) due to being a 2-component system, it is less prone to 'system breakdown' (e.g. synNotch systems can easily break via spontaneous mutations in the internal cleavage sites, in the transcription factor that turns on the reporter gene in 'Receiver' cells, or in the promoter or coding sequence of the reporter gene itself). Furthermore, due to its simplicity and modularity, G-baToN can be seamlessly expanded to allow for isolation of both 'Sender' and 'Receiver' interacting cells by essentially endowing 'Receiver' cells with 'Sender' capability and vice versa (see Figure 6). Specifically, one can simply engineer 'Sender' cells to express (1) a specific antibody in the surface targeting a surface fluorescent protein encoded in the 'Receiver' cell and (2) a different fluorescent protein expressed in its own cell surface. On the other hand, 'Receiver' cells can be engineered to express (1) a surface antibody targeting the 'Sender' surface fluorescent protein and (2) a fluorescent protein expressed in its cell surface recognized by the 'Sender' surface antibody (see. Figure 6). Furthermore, the authors show that one can append synthetic tags and fluorophores to the fluorescent proteins, which can increase both the half-life and the dynamic range of cell-cell interaction labeling, and that the inherent modularity and combinatorial nature of the system allows for further detection and isolation of higher-order cell-cell interactions (e.g. 'Receiver' cells that have interacted with 2 independent 'Sender' cells) (see Figure 7). Collectively, this allows for efficient bidirectional reporting and isolation of both simple and higher-order cell-cell interactions, which will undoubtedly open the door for more comprehensive molecular and cellular characterization of each cell within an interaction unit. Lastly, the authors show that the modular nature of G-baToN can allow for interaction-dependent transfer of various types of molecular cargoes (antibiotic resistance cassettes, ssDNA molecules), albeit with an apparent variable efficiency.

Please provide any additional detail on the 1-6 hour timepoints in Figure 1f. Is there a burst of transfer around 2 hour or any specific average of time after first contact? (see comment from Reviewer 1).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for noting the rapid GFP transfer at early time points. To better resolve the dynamics of GFP transfer at 0-6 hours, we collected Î±GFP-receiver (HEK293T, at 1:1 ratio) at 15 min, 30 min, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 8 hours, and 12 hours of co-culture with sGFP-senders (KPT). As shown in new Figure 1âfigure supplement 1g, there is indeed a large amount of transfer around 2 hours. However, we think that this is most likely driven by technical aspects of the experiment. Senders and receivers are trypsinized, counted, and mixed for co-culture. It normally takes 1-2 hours for cells to attach to culture plate, where cell-cell interaction can be stabilized. Thus, we believe that transfer may occur even more rapidly upon cell-cell contact. However, we do note that transfer kinetics could be cell type-dependent.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Please comment on whether it might be possible to transfer the Cre-recombinase to a different cell population to turn on a floxed reporter in a neighboring cell.</p></disp-quote><p>As we now discuss in our manuscript (Discussion), due to the capacity of G-baToN to mediate the transfer of cargo (Figure 8), we believe that it should be possible to co-transfer Cre recombinase (or other site specific or programable nucleases). However, there will likely be some challenges when combing NLS-Cre with sGFP. The NLS could hinder sGFP expression or transfer efficiency. Furthermore, for transferred Cre to get to the nucleus it will have to detach from the sGFP-TM anchor following transfer. There are multiple systems that could solve the problems (e.g. transfer a CreERT2). Thus, co-transfer a bioactive Cre into a floxed reporter receiver cell with high efficiency remains an important future direction. In fact, in collaboration with Geoffrey Wahl's lab at the Salk Institute, we are developing modified versions of G-baToN enabling indelible labeling of receiver cells using site-specific recombinase technology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Along these lines, also please comment on the point from Reviewer 2 regarding only a minor population of cells being active as receivers. Can you comment whether this is because the system inefficient, or short lived, or the transferred proteins are not stable?</p></disp-quote><p>We do not think that this stems from variable degrees of transfer efficiency of the G-baToN system, but rather due to differences in copy number, transgene expression, and Î±GFP presentation in different cell types. Although we have not directly assessed the relationship between Î±GFP expression and GFP transfer efficiency, we have noted that Î±GFP expression generally correlates with GFP transfer. Even though, among all the cell types we tested, as long as the Î±GFP expression level can be detected by FACS (either through surface Myc tag or intracellular BFP), the cell can be used as receiver. We included a variety of different cell types as receivers, including human cell lines (HEK293T, most figures), endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells (Figure 3), T cells</p><p>(Figure 4), neurons (Figure 5), lung and kidney epithelial cells, skeleton muscle cells, astrocytes, splenocytes (Figure 5-figure supplement 2), and human cancer cells (Figure 5âfigure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Comment on single copy (low MOI) versus multiple copy (high MOI) lentiviral transduction used for the system as Reviewer 2 points out this is relevant for future applications. Also comment on leakiness of the system, and issues are half-life of fluorophores to highlight additional potential limitations of this system.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for bringing up this practical concern regarding the G-baToN technology. For transductions, we used high MOI (&gt;1) to generate all stable cell lines (sender and receiver). Beyond copy number, transgene expression level can be controlled in multiple ways (e.g. promotor activity, codon optimization) which are likely more important for driving sGFP and nanobody expression. Furthermore, surface presentation of sGFP or Î±GFP may be enhanced via optimization of signal peptides in different cell types. G-baToN used exogenous fluorophores to label cells, which gives both advantage in increasing signal-to-noise ratio (minimal leakiness) and disadvantage in a shorten half-life for labeling.</p><p>For leakiness, because the G-baToN system is fluorescence-transfer-based, it is more a foreground to background (natural autofluorescence) consideration rather leakiness.</p><p>For half-life of fluorophore, protein fluorophore will have a shorter half-life (half-life around 6 hours), but we show evidence that a chemical fluorophore persists longer.

Reviewer 3 commented the resistance to puromycin in Figure 8 was weak, please comment on this in the revised manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We acknowledge in the text that the resistance conferred by transferred PuroR is not dramatic. This is likely influenced by (1) impaired transfer efficiency caused by extra cargo proteins; and (2) the short half-life for transferred PuroR in receiver cells. However, as a proof-of-principle experiment, this result still provides evidence that G-baToN can transfer cargo protein with biological</p><p>function. Further efforts will be required to optimize cargo protein transfer efficiency and maintain activity in receiver cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this interesting technology development manuscript from the Winslow lab, the authors have created a very adaptable and flexible reporter system for studying cell-cell interactions. The authors have extensively controlled for each feature of the reporter and the data is quantitative and compelling throughout. Multiple specific kinds of cell-cell interactions are examined in this tour-de-force of proof of principle examples. Cancer cell â neuron, cancer cell â T cells, cancer cell- endothelial cells, and even neurons â astrocytes are examined here. Multi-color systems for reporting on complex interactions between 3 or more cell types are examined, which speaks to the more likely functionality one would observe in vivo. Beyond the initial nanobody design, the authors end the study with HaloTag baton systems and very interesting data reporting the co-transfer of cargo molecules into target cells, including Tomato, PuroR, and ssDNA. One could envision this system being used for a wide variety of downstream applications, in a wide variety of biological and bioengineering fields. It is that last point which makes this manuscript a compelling one to publish in eLife, as it will be of broad interest to several fields.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>I) Relevance</p><p>Cell-cell interactions play critical roles across all of biology, including during normal organismal development and disease initiation, progression, and resolution. Achieving a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of how specific cell-cell interactions are established and disentangling the biological processes that are regulated by such cell-cell interactions ultimately requires that one is able to (1) track and quantitatively measure the initiation of specific cell-cell interactions; (2) follow the fate of interacting cells over time; (3) isolate and characterize interacting cells; (4) probe interacting cells; and (5) ideally be able to do all of the above in a spatiotemporal manner. Progress in this area has been limited by the lack of faithful experimental tools that allow for rapid, specific, and ideally long-lived labeling of cell-cell interactions, particularly in the in vivo setting. Recent advances in the areas of synthetic biology (e.g. synNotch receptors; PMID: 26830878 and 27693353) and chemical biology (e.g. Sortase-based LIPSTIC labeling approaches; PMID: 29342141) have opened the door for mechanistically probing cell-cell interactions in a reasonably specific manner. More recently, a system that employed secreted fluorescent proteins (sLP-mCherry; PMID: 31462798) was developed to label neighboring groups of cells in specific niches, some of which were shown to interact directly. All of these systems have drawbacks, including the requirement for multiple complementary components expressed in each of the interacting cells and potential unspecific labeling of artificial cell-cell interactions due to inappropriate expression or activity or some of the modular components that form these systems.</p><p>II) General concept and approach</p><p>In this manuscript, Tang et al., present G-baToN, a novel cell-cell interaction platform that relies on direct cell to cell transfer of a fluorescent protein by a 'Sender' cell, which leads to rapid (but temporary) labeling of a 'Receiver' cell. G-baToN is largely based on the synNotch concept, whereby a 'Sender' cell expresses a fluorescent reporter (Surface GFP, or sGFP) in the surface and a 'Receiver' cell expresses a synthetic Notch-based nanobody that recognizes sGFP, which in turn leads to activation of the Notch pathway, intracellular cleavage and release of a transcription factor, and induction of a synthetic gene reporter. However, instead of relying on a synthetic gene reporter in 'Receiver' cells, G-baToN exploits the concept of ligand internalization, whereby a nanobody-sGFP complex is internalized into cells, leading to sGFP-based labeling of the 'Receiving' cell. Thus, G-baToN does not need an additional reporter component in 'Receiver' cells; it only requires that they express the sGFP nanobody in their surface. Furthermore, the sGFP nanobody does not need to be engineered as a synNotch receptor (i.e. it does not need to be fused to a cleavable Notch-based transcription factor). Therefore, G-baToN is a simpler and more versatile system relative to the original synNotch system and also to the Sortase-based LIPSTIC system (which relies on specific receptor-ligand pairs and in exogenous substrates for cell-cell interaction labeling).</p><p>III) Novelty and comparison to other similar methods</p><p>As mentioned above, G-baToN is largely based on the synNotch concept, relying on sGFP and anti-sGFP nanobody expression in the surface of 'Sender' and 'Receiver' cells, respectively. Therefore, G-baToN is not novel from that point of view, even though it employs carefully optimized engineered versions of these components (see Figure 2). Where G-baToN really shines is in its simplicity relative to both synNotch and LIPSTIC systems. Although G-baToN still relies on expression of specific synthetic components in the surface of 'Sender' and 'Receiver' cells, it dramatically simplifies the identification and isolation of 'Receiver' cells since (1) no reporter gene needs to be turned on in 'Receiver' cells; (2) no exogenous substrate needs to be provided in order for cell labeling to take place; and (3) due to being a 2-component system, it is less prone to 'system breakdown' (e.g. synNotch systems can easily break via spontaneous mutations in the internal cleavage sites, in the transcription factor that turns on the reporter gene in 'Receiver' cells, or in the promoter or coding sequence of the reporter gene itself). Furthermore, due to its simplicity and modularity, G-baToN can be seamlessly expanded to allow for isolation of both 'Sender' and 'Receiver' interacting cells by essentially endowing 'Receiver' cells with 'Sender' capability and vice versa (see Figure 6). Specifically, one can simply engineer 'Sender' cells to express (1) a specific antibody in the surface targeting a surface fluorescent protein encoded in the 'Receiver' cell and (2) a different fluorescent protein expressed in its own cell surface. On the other hand, 'Receiver' cells can be engineered to express (1) a surface antibody targeting the 'Sender' surface fluorescent protein and (2) a fluorescent protein expressed in its cell surface recognized by the 'Sender' surface antibody (see. Figure 6). Furthermore, the authors show that one can append synthetic tags and fluorophores to the fluorescent proteins, which can increase both the half-life and the dynamic range of cell-cell interaction labeling, and that the inherent modularity and combinatorial nature of the system allows for further detection and isolation of higher-order cell-cell interactions (e.g. 'Receiver' cells that have interacted with 2 independent 'Sender' cells) (see Figure 7). Collectively, this allows for efficient bidirectional reporting and isolation of both simple and higher-order cell-cell interactions, which will undoubtedly open the door for more comprehensive molecular and cellular characterization of each cell within an interaction unit. Lastly, the authors show that the modular nature of G-baToN can allow for interaction-dependent transfer of various types of molecular cargoes (antibiotic resistance cassettes, ssDNA molecules), albeit with an apparent variable efficiency.
