regulatory activity underlining cellular functions and precise cell fate choices. Using TWIST1 BioID-proximity-labeling and network propagation analyses, we discovered and characterized a TWIST-chromatin regulatory module (TWIST1-CRM) in the neural crest cells (NCC). Combinatorial perturbation of core members of TWIST1-CRM: TWIST1, CHD7, CHD8, and WHSC1 in cell models and mouse embryos revealed that loss of the function of the regulatory module resulted in abnormal differentiation of NCCs and compromised craniofacial tissue patterning. Following NCC delamination, low level of TWIST1-CRM activity is instrumental to stabilize the early NCC signatures and migratory potential by repressing the neural stem cell programs. High level of TWIST1 module activity at later phases commits the cells to the ectomesenchyme. Our study further revealed the functional interdependency of TWIST1 and potential neurocristopathy factors in NCC development.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Shaping the head and face during development relies on a complex ballet of molecular signals that orchestrates the movement and specialization of various groups of cells. In animals with a backbone for example, neural crest cells (NCCs for short) can march long distances from the developing spine to become some of the tissues that form the skull and cartilage but also the pigment cells and nervous system.</p><p>NCCs mature into specific cell types thanks to a complex array of factors which trigger a precise sequence of binary fate decisions at the right time and place. Amongst these factors, the protein TWIST1 can set up a cascade of genetic events that control how NCCs will ultimately form tissues in the head. To do so, the TWIST1 protein interacts with many other molecular actors, many of which are still unknown.</p><p>To find some of these partners, Fan et al. studied TWIST1 in the NCCs of mice and cells grown in the lab. The experiments showed that TWIST1 interacted with CHD7, CHD8 and WHSC1, three proteins that help to switch genes on and off, and which contribute to NCCs moving across the head during development. Further work by Fan et al. then revealed that together, these molecular actors are critical for NCCs to form cells that will form facial bones and cartilage, as opposed to becoming neurons. This result helps to show that there is a trade-off between NCCs forming the face or being part of the nervous system.</p><p>One in three babies born with a birth defect shows anomalies of the head and face: understanding the exact mechanisms by which NCCs contribute to these structures may help to better predict risks for parents, or to develop new approaches for treatment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ectomesenchyme</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>neural stem cell</kwd><kwd>craniofacial

from the neuroepithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Vokes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Groves and LaBonne, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mandalos and Remboutsika, 2017</xref>) and contributes to the craniofacial tissues in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sauka-Spengler and Bronner-Fraser, 2008</xref>) including parts of the craniofacial skeleton, connective tissues, melanocytes, neurons, and glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kang and Svoboda, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Blentic et al.,

The development of these tissues is affected in neurocristopathies, which can be traced to mutations in genetic determinants of NCC specification and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Etchevers et al., 2019</xref>). As an example, mutations in transcription factor <italic>TWIST1</italic> in human are associated with craniosynostosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">El Ghouzzi et al., 2000</xref>) and cerebral vasculature defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Tischfield et al., 2017</xref>). Phenotypic analyses of <italic>Twist1</italic> conditional knockout mouse revealed that TWIST1 is required in the NCCs for the formation of the facial skeleton, the anterior skull vault, and the patterning of the cranial nerves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Soo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ota et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bildsoe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bildsoe et al., 2016</xref>). To comprehend the mechanistic complexity of NCC development and its implication in a range of diseases, it is essential to collate the compendium of genetic determinants of the NCC lineage and characterize how they act in concert in time and space.</p><p>During neuroectoderm development, transcriptional programs are initiated successively in response to morphogen induction to specify neural stem cell (NSC) subdomains along the dorsal-ventral axis in the neuroepithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Briscoe et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Vokes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kutejova et al., 2016</xref>). NCCs also arise from the neuroepithelium, at the border with the surface ectoderm through the pre-epithelial-mesenchymal transition (pre-EMT) which is marked by the activation of <italic>Tfap2a, Id1, Id2, Zic1, Msx1</italic> and <italic>Msx2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baker et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mayor et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Saint-Jeannet et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Marchant et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Etchevers et al., 2019</xref>). In the migratory NCCs, gene activity associated with pre-EMT and NCC specification is replaced by that of EMT and NCC identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Marchant et al., 1998</xref>). NCC differentiation progresses in a series of cell fate decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lasrado et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Soldatov et al., 2019</xref>). Genetic activities for mutually exclusive cell fates are co-activated in the progenitor population, which is followed by an enhancement of the transcriptional activities that predilect one lineage over the others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lasrado et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Soldatov et al., 2019</xref>). However, more in-depth knowledge of the specific factors triggering this sequence of events and cell fate bias is presently lacking.</p><p><italic>Twist1</italic> expression is initiated during NCC delamination and its activity is sustained in migratory NCCs to promote ectomesenchymal fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Soldatov et al., 2019</xref>). TWIST1 mediates cell fate choices through functional interactions with other basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Spicer et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Firulli et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Connerney et al., 2006</xref>) in addition to transcription factors SOX9, SOX10, and RUNX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Spicer et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hamamori et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bialek et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Laursen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Vincentz et al., 2013</xref>). TWIST1 therefore constitutes a unique assembly point to identify the molecular modules necessary for cranial NCC development and determine how they orchestrate the sequence of events in this process.</p><p>To decipher the molecular context of TWIST1 activity and identify functional modules, we generated the first TWIST1 protein interactome in the NCCs. Leveraging the proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID) methodology, we captured TWIST1 interactions in the native cellular environment including previously intractable transient and low-frequency events which feature interactions between transcription regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Roux et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kim and Roux, 2016</xref>). Integrating prior knowledge of protein associations and applying network propagation analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cowen et al., 2017</xref>), we uncovered modules of highly connected interactors as potent NCC regulators. Among the top-ranked candidates were histone modifiers and chromatin remodelers that constitute the functional chromatin regulatory module (TWIST1-CRM) in NCC. Genome occupancy, gene expression, and combinatorial perturbation studies of high-ranked members of the TWIST1-CRM during neurogenic differentiation in vitro and in embryos revealed their necessity in stabilizing the identity of early migratory NCC and subsequent acquisition of ectomesenchyme potential. This study also highlighted the concurrent activation and cross-repression of the molecular machinery that governs the choice of cell fates between neural crest and neurogenic cell lineages.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Deciphering the TWIST1 protein interactome in cranial NCCs using BioID</title><p>The protein interactome of TWIST1 was characterized using the BioID technique which allows for the identification of interactors in their native cellular environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

We did not observe an overall correlation between disease probability and the degree of connectivity or centrality for factors in the TWIST1 interactome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F</xref>). However, the topological characteristics of the chromatin regulatory cluster resembled the features of disease modules and enriched for craniofacial phenotypes. In contrast, the ‘ribosome biogenesis’ module that was also densely inter-connected, was void of relevant phenotypic association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Network propagation is, therefore, an efficient way to identify and prioritize important clusters while eliminating functionally irrelevant ones.</p><p>Based on these results, we selected core TWIST1-CRM epigenetic regulators CHD7, CHD8, and WHSC1, and demonstrated their physical and functional interaction with TWIST1. In the progenitors of the NCCs, these factors displayed overlapping genomic occupancy that correlated with the active chromatin marks in the fate specification genes in the neuroepithelium.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Attribute of TWIST1 interacting partners in NCC development</title><p>Combinatorial perturbation of the disease ‘hot-spots’ in TWIST1-CRM impacted adversely on NCC specification and craniofacial morphogenesis in mouse embryos, which phenocopy a spectrum of human congenital malformations associated with NCC deficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Johnson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chun et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cai et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bosman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bernier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schulz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Battaglia et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Etchevers et al., 2019</xref>). These observations revealed CHD8 and WHSC1 as putative determinants for NCC development and neurocristopathies. While CHD8 is associated with autism spectrum disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bernier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Katayama et al., 2016</xref>), its function for neural crest development has never been reported. Here, we demonstrated that the loss of <italic>Chd8</italic> affected NCC migration and trigeminal sensory nerve formation in vivo, in a <italic>Twist1</italic>-dependent manner. We showed that TWIST1 occupancy is a requisite for CHD8 recruitment to common target genes. CHD8 may initiate chromatin opening and recruit H3-lysine tri-methyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>) such as WHSC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). The TWIST1-CHD8 complex may also repress neurogenic genes by blocking the binding of the competitive TFs. The specificity for NCC differentiation genes might be achieved when TWIST1, CHD8 and additional factors bind adjacently to each other, either sequentially or simultaneously. ChIP-seq peaks shared between TWIST1 and CHD8 or unique to each of them were enriched in different sets of motifs matched to various transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Interestingly, only factors binding to TWIST1+CHD8 peaks show enriched expression in the delaminatory and migratory NCC populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>). These results suggested that TWIST1-CHD8 module may interact with additional factors, such as DLX1 and SOX10, to enhance NCC identity. We also showed that WHSC1 is required in combination with TWIST1 to promote NCC fate and tissue patterning. Unlike CHD8 and WHSC1, CHD7 has been previously implicated in neurocristopathy (CHARGE syndrome) and the motility of NCCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schulz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Okuno et al., 2017</xref>). Our study has corroborated these findings while also showing that CHD7 interacts with TWIST1 to promote NCC differentiation. One limitation of the mutant study is that there was no parallel comparison of the mutant phenotype in chimeras derived from multiple mutant cell lines to rule out the possibility of off-target gene-editing. However, in view of the potential variation of the ESC contribution to the chimera, We took a more productive approach to analyze multiple chimeric embryos from one line to glean a consistent phenotype that may inform the impact of genetic interaction Twist1 and the chromatin regulators on development.</p><p>In sum, we propose the TWIST1-CRM as a unifying model that connects previously unrelated regulatory factors implicated in different rare diseases and predicts their functional inter-dependency in NCC development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Classical studies of systemic and conditional <italic>Twist1</italic> knockout embryos have shed light on the in vivo implications of our molecular characterizations. Neural tube thickening and distortion were observed in the homozygous null mutant embryo.

Based on these phenotypes and our data from the knockout NECs, is possible that in the absence of <italic>Twist1</italic> activity, the process of cellular delamination is impaired leading to the retention of the NCC progenitors in the neuroepithelium or at ectopic sites.</p><p>TWIST1 and the chromatin regulators cooperatively drive the progression along the lineage trajectory at different phases of NCC differentiation. <italic>Twist1</italic> is activated from delamination and its expression steadily increases during differentiation. The functional interaction of TWIST1 and the chromatin regulators may commence at the transition from delaminatory to early migratory stage, coinciding with the first peak of <italic>Twist1</italic> expression. The expressions of NCC specification (<italic>Msx1/2, Zic1</italic>) or migratory genes (<italic>Tfap2a</italic>) were compromised by the loss of the TWIST1-chromatin regulators, albeit they are activated before <italic>Twist1</italic> during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Soldatov et al., 2019</xref>). The early activity of <italic>Twist1</italic>, <italic>Chd7, Chd8</italic>, and <italic>Whsc1</italic> module might stabilize the activity of these early NCC genes. Loss of the module in NECs leads to reversion to NSC fate at the expense of the NCC lineage. In the post-migratory NCCs, modular activity of <italic>Twist1</italic> and <italic>Chd8/ Whsc1</italic> promotes the ectomesenchyme propensity while represses alternative cell fates such as autonomic neurons. <italic>Chd7</italic> activity was not connected with EMT in the NCCs, suggesting that its role may be different from CHD8 and WHSC1. The early versus late TWIST1-module activities are associated with the activation of different groups of target genes, suggesting that phasic deployment of the regulatory module may navigate the cells along the trajectory of NCC development.</p><p>Overexpression of <italic>Twist1</italic> in NCCs disrupts the formation of thoracic sympathetic chain ganglia, of the autonomic nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Vincentz et al., 2013</xref>). On the other hand, in the <italic>Wnt1-Cre</italic> conditional <italic>Twist1</italic> knockout mutants, differentiation of cardiac neural crest cells into neuronal cells reminiscent of those in the sympathetic ganglia was found ectopically in the cardiac outflow tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Vincentz et al., 2013</xref>). These aggregates of cardiac NCCs expressed pan-neuronal <italic>Tubb3</italic> and markers specific for the autonomic nerve cells (<italic>Sox10, Phox2b</italic>, and <italic>Ascl1)</italic>, but did not express sensory neuron markers (<italic>TrkA, Pou4f1</italic>, and <italic>NeuroD1</italic>). Similarly, NCCs losing the function of TWIST1-module in vitro showed sign of mesenchyme to autonomic state trans-differentiation, whereas the sensory markers in these cells remain repressed. In the heterozygote null mutants, we did not observe any ectopic gain of neurons, but loss and disorganization of trigeminal nerves (composed of sensory and motor neurons), similar to the phenotype of null mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ota et al., 2004</xref>). This may result from the loss of early function of <italic>Twist1</italic> in early migratory NCC formation, rather than its late activity on automimic-mesenchymal bifurcation.</p><p>In conclusion, by implementing an analytic pipeline to decipher the TWIST1 interactome, we have a glimpse of the global molecular hierarchy of NCC development. We have characterized the cooperative function of core components of TWIST1-CRM including the TWIST1 and chromatin regulators CHD7, CHD8, and WHSC1. We demonstrated that this module is a dynamic nexus to drive molecular mechanisms for orchestrating NCC lineage progression and repressing NSC fate, enabling the acquisition of ectomesenchyme propensity. The TWIST1-chromatin regulators and the NSC regulators therefore coordinate the molecular cross-talk between the ectomesenchyme and neurogenic progenitors of the central and peripheral nervous systems, which are often affected concurrently in a range of human congenital diseases.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Aantibody <break/>(mouse monoclonal)</td><td>α-TWIST</td><td>Abcam</td><td>cat# ab50887;

by identifying Twist binding partners and how they function together in vitro and in vivo. The study is well done and a valuable contribution to the literature.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;TWIST1 and chromatin regulatory proteins interact to guide neural crest cell differentiation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Marianne Bronner as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Igor Adameyko (Reviewer #1); Anthony Firulli (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this well done manuscript, the authors examine the bHLH transcription factor TWIST1 and its interacting proteins in neural crest cell development using an unbiased screen. Given the important role of neural crest cells in craniofacial and cardiac developmental defects, the data are both useful and important.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The major problem is the claim that the regulation reported here is important for neural crest specification / induction. This cannot be the case, as Twist 1 starts to be expressed in mouse only during the delamination step according to published single cell data. The premigratory <italic>Zic/Msx</italic> positive neural crest shows no expression of <italic>Twist1</italic> before EMT markers kick in. The authors need to deal with this. It would be important to show in vivo expression data analysis and bring the conclusions in line with the timing in neural crest development.</p><p>In addition to these issues, the reviewers raise many smaller points which would be good to address. For this reason, I have included the full reviews below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This excellent study is focused on the mechanisms of action of <italic>Twist1</italic> in the neural crest cells and on the identification of core components of <italic>Twist1</italic> network. The authors performed an in-depth experimental study and sophisticated analysis to identify <italic>Chd7/8</italic> as the key partners of <italic>Twist1</italic> during NCC development. This identification and corresponding predictions later appeared consistent with experimental in vivo data including single and combinatorial gene knockout mouse models with phenotypes in the cranial neural crest. Overall, this study is important for the field.</p><p>However, I disagree with some secondary interpretations the authors give to their results. At the same time, the major conclusions stay solid. Below I discuss the most critical points.</p><p>1) <italic>Chd7</italic>, <italic>Chd8</italic> and <italic>Whsc1</italic> are ubiquitously expressed. Thus, the specificity of regulation is achieved via interactions with other, more cell type- and stage-specific, factors. This would be good to mention.</p><p>2) The authors suggest: &quot;The phenotypic data so far indicate that the combined activity of TWIST1-chromatin regulators might be required for the establishment of NCC identity. To examine whether TWIST1- chromatin regulators are required for NCC specification from the neuroepithelium and to pinpoint its primary molecular function in early neural differentiation, we performed an integrative analysis of ChIP-seq datasets of the candidates&quot;.</p><p>This is a strange assumption, given that <italic>Twist1</italic> is expressed only staring from the NCC delamination stage in mouse cranial neural crest (Soldatov et al., 2019). It does not seem to correlate with premigratory NCC identity and the situation inside of the neural tube. The authors conclude: &quot;Therefore, combinatorial binding sites for TWIST1, CHD7 and CHD8 may confer specificity for regulation of patterning genes in the NECs.&quot; Or, alternatively, they may confer the control of mesenchymal phenotype, downstream migration and fate biasing etc. I do not think the authors have good arguments to bring up induction or patterning of NCCs at the level of neural tube.</p><p>I have a good suggestion for the authors: I would extract the regulons from Soldatov et al. single cell data and run the binding site proximity check for the individual genes belonging to the gene modules /regulons specific to delamination and early NCC migration stages. I am curious, if the proximity of binding sites of <italic>Twist1</italic>-related crowd would rather correlate with genes from these specific regulons as compared to randomly selected regulons from the entire published single cell dataset.</p><p>Randomization/bootstrapping analysis are welcomed. So far, being an excellent study, this paper does not solve a problem of downstream (of <italic>Twist1</italic>) gene expression program in the neural crest cells. At the same time, this is what the author can try to obtain with their DNA binding data in combination with published single cell data. Repression of <italic>Sox2</italic> and upregulation of <italic>Pdgfra</italic> (reported in Figure 4) might be a part of this downstream program being in line with the published single cell gene expression data (Soldatov et al., 2019).</p><p>The authors conclude the paragraph: &quot;Therefore, combinatorial binding sites for TWIST1, CHD7 and CHD8 may confer specificity for regulation of patterning genes in the NECs&quot;. Again, this is not a good or plausible explanation based on specificity of expression of suggested pattering genes (or visualized genes are poorly selected). Additionally, although I believe the obtained results are important and of a good quality, I would not call them &quot;developmentally equivalent to ectomesenchymal NCCs&quot; or other NCCs. This is because the in vitro system will never reflect the embryonic in vivo development with high accuracy (especially when it comes to patterning and positional identity). This might explain that some prominent binding positions and interpretations the authors give do not correspond the gene expression logic during neural crest development.

The work appears carefully done and the data and impact of this study are high given the nature of NCCs being involved as key players in craniofacial and cardiac developmental defects.

For this reason, I have included the full reviews below.</p></disp-quote><p>We have attended to the concerns raised in the review to our best ability. Please see the point-by-point response and the revision made to the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This excellent study is focused on the mechanisms of action of Twist1 in the neural crest cells and on the identification of core components of Twist1 network. The authors performed an in-depth experimental study and sophisticated analysis to identify Chd7/8 as the key partners of Twist 1 during NCC development. This identification and corresponding predictions later appeared consistent with experimental in vivo data including single and combinatorial gene knockout mouse models with phenotypes in the cranial neural crest. Overall, this study is important for the field.</p><p>However, I disagree with some secondary interpretations the authors give to their results. At the same time, the major conclusions stay solid. Below I discuss the most critical points.</p><p>1) Chd7, Chd8 and Whsc1 are ubiquitously expressed. Thus, the specificity of regulation is achieved via interactions with other, more cell type- and stage-specific, factors. This would be good to mention.</p></disp-quote><p>We examined the in vivo expression of partners of TWIST1 and indeed they appear ubiquitously expressed in all neural crest populations extracted (Figure 4—figure supplement 2B, C). Their interaction would be subjected to the TWIST1 protein level across the subtypes of the neural crest.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors suggest: &quot;The phenotypic data so far indicate that the combined activity of TWIST1-chromatin regulators might be required for the establishment of NCC identity. To examine whether TWIST1- chromatin regulators are required for NCC specification from the neuroepithelium and to pinpoint its primary molecular function in early neural differentiation, we performed an integrative analysis of ChIP-seq datasets of the candidates&quot;.</p><p>This is a strange assumption, given that Twist1 is expressed only staring from the NCC delamination stage in mouse cranial neural crest (Soldatov et al., 2019). It does not seem to correlate with premigratory NCC identity and the situation inside of the neural tube. The authors conclude: &quot;Therefore, combinatorial binding sites for TWIST1, CHD7 and CHD8 may confer specificity for regulation of patterning genes in the NECs.&quot; Or, alternatively, they may confer the control of mesenchymal phenotype, downstream migration and fate biasing etc. I do not think the authors have good arguments to bring up induction or patterning of NCCs at the level of neural tube.</p><p>I have a good suggestion for the authors: I would extract the regulons from Soldatov et al. single cell data and run the binding site proximity check for the individual genes belonging to the gene modules /regulons specific to delamination and early NCC migration stages. I am curious, if the proximity of binding sites of Twist1-related crowd would rather correlate with genes from these specific regulons as compared to randomly selected regulons from the entire published single cell dataset.</p><p>Randomization/bootstrapping analysis are welcomed. So far, being an excellent study, this paper does not solve a problem of downstream (of Twist1) gene expression program in the neural crest cells. At the same time, this is what the author can try to obtain with their DNA binding data in combination with published single cell data. Repression of Sox2 and upregulation of Pdgfra (reported in Figure 4) might be a part of this downstream program being in line with the published single cell gene expression data (Soldatov et al., 2019).</p><p>The authors conclude the paragraph: &quot;Therefore, combinatorial binding sites for TWIST1, CHD7 and CHD8 may confer specificity for regulation of patterning genes in the NECs&quot;. Again, this is not a good or plausible explanation based on specificity of expression of suggested pattering genes (or visualized genes are poorly selected). Additionally, although I believe the obtained results are important and of a good quality, I would not call them &quot;developmentally equivalent to ectomesenchymal NCCs&quot; or other NCCs. This is because the in vitro system will never reflect the embryonic in vivo development with high accuracy (especially when it comes to patterning and positional identity). This might explain that some prominent binding positions and interpretations the authors give do not correspond the gene expression logic during neural crest development. Besides, Twist1 and Chd7/8 are naturally expressed in many other cell types and might target non-NCC genes (Vegfa?). This does not reduce the value of the data, but it is good to mention for the community.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up these important points and for the helpful advice for further analysis. Our original data supported that in addition to the role of <italic>Twist1</italic>-CRM in the ectomesenchyme, where <italic>Twist1</italic> expression peaks, the interaction between <italic>Twist1</italic> and the chromatin regulators may have distinct functions at an earlier stage of NCC development. We have now studied the temporal profile of <italic>Twist1</italic> expression by mining the E8.5-10.5 NCC scRNA-seq data (Soldatov et al., 2019) and found that <italic>Twist1</italic> starts to be expressed in the delaminating cells. We have performed an integrative analysis of the single-cell RNA-seq data and our DNA binding data of TWIST1 and chromatin regulators to answer the following questions:</p><p>– At which stage/s does the module of <italic>Twist1</italic>-chromatin regulators kick into action, based on their expression across NCC subtypes and correlation with the DNA binding sites in the gene regulons specific for the NCC stage?</p><p>– What is the role of the TWIST1-module at different stages of NCC lineage development in vitro and in vivo?</p><p>The first clue came from examining the dynamics of expression of <italic>Twist1</italic> and partners. Similar to the outcome of in vitro differentiation model, the expression of <italic>Twist1</italic> and <italic>Sox2</italic> showed a reciprocal trend through the course of neuroepithelium to mesenchyme transition in vivo. <italic>Twist1</italic> initially peaks at the early migratory NCCs whereas, at more advanced stages, expression increases exponentially in the mesenchyme. On the other hand, as the reviewer pointed out, the three partners do not show major variations in expression levels during NCC differentiation and are expressed throughout differentiation (Figure 4—figure supplement 2A-C, subsection “Genomic regions co-bound by TWIST1 and chromatin regulators are enriched for early migratory NCC signatures in the open chromatin region”). Therefore, the expression level of <italic>Twist1</italic> is likely to be a major factor modulating the activities of TWIST1-CRM.</p><p>We then examined the activities of ChIP-seq targets of TWIST1, CHD7 and CHD8 in the scRNA-seq data, and specifically restricted the target sets to genes responsive to <italic>Twist1</italic> conditional knockout in <italic>Wnt1-Cre; GFP</italic> sorted E 9.0-9.5 mouse NCCs (Bildsoe et al., 2009). Among all the regulons in the developing NCC populations (E8.5- E10.5), the binding sites of TWIST1-module correlate best with the profile of early migratory NCCs. We also noted that the expression of marker genes of early migratory cells and neuroepithelium (neural tube) is mutually exclusive. A proportion of early migratory genes are significantly repressed in the neural tube (62%), while the neural tube genes are downregulated at the early migratory stage (33%). Therefore, TWIST1 and partners could repress many of the neural tube or neurogenesis genes in the early migratory NCCs, including <italic>Sox2, Foxb1, Jag1, En1, Zic3</italic> and <italic>Dll3.</italic></p><p>In summary, combining the in vivo gene expression and DNA binding sites from NECs, <italic>Twist1</italic>- chromatin regulators are most active in the early migratory and mesenchyme stage. The mesenchyme only constitutes a small portion of cells in early neural crest development (E8.5). We will discuss the function of the module in the mesenchyme later combining the O9-1 knockdown data. Our observation suggests that even when the NCCs have delaminated from the neural tube, they still need to continuously repress many neurogenic genes. The TWIST1-module is likely a “valve” that maintains the one-way flow of newly specified NCCs towards downstream trajectories by preventing the flare-up of competitive neural stem cell regulators. Meanwhile, it helps to enhance/stabilize the migratory and early NCC fate programs.</p><p>The findings of the additional analysis were presented (see the aforementioned subsection) and discussed (Discussion) in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 2: Twist1<sup>-/+</sup> Chd8<sup>-/+</sup> is repeated two times in panel B (but the embryos look differently), although the authors most likely meant to show Twist1<sup>-/+</sup> Chd7<sup>-/+</sup> in the second case.

This was because the marker gene panel was designed to prioritize putative direct ChIP-seq target genes of the three factors. We have now performed qPCR analysis on additional markers highlighted in the scRNA-seq analysis of E8.5-E10.5 mouse NCCs (Soldatov et al., 2019). We focused on the analysis of genes associated with lineage bifurcation in the ectomesenchyme, autonomic and sensory branches, as these genes may best report trans-differentiating activities (http://pklab.med.harvard.edu/ruslan/neural.crest.html). Among these genes, we selected those harboring DNA binding sites for TWIST1-CRM in the regulatory elements (Figure 6—figure supplement 1).</p><p>Through qPCR analysis of the selected genes in O9-1 cranial NCC stem cells treated with individual or combinatorial siRNA, we studied the impact of the functional interaction of TWIST1 and its protein partners on the ectomesenchyme propensity versus the alternative lineages of NCCs. We detected the expression of most of the mesenchymal marker genes in the cell lines (Ct value &lt; 32), but many sensory neurons and autonomic fate markers were below the detection level (Ct &gt; 32). These initial observations suggested that the O9-1 neural crest stem cells may have a strong mesenchymal bias (Ishii et al., 2012). After 24 hours of siRNA knockdown of <italic>Twist1, Chd8</italic> and <italic>Whsc1</italic>, the treated cells displayed loss of mobility and reduced expression of EMT/ mesenchymal markers (Figure 6C, D). Most of the marker genes were significantly reduced in double siRNA treated groups. On the other hand, changes in non-mesenchymal genes, such as the sensory/ autonomic neuron markers, were inconsistent (Figure 6E). The significant upregulation of <italic>Sox2, Sox8, Sox10</italic> and <italic>Tubb3</italic> may indicate a gain of autonomic neuron fate, which is the immediately adjacent state of mesenchyme (Soldatov et al., 2019). Genes more specific for sensory neurons were either below detection or not significantly affected. Prolonged knockdown treatment may be required to observe a more substantial change of these alternative fate markers. This data agrees with observations in the <italic>Wnt1-CreTwist1</italic> conditional knockout mouse, where ectopic clumps of autonomic neurons expressing <italic>Sox10, Phox2b</italic> and <italic>Ascl1</italic> and <italic>Tubb3</italic> were found in the cardiac mesenchyme, while sensory markers (<italic>TrkA, Pou4f1</italic> and <italic>NeuroD1</italic>) were not altered (Vincentz et al., 2013); (discussed in more detail below). We therefore conclude that at the NCC maturation stage, high level of TWIST1 and its interactions with CHD8 and WHSC1 are important to commit cells to the mesenchymal lineage. Persistent activity of these factors is necessary to maintain the mesenchyme state and keep competitive neurogenic programs shut.</p><p>The findings were present in the Results, Figure 6C-E, and discussed (Discussion) in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors write: &quot;The genomic and embryo phenotypic data collectively suggest a requirement of TWIST1- chromatin regulators in the establishment of NCC identity in heterogeneous neuroepithelial 403 populations&quot;.

It will be important to justify why a certain cell type is selected for each analysis, focusing on the biological question at hand.</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided information on the use of cell types for specific analysis in the Results: ESC-derived NECs were used to study the early functions of <italic>Twist1</italic>-chromatin regulators, and neural crest stem cells were used as a surrogate of NCCs to study the function of module in fate bifurcation in post-migratory NCCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Using BioID, the authors detected 140 different proteins that interact with Twist1. However, only 4 of them overlap with the 56 known Twist1 partners (Figure 1A). This result suggests that BioID identified almost a distinct set of Twist1-interacting proteins, compared to the published results. The authors need to discuss the discrepancy, and the underlying reasons.</p></disp-quote><p>We listed the 56 know partners to make it clear about what has been reported for TWIST1 protein interaction and what are the novel partners identified in this study. It is important to note that the 56 known partners in the APID database are collected from various sources, including yeast two-hybrid and immunoprecipitation from mammalian cell lines. The lack of overlap is anticipated as protein interactions are highly cell-type-specific. Without high-throughput TWIST1 proteomic data, we cannot decide whether the BioID technique recovers a different group of protein compared with traditional immunoprecipitation techniques. However, the TCF3,4,12 partners that are recurrently found in yeast-two-hybrid, immunoprecipitation and in vitro interaction assays were recovered by BioID (El Ghouzzi et al., 2000; Firulli et al., 2007; Fu et al., 2011; Teachenor et al., 2012; Sharma et al., 2013; Kotlyar et al., 2015; Li et al., 2015). This has encouraged us to explore the rest of the novel partners found in the BioID data.</p><p>These points are noted in the Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors show that Twist1 colocalize with Cdh8, and is required for the binding of Cdh8, thus suggest that Twist1-Cdh8 form a regulatory module. Given the degenerate nature of bHLH factor binding motifs, it is likely that the binding of Twist1, and subsequently the binding of Cdh8, are dictated by other transcription factors. Therefore, a motif enrichment analysis should be done among the Twist1/Cdh8 co-binding sites, and compare those motifs enriched in Twist1-only and Cdh8-only binding sites.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that bHLH factor binding sites alone is not enough to confer specificity for TWIST1-CHD8 target recognition. The specificity for NCC differentiation genes might be achieved when TWIST1, CHD8 and additional factors bind adjacently to each other, either sequentially or simultaneously.</p><p>We performed the suggested analysis of motif enrichment of three ChIP-seq peak groups (TWIST1+CHD8, CHD8-only and TWIST1 only). The top motifs and best-matching factors binding to these motifs are now shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 3A. These factors could be either co-binding partners or competitors for the same region. Interestingly the three groups of peaks were enriched in a distinct range of motifs. The co-binding/ competitive factors identified in the three groups of peaks also had variable express patterns across the NCC subtypes. While the average expression of factors binding to TWIST1+CHD8 peaks was activated in the delaminatory and all migratory NCC populations, those binding to CHD8-only and TWIST1-only peaks were highly expressed in the neural tube (Figure 4—figure supplement 3B). This analysis suggests that the TWIST1-CHD8 module is interacting with additional factors, including DLX1 and SOX10 in this case, to enhance NCC identity (Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The increasing expression of DRG neurons genes in Twist1/Cdh8 mutants suggests a possible transition from cranial NC to trunk NC. Therefore, the authors should examine the expression of marker genes accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We have selected a representative panel of ectomesenchymal genes and markers of autonomous and sensory NCC fate in the trunk NCCs. As discussed in the response to reviewer #1 comment 4 above, we observed a loss of ectomesenchymal propensity and some gain of autonomic neuron potential revealed by the upregulation of <italic>Sox2, Sox8, Sox10</italic> and <italic>Tubb3</italic> in the compound mutant embryos. However, genes specific for sensory neurons either were below detection or not significantly changed. These changes were consistent with the ectopic expression of autonomic neuron marker in <italic>Twist1</italic> conditional knockout mouse (Vincentz et al., 2013). We concluded that the <italic>Twist1</italic>/<italic>Chd8</italic>/<italic>Whsc1</italic> module influences the mesenchymal bias at the autonomic<bold>-</bold>ectomesenchyme bifurcation. The findings were present in the Results, Figure 6C-E, and discussed (Discussion) in the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
