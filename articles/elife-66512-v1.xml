A comprehensive understanding of in vivo heterogeneity and specificity of HSC responses to external stimuli is currently lacking. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) on functionally validated mouse HSCs and LSK (Lin-, c-Kit+, Sca1+) progenitors after in vivo pharmacological perturbation of niche signals interferon, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and prostaglandin. We identified six HSC states that are characterized by enrichment but not exclusive expression of marker genes. External signals induced rapid transitions between HSC states but transcriptional response varied both between external stimulants and within the HSC population for a given perturbation. In contrast to LSK progenitors, HSCs were characterized by a greater link between molecular signatures at baseline and in response to external stressors. Chromatin analysis of unperturbed HSCs and LSKs by scATAC-Seq suggested some HSC-specific, cell intrinsic predispositions to niche signals. We compiled a comprehensive resource of HSC- and LSK progenitor-specific chromatin and transcriptional features that represent determinants of signal receptiveness and regenerative potential during stress hematopoiesis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most organs in the human body are maintained by a type of immature cells known as adult stem cells, which ensure a constant supply of new, mature cells. Adult stem cells monitor their environment through external signalling molecules and replace damaged cells as needed.</p><p>Stem cell therapy takes advantage of the regenerative ability of immature stem cells and can be helpful for conditions such as blood diseases, autoimmune diseases, neurodegeneration and cancer. For example, hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation is a treatment for some types of cancer and blood disorders, in which stem cells are harvested from the blood or bone marrow and reintroduced into the body, where they can develop into all types of blood cells, including white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets.</p><p>Hematopoietic stem-cell transplants have been in use for over 30 years, but they remain a highly risky procedure. One of the challenges is that outcomes can vary between patients and many of the factors that can influence the ‘regenerative’ potential of hematopoietic stem cells, such as external signalling molecules, are not well understood.</p><p>To fill this gap, Fast et al. analysed which genes are turned on and off in hematopoietic stem cells in response to several external signalling molecules. To do so, three signalling pathways in mice were altered by injecting them with different chemicals. After two hours, the hematopoietic stem cells were purified and the gene expression for each cell was analysed.</p><p>This revealed that the types of genes and the strength at which they were affected by each chemical was unique. Moreover, hematopoietic stem cells responded rapidly to external signals, with substantial differences in gene expression between individual groups of cells. Contrary to more specialised cells, the external signalling genes in some hematopoietic stem cells were already activated without being injected with external signalling molecules. This suggest that low levels of external signalling molecules released from their microenvironment may prepare stem cells to better respond to future stress or injuries.</p><p>These results help to better understand stem cells and to evaluate how the signalling state of hematopoietic stem cells affects regeneration, and ultimately improve hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>stem cell niche</kwd><kwd>blood</kwd><kwd>interferons</kwd><kwd>prostaglandins</kwd><kwd>growth

indications, including blood diseases, autoimmune diseases, neurodegeneration, and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blau and Daley, 2019</xref>). Despite being used in the clinic for over 30 years, hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplants remain a highly risky procedure. To better understand HSC regeneration, recent efforts have used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) to discover novel markers to further enrich for functional HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cabezas-Wallscheid et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wilson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rodriguez-Fraticelli et al., 2020</xref>). Yet, no consensus exists on the optimal marker combination to obtain the most purified HSCs in part because extensive functional heterogeneity within HSCs makes experimental evaluation challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Haas et al., 2018</xref>). Both intrinsic and extrinsic factors have been implicated in regulating HSC function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morrison et al., 1996</xref>). The stem cell niche forms an important extrinsic regulator of HSCs as it anchors stem cells and maintains the balance between self-renewal and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Morrison and Spradling, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Morrison and Scadden, 2014</xref>). Release of soluble signals from the niche such as interferons, prostaglandins, and growth factors, including stem cell factor (SCF) and G-CSF, has been shown to influence HSC function during homeostasis and upon injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pinho and Frenette, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pietras et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Morales-Mantilla and King, 2018</xref>). While known to be affected by a wide variety of extracellular signals, little is known about the heterogeneity and specificity of HSC responses to these external stimuli, nor is it understood how differential responses relate to functional diversity of HSCs. HSCs are also regulated cell intrinsically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morrison et al., 1996</xref>). Chromatin state is a crucial determinant of cell identity and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Klemm et al., 2019</xref>). Hematopoietic differentiation is a prime example of how cell fate changes associate with massive remodeling of the epigenetic landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avgustinova and Benitah, 2016</xref>). Despite the current knowledge on regulators of HSC fate, few studies have assessed chromatin states in purified, in vivo-derived HSC populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lara-Astiaso et al., 2014</xref>) due to technical limitations such as cell numbers. Recent advancements in single-cell chromatin accessibility sequencing (scATAC-Seq) provides a methodological framework for studying the diversity and uniqueness of HSC chromatin features at homeostasis and upon external stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buenrostro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lareau et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Here, we performed comprehensive scRNA-Seq and scATAC-Seq profiling on functionally validated mouse HSCs and examined in vivo transcriptional responses to pharmacological stimulation, mimicking signals from the stem cell niche. To encompass a wide variety of different transcriptional responses, we evaluated three different signaling pathways: an inflammatory pathway through stimulation or inhibition of prostaglandins by 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (dmPGE<sub>2</sub>) and indomethacin, a host-defense immune signaling pathway mediated by activating of TLR and interferon signaling with poly(I:C), and a cellular mobilization pathway stimulated by the growth factor G-CSF. We found that unperturbed HSCs exist in fluent transcriptional states with different levels of marker gene enrichment. External stimulants can alter the cell distribution between HSC states to varying degrees depending on the stimulant as well as induce specific changes within cell states. Comparison of HSCs to multipotent LSK (Lin-, c-Kit+, Sca1+) progenitors allowed us to determine the specificity of transcriptional responses in HSCs. Finally, analysis of native HSC chromatin states revealed cell intrinsic heterogeneity that may prime HSC subpopulations for particular transcriptional responses following exposure to certain signals. The data is provided as a resource to the broader research community via an easily accessible web interactive application (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mouse-hsc.cells.ucsc.edu">https://mouse-hsc.cells.ucsc.edu</ext-link>). This work provides a comprehensive description of the in vivo single-cell transcriptomic and epigenetic landscape of HSCs and multipotent LSK progenitors in response to common external stressors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>In vivo stimulation of functionally validated HSCs and multipotent progenitors for transcriptomic and epigenetic profiling</title><p>To investigate transcriptional responses to external signals, we profiled HSCs and multipotent progenitors (MPPs) after four distinct in vivo pharmacological perturbations with doses matching previous studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, see Materials and methods). Male and female mice were treated with one of three activators dmPGE<sub>2</sub>, poly(I:C), or G-CSF for 2 hr or administered the Cox1/2 inhibitor indomethacin (‘Indo’) for 1 week to deplete endogenous prostaglandins (see Materials and methods). We chose a 2 hr treatment window for the extrinsic activators as we aimed to assess the immediate, direct effects of the external stimulants on HSCs and MPPs. After the respective drug treatments, HSC and MPP populations comprising the entire LSK compartment were isolated via fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Through a limiting dilution transplantation assay (LDTA) and extreme limiting dilution assay (ELDA) analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hu and Smyth, 2009</xref>), we determined HSC purity to be 1 in 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B-D</xref>). The LDTA confirmed that our isolation and purification procedure allowed for the profiling of functional, highly purified HSCs. Phenotypic marker composition within LSK cells remained largely consistent between different stimulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). An exception was the reduction of cells within the HSC compartment following dmPGE<sub>2</sub> treatment, decreasing from 1.9% in control to 0.85% of LSK cells (p-value = 6.4*10<sup>–4</sup>, by differential proportion analysis [DPA]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Farbehi et al., 2019</xref>). To account for a potential phenotypic shift in HSC surface marker expression due to CD34 externalization, which would move functional HSCs to the MPP1 population, we compared the contribution of the later by scRNA-Seq-defined ‘stem cell state’ in HSCs and MPP1s. We found no increase in the ‘stem cell’ population in dmPGE<sub>2</sub>-treated MPP1s, compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2H</xref>). After cell sorting, we subjected a total of 46,344 cells to scRNA-Seq using the 10× Genomics platform (see Materials and methods). We obtained an average of 37,121 (SD = 14,308) reads per cell and 2994 (SD = 480) genes per cell (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), indicative of a rich dataset that contained functionally validated HSCs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are transcriptionally heterogeneous and niche perturbations rapidly shift cells into different states.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of stimulant treatment before HSC and multipotent progenitor (MPP) isolation, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>.

We applied a standard scRNA-Seq pipeline to filter and normalize UMI reads (see Materials and methods). Separate analysis of male and female HSCs revealed minimal sexual dimorphism during both steady state and following perturbation with external stimulants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2 supp3">Supplementary files 2 and 3</xref>). We therefore regressed out any sex-specific effects and controlled for other batch-specific confounders in further downstream analyses (see Materials and methods). In the aggregated dataset, we detected a total of six HSC clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To ensure optimal choice of clustering hyperparameters, we used a data-driven approach (Silhouette coefficient and Davies–Bouldin index) that was validated by comparison of two independent biological scRNA-Seq replicates of control HSCs sorted from different mouse strains (see Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). The absence of clear separation into highly distinct clusters in uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), together with fact that most marker genes were not exclusively expressed but rather enriched in a given cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>), suggests that the HSC clusters represent transcriptional states with continuous transitions as opposed to discrete subtypes of HSCs. We calculated a transcriptional score by combining the top enriched genes for each cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, see Materials and methods) to further illustrate the observation of gradual changes in transcriptional state within the HSC population. While transcriptional scores were most enriched in their respective clusters, expression dropped before and extended beyond cluster borders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). Reactome and gene ontology (GO) term pathway enrichment analysis, comparison to previous studies of functionally characterized HSCs (Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5 supp6">Supplementary files 5 and 6</xref>) and manual curation of enriched genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>) allowed to assign labels to each HSC cluster or state. Three HSC clusters made up 98% of control HSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) while the remaining 2% split into a ‘cell cycle’ cluster marked by genes such as <italic>Ki67</italic> and an ‘Interferon’ cluster characterized by the expression of interferon-response genes <italic>Iigp1</italic>, <italic>Isg15</italic>, <italic>Ifit1</italic>, <italic>and Oasl2</italic> (each 1%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and F</xref>).

We eliminated the possibility that the ‘Activated’ cluster arose due to an unspecific artifact of the cell isolation procedure since LSKs did not have an ‘Activated’ cluster and the proportion of <italic>Nr4a1</italic> expressing cells was much smaller (Figure 3B and Figure 3—figure supplement 1B). HSCs have been tightly associated with decreased cell cycle activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Foudi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wilson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Qiu et al., 2014</xref>). The cluster adjacent to the ‘Activated’ state was termed ‘quiescent’ because cells showed enrichment in expression of marker genes that have previously been linked to the most potent and quiescent HSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cabezas-Wallscheid et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wilson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gazit et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balazs et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Komorowska et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schneider et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jeong et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, ‘quiescent’ HSCs did not express IEGs and expressed low levels of the ‘cell cycle’ score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). The ‘metabolism’ cluster comprised the most metabolically active HSCs as evidenced by enrichment of transcripts involved in translation initiation (<italic>Eif5a, Eif4a1</italic>), nucleotide metabolism (<italic>Nme1, Dctpp1</italic>), ribosome assembly (<italic>Ncl, Nop56, Nop10, Npm1</italic>) and protein chaperones (<italic>Hsp90, Hsp60</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). In conclusion, baseline HSCs were defined by three main transcriptional states, ‘Quiescent’, ‘Activated’, and ‘Metabolism’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) with few HSCs residing in the ‘Interferon’ or ‘Cell cycle’ state. Transcriptional scores visualized that these HSC states were not exclusive and that HSC transcriptional state could be rather described by a combination of continuous gradients of marker genes. Therefore, subsequent analyses via discrete clusters provided an analytical tool to compare changes in transcriptional state as opposed to an exclusive assignment of cell identities.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>External signals changed HSC distribution between clusters and transcriptional activity within clusters</title><p>To determine how external stimulants affect transcriptional identity of HSCs, we evaluated changes in cell distribution between clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>) as well as differentially expressed genes (DEGs) within each cluster using ‘model-based analysis of single-cell transcriptomics’ or MAST (see Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Finak et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). We further examined the relationship of genes that define each HSC cluster and genes perturbed by each external stimulant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and H</xref>). A unified heatmap shows all HSC clusters for every perturbation (rows) and the averaged gene expression within these clusters for four cluster- or treatment-representative genes (columns, up-only, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4 supp8">Supplementary files 4 and 8</xref>, full heatmap in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2I</xref>). To further identify distinct patterns of gene regulation in HSC clusters and visualize both up- and downregulated genes, we generated separate heatmaps for each individual perturbation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>). DmPGE<sub>2</sub> and poly(I:C) stimulated genes showed enrichment for previously described signatures with the same stimulants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5 supp6">Supplementary files 5 and 6</xref>). G-CSF induced selected genes such as <italic>Myb</italic> and <italic>Spi1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and downregulated niche adhesion receptors <italic>ckit</italic> and <italic>Cd9</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>, purple arrows) consistent with the growth factor’s role in myeloid differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Metcalf and Nicola, 1983</xref>) and mobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Leung et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bendall and Bradstock, 2014</xref>), respectively. However, our G-CSF-induced gene set did not show any significant enrichment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5 supp6">Supplementary files 5 and 6</xref>) with various previously reported G-CSF signatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schuettpelz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pedersen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Giladi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mervosh et al., 2018</xref>) likely due to different timing of G-CSF treatment. Indomethacin only led to subtle changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>) and cell distribution between HSC clusters remained unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Both dmPGE<sub>2</sub> and poly(I:C) caused a significant change in HSC cluster distribution which indicated a loss of the original transcriptional identity of some HSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>). In vivo treatment with dmPGE<sub>2</sub> gave rise to a novel cluster that contained 55% of dmPGE<sub>2</sub>-treated HSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) and which was itself only composed of dmPGE<sub>2</sub>-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). We called this cluster ‘Acute activation’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) since marker genes included known cAMP-response genes such as <italic>Fosl2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>) and the phosphodiesterases <italic>Pde10a</italic>, <italic>Pde4b</italic>, and <italic>Pde4d</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). The ‘Acute activation’ cluster displayed the highest transcriptional score of marker genes from the ‘Activated’ cluster (besides the ‘Activated’ cluster itself) including genes such as <italic>Klf2</italic> which confirmed the close relationship between these two clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2G</xref>, p-value [Tukey’s honest significant differences, HSD] = 0.001). dmPGE<sub>2</sub>-treated cells in other clusters also showed strong expression of target genes such as <italic>Tsc22d3</italic>, but in contrast to the ‘Acute activation’ cluster the expression of cluster identity genes (e.g. <italic>Txnip, Mllt3</italic>) was maintained in the dmPGE<sub>2</sub>-treated ‘quiescent’ cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Poly(I:C) treatment increased the proportion of HSCs in the ‘interferon’ cluster from 1% to 42% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and p-value [DPA] &lt;10<sup>–5</sup>). The top 100 poly(I:C)-stimulated genes exhibited a 72% overlap with the top 100 marker genes of the ‘interferon’ cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> and p-value (hypergeometric test, false discovery rate [FDR]-corrected) = 10<sup>–144</sup>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp9">Supplementary file 9</xref>) suggesting that poly(I:C) treatment reinforces a transcriptional program that already exists endogenously in a small proportion of HSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A-D</xref>). In contrast to dmPGE<sub>2</sub>, the transcriptional response to poly(I:C) was strongest in the ‘interferon’ cluster since target genes, for example, <italic>Oasl2</italic> or <italic>Peli1</italic>, were less induced in the other poly(I:C)-treated clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Treatment with G-CSF led only to minimal shifts in HSC distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and proportions between HSC clusters, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and p-value [DPA] &gt;0.05 for all clusters). The transcriptional response for most G-CSF target genes such as <italic>Myb</italic>, <italic>Eif4ebp1</italic>, <italic>or Ncl</italic> was strongest within the ‘metabolism’ cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) with a 34% overlap (p-value [hypergeometric test, FDR-corrected] = 8.2*10<sup>–49</sup>) between ‘metabolism’ marker genes and G-CSF-induced genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp9">Supplementary file 9</xref>). In summary a 2 hr in vivo pulse with poly(I:C) or dmPGE<sub>2</sub> significantly altered distributions of HSCs between pre-existing transcriptional states and, in the case of dmPGE<sub>2</sub>, allowed for a novel transcriptional state to surface. The fact that certain clusters (e.g. ‘metabolism’ and ‘interferon’) responded more strongly to external stimuli combined with the observation that HSCs kept their baseline cluster identity to varying degrees strongly suggests that transcriptional heterogeneity does not only exist at baseline but also during HSCs’ response to extrinsic signals.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Endogenous cell states distinguished TLR- and IFN-specific responses of poly(I:C) treatment</title><p>To better understand how poly(I:C) induced interferon signaling, we evaluated different components of the TLR and interferon pathways in our single-cell clusters. Binding of poly(I:C) to Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexopoulou et al., 2001</xref>) induces expression of Type I interferons (IFNα and IFNβ), which in turn signal via IFNα/β receptor 1 (<italic>Ifnar1</italic>) and 2 (<italic>Ifnar2</italic>) heterodimers, all of which were expressed in HSCs (Figure 4E). We identified two expression patterns in poly(I:C)-treated HSCs that were consistent with TLR and interferon receptor signaling. The first expression pattern ‘up interferon’ was driven by induction of poly(I:C) responsive genes across all cell states. In addition, these genes were already specifically enriched in the ‘interferon’ cluster in the absence of poly(I:C) stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Genes within this group are either directly downstream of Type I interferon receptors, such as <italic>Stat2</italic> and <italic>Irf9,</italic> or act as effector proteins involved in viral interferon response such as <italic>Apobec3</italic> and <italic>Eif2ak2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>).

The second expression pattern ‘up Toll-like receptor’ constituted poly(I:C)-induced genes that were predominantly found in the ‘interferon’ cluster with low expression at baseline in the control ‘interferon’ cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Genes within this signature included <italic>Nfkbia</italic>, <italic>Peli1</italic>, <italic>Map3k8</italic>, and <italic>Rps6ka3</italic> all of which are part of TNFα and Toll-like signaling pathways.

While cell proportions did not change between the HSC clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), distribution of cells shifted slightly toward the periphery of the UMAP plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) which was mirrored by increased expression of individual ‘Activated’ cluster marker genes such as <italic>Fos</italic> and other IEGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A-B</xref>). To further investigate the influence of endogenous prostaglandin depletion on cell state while taking the entire transcriptional landscape into account, we computed diffusion pseudotime (DPT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Haghverdi et al., 2016</xref>) between the ‘Activated’ and ‘Quiescent’ cluster in HSCs. The cell with the combined highest expression of the three top cluster markers for the ‘Activated’ state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, see Materials and methods) was set as the ‘root cell’ and DPT was calculated originating from that root cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

The pseudotime analysis of the scRNA-Seq data indicated a specific shift in IEG transcriptional state upon depletion of endogenous prostaglandins. To further confirm the effect of endogenous prostaglandins on IEGs in an orthogonal assay, we measured single-cell protein levels of FOS by intracellular flow cytometry.

We analyzed transcriptomic data from LSK cells as an aggregated set consisting of all four perturbations and control, analogous to the approach used for HSCs above.

Because the latter analysis only indicated similarity rather than full equivalence of HSC and LSK clusters, and to avoid ambiguity when evaluating HSCs and LSKs, all LSK clusters were denoted with the prefix ‘LSK-’. LSK clusters most similar to the ‘quiescent’ HSC state by top enriched genes were named ‘LSK-primitive’ and ‘LSK-primed’, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). These two clusters further expressed the highest level of the HSC ‘quiescence’ score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1H</xref>, p-value(Tukey’s HSD) = 0.001).

The motif activities of TFs CREB1, NF-κB, and STAT3 that are immediately downstream of prostaglandins, poly(I:C), and G-CSF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), respectively, were homogeneously distributed in HSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and the majority of LSK clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp11">Supplementary file 11</xref>). This result suggested that HSCs have an equally responsive potential to these external signals based on their accessible chromatin states. We did detect differential enrichment of motifs for TFs that are further downstream in the response to external signals.

While we cannot entirely rule out that the continuous cell states arose from the noisy nature of scRNA-Seq sampling, this is unlikely given our observation that genes that vary along the same transcriptional gradients are also functionally correlated (e.g. IEGs). External perturbations rapidly shifted HSC distribution between HSC states within hours of signaling, providing evidence that the transcriptional states are highly dynamic allowing HSCs to quickly transition between states. Interestingly, we observed heterogeneity of HSC responses to external stimuli which may be determined by the baseline transcriptional and epigenetic state supported by our single-cell chromatin studies. Preliminary findings suggested an HSC specific co-occurrence of signaling and lineage-specific TF motif activities that is consistent with previous observations in human hematopoietic progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Trompouki et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choudhuri et al., 2020</xref>). Overall, our data indicates that the single-cell landscape of in vivo-derived, functional HSCs is likely made up of a unique chromatin architecture with fluent transcriptional states, some of which can be rapidly influenced by external signals.</p><p>Our combined scRNA-Seq and cell hashing (HTO barcoding) approach allowed us to gain insights into the transcriptional landscape of HSCs and phenotypically defined MPP populations within the LSK compartment at steady state and following perturbations with extrinsic signals. Our results enabled us to connect the transcriptional profile on a single-cell level to the previously described phenotypic behaviors of these MPP populations (; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pietras et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cabezas-Wallscheid et al., 2014</xref>). For example even though both MPP2 and MPP3 cells have been previously described as myeloid biased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pietras et al., 2015</xref>), our analysis allowed to determine the proportion of putative myeloid cells within MPP2 and MPP3/4 cells as well as the relative MPP2 and MPP3/4 composition of myeloid cells. The HTO barcoding method provided a flexible tool to evaluate and compare transcriptional profiles within phenotypically defined populations because the technology used here is not dependent on the availability of specifically conjugated antibodies against particular surface receptors. In addition, <italic>Xist</italic> expression was used to deconvolute pooled male and female cells. While our analysis revealed only minimal sexual dimorphism that is consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nakada et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gal-Oz et al., 2019</xref>), the negligible additional investment to obtain data from both sexes may become the default experimental design in mammalian scRNA-Seq experiments. Our work presents evidence for two value-adding pooling strategies that allow for further insights into cell populations analyzed by scRNA-Seq.</p><p>We used a two-pronged strategy to assess the specificity of external perturbations in HSCs and LSKs. First, we determined changes of cell proportions between cell states. Second, we evaluated differential expression within particular cell states following stimulation. Comparison of cluster-enriched and treatment-induced genes allowed us to identify unique and common genes for a given perturbation or a specific cluster. In contrast to LSKs, HSCs exhibited a high degree of overlap between stimulant-induced and cluster marker-defined gene programs. These results suggest that even at baseline, HSC transcriptional heterogeneity is defined by differences in signaling activity. Changes in cell proportions between different clusters indicated further specificity for treatment and differentiation state. Poly(I:C) and dmPGE<sub>2</sub> led to cellular shifts between distinct transcriptional states with poly(I:C) driving the formation of two novel interferon-related clusters in LSKs but not HSCs. The strength of transcriptional perturbation could not solely be estimated based on the distribution of cells within clusters alone. G-CSF did not change the cell proportions between clusters but rather elicited strong transcriptional responses within a given cell state. Comparison of DEGs within clusters in HSCs and LSKs indicated that HSCs display a smaller response across all clusters to G-CSF compared to LSK progenitors. In summary, scRNA-Seq enabled a number of analyses that uncovered novel, HSC-specific responses to external perturbations.</p><p>We evaluated the effect of three complementary signaling pathways (G-CSF, prostaglandin, and interferon) on the transcriptional state of HSCs. Pharmacological perturbation of these signaling pathways allowed to tightly control critical experimental parameters (e.g. genetic background of mice, timing of sample processing) that mitigated potential confounders of the downstream analysis. With the exception of indomethacin, we chose a short treatment window of 2 hr to increase the likelihood of studying direct downstream effects of stimulants on HSCs. Analysis of DEGs within clusters indicated interferon- vs. Toll-like receptor response genes induced by poly(I:C) treatment. While we could not detect transcripts for Type I interferons in our scRNA-Seq data of HSCs or MPPs, it is possible that some of the interferon-response genes were induced indirectly by release of interferons from the niche. An interferon inducer similar to poly(I:C) has been previously shown to increase IFNα protein levels in the serum as early as 2 hr post in vivo injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Linehan et al., 2018</xref>). Future work using genetic models is needed to further dissect indirect vs. direct effects of external stimulants on HSCs.</p><p>There is a tradeoff between the strength of a perturbation required for experimental robustness vs. studying signals that are more physiologically relevant but lead to more subtle changes within and between cells. Here, we evaluated response of HSCs to three different external activators mimicking niche signals that were dosed two to four orders of magnitude higher than what an animal would typically encounter during actual injury or infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eyles et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Porter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hoggatt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sheehan et al., 2015</xref>). To assess niche-derived signals in a more physiological setting, we administered the Cox1/2 inhibitor indomethacin orally for 1 week to deplete endogenous prostaglandins. As expected, the changes in gene expression with indomethacin were much weaker than those observed after acute injection with dmPGE<sub>2</sub>, G-CSF, and poly(I:C). ScRNA-Seq analysis offers unique tools to evaluate gene expression changes in response to weak perturbations. Pseudotime analysis showed that depletion of endogenous prostaglandins using indomethacin led to a small but significant shift in the transcriptional state of HSCs. The effect of indomethacin on IEGs such as <italic>Fos</italic> was further validated in independent FACS experiments which showed that the transcriptional programs implicated through pseudotime were also found to be perturbed using this orthogonal assay. How exactly the increase in RNA levels of <italic>Fos</italic> observed in scRNA-Seq can be reconciled with decreased FOS protein levels determined by FACS analysis will need to be addressed in future experiments. Another important implication and potential caveat highlighted by our findings is that RNA and protein levels may not always positively correlate, even on a single-cell level. Regardless, scRNA-Seq technologies provide sensitive tools to interrogate subtle changes in cellular states.</p><p>In summary, we showed that single-cell approaches provide a rich and sensitive tool to analyze transcriptional and epigenetic states of HSCs during homeostasis and upon external perturbation. We found that HSCs exist in dynamic cell states and external signals can induce rapid transitions between, as well as changes within, these HSC states. While our work did not reveal whether these transcriptional states are associated with specific niches in vivo, novel spatial transcriptomic approaches provide exciting new opportunities to address such questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rodriques et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, recently developed barcoding strategies enable assessment of treatment-induced transcriptional changes and functional potential of single cells within the same experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rodriguez-Fraticelli et al., 2020</xref>). Understanding endogenous levels of niche-derived factors and the associated transcriptional and epigenetic responses will advance our basic understanding of stem cells and their potential applications in the clinic.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

used the following mouse strain (#016617) that was obtained from Jackson labs but bred in-house. For external stimulant treatments, male and female mice (8–10 weeks) were ordered from Jackson labs (strain CD 45.2 [Ly5.2], #00664). Mice were kept for at least 1 week in the animal facility before initiating experiments and allocated at random (by cage) into experimental groups. Indomethacin (Sigma, 6 mg/l) was administered for 7 days in acidified drinking water to maintain stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Curry et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Praticò et al., 2001</xref>). Indomethacin supplemented drinking water was changed every other day. Mice were injected with the following drugs and euthanized after 2 hr: poly(I:C) HMW (Invivogen), IP injection 10 mg/kg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pietras et al., 2014</xref>). G-CSF Recombinant Human Protein (Thermo Fisher), IP injection, 0.25 mg/kg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Morrison et al., 1997</xref>). dmPGE<sub>2</sub> (Cayman), SC injection, 2 mg/kg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hoggatt et al., 2013</xref>). Mice were weighed before injection and injection volume was adjusted to ensure equal dose between individual mice. The ‘control’ condition from the external stimulant treatments was also used as the second independent biological replicate of unperturbed HSCs (HSC Replicate 2). All animal procedures were approved by the Harvard University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Bone marrow preparation and FACS</title><p>Whole bone marrow was isolated from femur, tibia, hip, and vertebrae via gentle crushing using a mortar and pestle. Stem and progenitor cells were enriched via lineage depletions (Miltenyi Biotech, 130-090-858). Antibodies, dilutions, and vendors are listed in the Key resources table. Cells were stained for 1.5 hr based on published best practice protocols for assessing CD34 labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ema et al., 2006</xref>). HSCs (LSK, CD48-, CD150+, CD34-), MPP1s (LSK, CD48-, CD150+, CD34+), MPP0s (LSK, CD48-, CD150-), MPP2s (LSK, CD48+, CD150+), and MPP3/4s (LSK, CD48+, CD150-) were sorted on a FACSAria (Becton Dickinson) and representative sorting scheme is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>. Purity of &gt;80% was ensured by reanalyzing each sorted population.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Sample size estimation and sample batching</title><p>To determine appropriate sample sizes of mice and HSCs, we performed an initial experiment on fresh HSCs (HSC Replicate 1) which yielded estimated number of 2382 cells (after filtering), and which resolved biologically meaningful clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In subsequent experiments we therefore targeted obtaining a similar or higher cell number. For external stimulant treatment, we based our sample size of five male and five female mice on this initial experiment. Because of sample processing times, a maximum of two conditions could be performed on the same day, resulting in three separate days of experiments. To mitigate batch effects resulting from different experimental days, the following precautions were taken. (1) All mice included in the external stimulant treatment were ordered from the same batch from JAX. (2) Control mice were administered acidified water and injected with DMSO to control for both unspecific perturbations that might result from the external stimulant treatments. (3) All experiments were performed within less than 1 week and single-cell libraries were prepared together for all samples after the initial droplet reaction was frozen. (4) FACS gates were set up initially but left constant for each experiment. Single color controls as well as fluorescence minus one controls ensured that there was minimal day-to-day technical drift on the FACS instrument.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Intracellular staining for FACS</title><p>BM extraction, lineage depletion, and surface marker staining were performed as described above. Cells were fixed and permeabilized for intracellular staining according to manufacturer’s instructions (BD Biosciences, 554714). Intracellular staining was performed for 30 min on ice. Samples were analyzed on an LSRII FACS analyzer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Limiting dilution transplantation assay</title><p>Recipient CD45.2 (Jax #00664) mice were gamma-irradiated (Cs-137 source) with a split dose of 5.5 Gy each 1 day before transplantation. HSCs were isolated from CD45.1 (Jax #002014) donors and transplanted with 200,000 whole bone marrow cells (CD45.2) via retro-orbital injection. Donor cell engraftment was monitored monthly for 16 weeks using an LSRII FACS analyzer (Becton Dickinson). Flow cytometry data were analyzed with FlowJo (Tree Star). HSC frequency was calculated using the following website: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/elda/">http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/elda/</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Single-cell RNA and ATAC sequencing library preparation and sequencing</title><p>Male and female cells were sorted separately but pooled in equal ratios before further downstream processing. For CITE-Seq HTO labeling of MPP populations, 0.25 µg of TruStain FcX Blocking reagent (Biolegend) was added for 10 min on ice. Each MPP populations was labeled with 1 µg of TotalSeq antibody cocktail (Biolegend, see Key resources table) and incubated for 30 min on ice. After washing, cells were resuspended in small amounts, counted and pooled in equal ratios. Each drug treatment condition resulted in one pooled MPP and one HSC sample that were processed separately for scRNA-Seq according to manufacturer’s recommendations (10× Genomics, 3’ V2 for HSC Replicate 1 experiment and V3 for external stimulant treatments). Briefly, for pooled MPPs, no more than 10,000 cells were loaded. For HSCs, all sorted cells (between 2222 sorted events for dmPGE<sub>2</sub> and 12,017 sorted events for control) were loaded on the 3’ library chip. For preparation of HTO – surface libraries manufacturer’s recommendations (Biolegend) were followed. For ATAC-Seq, HSCs and MPPs (pooled MPP0, MPP1, MPP2, and MPP3/4) were sorted as described above from five male and five female mice (strain CD 45.2 [Ly5.2], JAX strain #00664). Nuclei were isolated and libraries were prepared using manufacturer’s recommendations (10× Chromium Single Cell ATAC). Libraries were sequenced on a Next-seq 500, 75 cycle kit (‘Replicate 1’, scRNA-Seq) and NOVAseq 6000, 100 cycle kit (‘Replicate 2’ and external stimulant treatments, scRNA-Seq, scATAC-Seq).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Computational and statistical analyses</title><p>All code and a detailed description of the analysis is available in a dedicated GitHub repository (see link in key resources table). To ensure reproducibility the entire analysis (except cellranger and CITE-Seq count) was entirely performed in Docker containers. Containers used for the analysis are indicated in the Jupyter notebooks and corresponding images are available on dockerhub (see link in key resources table). Interactive cell browser web app is available here: (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mouse-hsc.cells.ucsc.edu">https://mouse-hsc.cells.ucsc.edu</ext-link>). Raw data are available with GEO accession code GSE165844.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Demultiplexing and generation of count matrices</title><p>Cellranger (v3.0.1) command ‘mkfastq’ was used to demutliplex raw base call (BCL) files into individual samples and separate mRNA FASTQ files and HTO surface fastq files. The cellranger ‘count’ command was used with default options to generate gene by cell matrices from mRNA FASTQ files. CITE-Seq count (version 1.4.3) was used to generate surface count by cell matrices from the HTO surface FASTQ libraries. For the fresh HSC Replicate 1 experiment cellranger (version 2.1.0) was used for demultiplexing and count matrix generation. The mm10 reference genome was used for all alignments. For scATAC-Seq cellranger-atac <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-atac/software/pipelines/latest/using/mkfastq">mkfastq</ext-link> and count (1.2.0) was used for demultiplexing and alignment and generation of the fragment file. To generate the count matrix MACS2 was run with default parameters (keeping duplicates) on the aligned reads. Resulting peak summits were extended to 300 bp and counts were extracted from fragment file using a custom script (see GitHub repository) to generate a count matrix.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Quality control, filtering, and dimensionality reduction of scRNA-Seq data</title><p>The main parts of the bioinformatic analysis of scRNA-Seq data was performed using the python package scanpy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wolf et al., 2018</xref>). For filtering and quality control, best practice examples were followed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Luecken and Theis, 2019</xref>). Count matrices were filtered on a gene and cell level. Cells were excluded with either less than 3000 UMIs, less than 1500 (LT), or 2000 (MPPs) genes or more than 20,000 (LT) or 30,000 (MPPs) counts. A cutoff of no more than 10% UMIs aligned to mitochondrial genes per cell was applied. Genes expressed in less than 20 cells were excluded from the analysis. Counts were normalized to 10,000 per cell and log transformed. Features (genes) were scaled to unit variance and zero mean before dimensionality reduction. To reveal the structure in the data, we built a neighborhood graph and used the leiden community detection algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Traag et al., 2019</xref>) to identify communities or clusters of related cells (see also below). The UMAP algorithm was used to embed the high-dimensional dataset in a low-dimensional space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Becht et al., 2018</xref>). DPA was used for comparing cell proportions between clusters as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Farbehi et al., 2019</xref>). Interactive visualization app of scRNA-Seq data was prepared using UCSC Cell Browser package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Speir et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Demultiplexing of CITE-Seq hashtag data</title><p>We used the DemuxEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gaublomme et al., 2019</xref>) implementation in pegasuspy to assign MPP surface identities and demultiplex the pooled MPP sample. First background probabilities (‘pg.estimate_background_probs’) were estimated using default settings and ‘pg.demultiplex’ was run adjusting the alpha and the alpha_noise parameter to maximize cell retrieval by singlet classification. Assignments were validated by plotting count matrix in UMAP space and observing four distinct clusters indicative for the four HTO labels that were pooled. The proportion of demultiplexed cells matched the original pooling ratio. Analysis of coexpression of sex-specific genes allowed for further validation of the doublet rate. Proportion of cells classified by DemuxEM as doublets exceeded doublet rate estimated by coexpression of sex-specific genes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Batch correction</title><p>Because of timing required for FACS and sample prep, it was impossible to obtain HSCs and MPPs from all conditions on 1 day (see also ‘Sample size estimation and sample batching’ above). To evaluate if batch correction was needed, we determined scRNA-Seq clusters and enriched genes by processing each sample separately or by combined analysis of all samples. Even though similar scRNA-Seq clusters were found in individual samples, these populations were non-overlapping in the integrative analysis (especially for G-CSF). To correct for the batch effects we used ComBat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Johnson et al., 2007</xref>) with default settings on the log<sub>2</sub> expression matrix, allowing cells to be clustered by cell type or cell state. Batch correction results were similar when we used Scanorama (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hie et al., 2019</xref>) and Harmony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Korsunsky et al., 2019</xref>) but both of these methods appeared to be overcorrecting with respect to the dmPGE<sub>2</sub>-treated population. To correct for potential sex-specific differences Xist counts were regressed out. Raw data was used for all differential expression analyses and plotting of single-cell gene expression values. Batch-corrected counts were used for clustering and DPT analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Optimal cluster parameter selection</title><p>Since HSCs and MPPs are highly purified cell populations, we did not observe any clearly separated clusters in UMAP space. To aid the optimal choice of hyperparameters for leiden clustering, we used a combination of Silhouette coefficient and Davies–Bouldin index. We first validated this approach using the PBMC3K (from 10× genomics, scanpy.datasets.pbmc3k()) silver standard dataset. We iterated through a range of KNN nearest neighbors and Leiden resolution combinations measuring average Silhouette coefficient and Davies–Bouldin index in PCA space for each combination. Plotting the optimal value for Silhouette score and Davies–Bouldin index vs. increasing numbers of clusters allowed for the determination of appropriate cluster number for the dataset. For the PBMC dataset, there was a clear drop-off in optimal value after eight clusters, which is corroborated by most single-cell tutorials that also report eight clusters for this dataset. After validation of this approach on PBMCs, we assessed Silhouette coefficient and Davies–Bouldin index for different clustering results of our own HSC and MPP datasets. This allowed us to select the optimal hyperparameters for each cluster number. The approach was validated by comparing two independent biological replicates of control HSCs (‘Replicate 1’ and ‘Replicate 2’).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Differential expression using MAST</title><p>Differential expression analysis was performed using MAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Finak et al., 2015</xref>). This method is based on a Hurdle model that takes into account both the proportion of cells expressing a given transcript and transcript levels themselves while being able to control for covariates. Based on previous reports, differential expression cutoff was set at 1.2-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Smillie et al., 2019</xref>) and a more stringent cutoff of 1.5-fold was also included. Only genes that were expressed in at least 5% of the cells were considered for differential expression analysis. FDR (Benjamini and Hochberg) cutoff was set at 1%. For drug treatments, differential expression between treatment and control was assessed within the entire LSK or HSC dataset and within each cluster controlling for number of genes per cell and sex. For differential expression analysis between male and female cells at baseline, control datasets were analyzed with clusters and number of genes as a covariates. For sex-specific effects of drug treatments, samples were split by sex and analyzed separately. Resulting differential expression coefficients were compared between male and female cells. To identify gene signatures with common patterns, for each treatment average expression of DEGs was extracted per cluster, scaled (z-score) and grouped together by similarity using hierarchical clustering (seaborn.clustermap, Euclidean distance, single linkage).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>DPT analysis</title><p>For DPT analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Haghverdi et al., 2016</xref>), cells from the ‘Quiescent’ and ‘Activated’ cluster were selected for the following treatments: control, indomethacin, and G-CSF. We recalculated PCA and UMAP embeddings in this reduced dataset. Re-clustering using the Leiden algorithm was used to exclude outlier cells and assess top enriched genes within the new ‘Activated’ cluster. Raw expression of the three top enriched genes (Nr4a1, Nr4a2, Hes1) was summed to robustly select the most highly ‘Activated’ cell as a root cell. DPT was calculated with the following function in scanpy (‘sc.tl.dpt’) using default settings. Cells were ranked according to pseudotime and kernel density distribution was plotted using a bandwidth of 0.02. The Mann–Whitney U-test was used to assess if cells from different samples are drawn from the same pseudotime distribution. To analyze gene expression across pseudotime, for each sample cells were split into 10 equally sized bins according to ascending pseudotime. Bin 1 contained the first 10% of cells with the lowest pseudotime and bin 10 contained the 10% of cells with the highest pseudotime. Average gene expression for representative genes were plotted for each bin and sample.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Pathway and gene list enrichment analysis and comparison</title><p>We performed over-representation analysis comparing various gene sets of interest (upregulated by stimulants, enriched in clusters) to a reference gene set. Depending on the analysis, the reference gene set was composed of an entire database of pathways (REACTOME, GO:BP), manually curated pathways of interest (searching for keywords on MSigDB database and from relevant publications; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goessling et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schuettpelz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pedersen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Giladi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mervosh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Patterson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cilenti et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rodriguez-Fraticelli et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cabezas-Wallscheid et al., 2017</xref>) or gene sets generated from the analysis itself (marker genes from other clusters). Enrichment was assessed using a hypergeometric test (one-sided Fisher’s exact test) and p-values were corrected for FDR using Benjamini–Hochberg. We deliberately choose to evaluate the top 100 genes for every pairwise cluster/treatment comparisons to be more intuitive to interpret and compare.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Calculation of transcriptional scores</title><p>Transcriptional scores for each cluster were calculated using the scanpy function ‘scanpy.tl.score_genes’. Briefly the score represents the average expression of a set of genes subtracted with the average expression of a reference set of genes. The reference set is randomly sampled for each binned expression value. Mean scores per cluster were compared via ANOVA followed by Tukey’s HSD test for individual post hoc mean comparisons.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>scATAC-Seq</title><p>The R package Signac (version 0.2.5), an extension of Seurat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>), was used for quality control, filtering of ATAC-Seq peaks counts and plotting. Quality of scATAC-Seq dataset was ensured by presence of nucleosomal banding pattern and enrichment of reads around transcription start sites. Cells were removed with a less than 1000 or more than 20,000 fragments in peaks. Male and female cells were classified according to absence or presence of Y-chromosome reads. Since distribution of male and female cells appeared uniform across all analyses, no downstream correction was taken for sex. Term frequency-inverse document frequency was used for normalization and dimensionality reduction was performed by singular value decomposition. Cells were clustered using the Louvain community finding algorithm after a neighborhood graph was built with k = 20 (HSCs) or k = 30 (LSK) nearest neighbors. To calculate TF motif scores, ChromVAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schep et al., 2017</xref>) was run with default parameters using the JASPAR 2018 motif database. Differential TF motif activity scores between clusters were calculated with the ‘FindMarkers’ function in Signac using a logistic regression and p-values were adjusted using a Bonferroni correction.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>is a director and equity holder of Agios Pharmaceuticals, Magenta Therapeutics, Editas Medicines, ClearCreekBio, and Life-VaultBio; a founder of Fate Therapeutics and Magenta Therapeutics; and a consultant to FOG Pharma and VCanBio</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>is founder and stockholder of Fate, Inc, Scholar Rock, Camp4 therapeutics and a scientific advisor for Stemgent</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Software, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation, Visualization, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Resources, Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Methodology, Funding acquisition</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Funding acquisition, Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Funding acquisition, Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Project administration, Funding acquisition, Data curation, Supervision</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All animal procedures were approved by the Harvard University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol number 15-03-237).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Table of sequencing metrics.</title><p>Sequencing metric output from cellranger.</p></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-66512-supp1-v1.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Table with overlap of differentially regulated genes in male and female hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and Lin-, c-Kit+, Sca1+ (LSKs).</title><p>Table summarizing number of differentially regulated genes within male and female HSCs and LSKs.

Is this confirmed by the RNAseq data? How could this unusual cell cycle profile be explained?</p><p>Supp figure 1. How many mice were analyzed? Error bars are missing in F and G.</p><p>The repeated use of the term 'niche stimulation' or 'niche stimulants' is misleading because all factors, even though some can be produced by niche cells and pIpC leads to upregulation of IFNalpha which is known to act both on HSCs and their niche, were administered to the mice. The terms 'stimuli', or 'extrinsic stimuli' seem more appropriate.</p><p>Figure 1A. What cells exactly went into the analysis? Is it bulk LKS or bulk LKS plus a number of HSCs to increase their representation? Is Figure 1B showing LKS cells or HSCs? One would think LKS cells, but later the text (lines 124-129) talks about 'HSCs'. The same issue is again in Figure 2E where the figure legend states LKS but main text states HSCs. Do MPPs not show an interferon response following pIpC administration? What does the color coding indicates?</p><p>Figure 1B. As the authors point out, the three main clusters appear to be quite unusual, and indeed a continuum of states may be a better explanation for the differences observed. Would it make sense to further develop the visualization of the data to reflect this? For example, cells could be differentially colored based on quiescence/activation/metabolism scores, resulting in a more nuanced picture.</p><p>Supp Figure 2E. The gene categories of the quiescent and Acute activation clusters seem highly overlapping. What makes them different?</p><p>Line 163 – 163 contradicts the previous section which was largely presented as an analysis of LSK cells, not of HSCs.</p><p>Figure 2. It would be helpful to indicate where in the overall plot each control/stimulated sample falls, as done in Figure 1E. One would expect major shifts to become visible between for example control and pIpC treated samples.</p><p>Figure 3A. It would be useful to read the authors’ interpretation of the data. Would it be correct to think that G-CSF might have a stronger effect on MPPs, and indo on HSCs?</p><p>Figure 3F. Why are there only four LSK clusters, when there were 8 in figure 2A?</p><p>Figure 5. The ATACseq data need to be reorganised to make it clearer that differences between HSC 0/1 are from chromatin accessibility of genes downstream of the genes directly affected by the stimuli considered. The same 5 motifs analyzed for HSCs (CRE, STAT, NF-κB, AP-1, ISRE) should be shown for LKS cells too. This is done for some motifs in Figure 5 G-J and is the most helpful comparison.</p><p>I wonder if a bioinformatics journal may be a more suitable vehicle for publication of the dataset.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1. The results indicate that scRNAseq “in the case of PGE, allowed for a novel transcriptional state to surface”. How is this more novel or distinct than the interferon state that is described?</p><p>2. In 2A why rename the “quiescent” cluster as “progenitor” – it is rather misleading because you are taking a gene set enriched for quiescence and calling it progenitor rather than just describing the phenotype. This name is also misleading because it implies that the cells in the other states are not progenitors, which they are.</p><p>3. G-CSF exerts well-known effects on HSCs with induction of cell cycle (Schuettpelz 2014) – why is this not evident transcriptionally in the data? This should at minimum be addressed in the discussion.</p><p>4. The MPP3 population is supposedly more myeloid biased. It is surprising that this is hardly noticeable in the MPP3/MPP4 population (Figure 2F) – another point that should be addressed in the discussion.</p><p>5. Figure 3G and 3H are really difficult to understand. Is the interpretation that cell cycle genes suppressed by PGE are in the HSC and not defined MPP subset of the LSK? What are you calling “within cluster” and what is “between cluster”? Is 3H only showing the cell cycle gene set? Further description and clarification are needed.</p><p>6. It is interesting that the interferon cluster can be distinguished from the TLR cluster, but what is more interesting is to understand whether some of the interferon signature genes induced in the other clusters e.g. quiescent, activated, metabolism are due to indirect signaling by IFN to these cells as opposed to direct TLR3 engagement by PIPC. This should be included in the discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Understanding the molecular determinants controlling hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) biology is critical for myriad clinically-relevant interventions; however, because HSC are rare, this information is limited. Here the authors exploit their considerable facility with HSC isolation and apply single-cell genomics to provide a profile of both normal HSC transcriptional clusters and HSC relevant perturbations (di-methyl-PGE2 vs. the Cox1/2 inhibitor indomethacin, and G-CSF stimulating mobilization, or the TLR3 ligand poly(I:C)) and identify potential underlying regulatory transcription factors based on in silico analyses. They note that they can understand the perturbations as shifts in cells within the unperturbed clusters (with modest gene expression changes in each cluster). There are some aspects of the work that could be changed to improve impact and to clarify the take-home message.</p><p>The manuscript leaves the reader with the expectation that the work will biologically dissect the normal and perturbed cluster/populations. This is probably because the authors do not adequately clarify the biological impact of the manipulations, the depth of the published record on them, and then convey the expected versus observed transcriptional changes based on that prior published record. In addition, the transcriptional changes in each cluster within the heatmaps relegated to supplementary data probably provide the essential information, but they fail to represent the data across all clusters with all differentially expressed genes to demonstrate common or distinct gene expression changes. This would best be consolidated to a heatmap of differentials instead of the current method of clustering the actual expression metric. To be clear, it would significantly improve the work to show all differentially expressed genes in each HSC cluster across all perturbed clusters in a single heatmap. A viewer other than a genome browser session (which is not easily maintained) would be an essential improvement.</p><p>The central claim is that “niche signals regulate continuous transcriptional states in hematopoietic stem cells”. As an experimental paradigm, the authors inject mice with different molecules and then purify HSC two hours later to examine changes in gene expression. This experimental paradigm does not represent specific perturbations of niche signaling.</p><p>As shown by the Morrison, Frenette, and Link laboratories, the same cytokine has different effects on HSC behavior depending on its cellular source. For example, CXCL12 from osteoblasts does not regulate HSC but CXCL12 produced by perivascular cells is essential for HSC maintenance (Nature. 2013 Mar 14; 495(7440): 231-235). It is unclear to this reviewer how super physiological doses of G-CSF, pIpC -which is an artificial analog of dsRNA and never found in normal mice-, or stabilized PGE2 represent physiological perturbations of niche signals. Moreover, the molecules used do not only target HSC but also affect production of cytokines by niche cells. For example, G-CSF results in CXCL12 downregulation in the niche (Leukemia. 2011 Feb;25(2):211-7) whereas pIpC displaces HSC from bone marrow niches (Cell Rep. 2020 Dec 22;33(12):108530). If the authors wish to claim that niche signals regulate transitions between transcriptional states in HSC then they should repeat their analyses in mouse chimeras containing both WT and receptor KO HSC (e.g. WT and IFNγ-/- mice). These will control for cell autonomous vs non-cell autonomous effects before and after G-CSF, pIpC and dmPGE2 injection.</p><p>Although HSC clusters were not distinguishable by unique markers, the authors defend a protocol to select optimal parameters that enrich for cell-population markers (non-exclusive) in the Leiden scanpy clusters, reasonably arguing that these represent continuous transitions (though they should acknowledge the limitation of the data sparsity, which might artificially enforce continuity). These data were curated based on prior nomenclature and marker genes. The code, single-cell data and underlying cluster associations are provided in a clear and transparently manner. The authors used standard bioinformatics tools (scanpy, signac, MAST, DPT, chromVar) and web-portal applications (cell browser) to perform their analyses. However, it is worth noting that the authors apply some customized combinations of existing pipelines to address problems. Careful consideration should be paid to when such integrative analyses have not been previously vetted, especially when existing published/benchmarked toolkits have been developed to specifically solve these challenges. In this case, for example, scanpy MNN was developed to correct for batch effects in scanpy clustering and the software cellHarmony for comparing perturbation datasets, finding differential expression patterns among matched single-cell clusters and pathway enrichment for those patterns. However, the custom workflows applied appear to be relatively straight forward and likely to produce consistent results.</p><p>Treatment with dmPGE2 gives rise to a novel cluster referred to as 'Acute activation' in the HSC. To qualify this as a derivative to the IER activation cluster (and similarly for the analogous Lsk cluster), the authors should perform reference-based classification to their unperturbed clusters. This is a more quantifiable method to assess the presence or absence of cell populations when a baseline is defined, assuming the perturbations do not impact core cell identity gene expression programs.</p><p>The authors note that LSK 'Progenitor' and 'Primed' populations were most like 'Quiescent' and 'Activated' in HSC, but &quot;similar&quot; is not qualified analytically (markers, reference-based classification, gene-set enrichment?).</p><p>Is HSC Replicate1 the only sample that was analyzed using 10X Genomics, 3' V2 and are all others were V3? Is this the main reason that combat was needed?</p><p>Was MAST performed comparing 10x version 2 and 10x version 3 captures? This would not be recommended even with combat adjustment, especially since the authors have 10x version 3 data for all captures but not 10x version 2. If the authors are able to replicate their findings with the just the 10x version 3, then the results could be considered higher confidence.</p><p>The authors mention CITE-Seq which implies the use of ADT conjugated antibodies. The reviewer can only find HTO conjugated antibodies to separate rare MPP populations within the same capture (a cost saving method). Moreover, the authors make note that the hashing worked in a prime figure panel (clearly this is a supplementary figure panel). The authors run the risk of conflating cell hashing with informative cell surface antigen detection to the reader. Hence, the term hashing should be used instead of CITE-Seq.</p><p>The analysis of the scATAC seq is extremely limited, and hence the value of the inferred regulators needs to be moderated in the text.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;External signals regulate continuous transcriptional states in hematopoietic stem cells&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Without this, it is hard to evaluate the potential contribution to the field of the current manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, a unified heatmap showing differentials of both clusters and treatments is now added to Figure 1 for HSCs (Figure 1D) and a similar heatmap has been added to Figure 3 (Figure 3E) for LSK cells. We choose to display 4 representative genes for each cluster or treatment in an effort to increase readability of the figures. In addition, we have added a larger heatmap to Figure 1 —figure supplement 2I. To further identify unique or common gene signatures, we have included pairwise comparisons of the top 100 genes enriched in each cluster and following treatment for HSCs (Figure 1H) and LSKs (Figure 3F). All the underlying data is available via easily searchable source files (Supplementary file 4, 7-10). To compare our results to prior studies, we have expanded our over-representation analysis to more pathways (GO:BP and REACTOME) and have added 49 manually curated gene sets from literature search and the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) (Supplementary file 5 and 6). Based on these new and refined analyses, we describe the following main novel insights of HSC response to external stimulants.</p><p>– Our analysis showed that part of the gene signatures induced by dmPGE<sub>2</sub> or poly(I:C) matched previous reports. Selected G-CSF perturbed genes (<italic>Spi1, Myb, Nurp, ckit, Cd9</italic>) were consistent with previous knowledge. However, our G-CSF induced gene signature did not show enrichment with previous reports of G-CSF treated HSCs (both scRNA-Seq and bulk RNA-Seq), likely because of a difference in timing of treatment (2h vs 36h). Overall, our stimulant induced differentially expressed genes show some concordance to previous publications but also reveal new genes that may be specific for the short (2 hour) treatment.</p><p>– The new analysis comparing genes enriched in clusters and treatments highlighted a difference in transcriptional state and response between LSKs and HSCs. In contrast to LSKs, HSC baseline transcriptional heterogeneity is increasingly determined by different signaling gradients. This was evident by the large overlap of baseline cluster identity genes with stimulant induced genes (Figure 1H vs Figure 3F). Comparison of the total number of induced genes between HSCs and LSKs indicated further specificity of HSC response to external stimuli. We observed differences in preferred cell type for each stimulant (poly(I:C) – HSCs, G-CSF – LSKs) and magnitude of overall response (indomethacin – small changes).</p><p>– We discovered that HSC response to treatment with external stimulants is heterogeneous even within a given treatment – similar to our observation of fluent transcriptional states at baseline. The unified heatmap in Figure 1D for example illustrates that HSC clusters respond differently to poly(I:C). Even though all poly(I:C) treated HSC clusters show some induction of poly(I:C) target genes, response is most strong in the Interferon cluster. Our scATAC-seq analysis provides preliminary evidence that cell intrinsic chromatin heterogeneity at baseline may regulate responsiveness to external signals.</p><p>– Our data provides a rich resource for a number of additional analyses and replication studies that would have exceeded the space allocation of the current manuscript.</p><p>Examples of these analysis would be:</p><p>– Further identification of unique responses within clusters for each treatment (Analysis of cell cycle genes in dmPGE<sub>2</sub> treated LSK cells of dmPGE<sub>2</sub> which was removed from the updated manuscript in favor of streamlining discussion of HSC relevant results).</p><p>– Evaluation of genes that follow opposite directionality between HSCs and LSKs (IEGs in dmPGE<sub>2</sub>).</p><p>– Comparison of commonly and uniquely regulated genes between stimulants.</p><p>– Expansion of trajectory analyses within other treatments (Metabolism cluster – G-CSF).</p><p>– Effects of external stimulation on myeloid fate (myeloid cluster cells are predominantly from non-control cells).</p><p>– In depth analysis of sexual dimorphism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please revise the use of the term 'niche' throughout the manuscript as it is often misleading. The HSC niche is not analysed, and the signals used are stressors administered pharmacologically for as short as two hours. Much better clarity is needed when referring to niche-mediated vs. cell-autonomous responses.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers about the ambiguity of our previous terminology and have replaced ‘niche stimulation’ with ‘external stimulation’ or similar terminology wherever applicable throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Multiple figure panels are unclear – see specific comments from reviewers.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the multiple specific comments related to the presentation of our data. These questions helped us streamline and clarify the main conclusions of our work. We have taken the following specific actions and substantially reorganized our manuscript.</p><p>– We have switched the order of the figures so that Figure 1 and 2 only discuss HSCs and Figure 3 and 4 contain the comparative analysis of LSKs versus HSCs. To better communicate this layout to the reader we have updated the experimental schematic in Figure 1A indicating which Figure contain which cell type.</p><p>– We have improved terminology to increase clarity. For example, to further clarify which clusters belong to HSCs and which clusters belong to LSKs we have added a cell type specific prefix ‘LSK-’ to all LSK clusters. We have renamed the MPP (LSK, CD48-, CD150-) population into MPP0 to avoid confusion between all MPPs and this particular subset.</p><p>– We have reorganized Figure 3 (LSKs) so that the layout is similar to Figure 1 (HSCs). That way the reader should more easily be able to compare and contrast stimuli responses in HSCs versus LSKs.</p><p>– We have substantially revised the text to improve readability.</p><p>– Following two reviewers’ comments we have simplified the ATAC-seq section and moderated our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The rationale for the choice of stressors is unclear. Please explain it in the introduction.</p></disp-quote><p>In the updated manuscript we have included the following sentence outlining the rationale for our stimulants in the main text:</p><p>‘To encompass a wide variety of different transcriptional responses, we evaluated three different signaling pathways: an inflammatory pathway through stimulation or inhibition of prostaglandins by dmPGE<sub>2</sub> and indomethacin, a host-defense immune signaling pathway mediated by activating of TLR and interferon signaling with poly(I:C), and a cellular mobilization pathway stimulated by the growth factor G-CSF.’</p><p>We have further added a paragraph to the discussion explaining the rationale for using pharmacological perturbations of the niche and potential drawbacks of our study.</p><p>‘We evaluated the effect of three complementary signaling pathways (G-CSF, Prostaglandin and Interferon) on the transcriptional state of HSCs. Pharmacological perturbation of these signaling pathways allowed to tightly control critical experimental parameters (e.g. genetic background of mice, timing of sample processing) that mitigated potential confounders of the downstream analysis. With the exception of indomethacin, we chose a short treatment window of two hours to increase the likelihood of studying direct downstream effects of stimulants on HSCs. Analysis of DEGs within clusters indicated interferon- versus toll-like receptor response genes induced by poly(I:C) treatment. While we could not detect interferon ligands in our scRNA-Seq data of HSCs or MPPs, it is possible that some of the interferon-response genes were induced indirectly by release of IFN ligands from the niche. An interferon inducer similar to poly(I:C) has been previously shown to increased IFN-α protein levels in the serum as early as 2 hours post in vivo injection (Linehan et al., 2018). Future work using genetic models is needed to further dissect indirect versus direct effects of external stimulants on HSCs.‘</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>It is at odds with all literature that the LKS SLAM CD135- CD34- HSCs are pretty much all in G1, especially when for example 15% of MPP3/4 are in G0.

Although we were not able to determine the ultimate cause of the discrepancy of our cell-cycle results and previously published work, we suspect a technical artifact during preparation of our samples (ki67 antibody concentration). We therefore decided to remove the cell cycle experiment from the updated manuscript. We added further evidence showing pathway enrichment of Quiescent HSCs (Supplementary file 6). Together with our LDTA data we believe that we provide sufficient data demonstrating that our purified HSCs adequately match previously reported ones.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Supp figure 1.

Since each condition (stacked barplot) represents a pooled sort of 5 mice we were not able to calculate variability of cell proportions between individual mice.

To further analyze gene sets enriched in our clusters and clear up any ambiguities we have modified Figure 2E and instead produced supplementary file 6 that contains a more comprehensive pathway enrichment analysis. In addition to REACTOME and GO:BP pathways we also evaluate enrichment of gene sets specific to HSCs which were previously linked to a cycling status (Cabezas-Wallscheid et al., 2017) or functional potential (Rodriguez-Fraticelli et al., 2020). Using this more refined methodology we were able to verify that the names we assigned to our clusters (e.g. ‘Quiescent’, ‘Metabolism’) do indeed match previously reported HSC signatures and unambiguously identify different groups. Our updated pathway and gene set enrichment procedure is explained in detail in the Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 163 – 163 contradicts the previous section which was largely presented as an analysis of LSK cells, not of HSCs.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated the figures, section headings and cluster names to clarify which cell type is being discussed in which section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2.

Furthermore, we have classified genes into being regulated exclusively in HSCs and LSKs or being induced/downregulated in both cell types. Relatively speaking there is a higher proportion of unique genes changed by indo in HSCs (1.2 fold cut-off: 100% HSCs) and conversely in LSKs by G-CSF (1.2 fold cut-off: 68% LSKs). However, when comparing the absolute number of genes perturbed G-CSF and indo, G-CSF still changes more genes in HSCs than indo (51 vs 21). Indomethacin overall induces very minor changes in gene expression (Figure 4 and Figure 4 Source Table 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3F.

LSK control cells were composed of the four main clusters Primitive, Primed, Metabolism and Cell-cycle. We were only able to detect 75 myeloid cells overall (including all external pertubations). The control condition only contained two myeloid cells. We therefore left myeloid cells out from Figure 4F. The three clusters Interferon, Interferon Cell-cycle and Acute-Activation did only exist in the treated conditions and therefore these clusters were not considered for receptor expression at baseline. We have included language in the legend that explains that only clusters with more than 20 cells are shown.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5.

Upon poly(I:C) treatment the proportion of cells within the ‘Interferon’ cluster increases from 1% to 42%. In contrast no ‘Acute activation’ cluster exists at baseline. We therefore concluded that dmPGE<sub>2</sub> treatment led to the formation of a novel transcriptional state.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In 2A why rename the &quot;quiescent&quot; cluster as &quot;progenitor&quot; – it is rather misleading because you are taking a gene set enriched for quiescence and calling it progenitor rather than just describing the phenotype.

For example, 86 genes out of the top 100 genes were shared between the ‘Interferon’ clusters in HSCs and LSKs (Figure 3A). For other clusters we observed a lower similarity and often not a one-to-one match. The LSK Progenitor cluster actually shared genes with both the HSC ‘Activated’ and the HSC ‘Quiescent’ cluster.

G-CSF exerts well-known effects on HSCs with induction of cell cycle (Schuettpelz 2014) – why is this not evident transcriptionally in the data? This should at minimum be addressed in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We deliberately chose to assess transcriptional changes very early (2 hours) after G-CSF treatment to observe transcriptional response directly downstream of the stimulant. To address the earlier question about known versus novel transcriptional regulation of the different stimulants (see above) we performed enrichment tests with curated gene sets including the one from Schuettpelz, et al. 2014. We did not see a statistically significant overlap of our G-CSF induced gene expression signature and the one from Schuettpelz (Supplementary file 5 and 6). A likely explanation is that the G-CSF gene expression program significantly changes between 2h and 36h post treatment. Our data shows that G-CSF activates a metabolism program that likely results in increased cycling activity. Indeed, in our heatmap of all G-CSF differentially expressed genes (Figure 1 —figure supplement 4B) the ‘Metabolism’ cluster of G-CSF treated cells groups together with the Cell-cycle cluster.</p><p>We have updated the following text in the results:</p><p>‘However, our G-CSF induced gene set did not show any significant enrichment (Supplementary file 5 and 6) with various previously reported G-CSF signatures (Schuettpelz et al., 2014, Pedersen et al., 2016, Giladi et al., 2018, Mervosh et al., 2018) likely due to different timing of G-CSF treatment.’</p><p>and</p><p>‘Hierarchical clustering suggested that G-CSF treatment drove the expression profile of the HSC ‘Metabolism’ cluster closer towards the ‘Cell cycle’ state (Figure 1—figure supplement 4B).’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Further description and clarification are needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have chosen to take this analysis out of our update manuscript.

It is interesting that the interferon cluster can be distinguished from the TLR cluster, but what is more interesting is to understand whether some of the interferon signature genes induced in the other clusters e.g. quiescent, activated, metabolism are due to indirect signaling by IFN to these cells as opposed to direct TLR3 engagement by PIPC. This should be included in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the reviewers’ suggestion we have included a new paragraph in the discussion about timing of perturbation and evaluating indirect versus direct signaling with IFN and TLR3 as an example.

Pharmacological perturbation of these signaling pathways allowed to tightly control critical experimental parameters (e.g. genetic background of mice, timing of sample processing) that mitigated potential confounders of the downstream analysis. With the exception of indomethacin, we chose a short treatment window of two hours to increase the likelihood of studying direct downstream effects of stimulants on HSCs. Analysis of DEGs within clusters indicated interferon- versus toll-like receptor response genes induced by poly(I:C) treatment. While we could not detect interferon ligands in our scRNA-Seq data of HSCs or MPPs, it is possible that some of the interferon-response genes were induced indirectly by release of IFN ligands from the niche. An interferon inducer similar to poly(I:C) has been previously shown to increased IFN-α protein levels in the serum as early as 2 hours post in vivo injection (Linehan et al., 2018).

Here the authors exploit their considerable facility with HSC isolation and apply single-cell genomics to provide a profile of both normal HSC transcriptional clusters and HSC relevant perturbations (di-methyl-PGE2 vs. the Cox1/2 inhibitor indomethacin, and G-CSF stimulating mobilization, or the TLR3 ligand poly(I:C)) and identify potential underlying regulatory transcription factors based on in silico analyses. They note that they can understand the perturbations as shifts in cells within the unperturbed clusters (with modest gene expression changes in each cluster). There are some aspects of the work that could be changed to improve impact and to clarify the take-home message.</p><p>The manuscript leaves the reader with the expectation that the work will biologically dissect the normal and perturbed cluster/populations. This is probably because the authors do not adequately clarify the biological impact of the manipulations, the depth of the published record on them, and then convey the expected versus observed transcriptional changes based on that prior published record. In addition, the transcriptional changes in each cluster within the heatmaps relegated to supplementary data probably provide the essential information, but they fail to represent the data across all clusters with all differentially expressed genes to demonstrate common or distinct gene expression changes. This would best be consolidated to a heatmap of differentials instead of the current method of clustering the actual expression metric. To be clear, it would significantly improve the work to show all differentially expressed genes in each HSC cluster across all perturbed clusters in a single heatmap. A viewer other than a genome browser session (which is not easily maintained) would be an essential improvement.</p><p>The central claim is that &quot;niche signals regulate continuous transcriptional states in hematopoietic stem cells&quot;. As an experimental paradigm, the authors inject mice with different molecules and then purify HSC two hours later to examine changes in gene expression. This experimental paradigm does not represent specific perturbations of niche signaling.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the critical and constructive feedback of our manuscript. We further value the assessment that ‘understanding the molecular determinants controlling hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) biology is critical for myriad clinically-relevant interventions’ which was one of the driving forces for us to undertake this investigation. We have substantially reorganized our manuscript and added additional analysis responding to the concerns raised by the reviewer.</p><p>Specifically, we have compared our stimulant induced gene signatures to prior publications to provide additional context for our results in light of previous findings. As suggested, we have compiled a unified heatmap (Figure 1D) showing differentially expressed genes between clusters and treatments, which provided additional insights into the crosstalk between cluster defining and treatment induced genes. We have chosen to only display selected genes as opposed to all differentially expressed genes in the main Figure, to increase readability and allow easy referencing from the main text. We have added a heatmap encompassing a larger number of genes to Figure 1 —figure supplement 2I. In addition, we have added visualizations of pairwise comparisons of cluster-defining and stimulant-induced genes (Figure 1H and 3F). Source tables contain the complete set of differentially regulated genes for treatments and clusters.</p><p>We have deliberately chosen not to add another interactive visualization application to this manuscript. Currently our data is hosted externally for interactive exploration on the UCSC Cell Browser website (https://cells.ucsc.edu/) which provides a free resource for scientists to make their single-cell datasets available (378 single-cell datasets – July 2021). In addition, we plan to make all source datasets (such as differential expression analyses, cluster enrichments, cluster-treatment overlaps) available in a tabular format that ensures both persistence into the future as well as easy data accessibility for non-computational biologists.</p><p>We agree that the original terminology of ‘niche stimulants regulating HSC transcriptional states’ was not fully accurate. We have revised this terminology throughout the manuscript to ‘external stimulation’ or equivalent wording. While our pharmacological perturbations certainly have limitations (discussed in detail below and in the discussion) we do believe that our results provide novel findings about HSC response to external stressors and the relationship to baseline transcriptional heterogeneity. Because of the cost and time required of single cell genomics studies we believe that our work serves as an important starting ground for more fine-tuned investigations of the niche-HSC interaction using genetic models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As shown by the Morrison, Frenette, and Link laboratories, the same cytokine has different effects on HSC behavior depending on its cellular source. For example, CXCL12 from osteoblasts does not regulate HSC but CXCL12 produced by perivascular cells is essential for HSC maintenance (Nature. 2013 Mar 14; 495(7440): 231-235). It is unclear to this reviewer how super physiological doses of G-CSF, pIpC -which is an artificial analog of dsRNA and never found in normal mice-, or stabilized PGE2 represent physiological perturbations of niche signals. Moreover, the molecules used do not only target HSC but also affect production of cytokines by niche cells. For example, G-CSF results in CXCL12 downregulation in the niche (Leukemia. 2011 Feb;25(2):211-7) whereas pIpC displaces HSC from bone marrow niches (Cell Rep. 2020 Dec 22;33(12):108530). If the authors wish to claim that niche signals regulate transitions between transcriptional states in HSC then they should repeat their analyses in mouse chimeras containing both WT and receptor KO HSC (e.g. WT and IFNγ-/- mice). These will control for cell autonomous vs non-cell autonomous effects before and after G-CSF, pIpC and dmPGE2 injection.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the author that the original terminology of ‘niche stimulation’ was not fully accurate. Even though we did deliberately choose a short treatment regimen (2 hours) to assess likely direct effects of our perturbations on HSCs we cannot rule out that some of our transcriptional responses are induced indirectly through other cells. While we agree that the reviewer’s proposed experiment with receptor knockouts are best to resolve cell autonomous versus non-cell autonomous effects, we think these investigations are beyond the scope of this manuscript. We do believe there is value in reporting transcriptional changes with our chosen external perturbations since they are also widely used in experimental protocols to induce HSC mobilization (G-CSF) or transgene induction (pol(I:C) – mx-cre). Because reviewer #2 expressed a similar concern about direct vs indirect signaling we have updated the discussion with the following paragraph:</p><p>‘We evaluated the effect of three complementary signaling pathways (G-CSF, Prostaglandin and Interferon) on the transcriptional state of HSCs. Pharmacological perturbation of these signaling pathways allowed to tightly control critical experimental parameters (e.g. genetic background of mice, timing of sample processing) that mitigated potential confounders of the downstream analysis.

Including orally dosed indomethacin (through the drinking water) in our original experimental design addressed that same concern. We have included a section in the discussion on the tradeoffs between analyzing physiological perturbations with potentially small effect sizes versus strong external stimulants that lead to more robust experimental results.</p><p>‘There is a trade-off between the strength of a perturbation required for experimental robustness versus studying signals that are more physiologically relevant but lead to more subtle changes within and between cells. Here, we evaluated response of HSCs to three different external activators mimicking niche signals that were dosed 2-4 orders of magnitude higher than what an animal would ever encounter during actual injury or infection (Eyles et al., 2008, Porter et al., 2013, Hoggatt et al., 2013, Sheehan et al., 2015). To assess niche-derived signals in a more physiological setting, we administered the Cox1/2 inhibitor indomethacin orally for one week to deplete endogenous prostaglandins. As expected, the changes in gene expression with indomethacin were much weaker than those observed after acute injection with dmPGE<sub>2</sub>, G-CSF, and poly(I:C). ScRNA-Seq analysis offers unique tools to evaluate gene expression changes in response to weak perturbations. Pseudotime analysis showed that depletion of endogenous prostaglandins using indomethacin led to a small but significant shift in the transcriptional state of HSCs.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Although HSC clusters were not distinguishable by unique markers, the authors defend a protocol to select optimal parameters that enrich for cell-population markers (non-exclusive) in the Leiden scanpy clusters, reasonably arguing that these represent continuous transitions (though they should acknowledge the limitation of the data sparsity, which might artificially enforce continuity).</p></disp-quote><p>Based on this reviewer’s and Reviewer #1s comments we have expanded and clarified our observation that HSC clusters represent marker gene enrichments but not exclusive expression (Figure 1C).

To qualify this as a derivative to the IER activation cluster (and similarly for the analogous Lsk cluster), the authors should perform reference-based classification to their unperturbed clusters.

Specifically we have included the following two approaches in the updated manuscript:</p><p>1. As in the original version of the manuscript we have compared the top 100 genes enriched in HSC and LSK clusters. In the updated manuscript we have included this comparison in the main figures (Figure 3A) to increase visibility and performed formal enrichment tests of the pairwise cluster comparison (hypergeometric test). We have deliberately chosen a fixed number of top genes (100) for each cluster as opposed to a fold-change cut-off to allow comparisons of the number of common genes between individual pairwise overlaps.</p><p>2. We have calculated ‘scores’ from top genes enriched in each cluster (see Methods) an analysis that was also used to demonstrate gradual changes in transcriptional identity (Figure 1C). To compare similarity of clusters we compared mean scores between all clusters. For example, we calculated the mean ‘Activated’ score for HSCs in all clusters and found that the ‘Acute-Activation’ cluster had the highest mean score besides the ‘Activated’ cluster itself (Figure 1 —figure supplement 2G). Since any gene set can be used to calculate a score, we have used genes enriched in the HSC ‘Quiescent’ cluster to calculate scores in the LSK population. This analysis was used to qualify the statement that the ‘LSK-Primed’ and ‘LSK-Primitive’ (former ‘LSK-Progenitor’) cluster are most similar to the HSC ‘Quiescent cluster (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1H). We have also calculated an HSC ‘Activated’ score in the LSK cluster. Actually the ‘Acute activation’ and ‘Progenitor’ cluster had the highest HSC ‘Activated’ score and not the ‘Primed’ cluster (results available on GitHub). We therefore removed similarity of ‘Primed’ ‘Progenitor’ with the HSC ‘Activated’ cluster from the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is HSC Replicate1 the only sample that was analyzed using 10X Genomics, 3' V2 and are all others were V3?

HSC Replicate1 was not combined with any V3 dataset and only analyzed separately, shown in the following Figures (Figure 1 –supplement 2A-D and Figure 1- supplement 3B). Batch correction was required because a similar set of transcriptional clusters (‘Quiescent’, ‘Activated’, ‘Metabolism’, etc) were detected in separate analysis of control, indo and G-CSF samples but not when they were combined without batch correction. Batch correction was only used for dimensionality reduction and clustering, for all differential gene expression analyses (of cluster markers and treatment induced) we used the raw, non-batch corrected counts.

While cluster enrichment of AP-1 and ISREs was not unique to HSCs we observed a specific occurrence of AP-1 and HSC lineage-specific master factors suggestive of a HSC unique chromatin architecture.’</p><p>Discussion</p><p>‘Interestingly, we observed heterogeneity of HSC responses to external stimuli which may be determined by the baseline transcriptional and epigenetic state supported by our single cell chromatin studies. Preliminary findings suggested an HSC specific co-occurrence of signaling and lineage-specific transcription factor motif activities that is consistent with previous observations in human hematopoietic progenitors (Trompouki et al., 2011, Choudhuri et al., 2020). Overall, our data indicates that the single cell landscape of in vivo derived, functional HSCs is likely made up of a unique chromatin architecture with fluent transcriptional states, some of which can be rapidly influenced by external signals.’</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>The reviewers have agreed on a few sentences that would benefit from further clarification or some edits.
