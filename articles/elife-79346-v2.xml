which affect protein <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation. The yeast gene <italic>SEC53</italic> encodes a homolog of human <italic>PMM2</italic>. We evolved 384 populations of yeast harboring one of two human-disease-associated alleles, <italic>sec53-</italic>V238M and <italic>sec53</italic>-F126L, or wild-type <italic>SEC53</italic>. We find that after 1000 generations, most populations compensate for the slow-growth phenotype associated with the <italic>sec53</italic> human-disease-associated alleles. Through whole-genome sequencing we identify compensatory mutations, including known <italic>SEC53</italic> genetic interactors. We observe an enrichment of compensatory mutations in other genes whose human homologs are associated with Type 1 CDG, including <italic>PGM1</italic>, which encodes the minor isoform of phosphoglucomutase in yeast. By genetic reconstruction, we show that evolved <italic>pgm1</italic> mutations are dominant and allele-specific genetic interactors that restore both protein glycosylation and growth of yeast harboring the <italic>sec53</italic>-V238M allele. Finally, we characterize the enzymatic activity of purified Pgm1 mutant proteins. We find that reduction, but not elimination, of Pgm1 activity best compensates for the deleterious phenotypes associated with the <italic>sec53</italic>-V238M allele. Broadly, our results demonstrate the power of experimental evolution as a tool for identifying genes and pathways that compensate for human-disease-associated alleles.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>experimental evolution</kwd><kwd>humanized yeast</kwd><kwd>congenital disorders of glycosylation</kwd><kwd>PMM2-CDG</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM127420</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lang</surname><given-names>Gregory I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P20GM139769</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Steet</surname><given-names>Richard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Experimental evolution of yeast models of congenital disorders of glycosylation reveals that reduction, but not loss, of phosphoglucomutase activity best compensates for impaired phosphomannomutase activity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein glycosylation is an important cotranslational and posttranslational modification involving the attachment of glycans to polypeptides. These glycans play vital roles in protein folding, stability, activity, and transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Varki, 2017</xref>). Glycosylation is one of the most abundant protein modifications, with evidence indicating that over 50% of human proteins are glycosylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Roth et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wong, 2005</xref>). Despite this, we lack a global understanding of the complex pathologies involving protein glycosylation.</p><p>Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are a group of inherited metabolic disorders arising from defects in the protein glycosylation pathway, including <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation, <italic>O</italic>-linked glycosylation, and lipid/glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chang et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>N</italic>-linked CDG are further categorized into two groups based on the affected process: synthesis and transfer of glycans (Type 1) or processing of protein-bound glycans (Type 2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aebi et al., 1999</xref>). Mutations in the human phosphomannomutase 2 gene (<italic>PMM2</italic>) cause Type 1 CDG and are the most common cause of CDG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ferreira et al., 2018</xref>). PMM2 forms a homodimer and catalyzes the interconversion of mannose-6-phosphate and mannose-1-phosphate (M1P) (EC 5.4.2.8). M1P is then converted to GDP-mannose, a required substrate for <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation glycosyltransferases.</p><p>Two of the most common pathogenic <italic>PMM2</italic> variants found in humans are p.Val231Met and p.Phe119Leu. The V231M protein is less stable and exhibits defects in protein folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Citro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Silvaggi et al., 2006</xref>), whereas the F119L protein is stable but exhibits dimerization defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andreotti et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kjaergaard et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pirard et al., 1999</xref>). The budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> contains a homologous phosphomannomutase enzyme encoded by the gene <italic>SEC53. SEC53</italic> is essential in yeast and expression of human <italic>PMM2</italic> rescues lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hansen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lao et al., 2019</xref>). Previously, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lao et al., 2019</xref> constructed strains harboring the yeast-equivalent mutations of the most common human-disease-associated <italic>PMM2</italic> alleles including V231M (<italic>sec53</italic>-V238M) and F119L (<italic>sec53</italic>-F126L).</p><p>Using experimental evolution, we sought to identify compensatory mutations able to overcome glycosylation deficiency. Previous studies have used experimental evolution of compromised organisms, to study evolutionary outcomes and identify compensatory mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Harcombe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Helsen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Laan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Michel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Moser et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Szamecz et al., 2014</xref>). Experimental evolution allows for a more robust approach than traditional suppressor screens, enabling the identification of weak suppressors and compensatory interactions between multiple mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cooper, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">LaBar et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Here, we present a 1000-generation evolution experiment of yeast models of PMM2-CDG. We evolved 96 populations of yeast with wild-type <italic>SEC53</italic>, 192 populations with the <italic>sec53</italic>-V238M allele, and 96 populations with the <italic>sec53</italic>-F126L allele for 1000 generations. We sequenced 188 evolved clones to identify mutations that arose specifically in the populations harboring the <italic>sec53</italic> human-disease-associated alleles. We find an overrepresentation of mutations in genes whose human homologs are other Type 1 CDG genes, including <italic>PGM1</italic> (the minor isoform of phosphoglucomutase), the most commonly mutated gene in our experiment. We show that evolved mutations in <italic>PGM1</italic> restore protein <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation and alleviate the slow-growth phenotype caused by the <italic>sec53</italic>-V238M disease-associated allele.

We evolved 96 haploid populations of each mutant <italic>sec53</italic> genotype (p<italic>SEC53-sec53</italic>-V238M, p<italic>ACT1-sec53-</italic>V238M, and p<italic>ACT1-sec53-</italic>F126L) and 48 haploid populations of each wild-type <italic>SEC53</italic> genotype (p<italic>SEC53-SEC53</italic>-WT and p<italic>ACT1-SEC53</italic>-WT) for 1000 generations in rich glucose medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Strains with the p<italic>SEC53-sec53</italic>-F126L allele grew too slowly to keep up with a 1:2<sup>10</sup> dilution every 24 hr. Every 50 generations we measured culture density (single time-point OD<sub>600</sub>) for each population as a proxy for growth rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Populations with the p<italic>ACT1-sec53-</italic>V238M allele show a range of dynamics, with some populations reaching maximum saturation (OD<sub>600</sub> ≈ 1.0) early in the experiment, while some do not even by Generation 1000 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Three p<italic>ACT1-sec53-</italic>V238M populations went extinct before Generation 200. While saturation levels of p<italic>ACT1-sec53-</italic>F126L populations also increased over the course of the evolution experiment, none reached an OD<sub>600</sub> close to 1.0, indicating that these populations are likely less-fit than the evolved p<italic>ACT1-sec53-</italic>V238M populations. Each p<italic>SEC53-sec53</italic>-V238M population started the evolution experiment with growth rates comparable to <italic>SEC53</italic>-WT populations, indicating compensatory mutation(s) likely arose in the starting inocula (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We therefore exclude these populations from subsequent analyses. Together, our data show that the PMM2-CDG yeast models acquired compensatory mutations throughout the evolution experiment and that the extent of compensation depends on the specific disease-associated allele.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Putative compensatory mutations are enriched for other Type 1 CDG-associated homologs</title><p>To identify the compensatory mutations in our evolved populations, we sequenced single clones from 188 populations isolated at Generation 1000 to an average sequencing depth of ~50×.

This indicates that the number of compensatory mutations and/or the ameliorative effects of compensatory mutations are greater for the p<italic>ACT1-sec53</italic>-V238M allele compared to the p<italic>ACT1-sec53</italic>-F126L allele. Our sequencing and reconstruction experiments show that both explanations are true.

We find an overrepresentation of mutations in Type 1 CDG homologs in the evolved p<italic>ACT1-sec53</italic>-V238M populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This enrichment is striking considering that we observe a significant depletion of mutations in these same genes aggregated across evolution experiments with wild-type <italic>SEC53</italic>, which suggests that they are normally under purifying selection. Specifically, we find five mutations in <italic>PGM1</italic>, two in <italic>ALG9</italic>, and one in <italic>ALG12</italic>. In addition, one <italic>ALG7</italic> mutation was identified in a single p<italic>ACT1-sec53</italic>-F126L population.

This suggests that prodding steps in <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation alleviates the deleterious effect of <italic>sec53</italic> disease-associated alleles, perhaps by altering pathway flux to match lowered M1P availability. Evidence from human studies supports the idea of downstream genetic modifiers affecting PMM2-CDG phenotypes. For example, there is not a direct correlation between clinical phenotypes and biochemical properties of PMM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Citro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Freeze and Westphal, 2001</xref>).

Given that most of the evolved clones containing <italic>pgm1</italic> mutations are more fit than the reconstructed strains, it is possible that other evolved mutations interact epistatically only with non-LOF <italic>pgm1</italic> mutations. However, there are no shared mutational targets (genes or pathways) among the evolved clones with <italic>pgm1</italic> mutations and only one evolved <italic>pgm1</italic> clone contains a mutation in a known <italic>PGM1</italic> interactor (<italic>FRA1</italic>). These suggest any putative genetic interactions with our evolved <italic>pgm1</italic> mutations are allele specific.</p><p>Using tetrad dissections, we show that each evolved <italic>pgm1</italic> mutation and the catalytically dead <italic>pgm1</italic>-S120A mutation are dominant suppressors of <italic>sec53</italic>-V238M. <italic>pgm1</italic>Δ is not a dominant suppressor based on the tetrad analyses, contrary to the fitness assays where the heterozygous <italic>pgm1</italic>Δ allele confers a fitness benefit comparable to several evolved mutations. This discrepancy likely results from differences in ploidy or growth medium of the two experiments—diploids in liquid culture versus haploids on agar plates. We also find that several <italic>pgm1</italic> mutations (T521K, D295N, <italic>pgm1</italic>Δ, and S120A) are recessive suppressors of the <italic>sec53</italic>-F126L allele in the tetrad dissections, whereas we were unable to detect any improvement using fitness assays. Three of these four mutations have no detectable enzymatic activity. However, the R64C allele, which also does not have detectable enzymatic activity does not suppress.</p><p>To test specific hypotheses for the mechanism of suppression of <italic>sec53</italic> disease alleles by mutation of <italic>pgm1</italic>, we characterized the biochemical properties of purified recombinant Pgm1 mutant proteins. We find that phosphoglucomutase activity ranges from non-detectable activity (R64C and D295N) to near wild-type (T231). Based on well-characterized human and rabbit PGM1 structures, R64C and D295N mutations likely affect active-site integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Liu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Stiers et al., 2016</xref>). R64 helps hold the catalytic serine (S120) in place and D295 coordinates a catalytically essential Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion. The T231A mutation, which occurs in a residue near the metal-binding loop, shows the highest activity levels among our mutant Pgm1 enzymes. The other two mutations with low but detectable activity, G514C and T521K, both occur in the phosphate-binding domain of Pgm1, a region important for substrate binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beamer, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stiers et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Stiers et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stiers and Beamer, 2018</xref>). Comparing <italic>pgm1</italic> fitness effects versus their corresponding enzyme <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> we find an inverted U-shaped curve, where reducing phosphoglucomutase activity improves fitness, but complete loss of activity overshoots the optimum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Plotting fitness versus <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> results in a qualitatively similar trend, although comparing <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> between mutant enzymes may not be appropriate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eisenthal et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>We tested several hypotheses involving Pgm1 alteration-of-function. First, the evolved Pgm1 proteins could directly complement the loss of Sec53 phosphomannomutase activity by switching epimer specificity from glucose to mannose. However, we do not observe increased phosphomannomutase activity in the Pgm1 mutant proteins, nor is this hypothesis consistent with our genetic data: direct complementation would be expected to suppress both the <italic>sec53</italic>-V238M and <italic>sec53</italic>-F126L alleles.</p><p>A second possible mechanism of suppression is increasing the production of G16P. G16P is an endogenous activator and stabilizer of Pmm2 (Sec53). Compounds that raise G16P levels by increasing its production and/or slowing its degradation show promise as candidates for treatment of PMM2-CDG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Iyer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Monticelli et al., 2019</xref>). Whereas higher eukaryotes and some bacteria have a dedicated G16P synthase, in yeast G16P is produced as a dissociated intermediate of the phosphoglucomutase reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Maliekal et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Neumann et al., 2021</xref>). We hypothesized that evolved mutations in <italic>PGM1</italic> may increase the rate of G16P dissociation. Recent work has shown that a mutation affecting Mg<sup>2+</sup> coordination in <italic>L. lactis</italic> β-phosphoglucomutase can increase dissociation of β-G16P in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wood et al., 2021</xref>). While we did not directly measure G16P synthase activity of Pgm1, we find that intracellular levels of G16P are increased in strains with <italic>pgm1</italic>-T521K or <italic>pgm1</italic>-D295N. We cannot, however, determine if the observed increase in G16P is sufficient to rescue glycosylation. There may be other metabolic changes caused by the <italic>pgm1</italic> mutations that impact Sec53 activity and glycosylation.</p><p>A third possible mechanism of compensation is the indirect increase of G16P by increasing the relative flux of the reverse (G6P to G1P) reaction relative to the forward (G1P to G6P) reaction. This would create a futile cycle of G1P/G6P interconversion, which is expected to result in higher intracellular G16P. This hypothesis is attractive in that it accounts for three observations regarding the evolved <italic>pgm1</italic> mutations: (1) the observation of only missense (not nonsense or frameshift) mutations in the evolution experiment, (2) the dominance of suppressors in our genetic assay, and (3) greater extent of suppression for the stability mutant (V238M) of <italic>SEC53</italic>. Nevertheless, the observation that complete loss of Pgm1 enzymatic activity improves growth of <italic>sec53</italic> mutants suggests that there are multiple mechanisms of suppression through <italic>PGM1</italic>.</p><p>There is truth to the saying that ‘a selection is worth a thousand screens’. Experimental evolution takes what would otherwise be a screen—looking for larger colonies on a field of smaller ones—and turns it into a selection. Here, we demonstrate the power of yeast experimental evolution to identify genetic mechanisms that compensate for the molecular defects of PMM2-CDG disease-associated alleles. This general approach is applicable to other human disease alleles that affect core and conserved biological processes including protein glycosylation, ribosome maturation, mitochondrial function, and RNA modification. Mutations that impinge upon these processes are often highly pleiotropic. In humans, salient phenotypes may be neurological or developmental, but in yeast, these disease alleles invariably lead to slow growth. With a population size of 10<sup>5</sup>, evolution can act on differences as small as 0.001%, far below the ability to resolve on plates. Even our best fluorescence-based assays can only resolve differences of ~0.1% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lang and Botstein, 2011</xref>). With a genome size of 10<sup>7</sup> bp, a mutation rate of 10<sup>−10</sup> per bp per generation, and with continuous selective pressure exerted over thousands of generations, each population will sample hundreds of thousands of coding-sequence mutations. Over longer time scales, experimental evolution can be used to identify rare suppressor mutations, suppressor mutations with modest fitness effects, and/or complex compensatory interactions involving multiple mutations, which are largely absent from current genetic interaction networks.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pTC416-SEC53</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lao et al., 2019</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Wild-type SEC53 plasmid (CEN-ARS)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Plasmid map: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bit.ly/3nBYllD">https://bit.ly/3nBYllD</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pML104-NatMx3</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Addgene (83477)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cas9 plasmid</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Modified plasmids available upon request</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pAG25</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Addgene (35121)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Integrating plasmid</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Modified plasmids available upon request</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pGEX-2T</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cytiva Life Sciences (28954653)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Bacterial expression plasmid</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Modified plasmids available upon request</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">anti-carboxypeptidase rabbit polyclonal antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Abcam (ab181691)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">anti-rabbit IgG HRP-conjugated mouse monoclonal antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell Signaling Technologies (5127)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">(1:2000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">anti-invertase goat polyclonal antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Novus Biologicals (NB120-20597)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">anti-goat IgG HRP-conjugated mouse monoclonal antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Rockland Immunochemicals (18-8814-33)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">(1:2000)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental evolution</title><p>The haploid strains used in the evolution experiment are S288c derivatives and were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lao et al., 2019</xref>).

All the samples contained 10% <sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O for internal lock.</p><p>Similarly, forward (G1P to G6P) and reverse (G6P to G1P) phosphoglucomutase activities were measured following the same procedure described above, with 1 mM G1P or G6P as the substrate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Quantification of G16P abundance</title><p>Yeast metabolite extraction was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gonzalez et al., 1997</xref>). Briefly, five replicate cultures per genotype were grown in 5 ml YPD plus 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml tetracycline at 30°C. 10<sup>7</sup> cells of mid-log culture were collected on nylon filters, washed with 10 ml cold PBS, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and lyophilized. Cells were then treated with an ice-cold solution containing 14% HClO<sub>4</sub> and 91 mM imidazole, frozen and thawed five times (dry ice/acetone followed by 40°C bath) with vigorous shaking between each cycle, then centrifuged at 13,500 × <italic>g</italic> at 4°C. Supernatant was neutralized with 3 M K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> and centrifuged again at 13,500 × <italic>g</italic> at 4°C to eliminate salt precipitate.</p><p>G16P in the metabolite extracts was measured through stimulation of rabbit muscle phosphoglucomutase as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Veiga-da-Cunha et al., 2008</xref>). Phosphoglucomutase activity was assayed spectrophotometrically at 340 nm, in a mixture containing 87 mM Tris (pH 7.6), 5.6 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.11 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA), 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 0.048 mM NADP<sup>+</sup>, 0.48 mM G1P, 0.26 U/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, at 36°C. G1P had previously been purified from G16P through anionic exchange chromatography on AG1x8 Hydroxide Form column in step gradient of triethylammonium bicarbonate from 0.01 M to 1 M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Monticelli et al., 2019</xref>). Three technical replicates for each of the five biological replicates were assayed. 0.0–0.15 µM commercial G16P (Merck &amp; Co, Rahway, NJ, USA) was used as the standard.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>List of mutations that arose in the evolution experiment.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-79346-supp1-v2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Genotypes of strains used in this study.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-79346-supp2-v2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Loss-of-function (LOF)/non-LOF Bayesian analysis.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-79346-supp3-v2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-79346-mdarchecklist1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The short-read sequencing data reported in this study have been deposited to the NCBI BioProject database, accession number PRJNA784975.</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Vignogna</surname><given-names>RC</given-names></name><name><surname>Lang</surname><given-names>GI</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2022">2022</year><data-title>Experimentally-evolved <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> clones</data-title><source>NCBI BioProject</source><pub-id pub-id-type="accession" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA784975">PRJNA784975</pub-id></element-citation></p><p>The following previously published datasets were used:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="references" id="dataset2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>Lang, et al</collab></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2013">2013</year><data-title>The sequencing of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> strains</data-title><source>NCBI BioProject</source><pub-id pub-id-type="accession" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA205542">PRJNA205542</pub-id></element-citation></p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="references" id="dataset3"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>Fisher, et al</collab></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2018">2018</year><data-title>Evolved Autodiploid Clones</data-title><source>NCBI BioProject</source><pub-id pub-id-type="accession" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA422100">PRJNA422100</pub-id></element-citation></p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="references" id="dataset4"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>Johnson, et al</collab></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2021">2021</year><data-title>Evolved <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> population sequencing</data-title><source>NCBI BioProject</source><pub-id pub-id-type="accession" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA668346">PRJNA668346</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank members of the Andreotti Lab and members of the Lang Lab for comments on the manuscript.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Experimental evolution of phosphomannomutase-deficient yeast reveals compensatory mutations in a phosphoglucomutase&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Wenying Shou as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #3, and the evaluation has been overseen by George Perry as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Hudson H. Freeze (Reviewer #2);</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Please determine whether Sec53 and Pgm1 proteins directly interact in yeast and whether the mutations to study are on the interaction interface.</p><p>That the single-substitutions did not capture the fitness gains as much as the primary strains suggests genetic connections among the suppressors, and you should test the combinatorial impact of mutations. Over 90% of the yeast binary genetic interactions have been discovered. A simple computational screen using tools available at SGD could explore the possibility of rewiring the genetic interactions as a mode of action. Some of these combinations may be tested as well, but is not absolutely required.</p><p>EOP's observation that an aldose reductase inhibitor (epalrestat) has remarkable effects on a single patient and that the drug is now entering clinical trials is a real breakthrough. One of the observations is that Glc1,6P, a stabilizer of PMM2, is increased in PMM2 patient cells treated with the drug. Presumably, any way to do this would have a benefit. You discuss this, but the critical experiment is missing: measuring Glc1,6 P in the cells you study. Regardless of the results, it will be informative to perform this measurement, to learn whether pgm1 variants increase the steady state level of Glc1,6-bisphosphate. If they do, the level in itr2 mutants should be measured as well.</p><p>Figure 3 CPY gel should be rerun to prevent bands from nearly running off the gel.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Based on the data obtained between pACT1 and pSEC53-driven expression of the SEC53 mutant alleles, the pattern of suppressors appears to be different. Authors report that the variants expressed from strong pACT1 promoters show more suppressors than those driven by native promoters. Is this a general trend in experimental evolution that slower-growing strains tend to show lesser suppressors?</p><p>2. It isn't clear whether the strains used for evolution experiments harbor genomically encoded copies of variants or plasmid-borne copies (CEN or 2 micron)?</p><p>3. Authors use the term &quot;nearly-identical homolog&quot; twice in the article. The databases such as InParanoid show a clear orthology relationship. What does nearly-identical mean?

One of the observations is that Glc1,6P, a stabilizer of PMM2, is increased in PMM2 patient cells treated with the drug. Presumably, any way to do this would have a benefit. You discuss this, but the critical experiment is missing: measuring Glc1,6 P in the cells you study. Regardless of the results, it will be informative to perform this measurement, to learn whether pgm1 variants increase the steady state level of Glc1,6-bisphosphate.
