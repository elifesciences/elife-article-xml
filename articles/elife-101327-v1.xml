insight into the mechanisms of memory encoding, storage, and retrieval. However, few strategies exist for brain-wide mapping of multiple ensembles, including their overlapping population, and none incorporate capabilities for downstream network analysis. Here, we introduce a scalable workflow to analyze traditionally coronally sectioned datasets produced by activity-dependent tagging systems. Intrinsic to this pipeline is simple multi-ensemble atlas registration and statistical testing in R (SMARTTR), an R package which wraps mapping capabilities with functions for statistical analysis and network visualization, and support for import of external datasets. We demonstrate the versatility of SMARTTR by mapping the ensembles underlying the acquisition and expression of learned helplessness (LH), a robust stress model. Applying network analysis, we find that exposure to inescapable shock (IS), compared to context training, results in decreased centrality of regions engaged in spatial and contextual processing and higher influence of regions involved in somatosensory and affective processing. During LH expression, the substantia nigra emerges as a highly influential region that shows a functional reversal following IS, indicating a possible regulatory function of motor activity during helplessness. We also report that IS results in a robust decrease in reactivation activity across a number of cortical, hippocampal, and amygdalar regions, indicating suppression of ensemble reactivation may be a neurobiological signature of LH. These results highlight the emergent insights uniquely garnered by applying our analysis approach to multiple ensemble datasets and demonstrate the strength of our workflow as a hypothesis-generating toolkit.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>immediate early gene</kwd><kwd>engram</kwd><kwd>network</kwd><kwd>learned helplessness</kwd><kwd>mouse</kwd><kwd>activity mapping</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F30AG084312</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Michelle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM007367</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Michelle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HD101402</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Denny</surname><given-names>Christine Ann</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21AG064774</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Denny</surname><given-names>Christine Ann</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100018694</institution-id><institution>Marie Sklodowska Curie Action Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.3030/101107833</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Franceschini</surname><given-names>Alessandra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21NS114870</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Denny</surname><given-names>Christine Ann</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new scalable workflow for analyzing multiple ensemble datasets incorporates SMARTTR, an R package supporting network analysis, visualization, and the import of external datasets.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Immediate early genes (IEGs), such as <italic>Fos</italic> or <italic>Arc</italic>, are a class of genes that rapidly transcribe and express following recent neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hunt et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lyford et al., 1995</xref>). Peak IEG responses range from the scale of minutes for RNA expression to minutes and hours for protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guzowski et al., 2005</xref>). Because of its time-dependent nature, IEG expression has often been used as a proxy for neural activity. As such, high-throughput mapping of IEGs has been immensely useful in relating complex behaviors in rodents to their underlying brain activation (i.e., ensemble) patterns. The advent of effective intact tissue clearing methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chung et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Renier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Susaki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ueda et al., 2020</xref>), microscopy advances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ragan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Reynaud et al., 2015</xref>), and automated registration and cell segmentation pipelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Renier et al., 2016</xref>) has made brain-wide activity mapping projects both scalable and feasible. Recent studies have applied these methods to study brain activation during a wide variety of experiences, including after psilocybin, ketamine, and haloperidol administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davoudian et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Renier et al., 2016</xref>), the incubation of palatable food craving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Madangopal et al., 2022</xref>), and fear memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Franceschini et al., 2023</xref>). However, with a few exceptions, almost all of these approaches have focused on mapping <italic>single</italic> ensembles across the brains.</p><p>Over the last decade, activity-dependent tagging approaches, such as the tamoxifen-inducible ArcCreER<sup>T2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Denny et al., 2014</xref>) and TRAP1/TRAP2 systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">DeNardo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guenthner et al., 2013</xref>), or the doxycycline-controlled TetTag system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reijmers et al., 2007</xref>), have allowed for the investigation of multiple ensemblesâand their shared overlapâduring two distinct experiences within the same subjects. Such tagging methods have generated unprecedented insight into the neural mechanisms of memory formation, storage, and retrieval by allowing for the identification of individual memory traces. A memory trace or âengramâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Semon, 1921</xref>) refers to the enduring physical substrate of memory and is defined as a neural population initially active during memory encoding whose reactivation at a later time point results in memory retrieval. However, the majority of engram studies have focused on a few focal regions, such as the dentate gyrus (DG; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Denny et al., 2014</xref>), retrosplenial area (RSP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cowansage et al., 2014</xref>), medial prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kitamura et al., 2017</xref>), and amygdalar subdivisions, such as the lateral amygdalar nucleus (LA), and basolateral amygdalar nucleus (BLA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reijmers et al., 2007</xref>), rather than the investigation of numerous regions across the brain. In part, this is because high-throughput mapping and analysis of <italic>multiple</italic> ensembles poses many challenges: (1) Both activity markers need to be clearly immunolabeled across all brain structures under investigation; (2) both labeled markers need to be accurately segmented or automatically counted; (3) a validated strategy needs to be employed for identification of overlapping cell populations; (4) all cell counts and co-labeled cells need to be accurately registered to a standardized atlas space; (5) an infrastructure facilitating easy data management, aggregation, and transformation (e.g., normalizing cell counts by volume) needs to exist; and (6) analytical and visualization methods to intuit functional connectivity between brain regions and how they differ between experimental groupings should be easily implemented.</p><p>Here, we developed a workflow incorporating these features to make large-scale analysis of traditionally coronally sectioned datasets produced by activity-dependent tagging systems more accessible. Intrinsic to this pipeline is SMARTTR, a versatile R package that wraps mapping capabilities to the common coordinate framework (CCF) of the Allen Brain Institute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2020</xref>) with functions for statistical analysis and network visualization for multiple ensembles using graph theory. Moreover, this package is versatile, such that the analysis modules can be easily applied to imported mapped datasets from other alternative imaging, segmentation, and registration workflows, including those reliant on alternative atlas ontologies, such as the Unified Anatomical Atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chon et al., 2019</xref>). While we have designed and validated this pipeline with the ArcCreER<sup>T2</sup> tagging system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Denny et al., 2014</xref>), the steps and analysis software used in this pipeline are generalizable to virtually all widely used dual-ensemble tagging systems.</p><p>Beyond its direct application to engram research, this pipeline has broader use in allowing for the comparison of brain-wide activity patterns during any two distinct experiences. To demonstrate the versatility of our workflow, we applied this approach to gain novel insight into brain-wide functional activation patterns underlying the acquisition and expression of learned helplessness (LH), a robust behavioral paradigm which models traumatic stress. To our knowledge, wide-scale mapping of ensembles underlying both of these time points has not been studied in the context of LH and would allow for greater functional insight into changes occurring between these stages. In this effort, we have identified several altered functional connectivity signatures of the ensembles active during exposure to IS, escapable shock (ES), as well as the shared ensemble population between these experiences. Finally, we have presented this work as a reference dataset freely available for download and walkthrough alongside an accompanying tutorial.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Pipeline overview</title><p>Our pipeline was designed for mapping and analysis of dual-ensemble datasets generated by the ArcCreER<sup>T2</sup> tagging system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Denny et al., 2014</xref>), although the steps are, in principle, generalizable to all dual-ensemble tagging approaches. The ArcCreER<sup>T2</sup> mouse line leverages the activity-dependent expression of the IEG <italic>Arc</italic> to enable <italic>permanent</italic> fluorescent tagging of neural ensembles with enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Denny et al., 2014</xref>). In this system, injection of a selective estrogen receptor agonist, such as 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT), opens a transient window for labeling recently active neurons with eYFP. Staining for IEG protein expression (i.e., c-Fos) at a second time point allows for the identification of active ensembles driven by two different behavioral experiences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Following tissue perfusion and brain extraction, multiple ensemble mapping through the pipeline workflow was organized into three different components: (1) immunolabeling and imaging acquisition, (2) image preprocessing and automatic segmentation of dual ensembles and their overlap in ImageJ/FIJI, and (3) atlas registration and downstream analyses in our software package in R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Pipeline schematic.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The ArcCreER<sup>T2</sup> Ã eYFP tagging strategy allows for labeling of Arc-expressing cells with eYFP following injection of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT).

A traditional serial sectioning approach was used, as it is the most accessible and reliable way to stain two markers at a high signal-to-noise ratio across deep brain structures. Following imaging for eYFP<sup>+</sup> (channel 1) and c-Fos<sup>+</sup> (channel 2) cells using a scanning confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP8, Leica Microsystems Inc, Wetzlar, Germany) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), we implemented a custom segmentation strategy in ImageJ/FIJI which uses a suite of open-source image processing plugins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ollion et al., 2013</xref>) for accurate cell segmentation in 3D based on the staining morphology characteristics of eYFP<sup>+</sup> and c-Fos<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The characteristics and positions of segmented eYFP<sup>+</sup> and c-Fos<sup>+</sup> cells were saved into .txt files as outputs. Next, co-labeled (eYFP<sup>+</sup>/c-Fos<sup>+</sup>) cells were identified by comparing all possible overlapping objects using the open-source 3D MultiColoc plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ollion et al., 2013</xref>), saving the output as .txt files, and thresholding by percent volume overlap downstream.

Importantly, these macros have been generalized to allow for easy parameter modification through a graphical user interface (GUI), to account for different imaging resolutions and unique naming conventions.</p><p>In the final preprocessing step, since registration is performed on single-plane .tiff images, we collapsed raw images across all z-planes and channels to use as an aggregate reference image for registration to atlas templates from the Allen Institute Mouse Brain Atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lein et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Oh et al., 2014</xref>).

This standard API was designed around an object-oriented infrastructure. In the package, data is managed using slice, mouse, and experiment objects which also store additional metadata in a hierarchical manner. For example, a slice object contains all imaging-related metadata such as the image ID, image path, channel names, and a matching anteriorâposterior atlas coordinate, alongside registration data and imported segmentation data. Slice objects are hierarchically stored inside mouse objects, which contain additional metadata such as mouse ID, sex, strain, and genotype. Package functions for interactive registration, importation of segmentation outputs, mapping cell counts to a standard atlas space, automated network analysis, and visualization operate directly on these objects. Moreover, there are also a suite of additional capabilities, including data quality checking for outlier counts, removal of regions to omit due to tissue damage, and normalizing co-labeled counts by a particular channel. The organization of the SMARTTR package also facilitates alternative pipeline entry points. Import functions exist for alternate segmentation approaches. Compatibility with datasets previously registered and mapped with alternative workflows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eastwood et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Renier et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yates et al., 2019</xref>) is supported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), allowing users to take advantage of the analysis and visualization capabilities of this package without reliance on prior processing steps. Extensive documentation of the package functions and a detailed tutorial using the datasets from this study are available at the package website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mjin1812.github.io/SMARTTR/">https://mjin1812.github.io/SMARTTR/</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Identifying ensembles underlying the acquisition and expression of LH</title><p>To demonstrate the strengths and capabilities of our dual-ensemble mapping pipeline, we applied our approach to gain novel insights into the neural activity patterns underlying LH, a robust behavioral paradigm widely used to model aspects of trauma and depression preclinically. The neural correlates of LH have been studied across a variety of model organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maier and Seligman, 2016</xref>) and have been largely focused on single or few regions.

With this semi-targeted mapping approach, we ensured that critical regions previously implicated in the expression of LH and stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ineichen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maier and Watkins, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marques et al., 2022</xref>) would be represented in our dataset, along with a myriad of under-investigated regions present within the same atlas plates spread across the rostralâcaudal axis. To account for the dendritic/axonal staining pattern of eYFP, a custom algorithm was applied to limit segmentation of cellular processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode4">Source code 4</xref>). Since this staining pattern is characteristic of other tagging approaches, for example, TRAP1/TRAP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">DeNardo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guenthner et al., 2013</xref>), this algorithm is likely generalizable to other activity-dependent tagging mechanisms. Since c-Fos localizes to the cell body, resulting in a punctate filled-spherical staining, a separate optimized algorithm for segmenting this expression pattern was applied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode3">Source code 3</xref>). Next, all possible segmented object overlaps were compared, and the proportion of volumetric overlap was calculated (relative to the volume of segmented c-Fos<sup>+</sup> cells). Colocalized cell counts were identified by thresholding by proportion of volume overlap downstream using SMARTTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). The individual image processing steps for both segmentation algorithms and colocalization analysis were all conducted in-batch using ImageJ/Fiji macros, with details extensively outlined in the Methods. These segmentation parameters are adjustable in a GUI menu to flexibly account for a range of resolutions, making them generalizable to other imaging parameters.</p><p>Next, we sought to validate the accuracy of our algorithms by comparing the automatically segmented counts of eYFP<sup>+</sup> and c-Fos<sup>+</sup> cells to manual cell counts in a subset of images across all mice. Specifically, automated cell counts in the granule cell layer of the DG of the HPC were compared to manual counts from two independent counters. For eYFP<sup>+</sup>, we found that automated segmentation results were highly correlated with manual cell counts across both annotators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1AâH</xref>; <italic>r</italic> = 0.85 averaged manual counts), and there was high correlation between independent manual counts (<italic>r</italic> = 0.92). Performance was further evaluated by independent quantification of false positive (FP, detected by algorithm alone), false negative (FN, detected by annotator alone), and true positive (TP, detected by both annotator and algorithm) cells on 3333 manual counts from Counter A and 3687 manual counts from Counter B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1I</xref>). We found that average precision (<italic>P</italic> = TP/(TP + FP)) was 0.92 and average recall (<italic>R</italic> = TP/(TP + FN)) was 0.76. The averaged overall <italic>F</italic>1 score, calculated as the harmonic mean of precision and recall (1/<italic>F</italic>1 = (1/<italic>P</italic> + 1/<italic>R</italic>)/2), was 0.85. For c-Fos<sup>+</sup> cells, we similarly found high correlation between automated cell counts and manual cell counts across both annotators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1JâQ</xref>; <italic>r</italic> = 0.93 averaged manual counts), as well as high correlation between annotators (<italic>r</italic> = 0.93). We further evaluated the number of FP, FN, and TP cells on 2971 manual counts from Counter A and 3477 manual counts from Counter B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1R</xref>). The c-Fos-optimized algorithm yielded an average precision of 0.96, an average recall of 0.78, and an average <italic>F</italic>1 score of 0.86. Overall, these results indicate that both algorithms faithfully reflected results that would be obtained from typical manual cell counting approaches and even outperformed metrics reported previously for other automatic segmentation approaches for activity-dependent labeled cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Franceschini et al., 2023</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Registration and mapping cell counts to a standardized atlas space</title><p>We created mouse and slice objects and auto-populated metadata using a custom script that is available on the package website and GitHub repository.

We then calculated different topology metrics per node, including degree, clustering coefficient, efficiency, and betweenness centrality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bullmore and Sporns, 2009</xref>). Degree is the simplest measure of connectivity and represents how many direct connections a single node has. The clustering coefficient represents the tendency of finding a third mutual connection among already connected neighboring nodes (i.e., âcliquishnessâ), giving insight into how functionally segregated or integrative a given region is among its neighbors. Efficiency is inversely related to the average path length between a given node and all other nodes in the network, and betweenness indicates how often a particular node lies on the shortest path between two other nodes, which can indicate a regionâs influence over information flow in functional networks.</p><p>We first averaged each of these metrics across all nodes to gain insight into each networkâs global connectivity patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3DâH</xref>). While there was no difference in average degree between groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), both networks showed characteristic tailed degree distributions that tend to be found in complex biological systems that follow a power-law distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barabasi and Albert, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bullmore and Sporns, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bullmore and Sporns, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Watts and Strogatz, 1998</xref>). There was also no difference in average clustering coefficient, global efficiency, and mean betweenness centrality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3FâH</xref>). As currently, there is no consensus on the ideal approach to choose a threshold to optimize retention of important connections and rejection of spurious ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garrison et al., 2015</xref>), we next examined whether the calculated global metrics might have changed across a wide range of significance thresholds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2AâD</xref>). Trajectories of degree, clustering coefficient, efficiency, and mean betweenness centrality were qualitatively similar between CT and IS groups across a range of alpha thresholds. Thus, global topology metrics reveal no striking differences in propensity for information transfer between IS and CT networks during LH acquisition.</p><p>To better investigate which individual regions are most differentially influential between networks, we looked specifically at the distribution of individual nodal degree centrality and betweenness centrality values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3IâJ</xref>). The degree distributions revealed that many primary somatosensory (SSp) regions (mouth, SSp-m; lower limb, SSp-Il; barrel field, SSp-bfd; upper limb, SSp-ul), motor regions (primary motor area, MOp), and limbic regions, including the nucleus accumbens (ACB) and BLA, were highly connected in the IS. Comparatively, far fewer sensory regions showed such high degree in the CT networks. Despite the high connectivity among mostly sensory regions, IS network betweenness distributions showed that additional key structures such as the AI, piriform cortex (PIR), septohippocampal nucleus (SH), and ENT act as influential information bridges in the IS network. The AI is a critical region involved in pain processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Labrakakis, 2023</xref>), and its central network engagement is largely consistent with experiencing a painful sensory event. In contrast, structures such as the subiculum (SUB), ECT, dorsal dentate gyrus (dDG), and medial septal nucleus (MS) were most influential in CT networks, and betweenness distributions also reveal that the SUB was most influential. The subiculum is well known to play a role in spatial representation during exploration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matsumoto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">OâMara et al., 2009</xref>), and the MS and dDG are, respectively, involved in motivated locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mocellin and Mikulovic, 2021</xref>) and contextual processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tuncdemir et al., 2019</xref>). The overall patterns seen in the individual regional degree and betweenness distributions indicate a strong engagement of areas involved in contextual and navigational processing in the CT network, whereas there appears to be greater influences of regions involved in sensory and affective processing of shock (e.g., BLA and AI), and motor reactivity (e.g., MOp) in the IS network.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>LH acquisition alters ventral CA1, ventral tegmental, and perirhinal connections</title><p>To better understand how coordinated activity among individual connections differs between groups, we performed a permutation analysis. Regional correlations from the CT group were subtracted from corresponding correlations in the IS group and compared against a permuted null distribution. We further analyzed only correlations differences that were large (<italic>r</italic> difference â¥1) and highly significant (p &lt; 0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>). A number of interesting patterns emerged from this analysis. Specifically, connections involving either the ventral CA1 (vCA1), ventral tegmental area (VTA), or perirhinal cortex (PERI) were strongly positively correlated in the CT group, whereas they became negatively correlated in the IS group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>). This pattern was consistent among connections between the vCA1 with associative areas (posterior parietal association areas, PTLp; ENT) and hypothalamic areas (zona incerta, ZI; lateral hypothalamic area, LHA), and between the PERI with primarily limbic, especially amygdalar regions (AI, BLA, piriform amygdalar area, and cortical amygdalar area), and the VTA with associative regions (temporal association areas, TEa; ECT, PERI). The VTA is centrally involved in reward processing and functional inversion of its connections may be indicative of the aversive experiencing of inescapable footshocks. Additionally, the vCA1 is known to be involved in processing of affective states and fear retrieval, with the vCA1âLHA projection in particular being enriched in representations of anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jimenez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jimenez et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting functional alterations of this particular connection may be important in the development of LH. Finally, the PERI region is involved in object perception and sensory feature processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Murray and Richmond, 2001</xref>), and thus, its strongly altered connectivity may indicate differences in how sensory features of the environment are assigned an affective value in IS versus CT mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>LH expression is characterized by a reversal in functional connectivity of the substantia nigra</title><p>We applied the same analysis approach to the mapped c-Fos<sup>+</sup> dataset, representing cells active during the expression of LH, when mice are tested under ES conditions.

Qualitatively, we observed that somatosensory and motor areas appear more integrated with amygdalar and hippocampal structures in CT compared to IS networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We then calculated the same global network topology metrics previously described. We found that there was no mean difference in degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2A</xref>), although both networks showed the expected tailed degree distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). There was also no difference in clustering coefficient, global efficiency, and mean betweenness centrality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2CâE</xref>). We validated the stable nature of this observation by recalculating these global metrics across a wide range of possible significance thresholds and observed similar trajectories between CT and IS networks across all metrics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2FâI</xref>).

The most highly interconnected region in the CT network was the nucleus reunions (RE), and the region with the highest betweenness value was the diagonal band nucleus (NDB). In contrast, for the IS network, the most highly interconnected regions include the dCA1 and ventral medial nucleus of the thalamus (VM), whereas two basal ganglia structures, the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the substantia nigra, reticular part (SNr), displayed the highest betweenness centrality. To further investigate how regions showing either the highest degree or betweenness centrality in the IS group are functionally changed, we plotted the distribution of Pearson correlation coefficients for all dCA1, VM, STN, and SNr connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4FâI</xref>). While there were no differences in the correlation distributions of the dCA1, VM, and STN, in the SNr, there was a strong shift from predominantly negative correlations in the CT group to positive correlations in the IS group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). Altogether, these findings indicate that the VM, a central thalamic relay structure which integrates limbic and prefrontal cortical signals to guide motor behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anastasiades et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Monconduit et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sieveritz et al., 2019</xref>), and the NDB, a basal forebrain structure capable of mediating motivated movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mocellin and Mikulovic, 2021</xref>), may be involved in the cognitive processes involved in generating adaptive escape responses in control animals. General reversal of functional connectivity in the substantia nigra (SN) when comparing the CT and IS suggests that the SN may be a critical region involved in gating of motor processing involved in an adaptive crossing response.</p><p>âFinally, we performed a permutation analysis as previously described to examine pairwise regional correlation changes between groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J, K</xref>). In line with our previous findings, we found a large proportion of the significantly altered connections in the positive direction in the IS group relative to the CT included the SNr. These SNr connections involved a number of sensory, motor, and visual processing regions. Conversely, a number of positively correlated connections involving the PERI region in the CT group shifted to negative correlations in the IS group. Among these connections were various midbrain structures (VTA and MRN) and visuomotor processing centers (SCm), and hypothalamic structures (ZI). As strong correlation reversals of PERI connections between CT and IS groups were similarly seen in ensembles active during LH acquisition, early modulation of PERI function may be an early functional signature of development of LH.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>LH is characterized by dampened reactivation of cells previously active during IS</title><p>We next leveraged the capability of the SMARTTR package to study co-labeled eYFP<sup>+</sup>/c-Fos<sup>+</sup> cell populations active during both acquisition and expression of LH.

The regions with the highest betweenness centrality were the ACA and MOs. For this reason, we further plotted the distribution of all Pearson correlation coefficients for the dCA1, AI, ACA, and MOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5P-S</xref>). While there were no differences found in the correlation distributions for the dCA1, ACA, and MOs, in the AI, there was a significant increase in the proportion of positive correlations in the IS group compared to the CT group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Q</xref>), indicating a general strengthening of functional connectivity of the AI among reactivated cells. In an exploratory analysis of co-labeled/c-Fos<sup>+</sup> cell activity, we also found that AI correlations to the vDG region were preferentially strengthened in the IS group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5âfigure supplement 5L</xref>).</p><p>âFinally, we used a permutation analysis, as done previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5TâU</xref>) to assess regional correlations differences that were large (<italic>r</italic> difference â¥1) and highly significant (p &lt; 0.01) between the two groups. Interestingly, a pattern emerged whereby there was a disproportionate number of strongly negative connections in the CT group that shifted to strongly positive connections in the IS group, many of which involved the CEA, a primary fear and pain processing center. These significantly altered CEA connections included regions such as the infralimbic area, which is involved in flexible response inhibition and decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barker et al., 2014</xref>), the caudoputamen, a basal ganglia structure involved in motor regulation, and the lateral septum, which is involved in emotional regulation and stress responding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wirtshafter and Wilson, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yadin et al., 1993</xref>). Altogether, these observations suggest that a functional change in the AI and strong functional reversal of key CEA connections in reactivated neural populations may underlie the process of developing of LH.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Activity-dependent tagging systems have been invaluable for studies investigating the shared overlapping ensembles active across two separate experiences. Such studies have revealed invaluable insights on the ensembles responsible for memory storage and retrieval (i.e., engrams). However, most of these studies have relied on targeted investigation of single or few regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cowansage et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Denny et al., 2014</xref>). The few publications reporting mapping of brain-wide tagged ensembles have relied on intact tissue clearing, 3D imaging, and registration workflows that, while advantageous in their ability to keep tissue intact, are specialized and difficult to implement widely, and/or rely on commercial software (e.g., Imaris) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Franceschini et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roy et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>To our knowledge, only one paper has reported mapping and analysis of colocalized ensembles without introducing a generalizable workflow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roy et al., 2022</xref>). Thus far, there have been scant accessible approaches that allow for the scalable brain-wide mapping of multiple ensembles as well as their overlap in traditionally immunolabeled coronal sections. Moreover, there are no standardized open-source tools to analyze functional connectivity signatures based on network analysis of brain-wide IEG activity patterns.</p><p>âHere, we present our workflow for automated segmentation optimized for the identification of eYFP<sup>+</sup> cells (indicative of previously Arc<sup>+</sup> cells), c-Fos<sup>+</sup> cells, and their co-labeled overlap. This process is open-source, as it is conducted entirely in ImageJ/FIJI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>), and relies on existing image processing toolkits that are freely available. Moreover, we introduce the SMARTTR package which offers a standardized API for the importation of segmentation output from our workflow, and for atlas registration and mapping by interfacing with previously published R packages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">FÃ¼rth et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jin et al., 2022</xref>). However, perhaps the most useful and novel feature of SMARTTR is the inclusion of numerous data management, quality checking, graph theory analyses, and visualization functions that are user-friendly, requiring only rudimentary programming knowledge.</p><p>âWe demonstrated the utility of our workflow by applying it to map two ensemble populations active during the experience of IS (or context) or later during exposure to ES. Our goal was to gain insight into how functional activity networks are changed during both LH acquisition and expression, which has never previously been studied. As the LH paradigm models a fundamental symptomology of trauma-related depression and anxiety states, this work has the major clinical implication of improving our understanding of how these states emerge following trauma. Our analysis of global network properties of eYFP<sup>+</sup>, c-Fos<sup>+</sup>, and co-labeled/eYFP<sup>+</sup> activity expression revealed no differences in topological metrics, suggesting that the learned helpless state is not characterized by gross deficits or alterations in information transfer during acquisition or expression of LH.</p><p>However, our region and connection specific analyses of eYFP<sup>+</sup> ensemble networks suggest that, when experiencing IS compared to context exposure, there is a functional shift from emphasis on navigational and contextual processing to sensory and affective processing. Network-wise, this appears to be represented by a decreased influence of regions such as the subiculum, which is centrally involved with spatial navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matsumoto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">OâMara et al., 2009</xref>), to generally high interconnectivity of somatosensory regions, and those potentially involved with affective processing of shock, such as the BLA and AI.</p><p>Surprisingly, we did not find strong evidence of absolute activity differences between groups across a targeted or brain-wide regional comparisons, and overall amygdalar activity in IS mice was comparable to that of CT mice during LH training. This is in contrast to previous findings showing <italic>Arc</italic> gene expression in the amygdala is upregulated 2 hr after IS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Machida et al., 2018</xref>). However, a key methodological difference in our approach is that the ArcCreER<sup>T2</sup> Ã eYFP tagging strategy labels previously Arc-expressing cells with eYFP over a longer window of time, as the serum half-life of 4-OHT is approximately 6 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cazzulino et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, neurons active during consolidation of the experience in the hours following acute shock or context exploration may also be recruited into the tagged ensemble.</p><p>During ES testing, network analysis revealed surprising high influence of two basal ganglia structures, the STN and the SNr, and that there was a striking functional reversal of the SNr between the CT and IS groups. Interestingly, recent work has shown that stressor controllability can change intrinsic dynamics and electrophysiological properties of SN neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yao et al., 2021</xref>). These findings, in conjunction with our results, suggest the possibility that the SN activity is altered by loss of control over a stressor in a manner that may gate an adaptive motor response such as crossing.</p><p>Finally, we examined the overlapping ensembles active during both LH acquisition and expression (eYFP<sup>+</sup>/c-Fos<sup>+</sup>) as a proportion of the originally active ensemble population (eYFP<sup>+</sup>). Interestingly, we found a robust decrease in reactivation activity in several targeted brain regions, alongside a trending brain-wide decrease. To our knowledge, this pattern of widescale decreased reactivity following exposure to a traumatic event has not been described before and suggests a potential phenomenon of neural plasticity which acts to suppress future ensemble reactivity as a major part of the neurobiology underlying LH. We also found a general correlative association between LA co-labeled activity and escape latency, suggesting reactivation of LA ensembles initially active during IS involved in regulating response to ES.</p><p>Performing network analyses, we identified the AI as a highly interconnected region in the IS networks, which showed a significantly strengthened distribution of functional connections compared to the CT group. As an integrative hub for sensory, affective, and cognitive function, in addition to its role in pain processing, the insula is involved in regulating fear and anxiety behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Casanova et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Labrakakis, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nicolas et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rogers-Carter et al., 2018</xref>). The influential positioning of the AI in the IS networks, along with its functional alteration, indicates that reactivated functional activity in the AI may be critical in mediating the helpless state. Network analysis also revealed the ACA as another potential key region, as the ACA displayed the highest betweenness centrality in the IS network. This finding is consistent with a previous study of long-term fear memory using network analysis of c-Fos expression which also found the ACA as an important hub within the fear network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wheeler et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, our permutation analysis revealed a number of key CEA connections that were strongly functionally reversed between IS and CT groups, suggesting possible functional targets for future investigation. Given these many novel insights, we believe the strength of SMARTTR and our multiple-ensemble mapping workflow lies in its use as a hypothesis-generating toolkit, which may lead to new questions and suggest future mechanistic studies that may draw more definitive causal conclusions.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Methodological considerations</title><p>There are many factors to consider regarding the choice of our workflow over other options. While serial coronal sectioning is not as rapid as intact tissue immunostaining, this approach allows for adequate antibody penetration for two or more ensemble populations in deep brain structures for high signal-to-noise staining. Intact whole-brain immunohistochemistry, typically in combination with lipid clearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chung et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Park et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Renier et al., 2014</xref>), has been demonstrated to label <italic>single</italic> ensembles well. However, insufficient penetration of multiple antibodies or purging of epitopes, especially during permeabilization steps in hydrophobic clearing approaches, remains a major technical barrier to widespread adoption in mapping engrams. We have found many of these methods result in confounding staining gradients from the surface to deeper depths of the tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pavlova et al., 2018</xref>), leading to inaccurate visualization of multiple ensembles in structures such as the hippocampus, which confounds study of biologically relevant overlapping populations. Applying intact tissue clearing approaches to brain-wide engram mapping remains a tremendous technical hurdle for most.</p><p>âA second limitation of this workflow is that the accuracy of registration alignment depends on the quality of physical sectioning, user annotation, and correction of registrations. Furthermore, accurate registration in the <italic>z</italic>-plane is limited to a resolution of ~100 Î¼m. This is because the registration capabilities of WholeBrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">FÃ¼rth et al., 2018</xref>) and SMART (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jin et al., 2022</xref>), the underlying packages used for registration and mapping, require coronal sections to align closely to the sectioning plane of the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas. Thus, registration alignment requires both technical skill and familiarity with brain-wide anatomy. However, this challenge can be mitigated with the use of brain matrices, which can help mount an even cutting plane during physical sectioning. Additionally, limited registration accuracy along the z-plane is still comparable to other recent volumetric registration approaches reporting accuracies of ~300 Î¼m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Franceschini et al., 2023</xref>), whereas maximal registration accuracy along the <italic>x</italic>- and <italic>y</italic>-planes is much higher due to WholeBrainâs scale-invariant spline-based atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">FÃ¼rth et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Future directions</title><p>There are a number of alternative mapping approaches that can account for sectioning angle during registration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Puchades et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Song et al., 2020</xref>). The structure of SMARTTR is modular such that additional pipeline entry points are possible if separate workflows are used for segmentation, registration, or mapping. For example, independently mapped data can be easily imported for integration with SMARTTRâs network analysis functions. Similarly, with some simple programming, it is possible to import segmented data from other approaches, such as CellPose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stringer et al., 2021</xref>) or QuPath (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bankhead et al., 2017</xref>), and still take advantage of the built-in registration, mapping, and analysis capabilities in SMARTTR. We anticipate, based on community feedback, that additional analysis features will be continually added to the package. For example, since the default supported atlas ontology is the Allen Mouse Brain Common Coordinate Framework, the merged FranklinâPaxinos/CCF atlas nomenclature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chon et al., 2019</xref>) was incorporated to analysis and visualization functions based on collaborator feedback. Finally, while this pipeline was designed to be especially user-friendly to novice programmers, future iterations may be even easier to learn through incorporation of a GUI menu for easy creation and modification of object metadata, running analyses, and visualizations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

A previously developed custom 3D segmentation approach was applied to each label due to their differences in morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leal Santos et al., 2021</xref>). Because c-Fos localizes to the cell body, resulting in punctate filled-spherical staining, an optimized algorithm for this labeling pattern was applied. c-Fos<sup>+</sup> cells were identified by first passing the image through a bandpass filter in Fourier space, subtracting the background using a rolling ball algorithm, and identifying the cells using the 3D Local Maxima Fast Filter, 3D Spot Segmentation, and 3D Manager plugins in the 3D ImageJ suite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ollion et al., 2013</xref>). Due to the dendritic expression of eYFP after labeling with the ArcCreER<sup>T2</sup> Ã eYFP tagging system, an optimized algorithm to minimize segmentation of cellular processes was applied. eYFP<sup>+</sup> cells were identified by subtracting the background, blurring the image with a Gaussian kernel, thresholding the image for the 0.5% brightest pixels, and using the thresholded regions as a mask for identifying the cells with the Classic Watershed plugin in the MorphoLibJ suite<sup>9</sup>. The segmentation output was then qualitatively inspected per image, and over-segmentation errors due to structural autofluorescence artifacts (e.g., around ventricles and tissue edges) were manually deleted to maximize accuracy of mapping in the final dataset. Co-labeled cells were identified using the 3D MultiColoc plugin in the 3D ImageJ suite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ollion et al., 2013</xref>), which uses the label images created during segmentation of the individual labels to efficiently identify overlapping objects. To maximize precision of counts, co-labeled cells were additionally filtered by the percent volume of overlap between the objects identified in each individual channel, relative to channel 2. A subset of identified co-labeled cells was manually inspected in ImageJ/FIJI to ensure accuracy. Custom ImageJ/FIJI macros were written to apply segmentation and colocalization algorithms in bulk to the images (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode3">Source code 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode4">Source code 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode5">Source code 5</xref>). All macros, along with an example image for trial, are available for download at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/ynqp7/">https://osf.io/ynqp7/</ext-link>, and were generalized to include adjustable parameters to apply to images across different resolutions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Manual cell quantification</title><p>The number of eYFP<sup>+</sup> and c-Fos<sup>+</sup> was manually counted by two annotators for the dDG bilaterally across two images per mouse. First, the z-stack image was collapsed into a single maximum projection image using Fiji<sup>6</sup> to facilitate counting. ROIs were drawn around the granule cell layer and saved for comparison with automated cell segmentation results. eYFP<sup>+</sup> and c-Fos<sup>+</sup> cells were counted within each ROI, with accuracy qualitatively verified by overlaying counts over each section of the original z-stack image. To quantify the number of FN and FP counts, the total number of cells manually quantified per ROI were compared to the collapsed maximum projection image of automated cell counts within the same ROI. Despite the auto-segmentation algorithms being applied in 3D, counting FN and FP cells in 2D for validation, followed by qualitative comparison with the original z-stack, allowed for a more time-efficient workflow for manual comparison. Estimated total TP counts per counter were then calculated by taking the average of two derivations: (Total no. manual counts â Total FN counts) and (Total no. auto-segmented counts â Total FP counts). Individual calculations for precision, recall, and <italic>F</italic>1 were performed for each annotator and then averaged.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Package development and code availability</title><p>The SMARTTR package was developed to bridge the optimized segmentation and colocalization approach in ImageJ/FIJI with the registration and mapping capabilities of the SMART (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jin et al., 2022</xref>) and WholeBrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">FÃ¼rth et al., 2018</xref>) packages in R. Beyond this, the SMARTTR package offers an extensive suite of functions to analyze and visualize the mapped datasets. The package design intrinsically incorporates data management facilitated by its object-oriented structure. Detailed documentation and in-depth descriptions of package objects and functions are available at the package website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mjin1812.github.io/SMARTTR">https://mjin1812.github.io/SMARTTR</ext-link>) and access to the source code is available as a GitHub repository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/mjin1812/SMARTTR">https://github.com/mjin1812/SMARTTR</ext-link>, copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jin and Ogundare, 2025</xref>). Additionally, the processed and mapped dataset from the LH experiments is available for download at the package website to follow along an analysis tutorial. SMARTTR was written primarily in base R (v3.6.3) and developed and documented with devtools and roxygen2. Built-in functions for network analyses and visualizations were created using the igraph, tidygraph, ggplot2, and ggraph packages. The SMARTTR website was built using pkgdown.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Registration and mapping</title><p>Image z-stacks were automatically preprocessed using an ImageJ/FIJI macro to combine fluorescence intensities across both channels and <italic>z</italic>-planes into a flattened maximum project image (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode2">Source code 2</xref>). Images were manually assigned to a best-matching anteriorâposterior atlas coordinate based on the reference atlas materials available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://openbrainmap.org/">openbrainmap.org</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/cpt5w">https://osf.io/cpt5w</ext-link>. Registration with flexible user correction was then performed in R on these flattened images using the registration() wrapper function in SMARTTR, which interfaces with the WholeBrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">FÃ¼rth et al., 2018</xref>) and SMART (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jin et al., 2022</xref>) packages.</p><p>In brief, WholeBrain allows for registration of serial sections to vectorized coronal reference atlas plates, generated from the 2008 Allen reference atlas. Because of its representation of region boundaries as non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS), the registration process is scale-invariant in the <italic>x</italic>- and <italic>y</italic>-planes and can accommodate a wide range of imaging resolutions. Registration along the <italic>z</italic>-plane, however, is limited to the spacing between atlas plates (~100 Î¼m), and accuracy depends on qualitative matching to the correct plate. Initial registration occurs by the fitting of 32 correspondence points along the contours of the atlas and tissue sections. These points can be pruned, corrected, or added to through a user-friendly console interface available through the SMART package. The user-corrected correspondence points are then used to calculate the thin-plate splines deformation field, which can interpolate and match any coordinates within the tissue to the atlas. Further details and a tutorial on the user-friendly registration process are available at the SMART package website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sgoldenlab.github.io/SMART/">https://sgoldenlab.github.io/SMART/</ext-link>). Misaligned or damaged regions per hemisphere were manually annotated by acronym, logged, and excluded from analysis using the exclude_anatomy() function.</p><p>Cell counts of eYFP<sup>+</sup>, c-Fos<sup>+</sup>, and co-labeled cells were warped to atlas space using the map_cells_to_atlas() function. The area of each region per image was calculated using Gaussâs formula and aggregated across all sections in a mouse. Volume of mapped images was calculated by multiplying the aggregated areas by the thickness of each z-stack section. Mapped cell counts were then normalized by region volume to yield cells per mm<sup>3</sup>. Regions expected not to contain IEG-labeled cells, such as the fiber tracts and ventricles, were excluded from counts in addition to manually curated lists of regions to omit due to tearing, imaging artifacts, etc. Normalized cell counts were stored and saved in the mouse object. Outlier values were detected and removed by finding normalized regional cell counts that were either two standard deviations above or below the group mean.</p><p>We improved efficiency by writing a user-friendly notebook for the registration process and using custom scripts to detect misspellings in annotated regions and automate mapping of segmented cell counts onto a standardized atlas space. We have documented all custom scripts in our website tutorial and GitHub repository to facilitate use. Comprehensive statistical mapping results for eYFP<sup>+</sup> cell counts, c-Fos<sup>+</sup> cell counts, co-labeled/eYFP<sup>+</sup>, and co-labeled/c-Fos<sup>+</sup> reactivation proportions with FDR corrections are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Permutation and network analysis</title><p>Pearson correlations between regions were calculated using the get_correlations() function, which interfaces with the rcorr() function from the Hmisc package (v4.5.0), and asymptotic p-values for each correlation were determined using a one-sample <italic>t</italic>-test. Significantly correlated regions were visualized in heatmaps using conservative alpha values of p &lt; 0.01 (eYFP<sup>+</sup>, co-labeled/eYFP<sup>+</sup>) and p &lt; 0.005 (c-Fos<sup>+</sup>). Each of these thresholds was chosen to ensure an optimal level of edge sparsity in their respective networks.</p><p>Permutation analysis was conducted with the correlation_diff_permutation() function to identify which region correlations differed most between experimental groups. Correlations differences were calculated by subtracting correlations from the CT group from respective correlations in the IS group (<italic>r</italic><sub>IS</sub> â <italic>r</italic><sub>CT</sub>). Each correlation difference was used as a test statistic against a null distribution produced by shuffling the labels of CT and IS mice 1000 times, with the correlation difference recomputed for each shuffle. Correlation differences were compared to each individual null distributions to determine the p-value. Significance correlation differences for all analyses were thresholded using an alpha of 0.01 without FDR correction. As our dataset is meant as a demonstrative and exploratory resource, we chose to minimize FN findings at the expense of high tolerance for FPs.</p><p>Networks were constructed and visualized using the create_networks() and plot_networks() functions, which interface with the igraph (v1.2.6) and tidygraph (v1.2.0) packages. Because the c-Fos and Arc-driven eYFP labels are both activity dependent, the correlations between regions are akin to functional connections. Thus, significant functional relationships can be visualized by representing regions as nodes and correlations as an edge between two nodes, with the Pearson correlation values determining the weight or thickness of the edge. Since pairwise correlations were calculated for all pairs, the initial functional network is complete, with all nodes fully interconnected. In order to interpret the networks and discover their most salient features, correlations with alpha values below their corresponding heatmap significance thresholds were dropped and additionally filtered to have an <italic>r</italic> &gt; 0.9 to ensure only the strongest connections were retained. Network topology measures and node centralities were then calculated using the summarize_networks() function. A supplementary community detection analysis was additionally applied to the c-Fos<sup>+</sup> and co-labeled/eYFP<sup>+</sup> channels using tidygraph functions. Close community modules were identified by calculating the eigenvector of the modularity matrix for the largest positive eigenvalue and then separating vertices into two communities based on the sign of the corresponding element in the eigenvector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Newman, 2006</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>employee of Research Foundation for Mental Hygiene, Inc (RFMH)</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Validation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing â original draft, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the Research Foundation for Mental Hygiene, Inc (RFMH) under protocol No.1522.

Is there a way to alter the visualization to improve interpretability? Perhaps coloring the heatmap by general anatomical region could help? We feel that these heatmaps are critical to the utility of the registration strategy, and hence, clear visualization is necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this point on aesthetic improvement, and we agree that clearer visualization of our correlation heatmaps is important. To address this point, we have incorporated the capability of grouping âchildâ subregions in anatomical order by their more general âparentâ region into the package function, plot_correlation_heatmaps(). Parent regions will be can now be plotted as smaller sub-facets in the heatmaps. We have also rearranged our figures to fit enlarged heatmaps in Figures 3-5, and Supplementary Figure 10 for easier visualization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Additional context in the Introduction on the use of immediate early genes to label ensembles of neurons that are specifically activated during the various behavioral manipulations would enable the manuscript and methodology to be better appreciated by a broad audience.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion and have revised the first part of our Introduction to reflect the broader use and appeal of immediate early genes (IEGs) for studying neural changes underlying behavior.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors mention that their segmentation strategies are optimized for the particular staining pattern exhibited by each reporter and demonstrate that the manually annotated cell counts match the automated analysis. They mention that alternative strategies are compatible, but don't show this data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment. We also appreciate that integration with alternative strategies is a major point of interest to readers, given that others may be interested in compatibility with our analysis and software package, rather than completely revising their own pre-existing pipelines.</p><p>Generally, we have validated the ability to import datasets generated from completely different workflows for segmentation and registration. We have since released documentation on our package website with step-by-step instructions on how to do so (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mjin1812.github.io/SMARTTR/articles/Part5.ImportingExternalDatasets">https://mjin1812.github.io/SMARTTR/articles/Part5.ImportingExternalDatasets</ext-link>). We believe this tutorial is a major entry point to taking advantage of our analysis package, without adopting our entire workflow.</p><p>This specific point on segmentation refers to the import_segmentation_custom()function in the package. As there is currently not a standard cell segmentation export format adopted by the field, this function still requires some data wrangling into an import format saved as a .txt file. However, we chose not to visually demonstrate this capability in the paper for a few reasons.</p><p>i) A figure showing the broad testing of many different segmentation algorithms, (e.g., Cellpose, Vaa3d, Trainable Weka Segmentation) would better demonstrate the efficacy of segmentation of these alternative approaches, which have already been well-documented. However, demonstrating importation compatibility is more of a demonstration of API interface, which is better shown in website documentation and tutorial notebooks.</p><p>ii) Additionally, showing importation with one well-established segmentation approach is still a demonstration of a single use case. There would be a major burden-of-proof in establishing importation compatibility with all potential alternative platforms, their specific export formats, which may be slightly different depending on post-processing choices, and the needs of the experimenters (e.g., exporting one versus many channels, having different naming conventions, having different export formats). For example, output from Cellpose can take the form of a NumPy file (_seg.npy file), a .png, or Native ImageJ ROI archive output, and users can have chosen up to four channels. Until the field adopts a standardized file format, one flexible enough to account for all the variables of experimental interest, we currently believe it is more efficient to advise external groups on how to transform their specific data to be compatible with our generic import function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors provided highly detailed information for their segmentation strategy, but the same level of detail was not provided for the registration algorithms. Additional details would help users achieve optimal alignment.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this lack of detail. The registration strategy depends upon the WholeBrain (FÃ¼rth et al., 2018) package for registration to the Allen Mouse Common Coordinate Framework. While this strategy has been published and documented elsewhere, we have substantially revised our methods section on the registration process to better incorporate details of this approach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The authors illustrate registration to the Allen atlas. Can they comment on whether the algorithm is compatible with other atlases or with alternative sectioning planes (horizontal/sagittal)?</p></disp-quote><p>Since the current registration workflow integrates WholeBrain (FÃ¼rth et al., 2018), any limitations of WholeBrain apply to our approach, which means limited support for registering non-coronal sectioning planes and reliance on the Allen Mouse Atlas (Dong, 2008). However, network analysis and plotting functions are currently compatible with the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas and the Kim Unified Mouse Brain Atlas version (2019) (Chon et al., 2019). Therefore, current limitations in registration do not preclude the usefulness of the SMARTTR software in generating valuable insights from network analysis of externally imported datasets.</p><p>There are a number of alternative workflows, such as the QUINT workflow (Yates et al., 2019), that support multiple different mouse atlases, and registration of arbitrarily sectioned angles. We have plans to support and a facilitate an entry point for this workflow in a future iteration of SMARTTR, but believe it is of benefit to the wider community to release and support SMARTTR in its current state.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Supplemental Figures S10-13 do not have a legend panel to define the bar graphs.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this omission and have fixed our legends in our resubmission. Our supplement figure orders have changed and the corresponding figures are now Supplemental Figures S11-14.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) When images in a z-stack were collapsed, was this a max intensity projection or average? Assuming this question is in regards to our manual cell counting validation approach, the zstacks were collapsed as a maximum intensity projection.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) While I was able to install the SMARTR package, after trying for the better part of one hour, I could not install the &quot;mjin1812/wholebrain&quot; R package as instructed in OSF. I also could not find a function to load an example dataset to easily test SMARTR. So, unfortunately, I was unable to test out any of the packages for myself. Along with the currently broken &quot;tractatus/wholebrain&quot; package, this is a good example of why I would strongly encourage the authors to publish SMARTR on either Bioconductor or CRAN in the future. The high standards set by Bioc/CRAN will ensure that SMARTR is able to be easily installed and used across major operating systems for the long term.</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly thank the reviewer for pointing out this weakness; long-term maintenance of this package is certainly a mutual goal. Loading an .RDATA file is accomplished by either doubleclicking directly on the file in a directory window, after specifying this file type should be opened in RStudio or by using the load() function, (e.g., load(&quot;directory/example.RData&quot;)). We have now explicitly outlined these directions in the online documentation.</p><p>Moreover, we have recently submitted our package to CRAN and are currently working on revisions following comments. This has required a package rebranding to âSMARTTRâ, as there were naming conflicts with a previously archived repository on CRAN. Currently, SMARTTR is not dependent on the WholeBrain package, which remains optional for the registration portion of our workflow. Ultimately, this independence will allow us to maintain the analysis and visualization portion of the package independently.</p><p>In the meantime, we have fully revised our installation instructions (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mjin1812.github.io/SMARTTR/articles/SMARTTR">https://mjin1812.github.io/SMARTTR/articles/SMARTTR</ext-link>). SMARTTR is now downloadable from a CRAN-like repository as a bundled .tar.gz file, which should ease the burden of installation significantly. Installation has been verified on a number of different versions of R on different platforms. Again, we hope these changes are sufficient and improve the process of installation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The package is quite large (several thousand lines include comments and space). While impressive, this does inherently make the package more difficult to maintain - and the authors currently have not included any unit tests. The authors should add unit tests to cover a large percentage of the package to ensure code stability.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added unit testing to improve the reliability of our package. Unit tests now cover over 71% of our source code base and are available for evaluation on our github website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/mjin1812/SMARTTR">https://github.com/mjin1812/SMARTTR</ext-link>). We focused on coverage of the most front-facing functions. We appreciate this feedback, which has ultimately enhanced the longevity of our software.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Why do the authors choose to perform image segmentation outside of the SMARTTR package using ImageJ macros? Leading segmentation algorithms such as CellPose and StarMap have well-documented APIs that would be easy to wrap in R. They would likely be faster as well. As noted in the discussion, making SMARTTR a one-stop shop for multi-ensemble analyses would be more appealing to a user.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this feedback. We believe parts of our response to Reviewer 1, Comment 3, are relevant to this point. Interfaces for CellPose and ClusterMap (which processes in situ transcriptomic approaches, like STARmap) are both in python, and currently there are ways to call python from within R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/index.html">https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/index.html</ext-link>). We will certainly explore incorporating these APIs from R. However, we would anticipate this capability is more similar to âtranslationâ between programming languages, but would not currently preclude users from the issue of needing some familiarity with the capabilities of these python packages, and thus with python syntax.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Given the small number of observations for correlation analyses (n=6 per group), Pearson correlations would be highly susceptible to outliers. The authors chose to deal with potential outliers by dropping any subject per region that was&gt; 2 SDs from the group mean. Another way to get at this would be using Spearman correlation. How do these analyses change if you use Spearman correlation instead of Pearson? It would be a valuable addition for the author to include Spearman correlations as an option in SMARTTR.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewers for this suggestion and we have updated our code base to include the possibility for using Spearmanâs correlation coefficient as opposed to Pearsonâs correlation coefficient for heatmaps in the get_correlations() function. Users can now use the `method` parameter, set to either âpearsonâ or âspearmanâ and results will propagate throughout the rest of the analysis using these results.</p><p>Below, in Author response image 1 we show a visual comparison of the correlation heat maps for active eYFP<sup>+</sup> ensembles in the CT and IS groups using both Pearson and Spearman correlations. We see a strongly qualitative similarity between the heat maps. Of course, since the statistical assumptions underlying the relationship between variables using Pearson correlation (linear) vs Spearman correlation (monotonic) are different, users should take this into account when interpreting results using different approaches.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Pearson and Spearmen regional correlations of eYFP+ ensembles activity in the CT and IS groups.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-101327-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) I see the authors have incorporated the ability to adjust p-values in many of the analysis functions (and recommend the BH procedure) but did not use adjusted p-values for any of the analyses in the manuscript. Why is this? This is particularly relevant for the differential correlation analyses between groups (Figures 3P and 4P). Based on the un-adjusted pvalues, I assume few if any data points will still be significant after adjusting. While it's logical to highlight the regional correlations that strongly change between groups, the authors should caution which correlations are &quot;significant&quot; without adjusting for multiple comparisons. As this package now makes this analysis easily usable for all researchers, the authors should also provide better explanations for when and why to use adjusted p-values in the online documentation for new users.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the feedback note that our dataset is presented as a more demonstrative and exploratory resource for readers and, as such, we accept a high tolerance for false positives, while decreasing risk of missing possible interesting findings. As noted by Reviewer #2, it is still âlogical to highlight the regional correlations that strongly change between groups.â We have clarified in our methods that we chose to present uncorrected p-values when speaking of significance.</p><p>We have also removed any previous recommendations for preferred methods for multiple comparisons adjustment in our function documentations, as some previous documentation was outdated. Moreover, the standard multiple comparisons adjustment approaches assume complete independence between tests, whereas this assumption is violated in our differential correlational analysis (i.e., a region with one significantly altered connection is more likely than another to have another significantly altered connection).</p><p>Ultimately, the decision to correct for multiple comparisons with standard FDR, and choice of significance threshold, should still be informed by standard statistical theory and user-defined tolerance for inclusion of false-positives and missing of false-negatives. This will be influenced by factors, such as the nature and purpose of the study, and quality of the dataset.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The package was developed in R3.6.3. This is several years and one major version behind the current R version (4.4.3). Have the authors tested if this package runs on modern R versions? If not, this could be a significant hurdle for potential users.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewers for pointing out concerns regarding versioning. We have since updated our installation approach for SMARTTR, which is compatible with versions of R &gt;= 3.6 and has been tested on Mac ARM-based (Apple silicon) architecture (R v4.4.2), and Windows 10 (R v3.6.3, v4.5.0 [devel]).</p><p>The recommendation for users to install R 3.6.3 is primarily for those interested in using our full workflow, which requires installation of the WholeBrain package, which is currently a suggested package. We anticipate updating and supporting the visualization and network analysis capabilities, whilst maintaining previous versioning for the full workflow presented in this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) In the methods section: &quot;Networks were constructed using igraph and tidygraph packages.&quot; - As this is a core functionality of the package, it would be informative to specify the exact package versions, functions, and parameters for network construction.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewers for pointing out the necessity for these details for code reproducibility. We have since clarified our language in the manuscript on the exact functions we use in our analysis and package versions, which we also fully document in our online tutorial. Additionally. We have printed our package development and analysis environment online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mjin1812.github.io/SMARTTR/articles/Part7.Development">https://mjin1812.github.io/SMARTTR/articles/Part7.Development</ext-link>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) On page 11, &quot;Next, we examined the cross-correlations in IEG expression across brain regions, as strong co-activation or opposing activation can signify functional connectivity between two regions&quot; - cross-correlation is a specific analysis in signal processing. To avoid confusion, the authors should simply change this to &quot;correlations&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this potentially confusing phrasing. We have changed all instances of âcross-correlationâ to âcorrelationâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Panels Q-V are missing in Figure 5 caption.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this oversight.
