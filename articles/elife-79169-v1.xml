Current noninvasive methods to detect axonal damage in vivo are limited in their specificity and clinical applicability, and by the lack of proper validation. We aimed to validate an MRI framework based on multicompartment modeling of the diffusion signal (AxCaliber) in rats in the presence of axonal pathology, achieved through injection of a neurotoxin damaging the neuronal terminal of axons. We then applied the same MRI protocol to map axonal integrity in the brain of multiple sclerosis relapsing-remitting patients and age-matched healthy controls. AxCaliber is sensitive to acute axonal damage in rats, as demonstrated by a significant increase in the mean axonal caliber along the targeted tract, which correlated with neurofilament staining. Electron microscopy confirmed that increased mean axonal diameter is associated with acute axonal pathology. In humans with multiple sclerosis, we uncovered a diffuse increase in mean axonal caliber in most areas of the normal-appearing white matter, preferentially affecting patients with short disease duration. Our results demonstrate that MRI-based axonal diameter mapping is a sensitive and specific imaging biomarker that links noninvasive imaging contrasts with the underlying biological substrate, uncovering generalized axonal damage in multiple sclerosis as an early event.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>axonal pathology</kwd><kwd>multiple sclerosis</kwd><kwd>MRI</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH 1R21NS123419-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mainero</surname><given-names>Caterina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011033</institution-id><institution>Agencia Estatal de Investigación</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PID2021-128909NA-I00</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Santis</surname><given-names>Silvia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014440</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CEX2021-001165-S</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Santis</surname><given-names>Silvia</given-names></name><name><surname>Cerdán Cerdá</surname><given-names>Antonio</given-names></name><name><surname>Gomez-Sanchez</surname><given-names>Jose A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003359</institution-id><institution>Generalitat Valenciana</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SEJI/2019/038</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Santis</surname><given-names>Silvia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003359</institution-id><institution>Generalitat Valenciana</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CIDEGENT/2021/015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Santis</surname><given-names>Silvia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003359</institution-id><institution>Generalitat Valenciana</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ACIF/2020/301</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cerdán Cerdá</surname><given-names>Antonio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004587</institution-id><institution>Instituto de Salud Carlos III</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CP22/00078</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gomez-Sanchez</surname><given-names>Jose A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>MRI is sensitive to the increase in axonal caliber due to pathology and was used to detect widespread increase in the average axonal caliber in multiple sclerosis brains with short disease duration only.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Axonal damage is the main pathological substrate of irreversible neurological disability in multiple sclerosis (MS). In MS, axonal damage can either be direct or secondary to demyelination, glial activation, or exposure to excitatory amino acids and cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haines et al., 2011</xref>). As the transition to progressive MS occurs when an axonal loss threshold is reached, and the brain compensatory capacity is surpassed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Criste et al., 2014</xref>), the development of novel in vivo, noninvasive strategies for characterizing axonal microstructure becomes essential for early disease detection.</p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), particularly diffusion-based approaches, has been applied in MS to investigate the white matter (WM) damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Inglese and Bester, 2010</xref>). However, conventional diffusion MRI is unspecific to different tissue compartments, such as axons or myelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De Santis et al., 2014</xref>), hampering the ability to distinguish axonal damage from other microstructural changes. In addition, due to the limitations of quantitatively comparing in vivo to ex vivo data, validation of imaging findings is rarely performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Horowitz et al., 2015</xref>). While animal models recapitulating specific aspects of MS pathophysiology are available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Torkildsen et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Constantinescu et al., 2011</xref>), none focuses on axonal damage but rather on the demyelinating aspect of the disease.</p><p>AxCaliber is an advanced imaging framework able to estimate an MRI axonal diameter proxy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Assaf et al., 2008</xref>), which has become applicable in humans thanks to recent hardware advances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jones et al., 2018</xref>). AxCaliber has revealed a higher axonal diameter proxy in the normal-appearing WM (NAWM) of the corpus callosum of MS patients compared to healthy controls, which was interpreted as a sign of axonal damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2016</xref>). However, in its original formulation, AxCaliber is only applicable to voxels characterized by a single fiber orientation (such as the corpus callosum, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2016</xref>), while at least 70% of brain voxels contain two or more dominant fiber orientations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jeurissen et al., 2013</xref>). Recently, we used a modified AxCaliber model to map whole-brain MRI axonal diameter proxy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Santis et al., 2019b</xref>), hence providing a means to characterize the axonal damage in MS in a whole-brain fashion.</p><p>From a pathophysiological point of view, measuring a higher estimated MRI axonal diameter proxy in MS does not, per se, represent conclusive evidence of axonal damage, especially in the light of the known bias toward larger axons of MRI-based axonal diameter quantification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Horowitz et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, MRI sensitivity to axonal pathology is yet to be fully demonstrated to establish its clinical utility. Recently, an approach to selectively manipulate specific microstructural aspects of the parenchyma through targeted, unilateral injection of neurotoxic agents has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garcia-Hernandez et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we aimed to (i) validate AxCaliber-based axonal mapping in a preclinical model of fimbrial damage induced by stereotaxic injection of ibotenic acid into the hippocampus and (ii) translate the model to investigate changes in axonal microstructure in the brain white matter of patients with MS, particularly in normal-appearing tissue where pathological microstructural abnormalities have been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Luchicchi et al., 2021</xref>). Specifically, we (iia) compared whole-brain, voxelwise MRI axonal diameter proxy in MS patients relative to healthy controls and (iib) tested the association between clinical features and the MRI axonal diameter proxy in MS patients. We uncovered an abnormal increase in the MRI axonal diameter proxy in NAWM in MS, outside the inflammatory lesions, which was greater in patients with short disease duration, implicating axonal pathology as a primary event in MS pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A rat model of acute axonal damage</title><p>Fourteen days after injection of the neurotoxin ibotenic acid into the hippocampus, paired t-test revealed a significant increase in the mean MRI axonal diameter proxy (p=0.021) in the fimbria belonging to the injected hemisphere compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>), confirming that the damage affected a large portion of the tract.

We then applied the same MRI preclinical protocol to a cohort of patients with MS and age-matched healthy controls, uncovering diffuse axonal damage in the NAWM of MS patients that was inversely associated with disease duration.</p><p>Neuropathologically, early axonal damage in MS manifests through the formation of varicosities and spheroids that enlarge the axonal diameter and are associated with impaired axonal transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Criste et al., 2014</xref>). Accordingly, histological postmortem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bergers et al., 2002</xref>) and animal studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nikić et al., 2011</xref>) report an increase in the mean axonal diameter in MS compared to controls in demyelinating and non-demyelinating areas. This increase is also influenced by the higher vulnerability of smaller axons compared to larger ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tallantyre et al., 2010</xref>), which implies that smaller axons are lost earlier. Histological alterations in axonal morphology have also been observed in the NAWM of MS brain specimens in the absence of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Luchicchi et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting that an imbalance of axon-myelin units could represent the primary event in MS pathogenesis.</p><p>Based on neuropathological evidence, axonal damage in MS would reasonably manifest as an increase in axonal caliber measured with imaging. An increase in axonal diameter in MS was indeed reported in previous MRI studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2016</xref>), but the results were not validated. In the context of multicompartment models for diffusion signals, comparing imaging results with pathological evidence is fundamental to validate the model, as multicompartment models make numerous assumptions and simplifications (to cite a few: fixed diffusivities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander et al., 2010</xref>], no exchange [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lasič et al., 2011</xref>], indirect account of the volume occupied by myelin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Assaf et al., 2008</xref>]).</p><p>Previous studies reported correlations between the axonal diameter measured with MRI and axonal caliber estimated using electron microscopy in healthy tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barazany et al., 2009</xref>), but with a reduced sample size. In addition, none thus far have demonstrated that AxCaliber is sensitive to axonal damage. Quantitative comparison between MRI maps and stained sections is severely hampered by the fixation process and other limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Horowitz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barakovic et al., 2023</xref>); here, we used a well-characterized rodent model in which the axonal compartment is selectively damaged. This approach has been previously used to prove the capability of diffusion MRI to dissect astrocyte and microglia reactivity in gray matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garcia-Hernandez et al., 2022</xref>). Here, we detected increased neurofilament staining intensity in the damaged tract, demonstrating altered axonal morphology without alteration in the total amount of myelin. This change is picked up by MRI as an increase in the MRI axonal diameter proxy. Electron microscopy and axonal diameter quantification demonstrate that the increase observed in imaging reflects true morphological axonal alterations, hallmarks of axonal pathology. The significant correlation between neurofilament staining intensity and the MRI axonal diameter proxy further validates the imaging parameter as a marker of axonal damage, and is compatible with recent work studying the association of MRI metrics sensitive to axonal pathology and the serum neurofilament light chain biomarker in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rahmanzadeh et al., 2021</xref>). Overall, our preclinical results show that axonal diameter mapping through MRI can detect axonal pathology in vivo and can thus be used as a biomarker of axonal damage in MS and possibly other neurological diseases. These results are extremely important given the ongoing debate on the discrepancy between MRI axonal diameter proxy and axonal diameter measured in fixated tissue using electron microscopy. The fact that both MRI and STEM detect a significant increase in the axonal diameter reconciles such findings, demonstrating that while absolute quantification of axonal caliber might differ (with MRI consistently overestimating axonal diameter due to higher weightings of larger axons, and STEM consistently underestimating axonal diameter due to heavy tissue fixation, as shown by our shrinkage analysis), both are sensitive to the same underlying pathological phenomenon. In many clinical contexts, detecting differences in pathological versus healthy conditions is far more interesting and valuable than absolute quantification, and we firmly believe this result validates the use of MRI-based axonal diameter mapping. In addition, we quantified the shrinkage due to the sample processing as high as 39% in our preparation. While this value cannot be directly used to correct STEM quantification, due to possible different shrinkage of extra- and intracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barakovic et al., 2023</xref>), it partially explains the discrepancy between STEM and MRI axonal diameter proxy, validating even further the used framework. Since this is an often-disregarded issue, we believe that this piece of information would help future validation of MRI-based microstructural characterization.</p><p>Our work used an AxCaliber formulation that allows accounting for multiple fibers and thus accesses whole-brain axonal diameter mapping. Indeed, while previous findings focused on the corpus callosum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2016</xref>), our results indicate an increase in MRI axon diameter proxy in MS patients in all the major tracts, demonstrating diffuse axonal pathology in the NAWM. Notably, the combination of whole brain mapping and a larger sample size uncovered significant negative associations between MRI axonal diameter proxy and disease duration, suggesting enlarged axonal caliber as an early event in MS pathogenesis, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>. Other tested MRI parameters are not associated with disease duration. This result indicates that consolidated axonal loss can manifest as a reduction in axonal diameter, meaning that the increase in the MRI axonal diameter proxy observed in our MS population is a candidate marker for acute axonal damage. The presence of axonal pathology so early in the disease is an incredibly meaningful result that puts the spot of MS pathogenesis in degeneration rather than myelin loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Luchicchi et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The lack of significant correlations with clinical variables (EDSS and SDMT) can possibly be explained by a lack of power due to limited sample size or potentially compensatory phenomena in our MS population, mainly composed of patients with relatively low disease scores. Although out of the scope of this work, it would be interesting to assess whether the MRI axonal diameter proxy is associated with more relevant clinical measures like the disability progression independent of relapse activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Granziera et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>This study has some limitations. Despite some inevitable minor differences due to different brain sizes and magnet features, the human protocol was built to match the main characteristics of the preclinical diffusion sequence, such as the b-value and diffusion time range. The chosen b-value has been a compromise between sensitivity to small structures and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) achievable in vivo and in the MS population, as indicated by recent animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crater et al., 2022</xref>) and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jensen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McKinnon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moss et al., 2019</xref>) work, pointing at 3000–4000 s/mm<sup>2</sup> as the b-value for which the intra-axonal water signal starts to be observable. While some works question this value as too low to detect intra-axonal signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Veraart et al., 2020</xref>), our shrinkage analysis suggests that current estimated sizes fed into the calculation to determine the minimum b-value needed to measure axonal diameter through MRI, as the one reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Santis et al., 2016</xref>, should be updated. However, while feasible in vivo and in patients, this modest b-value is still suboptimal to measure axonal diameter, and higher b-values can boost the sensitivity to the intra-axonal compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Veraart et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barakovic et al., 2023</xref>). In this context, including spherical mean techniques might improve axonal diameter and intra-axonal diffusivity estimations by factoring out the effect of fibre distribution, and by providing better SNR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Veraart et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dhital et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In a subset of animals, we tested a protocol with a lower b-value and a simpler AxCaliber model (without diffusion time dependency), with the aim of facilitating future clinical AxCaliber studies. We found no qualitative differences in the outcome: MRI axonal diameter proxy was increased following fimbria damage. This result should be taken with caution due to possible predominance of extra-axonal signal as a confounding factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burcaw et al., 2015</xref>); thus, further work and perhaps more realistic simulations, considering real cell composition and morphology, are needed to clarify this issue.</p><p>We must emphasize that our quantification of the axonal diameter distribution is conducted through a Poisson distribution, which utilizes a single parameter to define both the average and dispersion. Consequently, our current methodology does not permit us to ascertain whether the observed increase is attributable to a preferential loss of small caliber axons or axonal swelling. Future investigations employing a more comprehensive experimental protocol and higher b-value, possibly using non-parametric estimates as done by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Romascano et al., 2020</xref>, may provide the opportunity to measure the full diameter distribution, thereby offering more detailed insights into the underlying pathology.</p><p>In addition, the AxCaliber model does not take into account fiber dispersion present in the white matter. While some work point at modest values of dispersion at least in single-fiber areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mollink et al., 2017</xref>), other measured values as high as 20 degrees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ronen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). While it is reasonable to expect that some axonal directional dispersion in areas of a single fiber is likely accounted for by the second fiber population, possibly mitigating the effect, future work should include spherical mean techniques to fully remove this bias.</p><p>It is important to stress that the aim of this work is not to propose a new animal model of MS, a disease that only affects humans, but rather to validate axonal damage detection (independently from the pathology that has induced it) through noninvasive MRI, and apply the framework to characterize axonal pathology in MS. The same innovative validation framework proposed here can be used in the future to dissect the sensitivity of other more refined methods to detect axonal pathology.</p><p>We cannot exclude that other pathological processes including glial activation and gliosis could have contributed, at least in part, to the observed changes in diffusion measures. However, in contrast to our findings of axonal swelling, these processes tend to increase with advancing of disease duration and stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gallego-Delgado et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, pathological glial changes in MS do not occur in isolation but often in association with axonal changes. Future diffusion models combining estimates of changes either in soma or fiber diameter and density could help further elucidate this aspect.</p><p>Last, the method has been demonstrated preclinically only looking at one specific tract (the fimbria, as the tract with the largest number of hippocampal projections in the rat); however, it would be straightforward to extrapolate our results to other tracts. Future studies are needed to demonstrate this.</p><p>In conclusion, given the central role of axonal pathology in MS, developing and validating strategies for early detection of axonal damage, in vivo and noninvasively, is of high priority; our results have the potential to improve early detection and monitoring of axonal pathology in the disease, as well as provide a novel imaging marker for monitoring the effects of treatments on the progression of axonal degeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal preparation</title><p>Animal preparation (n=19 rodents) was carried out as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garcia-Hernandez et al., 2022</xref>).

Electron microscopy was used to quantify axonal diameter and count in the fimbriae.

The slices were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies against myelin basic protein (1:250 Millipore Cat# MAB384-1ML, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_240837">AB_240837</ext-link>), neurofilament 160 kD medium (1:250, Abcam Cat# ab134458, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2860025">AB_2860025</ext-link>) and NeuN (1:250, Millipore Cat# MAB377, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2298772">AB_2298772</ext-link>) to label myelin, axonal processes and nuclei, respectively. The sections were subsequently incubated in specific secondary antibodies conjugated to the fluorescent probes, each at 1:500 (Molecular Probes Cat# A-11029, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2534088">AB_2534088</ext-link>; Molecular Probes Cat# A-11042, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2534099">AB_2534099</ext-link>) for 2 hr at room temperature. Sections were then treated with 4′,6-Diamidine-2′-phenylindole dihydrochloride at 15 mM (DAPI, Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 min at room temperature. Finally, sections were mounted on slides and covered with an anti-fading medium using a mix solution 1:10 Propyl-gallate: Mowiol (P3130, Sigma-Aldrich; 475904, MERCK-Millipore, Massachusetts, United States). For myelin labeling, antigen retrieval was performed in 1% citrate buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich) warmed to 80 °C for protein unmasking.</p><p>The tissue sections were then examined using a computer-assisted morphometry system consisting of a Leica DM4000 fluorescence microscope equipped with a QICAM Qimaging camera 22577 (Biocompare, San Francisco, USA) and Neurolucida morphometric software (MBF, Biosciences, VT, USA). Myelin, neurofilament and neural nuclei fluorescent analysis was performed using Icy software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Chaumont et al., 2012</xref>). For neural nuclei, two ROIs of 200 µm<sup>2</sup> were placed per hippocampus per hemisphere in at least 5 slices per rat to obtain the corresponding intensity values. Similarly, for MBP and neurofilaments, an ROI of 400 µm<sup>2</sup> was placed per fimbria per hemisphere in at least 5 slices per rat.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Tissue processing for electron microscopy</title><p>Rats were deeply anesthetized with a lethal dose of sodium pentobarbital, 46 mg/kg, injected intraperitoneally (Dolethal, E.V.S.A. laboratories., Madrid, Spain). Afterwards, rats were transcardially perfused with 100 ml of 0.9% PBS and 100 ml of a fixative solution containing 2% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.3) (Electron Microscopy Science, USA). The brains were quickly removed and postfixed overnight in the same fixative solution at 4 °C. The following day, the brains were washed with 0.1 M cacodylate buffer. Subsequently, the fixed brains were sliced into 250-µm-thick horizontal sections using a vibratome (Leica VT1000S, Germany). The sections were collected in cacodylate buffer, and those containing the fimbria were washed three times with 0.1 M cacodylate buffer for 15 minutes each, and subsequently postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer for 1.5 hr at 4 °C. The tissue was then washed in distilled water twice for 15 min each and dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol solutions, followed by propylene oxide. The sections were then infiltrated with a mixture of propylene oxide and Agar 100 embedding resin (Agar Scientific, UK) for 2 hr at room temperature, and then placed in fresh embedding resin overnight at room temperature. The following day, the samples were transferred to fresh embedding resin and polymerized for 30 hr at 60 °C in flat silicon moulds. Ultrathin sections (90 nm) were cut using an ultramicrotome (Leica UC7) and placed on formvar-coated copper slot grids. The ultrathin sections were then stained with lead citrate and imaged using STEM on a scanning electron microscope (Zeiss GeminiSEM 460, Germany).</p><p>Photos were binarized, and axons were quantified semiautomatically by two operators blind to animals and conditions (ACC and SDS). While the cell’s inner area is detected automatically using the MATLAB function <italic>bwconncomp</italic>, nonaxonal structures are eliminated via visual screening. Six photos per condition per animal were analyzed, generating a total segmented number of axons of 12272. Axonal diameter and count were compared across conditions using an unpaired t test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Volume measurements</title><p>Volume measurements were taken using high-resolution T2-weighted images for in vivo conditions. Four different measurements were obtained for ex vivo conditions: immediately after perfusion, and at 4-, 7-, and 10 days post-perfusion. The volumes were extracted as follows: in vivo volumes were calculated by counting the number of voxels corresponding to brain tissue in the high-resolution T2-weighted images, multiplied by the voxel volume. The volume of the perfused brains was measured using Archimedes’ principle. Briefly, a predetermined volume of fresh fixative solution was placed in a test tube, and the fixed brain was inserted into it. The difference between the final and initial volumes was considered as the volume occupied by the brain.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Paired t tests were used to assess the differences in histological quantities between injected versus control hemispheres. Diffusion-weighted rat MRI data were preprocessed as described here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Santis et al., 2019a</xref>). The mean signal-to-noise (SNR) of the b0 images, calculated according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aja-Fernández et al., 2015</xref> was 11.2 for rats (fimbria average) and 17.3 for humans (white matter average). We also tested an alternative method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Koay and Basser, 2006</xref>) for SNR calculation. While the average SNR quantification was very similar between the two approaches, in the Koay and Basser SNR maps we observed artefacts due to the iterative process, so we decided to use the method by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aja-Fernández et al., 2015</xref>.</p><p>Human diffusion-weighted MRI data were preprocessed with software tools in FreeSurfer V5.3.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu">https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu</ext-link>) and FSL V5.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk">https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk</ext-link>). Preprocessing included gradient nonlinearity correction, motion correction, and eddy current correction, including corresponding b-matrix reorientation. Additional preprocessing details are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.humanconnectome.org/">http://www.humanconnectome.org/</ext-link>. In both rats and humans, MRI data were employed to fit the AxCaliber model using in-house software written in MATLAB R2015b (The Mathworks) to extract the average axonal diameter proxy. The theoretical framework described here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Santis et al., 2019b</xref>) was modified to include the dependency of the extra-axonal signal on the diffusion time through a linear term, in the form D<sup>RADIAL</sup><sub>ΔMIN</sub>+slope*(D- D<sub>MIN</sub>). While this is a simplification of the proposed Δ dependency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burcaw et al., 2015</xref>), we believe that it is a parsimonious choice that is supported by the relatively short range of Δ values explored as compared to previous work exploring time dependency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Santis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fieremans et al., 2016</xref>), and also by comparison of a linear with a non-linear model in our data through a Bayesian information criterion (BIC), which preferred a linear fit over the expression used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Santis et al., 2016</xref> in 100% of the subjects. The comparison between the two functional forms fitted to the radial diffusivity for the dataset acquired with the lower b-value protocol is reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>. The fit is implemented through a cascade model as done in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harms et al., 2017</xref>, so that an initial CHARMED fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Assaf and Basser, 2005</xref>) is performed using the data acquired at the shorter diffusion time to initialize the volume fractions. The intra-axonal axial diffusivity and the main fiber orientations are estimated through the CHARMED fit and kept fixed in the AxCaliber fit. The radial diffusivity (at the shortest Δ) in the extra-axonal compartment is first modelled using the tortuosity approximation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>), and then this constraint is released in a last iteration of model fitting where everything in the model is fixed except for the radial diffusivity and the noise factor. As such, the fitted parameters are: the restricted main orientations and fractions, the intra-axonal axial diffusivity, the extra-axonal radial diffusivity, the slope of the extra-axonal radial diffusivity decay for increasing Δ, the axonal diameter and the Rician noise term. For STEAM data, an additional T1 decay is included in the fit. The BIC preferred a mono-exponential T1 decay over a bi-exponential decay in 98% of the examined voxels. Simulations using Rician noise were run on 10^5 different combinations of parameters sampled randomly from a uniform distribution in the following ranges: axonal diameter 0.5–5 μm, volume fraction 0.1–0.5, intra-axonal axial diffusivity 0.7–2.2x10<sup>–3</sup> mm<sup>2</sup>/s. The simulations were repeated with a narrower range of intra-axonal axial diffusivity (1.7–2.2x10<sup>–3</sup> mm<sup>2</sup>/s) matching more closely the scenario proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dhital et al., 2019</xref>. Each configuration was simulated 10 times by adding different Rician random noise with two different values of SNRs, matching human and animal acquisitions. The results demonstrate excellent agreement between ground truth and fitted axonal diameter for both human and animal acquisitions: <italic>r</italic>=0.90 and 0.75 respectively for a single repetition, <italic>r</italic>=0.98 and 0.95 respectively for 10 repetitions, and <italic>r</italic>=0.92 and 0.79 respectively for the narrower intraaxonal axial diffusivity range. The simulations are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p>For all MS patients, lesion masks were segmented on the FLAIR images using a semiautomated method (3D-Slicer v4.2.0; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.slicer.org">https://www.slicer.org</ext-link>).</p><p>In rats, the fimbria was reconstructed bilaterally using the DTI-based tractography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) algorithm in the software ExploreDTI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leemans et al., 2009</xref>), which was set to employ the lowest Δ and b-value. Mean axonal diameter values along the tracts were obtained for each animal in both hemispheres. Injection sites were aligned and considered the origin of the analyzed tract portion. Paired t tests were used to assess differences in the axonal diameter between the injected and contralateral fimbria, and repeated-measure ANOVA (factors: tract location, treatment (ibotenic acid <italic>vs</italic>. saline) and tract location*treatment) was used to assess the effect of ibotenic acid injection. p-Values were corrected according to Greenhouse-Geisser approach when sphericity assumption was not met. Post-hoc comparisons between treatment for each tract location were corrected for multiple comparisons according to the false discovery rate approach.</p><p>For groupwise analysis of NAWM, we employed a previously detailed approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Santis et al., 2019a</xref>). Briefly, fractional anisotropy maps (calculated using the lowest Δ and b-value) were employed to initialize the first steps of an improved version of the TBSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Smith et al., 2006</xref>). This version performs the coregistration steps using extremely accurate tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Klein et al., 2009</xref>). The warping procedure accounts for lesion masks by excluding them from the similarity metric calculation, a permutation-based nonparametric inference approach to general linear modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Winkler et al., 2014</xref>). We tested for a general linear model comprising group and disease duration as regressors. Our hypothesis, compatible with postmortem evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Luchicchi et al., 2021</xref>), is that axonal blistering is an early event in the disease. Lesion masks were excluded from the statistical analysis, and multiple comparisons across clusters were controlled for by using threshold-free cluster enhancement. In addition, we tested for voxelwise associations of axonal diameter with EDSS and SDMT in MS patients only. Lastly, we calculate the average MRI axonal diameter proxy of each subject in the whole white matter (excluding lesions in MS) and compared the average across the three groups: healthy controls, MS with less than 5 years of disease duration, and MS with 5 or more years of disease duration.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Software, Visualization, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Software, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Resources, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Software, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>The local institutional review board at the Massachussets General Hospital approved this study, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Instituto de Neurociencias de Alicante, Alicante, Spain, and comply with the Spanish (law 32/2007) and European regulations (EU directive 86/609, EU decree 2001-486, and EU recommendation 2007/526/EC; Project MRI-STRUCTURE 677/2018).

measure of axonal diameter that is derived from magnetic resonance imaging. The results are solid, demonstrating alterations in the proxy measure in rodent models of axonal damage and patients with multiple sclerosis.

What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the paper &quot;A translational MRI approach to validate acute axonal damage detection in multiple sclerosis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous. We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Specifically, the reviewers were concerned that the validation is limited by not having a more direct measure of axon diameter. Moreover, the pathological mechanisms are not sufficiently well matched between the rodent model and human disease to draw strong conclusions. As such, the reviewers feel the manuscript is of value but would be better suited to a specialized imaging journal.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The rodent protocol used single-shot EPI, long diffusion times, long echo times, and low b-values.

It is not clear in the 'Animal preparation' section that this is what is intended – this only becomes clear in the 'Data analysis' section. Is it well established that this is a robust control (e.g., that the other hemisphere is entirely unaffected)? Similarly, it is only in the 'Data analysis' section that it is clear that saline injection is used in the control hemisphere, whereas the 'Animal preparation' section refers to 'saline and ibotenic acid' as if it is a single injection.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is an interesting paper that sets out to validate the use of AxCaliber as a non-invasive quantification of axonal diameter. This goal is of great importance, especially in the context of pathology. It seems to me, however, that they have missed an opportunity by not comparing the MRI measures with some actual axonal diameter measurement based on electron or confocal microscopy. Such measurements would significantly strengthen the paper and provide some evidence that the diffusion-derived measures reflect actual axonal swelling. It is difficult to interpret the data presented: we have evidence of neurodegeneration, which correlates with estimated axonal diameter, but it is possible that what results in increased estimated diameter might be affected by other effects, e.g., gliosis. So, while the data are very interesting, they are not conclusive, and the Authors should acknowledge that clearly, and explore alternative explanations in their discussion.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1. In the abstract, the final statement should be toned down, in light of the above comments.</p><p>2. The mean axonal diameter reported for both, rats and humans, appears very large, suggesting that the modified AxCaliber is only sensitive to the rightmost tail of the distribution. Can the Authors comment on this?</p><p>3. The correlation between fluorescence intensity and axonal diameter is intriguing, but the 2 quantities measure different things. Perhaps it would be more convincing to look at the left vs right difference in both quantities – are the normalised differences also correlated?</p><p>4. For the results shown in Figure 4, please state clearly how the statistical comparison and correction for multiple comparisons were conducted.</p><p>5. On page 9, the authors state that they performed some ROI analysis – how were the ROIs picked? Were these chosen a priori or after the whole brain analysis (TBSS)?</p><p>6. Discussion: please explore alternative potential explanations than an actual axonal diameter increase. While the paper cited to support the possibility of axonal swelling or the formation of spheroids are very interesting, some of these occurrences are the consequence of axonal transaction, which can happen within MS lesions, but unlikely to occur in the NAWM. Is it possible that some kind of bias in the model leads other tissue changes to mimic axonal diameter enlargement?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. To validate the dMRI protocol and model fitting, authors should (1) perform Monte Carlo simulations of diffusion in realistic substrates or (2) compare dMRI results with axon diameter based on histology, such as electron microscopy. Author should also perform noise propagation to evaluate the accuracy and precision of model fitting.</p><p>2. In addition to the use of strong diffusion weighting, it is also possible to maximize the dMRI signal sensitivity to axon diameter by tuning the gradient pulse width, rather than varying the diffusion time alone (time interval between gradient pulse pair). As suggested in [Neuman, JCP 1974], the signal decay due to intra-axonal restricted diffusion is roughly proportional to the pulse width and almost independent of the diffusion time.</p><p>3. To account for the fiber orientation dispersion, spherically averaged signals of dMRI could be used to estimate the axon diameter, as in [Veraart et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2020].</p><p>4. The AxCaliber model provides not only the axon diameter estimate but also intra-cellular volume fraction. The value of the volume fraction and its correlation with the histology are valuable and should be reported as well.</p><p>5. Authors did not discuss other confounding factors of axon diameter mapping using dMRI, such as the tortuous/undulating axonal shape and the diffusivity time-dependence in extra-cellular space. Ignoring these factors could lead to overestimation of axon size. It is indeed difficult to design a model to accommodate all these factors, but they should be discussed.</p><p>6. Some sequence parameters of dMRI are missing, such as the gradient pulse width, partial Fourier factor, spin echo or stimulated echo, maximal gradient strength in animal scan, and acceleration factor of parallel imaging and simultaneous multi-slice if needed.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A translational MRI approach to validate acute axonal damage detection in multiple sclerosis&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Timothy Behrens (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>For this study, the experimental data and findings in animals and humans are valuable. However, Reviewer 3 notes that the interpretation and model fitting are problematic.</p><p>i) Given that the myelinated axon diameter is &lt; 1.5 micron in histology, the observed diffusion signal time-dependence (~20%) cannot be explained by restricted diffusion in thin axons (~0.1%). Extra-cellular diffusivity time-dependence could be a more reasonable interpretation.</p><p>ii) In the response 3.5, the SNR for human and rat scans is 13.2 and 7.3 in b0 image. It is surprisingly low and hard to believe that it is possible to estimate axon size under such low SNR. Their noise propagation also shows the problem.</p><p>For the paper to be publishable, the authors will need to reconsider the interpretation and the fitted model.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors performed time-dependent diffusion MR and histology in the animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS) to demonstrate the correlation of MR estimated axon diameter index and histological findings. Further, they applied the same technique to MS patients and observed the axon size increase in the early event of MS. This study is of interest for researchers studying the microstructural changes in MS and neurodegeneration. The observation of correlation between histology and the diffusion time-dependence is exciting; however, the optimization of the MRI protocol design, the implementation of model fitting, and the interpretation of the observed diffusion time-dependence are problematic. The acquisition protocol of diffusion MR is not optimal for the axon diameter estimation; in fact, it is probably more sensitive to the extra-cellular MR signal contrast. The assumptions in the proposed diffusion MR model were not detailed in this study and even in their previous studies, and the signal-to-noise ratio in the data was not high enough for a reliable fitting. The observed diffusion time-dependence could be interpreted as the result of beadings along axons, packing geometry in extra-cellular space, and the water exchange due to T1 weighting alterations with mixing times of the stimulated echo sequence in animal scans. Given that the absolute value of axon size estimation was different in histology (0.7 micron) and diffusion MR (4 micron) by a factor of ~6, the interpretation of diffusion time-dependence as a result of restricted diffusion inside axons was questionable.</p><p>1. The major concern is that the sequence parameter in diffusion MR is not optimal to estimate the axon diameter. At low b-value &lt; = 4000 s/mm2, it is quite impossible to have enough signal decay due to restricted diffusion inside axons [Burcaw et al., NeuroImage 0215], let alone detecting the signal time-dependence in intra-cellular space. In fact, at low b-value, most of the signal decay and signal time-dependence is contributed by the hindered diffusion in extra-cellular space [Fieremans et al., NeuroImage 2016]. Furthermore, the intra-cellular signal time-dependence largely depends on the pulse width, not the diffusion time [Neuman, JCP 1974]. Authors tried to cite the study of Axon Spectrum Imaging [Gast et al., Neuroinformatics 2023] to support their protocol design of varying diffusion time at low b-value. However, Gast et al. did not apply the AxCaliber model (diffusion narrowing regime) to estimate axon size. Actually, Gast et al. applied the assumption of intra-cellular diffusion in narrow pulse limit, and neglected the diffusion time-dependence in extra-cellular space, which has been shown as the dominant source of diffusion time-dependence at low b-values. This problem has been well recognized and further solved in previous studies [Veraart et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2020; Fan et al., NeuroImage 2020], where the high b-value data (b-value &gt; 15,000 s/mm2) were included for the model fitting.</p><p>2. Authors mentioned that, at low b-value, intra-axonal &quot;signal&quot; dominates. However, at low b-value, extra-axonal &quot;signal decay/signal contrast&quot; and &quot;signal time-dependence&quot; dominate (Figure 4 in [De Santis et al., 2016]). A simple calculation could indicate whether authors may misinterpret the extra-cellular signal time-dependence as intra-cellular one. For the in vivo rat MR protocol, the signal time-dependence of intra-axonal model is 20.3% for an axon diameter = 4 micron (Figure 1e) and intrinsic diffusivity = 3 um2/ms using Neuman's model, and the signal time-dependence of extra-axonal model is 19.5% for a strength of time-dependence = 0.5 micron<sup>2</sup> using a log(time)/time model [Burcaw et al., 2015].</p><p>3. It is required to apply many assumptions to fit the modified AxCaliber model [De Santis et al., 2016b] to diffusion data with only two b-values at three diffusion times. For example, did authors fix the value of axial diffusivity in intra- and extra-axonal space? Did authors apply the tortuosity relation in extra-cellular space to reduce the number of parameters [Zhang et al., NeuroImage 2010]? What is the value of intrinsic diffusivity in intra-cellular space? How many parameters were fitted exactly in each voxel with 1-3 fiber tracts? These assumptions were not explained even in the previous study [De Santis 2016b].</p><p>4. The applicability of the model fitting at a typical SNR (~20) on Connectome scanner should be tested by the noise propagation. In the previous revision 3.5, the noise propagation was tested at only 4 diameter values, and the mean value of 10<sup>4</sup> repetitions matched the ground truth value. However, the mean value of 10<sup>4</sup> repetitions for each diameter value is the result of SNR = 20*sqrt(10<sup>4</sup>) = 2000. The wide histogram of fitting result actually indicates the low precision in the model fitting. To perform the noise propagation, authors should apply many different parameter combinations (for example, 10<sup>5</sup>) with diameter, volume fraction, and extra-cellular diffusivity varied in wide ranges.</p><p>5. The modified AxCaliber model was validated by the in vivo rat brain scan, where the stimulated echo sequence was applied. However, the diffusion signal measured by stimulated echo had varying T1-weighting due to the varying diffusion time and mixing time. If the non-diffusion weighted signal (b0 signal) was mono-exponential decay with the mixing time, this T1-weighting could be canceled out via dividing DW signals by b0 signal. If the b0 signal was not mono-exponential decay, the T1-weighting variation between multiple compartments (e.g., water around myelin and water away from myelin) could lead to spurious &quot;diffusion&quot; time-dependence that was related with T1-weighting and exchange. It is essential to confirm that the b0 signal is mono-exponential decay with the mixing time in white matter, where the b0 signal decay is usually bi-exponential with the mixing time.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A translational MRI approach to validate acute axonal damage detection in multiple sclerosis&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Timothy Behrens (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>It is clear that the review process is converging. As you'll see, Reviewer 3 requests a few further clarifications of the study alongside some requests for limitations to be covered in the Discussion. If you are able to make changes for each of these requested comments, then we will hopefully be able to handle these as editors without the need to return to reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors in general did a great job to improve the manuscript. However, some important information about the model and results was only mentioned in the revision but not shown in detail. It is essential to include these details in either Methods or supplementary materials to support their arguments in this study. More specific concerns are given below:</p><p>1. Comment R3.1: Authors performed a simple CHARMED experiment and got the value of intra-cellular axial diffusivity close to 0.7-1 um2/ms, different from the values 2.25 um2/ms in previous studies (Dhital et al., NeuroImage 2019, 189:543 and more). This is because the inclusion of multiple highly aligned fiber bundles only factors out the fiber crossing, but not the angular dispersion in each fiber bundle. This dispersion is non-trivial even in highly aligned white matter, such as corpus callosum (~ 20-25 degree dispersion in Ronen et al., BSAF 2014, 219:1773 and Lee et al., BASF 2019, 224:1469). This is the reason why people start to use the spherical mean signal to factor out both fiber crossing and fiber dispersion for the axonal diameter mapping. This should be included in the limitation.</p><p>2. Comment R3.2: For the time-dependence of extra-cellular radial diffusivity, authors used a linear time-dependent model and suggested that the linear time-dependent model has better goodness of fit than the well-known [log(Δ/δ)+3/2]/(Δ-δ/3) model in previous studies (Burcaw et al., NeuroImage 2015 and more). What is the functional form of the linear model? Is it 1/Δ? Does it really matter to use the spurious linear model, instead of the validated log(t)/t model? For the time dependence on page 20, does the δ indicate the pulse width or the diffusion time (inter-pulse duration)? In addition, the authors did not show any results related to the fit parameters of this extra-cellular linear model for time-dependence.</p><p>3. Comment R3.4: Authors showed the noise propagation of their axonal diameter model at the SNR of 17.3 (human) and 11.2 (animal). It shows that the resolution limit of the smallest detectable axonal diameter is about 1.5 micron (kind of smaller than expected at the given SNR). However, each parameter combination was repeated 10 times with different Rician noise realizations at the same SNR. Why did authors repeat it 10 times with different Rician noise realizations? Were the 10 fitting results averaged in any way (mean, median, or other selection method)? It sounds like the SNR is boosted by a factor of sqrt(10).</p><p>4. Comment R3.4 (continued): The fitting algorithm is a little convoluted and difficult to understand now. I strongly suggest sharing the code of the model fitting and noise propagation online on a public repository.</p><p>5. Comment E.2: The relation of true signal A and Rician-biased signal E(M) was explained in Koay and Basser JMR 2006, where Equation 13 shows {E(M)}<sup>2</sup> ~ = A<sup>2</sup> + σ_Rician<sup>2</sup> at high SNR. The σ_Rician<sup>2</sup> does not have a factor of 2. In the response of comment E.2, authors used the equation for E(M<sup>2</sup>). However, the magnitude signal is E(M), not sqrt{E(M<sup>2</sup>)}. Therefore, authors should cite and use the relations in Koay and Basser JMR 2006 to correct and estimate the SNR, though it may not affect the numerical results significantly.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79169.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: The authors appealed the original decision.

While we agree that there was room to boost the performance of the preclinical scanner, we chose to match (as well as possible, despite inevitable minor differences) the two experimental paradigms (clinical and preclinical) to support the idea that if the MRI approach can detect axonal pathology in rats, where validation is available, then we can reasonably infer that it can also detect it in humans. Importantly, we would like to stress that the rodent data are also acquired in vivo, and no fixation is performed; therefore, there is no need to adjust the b-value to compensate for the slower dynamics in fixed tissue. We have clarified this point in the text.</p><p>Regarding our choice of b=4000 s/mm2, we would like to support it with recent bibliography. Indeed, the chosen b-value has been a compromise between sensitivity to small structures and SNR, as indicated by recent animal (Crater et al., 2022) and human (Jensen et al., 2016; McKinnon et al., 2017; Moss et al., 2019) work, pointing at 3000-4000 s/mm2 as the b-value for which the intra-axonal water signal is dominant. In addition, a paper from the laboratory that first developed the Axcaliber method recently came out (DOI: 10.1007/s12021-02309630-w) demonstrating that an MRI protocol with a maximum b-value between 3000 and 4000 s/mm2 is sufficient to capture, in vivo and in humans, various well-known aspects of axonal morphometry (e.g., the corpus callosum axon diameter variation) as well as other aspects that are less explored (e.g., axon diameter-based separation of the superior longitudinal fasciculus into segments). The same paper contains resources and further bibliography supporting that the contribution of intra-axonal water to restricted diffusion signals dominates other factors (see Online Resource 1, section A of the same paper). To challenge this recent evidence from a neurobiological perspective, we include in the supplementary material a subset of experiments in animals with lower maximum b-value (2500 s/mm2, Figure S1), where we are able to detect the same effect of increased MRI axonal diameter proxy in the injected hemisphere compared to control.</p><p>Changes in the manuscript</p><p>– Discussion, pag. 12:</p><p>“Despite some inevitable minor differences due to different brain sizes and magnet features, the human protocol was built to match the main characteristics of the preclinical diffusion sequence, such as the b-value and diffusion time range.

However, following recent work supporting sensitivity of diffusion-weighted MRI to axonal diameter even at lower b-values (Gast et al., 2023), we tested a protocol with a lower b-value in a subset of animals, with the aim of facilitating future clinical AxCaliber studies. We found no qualitative differences in the outcome (MRI axonal diameter proxy was increased following fimbria damage). Further work and perhaps more realistic simulations, considering real cell composition and morphology, are needed to clarify this issue.”</p><p>– Materials and methods, pag. 13:</p><p>“Fourteen days after surgery, rats underwent MRI scans in vivo using the AxCaliber protocol and were immediately perfused.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The units reported in Figure 1d (mm) are wrong.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for spotting this.

Using electron microscopy, we found that due to neurodegeneration, axonal damage is reflected as an increase in axon diameter (new Figure 3). We believe that these recent findings strongly support the validation of our noninvasive diffusion MRI estimates of axon diameter alterations as an early-stage hallmark of axonal pathology in MS.</p><p>The reviewer suggests gliosis as a possible additional mechanism affecting axonal diameter estimation in our preclinical model and in humans. We believe that this argument is extremely valid and have therefore discussed it in the text. Glial activation is a theme of extreme interest in our laboratory, we recently published a paper demonstrating the sensitivity of DW-MRI in gray matter to glial activation (Garcia-Hernandez et al., Science Adv 2022). We believe that this issue should be addressed properly with new experiments and models, starting by including a glia compartment in the white matter model. While this is out of the scope of the present work, we now discuss the issue of gliosis as a possible confound in the paper. In this regard, we would like to point out that in our electron microscopy data, when comparing the density of segmented axons across groups, we see no significant differences (see Figure 3 panel c, right plot), which would stand against the hypothesis of cell (other than axons) swelling.</p><p>Changes in the manuscript</p><p>– Discussion, pag. 12:</p><p>“We cannot exclude that other pathological processes including glial activation and gliosis could have contributed, at least in part, to the observed changes in diffusion measures. However, in contrast to our findings of axonal swelling, these processes tend to increase with advancing of disease duration and stage (Gallego-Delgado et al., 2020). Additionally, pathological glial changes in MS do not occur in isolation but often in association with axonal changes. Future diffusion models combining estimates of changes either in soma or fiber diameter and density could help further elucidating this aspect.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1.

Discussion: please explore alternative potential explanations than an actual axonal diameter increase. While the paper cited to support the possibility of axonal swelling or the formation of spheroids are very interesting, some of these occurrences are the consequence of axonal transaction, which can happen within MS lesions, but unlikely to occur in the NAWM. Is it possible that some kind of bias in the model leads other tissue changes to mimic axonal diameter enlargement?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful comment. While the new electron microscopy paradigm gives strength to the presence of axonal swelling in MS by establishing a clearer translation between preclinical and clinical imaging results, we agree on the need to discuss other potential explanations such as cell swelling due to gliosis (see also comment 2.2).</p><p>Changes in the manuscript</p><p>– Discussion, pag. 12:</p><p>“We cannot exclude that other pathological processes including glial activation and gliosis could have contributed, at least in part, to the observed changes in diffusion measures.

Additionally, pathological glial changes in MS do not occur in isolation but often in association with axonal changes. Future diffusion models combining estimates of changes either in soma or fiber diameter and density could help further elucidating this aspect.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. To validate the dMRI protocol and model fitting, authors should (1) perform Monte Carlo simulations of diffusion in realistic substrates or (2) compare dMRI results with axon diameter based on histology, such as electron microscopy. Author should also perform noise propagation to evaluate the accuracy and precision of model fitting.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment, which triggered an additional analysis that we believe has added further value to the paper. Using electron microscopy, we found that following ibotenic injections, axonal damage is indeed reflected as an increase in axon diameter (new Figure 3). We believe that these recent findings strongly support the validation of our noninvasive diffusion MRI estimates of axon diameter swelling.</p><p>While we would like to remark that we use a framework originally proposed and validated (in terms of accuracy/precision) by the group of Assaf when originally implemented, we agree on the importance of showing the performance of the framework in our specific setting, especially its robustness to noise. Noise is modelled through a variable (the background noise level) that is estimated as an additional free parameter in the fit, as proposed in the original papers by Assaf (2004,2005 and 2008). When calculating this parameter in our preclinical and clinical data, we obtain an average of 0.0754 +/- 0.0083 (humans, in the whole white matter) and 0.137 +/- 0.0169 (rats, in whole fimbria). Please note that this value represents the proportion of noise when the total signal amplitude is normalized to 1, thus confirming that (i) noise is a small proportion of the total signal (&lt;8% and &lt;14%, respectively), and (ii) clinical data, as expected, have higher SNR. We then run simulations by generating the MRI signal for varying axonal diameter in the physiological range (1-4 µm), add noise matching the same SNR measured in our preclinical and clinical data, and check that the histograms of the obtained axonal diameters (calculated over 104 noisy repetitions) correctly match the gold standard value.

In addition to the use of strong diffusion weighting, it is also possible to maximize the dMRI signal sensitivity to axon diameter by tuning the gradient pulse width, rather than varying the diffusion time alone (time interval between gradient pulse pair).

Further, they applied the same technique to MS patients and observed the axon size increase in the early event of MS. This study is of interest for researchers studying the microstructural changes in MS and neurodegeneration. The observation of correlation between histology and the diffusion time-dependence is exciting; however, the optimization of the MRI protocol design, the implementation of model fitting, and the interpretation of the observed diffusion time-dependence are problematic. The acquisition protocol of diffusion MR is not optimal for the axon diameter estimation; in fact, it is probably more sensitive to the extra-cellular MR signal contrast. The assumptions in the proposed diffusion MR model were not detailed in this study and even in their previous studies, and the signal-to-noise ratio in the data was not high enough for a reliable fitting. The observed diffusion time-dependence could be interpreted as the result of beadings along axons, packing geometry in extra-cellular space, and the water exchange due to T1 weighting alterations with mixing times of the stimulated echo sequence in animal scans. Given that the absolute value of axon size estimation was different in histology (0.7 micron) and diffusion MR (4 micron) by a factor of ~6, the interpretation of diffusion time-dependence as a result of restricted diffusion inside axons was questionable.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their insightful comments, which triggered several actions on our side; in brief:</p><p>A comprehensive update of the model employed to fit the data, now incorporating the time-dependency of the extracellular space as requested;</p><p>Initiation of new experiments to investigate the discrepancy between EM- and MRI-based axonal size estimation;</p><p>Conducting new experiments to evaluate mono-exponential decay in mixing time;</p><p>Revised SNR estimation and simulations.</p><p>Please find below our response to specific points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The major concern is that the sequence parameter in diffusion MR is not optimal to estimate the axon diameter. At low b-value &lt; = 4000 s/mm2, it is quite impossible to have enough signal decay due to restricted diffusion inside axons [Burcaw et al., NeuroImage 0215], let alone detecting the signal time-dependence in intra-cellular space. In fact, at low b-value, most of the signal decay and signal time-dependence is contributed by the hindered diffusion in extra-cellular space [Fieremans et al., NeuroImage 2016]. Furthermore, the intra-cellular signal time-dependence largely depends on the pulse width, not the diffusion time [Neuman, JCP 1974]. Authors tried to cite the study of Axon Spectrum Imaging [Gast et al., Neuroinformatics 2023] to support their protocol design of varying diffusion time at low b-value. However, Gast et al. did not apply the AxCaliber model (diffusion narrowing regime) to estimate axon size. Actually, Gast et al. applied the assumption of intra-cellular diffusion in narrow pulse limit, and neglected the diffusion time-dependence in extra-cellular space, which has been shown as the dominant source of diffusion time-dependence at low b-values. This problem has been well recognized and further solved in previous studies [Veraart et al., eLife 2020; Fan et al., NeuroImage 2020], where the high b-value data (b-value &gt; 15,000 s/mm2) were included for the model fitting.</p><p>2. Authors mentioned that, at low b-value, intra-axonal &quot;signal&quot; dominates. However, at low b-value, extra-axonal &quot;signal decay/signal contrast&quot; and &quot;signal time-dependence&quot; dominate (Figure 4 in [De Santis et al., 2016]). A simple calculation could indicate whether authors may misinterpret the extra-cellular signal time-dependence as intra-cellular one. For the in vivo rat MR protocol, the signal time-dependence of intra-axonal model is 20.3% for an axon diameter = 4 micron (Figure 1e) and intrinsic diffusivity = 3 um2/ms using Neuman's model, and the signal time-dependence of extra-axonal model is 19.5% for a strength of time-dependence = 0.5 micron<sup>2</sup> using a log(time)/time model [Burcaw et al., 2015].</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's insightful comments and wish to address them collectively, as we perceive them to be closely interconnected. We concur that higher b-values enhance sensitivity to intra-axonal water. However, we must note that the paper by Veraart et al., though offering valuable insights into the MRI sensitivity to axonal diameter estimation, includes data with very high b-values that were (i) acquired ex-vivo in animals and at an extremely high field (16.4T); and (ii) obtained with an in-vivo human protocol of partial coverage, limited resolution, and suitable only for imaging the corpus callosum. This experimental approach, fully valid for a proof-of-concept, was unfortunately incompatible with our research question, setups, in-vivo framework, and clinical population. Consequently, we opted for what we consider a balanced compromise between b-value and feasibility. We concur with the reviewer that this situation might be partially mitigated by strategies such as the spherical mean, as implemented in Barakovic et al. 2023, and have acknowledged this as a limitation of our work.</p><p>Furthermore, we would like to emphasize that the theoretical frameworks employed to determine the lower boundaries on axonal size detection necessarily rely on assumptions about tissue composition and properties that (i) can significantly alter the conclusions drawn, and (ii) are challenging to ascertain. For instance, Figure 1 of the paper by De Santis et al. 2016 clearly illustrates that the proportions of intra and extra-axonal signals critically depend on the value of intra-axonal diffusivity. While theoretical calculations typically use a value of 2.4x10-9 mm2/s (lines e-f), a simple CHARMED experiment yields values closer to 0.7-1x109 mm2/s (lines a-b). Additionally, in this revised version, we present new experiments demonstrating that STEM size estimation is substantially biased (about 40% in our preparation; see response to comment E.1) by tissue preparation steps including fixation and embedding, with literature data estimating this bias as high as 65% (Dyrby et al. 2018). This could further align with the scenario for the contribution of intra-axonal diffusivity reported in panel b or, most likely, higher.</p><p>In the light of these new results, we believe our arguments support the conclusion that, given the current uncertainties surrounding several critical parameters used in calculations, it is challenging to dismiss the sensitivity of a modest b-value, such as the one employed in our study (and in several previous papers with positive results), to axonal diameter. In this context, our biology-driven approach to generate, validate, and detect axonal pathology contributes valuable insights to an open question which is still ongoing.</p><p>Of course, all this does not mean that higher b-values do not provide enhanced sensitivity to axonal caliber measurements, so we fully agree with the reviewer on that. To stress this, we have moderated the emphasis in the paragraph concerning the b-value, aligning it more closely with the context of our study and the reviewer's insights, and have included the choice of b-value as a limitation of our work, expanding the citations to recent papers using higher b-values (e.g., Barakovic et al. 2023).</p><p>We also agree with the reviewer that the omission of the δ dependency in the model was a significant limitation of our previous analysis. Therefore, we have heeded this valuable suggestion and re-processed all the data with an updated model that includes δ dependency, specifically through a linear term in the expression of the diffusion orthogonal to the main orientation in the hindered compartment. The rationale for selecting a linear model was its parsimonious nature, especially considering that our δ sampling, compared to that used in De Santis et al. 2016, covers a more limited range (up to 60 vs. up to 200 ms). We have calculated DTI-based radial diffusivities for varying deltas, and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) supports a linear fit versus the expression used in De Santis et al. 2016 in 100% of the voxels (data can be included upon request).</p><p>Upon the inclusion of this additional term, we observed a reduction in the estimated size compared to our previous analysis, mirroring the findings in De Santis et al. 2016. This adjustment brought the estimates closer to histological values and also to recent dw-MRI estimates, although the latter was achieved with a more complex diffusion-relaxation model, as detailed in Barakovic et al. 2023. Additionally, we noted that the estimated slope is consistently negative (as anticipated) and does not exhibit significant differences between conditions (p=0.20, data can be included upon request).</p><p>Importantly, after the change in the processing, all the main results of the paper still hold, namely:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>higher axonal diameter in ibotenic-injected hemisphere compared to control (p=0.021), as shown in Figure 1 of the revised manuscript;</p></list-item><list-item><p>higher axonal diameter in MS as compared to controls, as shown in Figure 4 of the revised manuscript;</p></list-item><list-item><p>preferential increase of axonal diameter in subjects with short disease duration, as shown in Figure 5 of the revised manuscript (NB: although the voxel-wise statistic is not significant anymore but is now a trend, with the lowest p-value equal to 0.051, the group comparison in the whole WM stays significant).</p></list-item></list><p>In the previous version of the paper, we cited and discussed the work by Gast et al. to substantiate the sensitivity of a b-value of 4000 to axonal diameter, albeit with a different protocol.

However, while feasible in vivo and in patients, this modest b-value is still suboptimal to measure axonal diameter, and higher b-values can boost the sensitivity to the intra-axonal compartment (Veraart et al., 2020)(Barakovic, M, 2023).

While this is a simplification of the proposed δ dependency (Burcaw et al., 2015), we believe that it is a parsimonious choice that is supported by the relatively short range of δ values explored as compared to previous work exploring time dependency (De Santis et al., 2016) (Fieremans et al., 2016), and also by comparison of a linear with a non-linear model in our data through the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), which preferred a linear fit over the expression used in De Santis et al. 2016 in 100% of the voxels. As such, the fitted parameters are: the restricted main orientations and fractions, the intrinsic diffusivity, the extra-axonal radial diffusivity, the slope of the extra-axonal signal decay for increasing δ, the axonal diameter and the Rician noise term. For STEAM data, an additional T1 decay is included in the fit. The BIC preferred a mono-exponential T1 decay over a bi-exponential decay in 98% of the examined voxels. The fit is implemented through a cascade model as done in (Harms et al., 2017), so that an initial CHARMED fit (Assaf and Basser, 2005) is performed using the data acquired at the shorter diffusion time to initialize the volume fractions. The intrinsic diffusivity and the main fiber orientations are estimated through the CHARMED fit and kept fixed in the AxCaliber fit. The axial diffusivity (at the shortest δ) in the extra-axonal compartment is first modelled using the tortuosity approximation (Zhang et al., 2012), and then this constraint is released in a last iteration of model fitting where everything in the model is fixed except the axial diffusivity and the noise factor.”</p><p>References:</p><p>Harms RL, Fritz FJ, Tobisch A, Goebel R, Roebroeck A.

However, the mean value of 10<sup>4</sup> repetitions for each diameter value is the result of SNR = 20*sqrt(10<sup>4</sup>) = 2000. The wide histogram of fitting result actually indicates the low precision in the model fitting. To perform the noise propagation, authors should apply many different parameter combinations (for example, 10<sup>5</sup>) with diameter, volume fraction, and extra-cellular diffusivity varied in wide ranges.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. Indeed, a more comprehensive simulation approach, especially after an additional parameter was included in the model to describe the dependency of the extra-axonal signal from the diffusion time, could further demonstrate the validity of the extracted measurements. As suggested, we have now run simulations using 10<sup>5</sup> different combinations of parameters sampled randomly from a uniform distribution: diameter (sampled range 0.5-5 µm), volume fraction (0.1-0.5), and extra-cellular diffusivity (0.7-2.210^-9mm2/s). Each configuration was repeated 10 times with different Rician noise. We have found excellent agreement between fitted and ground truth axonal size (r=0.90 for human SNR and 0.75 for rodent SNR).</p><p>Changes in the text:</p><p>– Methods, pag. 20:</p><p>“Simulations using Rician noise were run on 10<sup>5</sup> different combinations of parameters sampled randomly from a uniform distribution in the following ranges: axonal diameter 0.5-5 µm, volume fraction 0.1-0.5, extra-cellular diffusivity 0.7-2.2x10-3mm2/s.

The modified AxCaliber model was validated by the in vivo rat brain scan, where the stimulated echo sequence was applied. However, the diffusion signal measured by stimulated echo had varying T1-weighting due to the varying diffusion time and mixing time. If the non-diffusion weighted signal (b0 signal) was mono-exponential decay with the mixing time, this T1-weighting could be canceled out via dividing DW signals by b0 signal. If the b0 signal was not mono-exponential decay, the T1-weighting variation between multiple compartments (e.g., water around myelin and water away from myelin) could lead to spurious &quot;diffusion&quot; time-dependence that was related with T1-weighting and exchange. It is essential to confirm that the b0 signal is mono-exponential decay with the mixing time in white matter, where the b0 signal decay is usually bi-exponential with the mixing time.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right. Indeed, we confirmed that in our data, the mono-exponential fit is preferred over the bi-exponential in the vast majority of voxels by using a Bayesian information criterion to compare the two models. In figure 6, the mean % of voxels belonging to the fimbria where the mono-exponential fit is preferred, thus yielding a lower BIC, is reported.</p><p>In addition, to make sure that this was not due to the relatively few mixing times sampled, we have acquired new data on n=3 animals by halving the sampling interval.

As you'll see, Reviewer 3 requests a few further clarifications of the study alongside some requests for limitations to be covered in the Discussion. If you are able to make changes for each of these requested comments, then we will hopefully be able to handle these as editors without the need to return to reviewers.</p><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors in general did a great job to improve the manuscript. However, some important information about the model and results was only mentioned in the revision but not shown in detail. It is essential to include these details in either Methods or supplementary materials to support their arguments in this study. More specific concerns are given below:</p><p>1. Comment R3.1: Authors performed a simple CHARMED experiment and got the value of intra-cellular axial diffusivity close to 0.7-1 um2/ms, different from the values 2.25 um2/ms in previous studies (Dhital et al., NeuroImage 2019, 189:543 and more). This is because the inclusion of multiple highly aligned fiber bundles only factors out the fiber crossing, but not the angular dispersion in each fiber bundle. This dispersion is non-trivial even in highly aligned white matter, such as corpus callosum (~ 20-25 degree dispersion in Ronen et al., BSAF 2014, 219:1773 and Lee et al., BASF 2019, 224:1469). This is the reason why people start to use the spherical mean signal to factor out both fiber crossing and fiber dispersion for the axonal diameter mapping. This should be included in the limitation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting the key factors affecting the measured intra-cellular diffusivity in models like CHARMED, which we utilize as an initial step for the AxCaliber fit. The insight into the limitations posed by not employing the spherical mean signal is well-received. Accordingly, we have updated our manuscript to reflect these considerations, including the relevant reference.</p><p>Moreover, for the purpose of this revision, we re-conducted our simulations with a different range of intra-cellular axial diffusivities (1.7 to 2.2 um2/ms), to match more closely the cited paper. These simulations did not show a significant difference in accuracy compared to our original results. This finding is now included in the supplementary material, Figure 4 —figure supplement 2, panels e and f.</p><p>Also, we concur that the quantification of the fiber dispersion in white matter varies significantly across different studies and techniques. Still, while some, like the ones you referenced, reports a dispersion of around 20 degrees, others such as Mollink (Neuroimage 2017) suggest a lower dispersion of approximately 10 degrees or less at least in the corpus callosum. This discrepancy underscores the ongoing debate in the scientific community regarding the precise extent of inter-bundle fiber dispersion. Our study recognizes these variances and acknowledges the limitations of even gold-standard histological techniques, as discussed in our revised manuscript. We believe that a consensus on the exact amount of fiber dispersion, factoring in these methodological limitations, is yet to be established.</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>“In this context, including spherical mean techniques might improve axonal diameter and intraaxonal diffusivity estimations by factoring out the effect of fibre distribution, and by providing better SNR (Fan et al., 2020) (Veraart et al., 2020) (Dhital et al., 2019). In addition, the AxCaliber model does not take into account fiber dispersion present in the white matter. While some work point at modest values of dispersion at least in single-fiber areas (Mollink et al., 2017), other measured values as high as 20 degrees (Ronen et al., 2014), (Lee et al., 2019). While it is reasonable to expect that some axonal directional dispersion in areas of a single fiber is likely accounted for by the second fiber population, possibly mitigating the effect, future work should include spherical mean techniques to fully remove this bias.”</p><p>Materials and methods:</p><p>“The simulations were repeated with a narrower range of intra-axonal axial diffusivity (1.72.2x10-3 mm2/s) matching more closely the scenario proposed by (Dhital et al., 2019). Each configuration was simulated 10 times by adding different Rician random noise with two different values of SNRs, matching human and animal acquisitions. The results demonstrate excellent agreement between ground truth and fitted axonal diameter for both human and animal acquisitions: r=0.90 and 0.75 respectively for a single repetition, r=0.98 and 0.95 respectively for 10 repetitions, and r=0.92 and 0.79 respectively for the narrower intra-axonal axial diffusivity range. The simulations are shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 2.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Comment R3.2: For the time-dependence of extra-cellular radial diffusivity, authors used a linear time-dependent model and suggested that the linear time-dependent model has better goodness of fit than the well-known [log(Δ/δ)+3/2]/(Δ-δ/3) model in previous studies (Burcaw et al., NeuroImage 2015 and more). What is the functional form of the linear model? Is it 1/Δ? Does it really matter to use the spurious linear model, instead of the validated log(t)/t model? For the time dependence on page 20, does the δ indicate the pulse width or the diffusion time (inter-pulse duration)? In addition, the authors did not show any results related to the fit parameters of this extra-cellular linear model for time-dependence.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting the need for additional details on our model for incorporating diffusion time dependency in the extra-axonal space. We utilized the linear expression: D<sup>RADIAL</sup> <sub>∆=min(∆)</sub>+slope*(Δ-min(Δ)), which incorporates the extra-axonal radial diffusivity from the CHARMED fit used to initialize the AxCaliber. This approach helps reduce the number of free parameters, a crucial consideration given the in vivo data collection constraints. While this functional form is preferred over log(t)/t within the limited Δ range in our study, we included a comparison between these two forms in the supplementary material (new Figure 1—figure supplement 3). Additionally, we have tested both functions with diffusivity at Δ=15 ms as a free parameter. Neither the log(t)/t nor the linear model is conclusively supported by the BIC in this scenario, indicating a mixed situation with similar BIC factors and residual sum of squares, likely attributable to the limited Δ range sampled.</p><p>We were unable to locate “δ” on page 20 of our submitted PDF, which contains references. However, we have revised the manuscript to ensure consistent use of Δ for diffusion time and δ for pulse width, thereby clarifying any ambiguity.</p><p>To address the final part of the comment, in the revised manuscript, we have included the plot of the slope, radial diffusivity, and restricted fraction in the injected versus control hemisphere (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1). While none of these parameters show significant differences across hemispheres, there is a tendency (p=0.09) for a reduced slope in the injected hemisphere. We also conducted a statistical comparison of these quantities in humans, examining both group differences between MS patients and controls and the association with disease duration. The slope of the extra-axonal radial diffusivity decay and the restricted signal fraction are significantly reduced in portions of the normal-appearing white matter in MS. However, no MRI parameter, except for the MRI axonal diameter proxy, shows a significant association with disease duration. These results are documented in new Figure 4—figure supplement 1.</p><p>Materials and methods:</p><p>“The comparison between the two functional forms fitted to the radial diffusivity for the dataset acquired with the lower b-value protocol is reported in Figure 1—figure supplement 3.”</p><p>Results:</p><p>“The other parameters extracted from the MRI analysis are not significantly different between hemispheres, although there is a tendency of reduced slope of the extra-axonal radial diffusivity decay for increasing diffusion time in the injected hemisphere (Figure 1—figure supplement 1).”</p><p>“Finally, we tested both group differences and associations with disease duration for the rest of the parameters extracted in the MRI analysis. While both the slope of the extra-axonal radial diffusivity decay for increasing diffusion time and the restricted signal fraction are significantly reduced in a portion of the normal-appearing white matter in MS (reported in Figure 4—figure supplement 1), no MRI parameter except the MRI axonal diameter proxy is significantly associated with disease duration.”</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>“Other tested MRI parameters are not associated with disease duration.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Comment R3.4: Authors showed the noise propagation of their axonal diameter model at the SNR of 17.3 (human) and 11.2 (animal). It shows that the resolution limit of the smallest detectable axonal diameter is about 1.5 micron (kind of smaller than expected at the given SNR). However, each parameter combination was repeated 10 times with different Rician noise realizations at the same SNR. Why did authors repeat it 10 times with different Rician noise realizations? Were the 10 fitting results averaged in any way (mean, median, or other selection method)? It sounds like the SNR is boosted by a factor of sqrt(10).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's attention to this detail. The 2D histogram presented in our original figure indeed corresponds to a single repetition. However, our methodology included conducting 10 repetitions with distinct Rician noise realizations. This approach reflects the standard MRI data analysis practice where spatial information is typically averaged across neighboring voxels within the same biological structure. This averaging is intended to counterbalance the noise inherent in the measurement process, a standard in ROI-based analysis. Even in voxel-based analysis, standard analysis pipelines like TBSS utilize spatial neighbourhood information to enhance the reliability of extended signal areas. In light of this, we believe that presenting the accuracy averaged over several repetitions in simulations offers a valid comparison to real data analysis. Consequently, we have included the 2D histograms for both single and 10 repetitions in the updated Figure 4—figure supplement 2, providing a more comprehensive view.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Comment E.2: The relation of true signal A and Rician-biased signal E(M) was explained in Koay and Basser JMR 2006, where Equation 13 shows {E(M)}<sup>2</sup> ~ = A<sup>2</sup> + σ_Rician<sup>2</sup> at high SNR. The σ_Rician<sup>2</sup> does not have a factor of 2. In the response of comment E.2, authors used the equation for E(M<sup>2</sup>). However, the magnitude signal is E(M), not sqrt{E(M<sup>2</sup>)}. Therefore, authors should cite and use the relations in Koay and Basser JMR 2006 to correct and estimate the SNR, though it may not affect the numerical results significantly.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comment. Indeed, for the previous version of the response to reviewers, we tried both approaches for the SNR calculation. Results were similar, but the method based on the mean shows some errors due to the iterative process, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig6">Authors’ response image 6</xref>.

This part of our paper was advised by Dr. Aja-Fernandez, who includes the referenced paper in his work. Koay's paper does use a mixed expression, and while {E(M)}<sup>2</sup> converges to A<sup>2</sup> + σ_Rician<sup>2</sup> at high SNR, our approach is valid for all SNR levels.</p><p>Also, the reviewer is right about the bias of the signal. One must clearly specify what bias one wants to Signal to noise ratio estimated for two removes. In general (not always true), if we estimate A, slices using the proposed method on the we must remove the bias to E{M} and if we estimate left, and Koay’s on the right. A<sup>2</sup>, we must remove the bias to E{M<sup>2</sup>}. However, please note that in our case, our goal is not removing the bias, but rather defining an estimator for A. This estimator could have very different properties (bias, minimum error, edge protection, quick convergence, etc.). Nevertheless, in our case, since we are looking for a global estimation of the SNR, we use a standard simple approach that assumes that:</p><p><inline-formula><mml:math id="sa2m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:msup><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mo fence="false" stretchy="false">{</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo fence="false" stretchy="false">}</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:msup><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> This is a classic assumption known as the conventional approach (McGibney Med.
