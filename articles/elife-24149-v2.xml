are metabolic sensors that couple cell energetics to membrane excitability. In pancreatic β-cells, channels formed by SUR1 and Kir6.2 regulate insulin secretion and are the targets of antidiabetic sulfonylureas. Here, we used cryo-EM to elucidate structural basis of channel assembly and gating. The structure, determined in the presence of ATP and the sulfonylurea glibenclamide, at ~6 Å resolution reveals a closed Kir6.2 tetrameric core with four peripheral SUR1s each anchored to a Kir6.2 by its N-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD0). Intricate interactions between TMD0, the loop following TMD0, and Kir6.2 near the proposed PIP<sub>2</sub> binding site, and where ATP density is observed, suggest SUR1 may contribute to ATP and PIP<sub>2</sub> binding to enhance Kir6.2 sensitivity to both. The SUR1-ABC core is found in an unusual inward-facing conformation whereby the two nucleotide binding domains are misaligned along a two-fold symmetry axis, revealing a possible mechanism by which glibenclamide inhibits channel activity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24149.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24149.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24149.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The hormone insulin reduces blood sugar levels by encouraging fat, muscle and other body cells to take up sugar. When blood sugar levels rise following a meal, cells within the pancreas known as beta cells should release insulin. In people with diabetes, the beta cells fail to release insulin, meaning that the high blood sugar levels are not corrected.</p><p>When blood sugar levels are high, beta cells generate more energy in the form of ATP molecules. The increased level of ATP causes channels called ATP-sensitive potassium (K<sub>ATP</sub>) channels in the membrane of the cell to close. This triggers a cascade of events that leads to the release of insulin.</p><p>Some treatments for diabetes alter how the K<sub>ATP</sub> channels work. For example, a widely prescribed medication called glibenclamide (also known as glyburide in the United States) stimulates the release of insulin by preventing the flow of potassium through K<sub>ATP</sub> channels. It remains unknown exactly how ATP and glibenclamide interact with the channel’s molecular structure to stop the flow of potassium ions.</p><p>K<sub>ATP</sub> channels are made up of two proteins called SUR1 and Kir6.2. To investigate the structure of the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel, Martin et al. purified channels made of the hamster form of the SUR1 protein and the mouse form of Kir6.2, which each closely resemble their human counterparts. The channels were purified in the presence of ATP and glibenclamide and were then rapidly frozen to preserve their structure, which allowed them to be visualized individually using electron microscopy. By analyzing the images taken from many channels, Martin et al. constructed a highly detailed, three-dimensional map of the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel. The structure revealed by this map shows how SUR1 and Kir6.2 work together and provides insight into how ATP and glibenclamide interact with the channel to block the flow of potassium, and hence stimulate the release of insulin.</p><p>An important next step will be to improve the structure to more clearly identify where ATP and glibenclamide bind to the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel. It will also be important to study the structures of channels that are bound to other regulatory molecules. This will help researchers to fully understand how K<sub>ATP</sub> channels located throughout the body operate under healthy and diseased conditions. This knowledge will aid in the design of more effective drugs to treat several devastating diseases caused by defective K<sub>ATP</sub> channels.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24149.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24149.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>ABC transporter</kwd><kwd>inward rectifier</kwd><kwd>sulfonylurea receptor</kwd><kwd>sulfonylurea</kwd><kwd>ATP</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK066485</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shyng</surname><given-names>Show-Ling</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31DK105800</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martin</surname><given-names>Gregory M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy reveals the first subnanometer structure of ATP-sensitive potassium (K<sub>ATP</sub>) channels, which provides insight into the structural mechanisms of channel assembly and gating.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Studies into the electric mechanisms of insulin release of the pancreatic β-cell in the early 1980s led to the discovery and identification of an ATP-sensitive potassium (K<sub>ATP</sub>) channel as the key molecular link between glucose metabolism and insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ashcroft and Rorsman, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cook and Bryan, 1998</xref>). Subsequent cloning and characterization revealed the β-cell K<sub>ATP</sub> channel as a complex of two proteins: a potassium channel Kir6.2 of the inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channel family, and a sulfonylurea receptor SUR1, a member of the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Inagaki et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>Physiological activity of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels is determined primarily by the relative concentrations of ATP and ADP: ATP inhibits, whereas MgADP stimulates channel activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nichols, 2006</xref>). As K<sub>ATP</sub> channels set the β-cell membrane potential, this regulation by nucleotides endows them the ability to sense metabolic changes and translate those into changes in membrane excitability, which ultimately initiates or stops insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ashcroft, 2005</xref>). Another key player for K<sub>ATP</sub> function is membrane phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>); as in all other Kir family members, PIP<sub>2</sub> is required for channel opening and sets the intrinsic open probability (<italic>P<sub>o</sub></italic>) of the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hibino et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nichols, 2006</xref>). Mutations disrupting channel assembly or the above-gating properties result in insulin secretion disorders, with loss- or gain-of-function mutations causing congenital hyperinsulinism (HI) or permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ashcroft, 2005</xref>). Importantly, K<sub>ATP</sub> channels are the targets of sulfonylureas, one of the most commonly prescribed treatments for type 2 diabetes, which stimulate insulin secretion by inhibiting channel activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gribble and Reimann, 2003</xref>). In particular, glibenclamide (GBC) binds the channel with nanomolar affinity and was instrumental for the purification and cloning of SUR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aguilar-Bryan et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>A member of the Kir channel family, Kir6.2 consists of two transmembrane helices and N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hibino et al., 2010</xref>). By comparison, SUR1, a member of the ABC transporter family, is much larger in size. In addition to a characteristic ABC core structure comprising two transmembrane domains (TMD1 and 2) and two cytoplasmic nucleotide binding domains (NBD1 and 2), it has an N-terminal extension that contains a transmembrane domain (TMD0) followed by a long, cytoplasmic loop ‘L0’ which connects to the ABC core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aguilar-Bryan et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tusnády et al., 2006</xref>). Kir6.2 and SUR1 are uniquely dependent on each other for expression and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Inagaki et al., 1995</xref>). Interestingly, unlike most ABC transporters such as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and the multidrug-resistant protein P-glycoprotein, SUR1 itself has no known ion channel or transporter activity; instead, its function is to regulate Kir6.2 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aguilar-Bryan et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Inagaki et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wilkens, 2015</xref>). A central question is how the two proteins assemble and function as a complex to sense metabolic signals.</p><p>Biochemical and biophysical studies have indicated that the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel is an octamer of four Kir6.2 and four SUR1 subunits. ATP and PIP<sub>2</sub> bind Kir6.2 directly to close or open the channel, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Baukrowitz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shyng and Nichols, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tanabe et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tucker et al., 1997</xref>). Although Kir6.2 alone can be gated by ATP and PIP<sub>2</sub>, its sensitivities to both ATP and PIP<sub>2</sub> are increased by SUR1 by ~10-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Baukrowitz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Enkvetchakul et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shyng and Nichols, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tucker et al., 1997</xref>). How SUR1 sensitizes Kir6.2 to ATP inhibition and PIP<sub>2</sub> stimulation remains unclear. In contrast to ATP inhibition of the channel, which does not depend on Mg<sup>2+</sup> and ATP hydrolysis, nucleotide stimulation of the channel is conferred by SUR1 and requires Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashcroft and Gribble, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gribble et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nichols, 2006</xref>). Evidence suggests that MgATP and MgADP interact with the nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) of SUR1 and either through MgATP hydrolysis or through direct MgADP binding at NBD2, promote NBDs dimerization and channel opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Wet et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nichols, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zingman et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, GBC has been proposed to inhibit K<sub>ATP</sub> channels by preventing Mg-nucleotide stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Wet and Proks, 2015</xref>), and may do so by stabilizing the ABC core of SUR1 in an inward-facing conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ortiz et al., 2012</xref>) but direct evidence is lacking.</p><p>In order to understand how the channel functions as a complex to respond to physiological and pharmacological molecules and mechanisms by which channel mutations cause disease, detailed structural information is crucial.

In Kir6.2, the inner helix gate is formed by F168 in M2 just below the central cavity.

However, the TMD and gates as well as the density corresponding to bound ATP (see below) in both classes are largely unaffected, suggesting rotational freedom for the CTD in the closed state. Whether this rotation represents a conformational transition that occurs during gating needs further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Identification of the ATP binding pocket</title><p>A hallmark of the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel is its inhibition by intracellular ATP.

Indeed, we observed a prominent bulge in the EM density that is too large to be accounted for by the main chain and the surrounding side-chains. The density is about the size of an ATP molecule and is immediately adjacent to K185, a residue that has been implicated in ATP binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">John et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tanabe et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tucker et al., 1997</xref>). Extensive mutagenesis of the K185 residue assessing the effects of various amino acid substitutions on channel sensitivity to inhibition by ATP, ADP, and AMP has provided strong evidence that this residue is important for binding to the β-phosphate of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jöns et al., 2006</xref>). We used this information to guide the initial docking of ATP into the density and then refined with the surrounding protein in RSRef (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chapman et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>An overview of the ATP binding site from the side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), and from the top (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), with ATP colored in red, illustrates that the pocket is at the interface of adjacent Kir6.2 N and C domains. A close-up view (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) shows that the docked ATP is surrounded by residues I182, L205, Y330, F333, and G334 from the same subunit, and R50 from the adjacent subunit. The adenine ring is pointing toward the N-terminus of subunit A, and could be supported by I182, L205, Y330, and F333 of subunit B. R50 in subunit A is in a position that would allow it to interact with the γ-phosphate but may also interact with the adenine ring, which would explain mutagenesis data indicating that the interaction of R50 and ATP is not entirely electrostatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">John et al., 2003</xref>). K185 is only ~3 Å from the β phosphate, while the α-phosphate is close to the main-chain nitrogen of G334 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>).

As discussed above, given its high-affinity GBC is likely to be bound in our structure. Thus, an interesting hypothesis is that the twisted conformation is caused by GBC binding, which would suggest that GBC prevents MgADP from stimulating the channel by causing a misalignment of the NBDs dimerization interface. Alternatively, the conformation may be unique to SUR1 and that Mg-nucleotide binding/hydrolysis is required to restore symmetry for dimerization. In this case, GBC may block stimulation by clamping down L0 and preventing it from communicating with Kir6.2. A structure in the absence of GBC will be needed to test these hypotheses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The structure reported here provides the first glimpse of the detailed domain organization of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels and the intricate structural interactions between SUR1 and Kir6.2.

In addition to contacts made by TM1 of Kir6.2 and the first TM helix of TMD0 which are consistent with previous structure-function studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schwappach et al., 2000</xref>), there are also new interactions revealed by the structure in the extracellular domain of TMD0 and the turret/pore loop of Kir6.2 as well as the cytoplasmic domains of TMD0 and Kir6.2. Indeed, TMD0 appears to harbor more mutations that disrupt channel biogenesis and trafficking than other regions of SUR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Martin et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">2016</xref>). It is worth noting that many mutations in TMD0 which impair channel biogenesis and trafficking can be rescued by pharmacological chaperones, specifically sulfonylureas such as GBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Martin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yan et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">2007</xref>). As our structure is obtained in the presence of GBC, an important question to address in the future is whether GBC alters structural interactions between TMD0 and Kir6.2 to correct biogenesis/trafficking defects caused by TMD0 mutations.</p><p>The interface between TMD0-L0 and Kir6.2 in the cytoplasmic domain near the proposed PIP<sub>2</sub> binding site and where ATP density is observed suggests TMD0-L0 may directly enforce PIP<sub>2</sub> or ATP binding to enhance Kir6.2 sensitivity to both, and also explains the effects of many disease mutations in this region. Although in our structure the Kir6.2 is bound to ATP with the pore in a closed conformation, a gating scheme whereby in the presence of PIP<sub>2</sub> remodeling of the interfaces near the ATP and PIP<sub>2</sub> sites leads to channel opening may be envisioned. Future studies comparing structures in the absence of ATP and with or without PIP<sub>2</sub> are needed to understand in detail the structural changes involved in gating.</p><p>The L0 region before the elbow helix leading to TMD1 in SUR1 was modeled de novo, with an amphipathic helix from L224-A240 and a helix from L260-D277 that are strongly supported by the density map. Part of L0 (from a.a. 214 on) is conserved in CFTR and the multidrug resistance-associated proteins MRPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang and Chen, 2016</xref>).

This observation suggests a possible mechanism in which GBC inhibits channel activity by preventing dimerization of NBDs in the presence of Mg-nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). As GBC is known to inhibit the activity of other ABC transporter proteins including CFTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schultz et al., 1996</xref>) and the multidrug resistance protein MDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Golstein et al., 1999</xref>), the mechanism we propose could have broader implications.

In particular, structures bound with various stimulatory and inhibitory ligands will further advance understanding of the detailed mechanisms of channel gating. Some regions known to be important for channel assembly and gating such as the distal N- and C-termini of Kir6.2 as well as several linker loops in SUR1 are not well resolved in the current map (see Materials and methods for details).

A TMD1 homology model was built using PCAT-1 (PDB ID: 4RY2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), NDB1 was modeled from the NDB1 of mouse P-glycoprotein (PDB ID: 4 M1M) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), and TMD2 and NBD2 were modeled together from chain B of TM287/288 (PDB ID: 4Q4HB) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>); all homology models were built with MODELLER. These models were docked into the density in Chimera.</p><p>SUR1 had some disordered regions (744–770, 928–1000, 1319–1343), particularly in the linkers between TMDs and NBDs, and in NBD1, that were not seen in our map. These regions were removed from the homology models before proceeding with refinement. The TM helices were then manually adjusted in COOT, as a substantial adjustment was needed to move them into density. The domains were then refined in the same steps as outlined for Kir6.2, except that before the final manual adjustments in COOT and final density gradient optimization, a batch of torsion angle simulated annealing optimization was inserted, again using RSRef/CNS and the same torsion angle restraints and NCS constraints. The final model for the ABC core structure contained residues 284–616 (TMD1), 675–739 and 762–930 (NBD1), 981–1044 and 1060–1321 (TMD2), and 1325–1577 (NBD2).</p><p>TMD0 and L0 domains of SUR1 (a.a. 1–283) are some of the most interesting and novel regions of the K<sub>ATP</sub> complex for which there is no existing homology model. These domains were therefore modeled de novo. Even though embedded in a micelle, all the transmembrane helices in TMD0 are clearly visible in the density map. The visibility of helical pitch and some side chains allowed confident modeling and refinement of the TM helices. With the predominantly alpha-helical nature of this domain, continuous loop density between most of the TM helices, and the presence of residues with bulky side chains, we were able to build the ~200 residues of TMD0 with a good degree of confidence. Of less certainty was the L0 region of SUR1 that sits between TMD0 and TMD1. While there was an easily identifiable region of the map corresponding to L0, the scarcity of secondary structures in this region made it difficult to build with the same degree of confidence. This was further complicated by the high likelihood that some of the observed density may be attributable to the ligand GBC, a high affinity antagonist which has been shown to interact with this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bryan et al., 2004</xref>). Nonetheless, we made a best effort to model the residues in L0 primarily to verify that (1) a plausible model could be built into this density, and (2) that the observed density was sufficient to account for all the amino acids in this loop. The L0 model we built fulfilled both criteria, and as such, allowed for a better interpretation and understanding of the electron density map. We did not, however, attempt to draw any definitive conclusions about specific residues or GBC density from our tentative modeling of L0.</p><p>Note we used two different software suites, RSRef and PHENIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref>), to confirm the consistency of our individual models of Kir6.2 and the SUR1 ABC core structure upon refinement into our electron density. The full final models were refined with all the constraints available in PHENIX real-space refinement: torsion angles, bond lengths, Ramachandran, and secondary structure. This was done initially with side-chains in place to ensure that the refinement did not place residues in implausible configurations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> shows examples of residues that were particularly well-resolved and served as anchor points for building and refining the model). Evaluation of these refined models confirmed that the model could be refined to fit the density quite well while maintaining good stereochemical statistics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). However, as many of the side chains did not have much, if any, supporting density, a final pass was made throughout the entire model to remove these side-chains prior to PDB deposition (PDB ID: 5TWV). The resulting model was very similar to the full-atom refinement, but had better statistics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) primarily due to the reduced possibility of clashes.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Nicholas Caputo for assistance with microscope operation and data collection, Dr. Omar Davulcu and Dr. Michael Chapman for assistance on structure refinement using RSRef.

They agree that this is a landmark paper and recommend rapid publication. The Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision letter to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Martin and colleagues present the structure by cryo-EM of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel at ~6 Å resolution in the presence of ATP and glibenclamide. This is a landmark structure of fascinating, complicated, and an extremely (and increasingly!) biomedically-important macromolecular assembly. The structural analysis is well done and the depth of expertise for the biological interpretation of the structure is readily apparent. Insight is gained into numerous points, including where ATP and Glibenclamide bind the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel and how they affect channel function. As a particularly interesting aspect, the structure illustrates how information about ATP concentrations in the cell, sensed by the ABC protein SUR1 subunits, is communicated to the Kir6.2 channel by TMD0 and the L0 linker.</p><p>Nevertheless, the reviewers felt that some revisions of the text are advisable, to make it more accessible to a broad readership.</p><p>Recommended revisions:</p><p>The manuscript is rich in detailed description of various interactions, but less so in mechanistic insights.

However, it remains a possibility that the motion is part of a conformational transition between ATP-bound and ATP-unbound states. In our preparation, ATP was present at saturating concentrations, which may prevent complete transition from the ATP-bound state to the ATP-free state. Moreover, the presence of GBC may also prevent complete transition to a second state via interaction between the CTD of Kir6.2 and the TMD0/L0 of SUR1. We decided to note the presence of this second state both because it is an interesting observation, and also because separating out these particles was necessary to reach the higher resolution in the better map. There is likely continuous heterogeneity between the high resolution map and the second lower-resolution map, and there may be more 3-D classes to be distinguished, but this was the best result we could achieve with our current dataset size. As stated in the manuscript, a structure in the absence of ATP in the future will be needed to address these questions. We have now revised the Results section to make it clear that ATP density was present in both classes.</p><p>As to the question of whether the density we observed is ADP, in our preparation only 1mM ATP was included without Mg<sup>2+</sup>. This makes it unlikely that the density we observed was ADP. Biochemical studies using azido-ATP have provided direct evidence that ATP binds to Kir6.2. Moreover, Kir6.2 channels formed in the absence of SUR1 (using a Kir6.2 variant lacking the RKR ER retention signal in the C-terminus) are inhibited by ATP as well as non-hydrolyzable ATP analogues, consistent with direct interaction of Kir6.2 with ATP. These studies, cited in the paragraph discussing the ATP binding site in Kir6.2, support our assumption and interpretation of the bound ATP density. We have now also included these background studies in Introduction to improve clarity.</p><p><italic>Considering that PIP2 is required for Kir channel functionality, is it possible that PIP2 has dropped off during isolation (which would be one explanation why it is not visible in the map), and that this is the reason why the channel is locked in a closed state, rather than because of ATP binding and drug inhibition?</italic> </p><p>It is possible that PIP<sub>2</sub> is present in our digitonin-solubilized sample preparations. However, at the resolution we have it is difficult to confidently identify PIP<sub>2</sub> density, especially along the micelle surface. This also applies to glibenclamide. In interpreting the structural data, we try to be rigorous and believe that higher resolution is needed to resolve PIP<sub>2</sub>. With regard to the closed Kir6.2 conformation observed, ATP and glibenclamide are two potent channel inhibitors even with physiological PIP<sub>2</sub> present (IC<sub>50</sub>~10µM and 1nM respectively measured in inside-out patch-clamp recordings). We have now revised the text concerning PIP<sub>2</sub> to make this point clear.</p></body></sub-article></article>
