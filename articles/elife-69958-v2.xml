healing. However, the potential role of senescent cells in fracture healing has not been defined. Here, we performed an in silico analysis of public mRNAseq data and found that senescence and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) markers increased during fracture healing. We next directly established that the expression of senescence biomarkers increased markedly during murine fracture healing. We also identified cells in the fracture callus that displayed hallmarks of senescence, including distension of satellite heterochromatin and telomeric DNA damage; the specific identity of these cells, however, requires further characterization. Then, using a genetic mouse model (<italic>Cdkn2a<sup>LUC</sup></italic>) containing a <italic>Cdkn2a<sup>Ink4a</sup></italic>-driven luciferase reporter, we demonstrated transient in vivo senescent cell accumulation during callus formation. Finally, we intermittently treated young adult mice following fracture with drugs that selectively eliminate senescent cells (‘senolytics’, Dasatinib plus Quercetin), and showed that this regimen both decreased senescence and SASP markers in the fracture callus and significantly accelerated the time course of fracture healing. Our findings thus demonstrate that senescent cells accumulate transiently in the murine fracture callus and, in contrast to the skin, their clearance does not impair but rather improves fracture healing.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>bone</kwd><kwd>fracture</kwd><kwd>callus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01 AG062413</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Farr</surname><given-names>Joshua N</given-names></name><name><surname>Khosla</surname><given-names>Sundeep</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21 AG065868</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Farr</surname><given-names>Joshua N</given-names></name><name><surname>Khosla</surname><given-names>Sundeep</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AG063707</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Monroe</surname><given-names>David G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DK128552</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Farr</surname><given-names>Joshua N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>German Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>413501650</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saul</surname><given-names>Dominik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Senescent cells accumulate in the fracture callus and a reduction in the number of these cells accelerates fracture healing in mice.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The worldwide burden of fractures is growing. One reason for this major public health problem is population aging, which is associated with progressive physiological decline, leading to an increased risk for many chronic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Khosla et al., 2020</xref>). Hallmarks of aging that drive this deterioration include genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, stem cell exhaustion, altered intercellular communication, and cellular senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">López-Otín et al., 2013</xref>). Recently, cellular senescence has emerged as a promising therapeutic target to prevent aging of multiple tissues, including the musculoskeletal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chandra et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Farr et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Farr et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Farr and Khosla, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khosla et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Khosla et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xu et al., 2018</xref>). Because the ‘geroscience hypothesis’ postulates that targeting fundamental mechanisms of aging, such as cellular senescence, can delay the onset of age-associated diseases as a group, a better understanding of the beneficial versus detrimental roles of senescent cells throughout the lifespan in various physiological contexts, such as fracture healing, is of considerable importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Khosla et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Similar to other tissues, senescent cells accumulate within the aged bone microenvironment and are causal in the pathogenesis of age-related bone loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Farr et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Farr et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Farr and Khosla, 2019</xref>). One key feature of the cellular senescence program is activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs), <italic>Cdkn2a<sup>Ink4a</sup></italic> (<italic>p16<sup>Ink4a</sup></italic>) and <italic>Cdkn1a<sup>Cip1</sup></italic> (<italic>p21<sup>Cip1</sup></italic>), paralleled by apoptosis resistance via upregulation of senescent cell anti-apoptotic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tchkonia et al., 2013</xref>). In the murine bone marrow, predominantly <italic>Cdkn2a<sup>Ink4a</sup></italic> and to a lesser extent <italic>Cdkn1a<sup>Cip1</sup></italic> have been linked to aging in diverse cellular populations such as B- and T-cells, myeloid cells, osteoprogenitors, osteoblasts, and osteocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Farr et al., 2016</xref>). Along with increased CDKI expression, senescent cells develop a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), consisting of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and extracellular matrix degrading proteins that can drive tissue dysfunction via paracrine and systemic intercellular signaling, and spread cellular senescence through a so-called ‘bystander effect’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lagnado et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nelson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xu et al., 2015a</xref>). These detrimental effects can be alleviated by clearing senescent cells either genetically or by administration of senolytics – drugs that selectively kill senescent cells. For example, intermittent delivery of the senolytic cocktail, Dasatinib (D, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor) plus Quercetin (Q, a natural flavonoid) has been shown to eliminate senescent cells in old mice and in humans and, in preclinical studies, slows the onset of aging by preventing multiple co-morbidities to thereby extend healthspan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Farr et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Farr et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xu et al., 2015b</xref>). These findings are now being translated into humans, and D + Q is currently undergoing human trials for safety and efficacy to prevent age-related skeletal deterioration (NCT04313634).</p><p>In youth, beneficial physiological functions of senescent cells and their SASP have been suggested in skin wound healing, as senescent fibroblasts and endothelial cells are recruited to sites of injury where they release SASP factors that, in turn, attract various cell populations (e.g. immune cells) to accelerate skin wound healing. Indeed, after an early appearance in the healing skin wound, senescent cells induce myofibroblast differentiation and secrete PDGF-AA, a crucial factor necessary for proper wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Demaria et al., 2014</xref>). However, the dynamics of skin wound healing do not directly translate to the various bone healing repair phases (i.e. inflammatory, soft callus, hard callus, and remodeling phase). Indeed, bone has the exclusive ability to form scar-free tissue de novo, although this process is slower than the typical wound healing process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marsell and Einhorn, 2011</xref>). Importantly, manipulation at each stage can change the course of natural fracture healing events, which has been demonstrated by our group previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Saul et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Undale et al., 2011</xref>). Whether senescent cells appear in the healing skeleton as they do in skin wound healing or how these cells modulate fracture repair is not known. Indeed, to the extent that senolytic drugs progress to clinical use, particularly in patients with osteoporosis, it is critical to understand whether senescent cells play a similar, beneficial role in bone fracture healing as appears to be the case in the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Demaria et al., 2014</xref>). For example, if clearance of senescent cells impairs the timecourse or final outcome of the fracture healing process, that would clearly adversely impact the potential use of senolytic therapies in patients with osteoporosis.</p><p>In this context, the aims of this study were to characterize the potential appearance of senescent cells during fracture healing and establish whether targeting cellular senescence with senolytics impacts facture healing dynamics. Herein, we specifically focus on fracture healing in young adult mice to avoid the confounding effects of senescence with aging. We first defined the transcriptional profiles of the healing callus and performed an in-depth characterization of cellular senescence at various timepoints. We then leveraged a <italic>Cdkn2a<sup>Ink4a</sup></italic>-luciferase reporter mouse model (<italic>Cdkn2a<sup>LUC</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burd et al., 2013</xref>) to further validate the appearance and disappearance of these cells in vivo. Finally, we treated young adult fractured mice with senolytics to evaluate whether clearance of senescent cells adversely affected fracture healing, which is a critical issue in the further development of senolytic therapies for osteoporosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cdkn1a<sup>Cip1</sup> and Cdkn2a<sup>Ink4a</sup> are induced during murine fracture healing</title><p>To evaluate transcriptome-wide changes underlying the different stages of fracture healing, we analyzed publicly available mRNA-seq data of murine femoral fracture sites as well as intact control femora at five specific time points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coates et al., 2019</xref>). At each time point, post-fracture femora displayed a distinct gene expression profile upon clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Within this dataset, samples collected on day 7 and 14 diverged most from the freshly fractured and intact bone. To identify cellular processes affected by fracture- and healing-associated mRNA expression changes, we performed gene ontology analyses comparing intact controls to femora 14 days post-fracture. As expected, cellular processes related to cell proliferation as well as apoptosis were significantly enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). To detect key common regulators among those biological processes, components of the respective gene sets were overlapped. Interestingly, the cell cycle regulators <italic>Cdkn1a<sup>Cip1</sup></italic> and <italic>Cdkn2a<sup>Ink4a</sup></italic> were present in all gene lists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Notably, the importance of Cdkn2a<italic><sup>Ink4</sup></italic><sup>a</sup> and <italic>Cdkn1a<sup>Cip1</sup></italic> during aging-associated bone deterioration has been previously observed by our group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Farr et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Farr et al., 2017</xref>). Next, gene expression kinetics of <italic>Cdkn1a<sup>Cip1</sup></italic>, <italic>Cdkn2a<sup>Ink4a</sup></italic>, as well as the proliferation marker <italic>Mki67</italic> were examined after the induction of femoral fracture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). <italic>Cdkn1a<sup>Cip1</sup></italic> increased significantly very early following fracture (0.2 days), with a subsequent reduction, although at all time points its expression remained higher than levels in the intact contralateral femur. By contrast, <italic>Cdkn2a<sup>Ink4a</sup></italic> increased progressively up to day seven post-fracture and then plateaued. <italic>Mki67</italic> expression gradually decreased during bone healing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), indicating a decrease in proliferation. Together, these findings suggest a potential function of <italic>Cdkn2a<sup>Ink4a</sup></italic> and <italic>Cdkn1a<sup>Cip1</sup></italic> in regulating key cellular processes during fracture healing in mice with an emphasis on the late callus building phase around day 14.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Cdkn1a</italic><sup>Cip1</sup> and <italic>Cdkn2a<sup>Ink4a</sup></italic> are upregulated after the induction of femoral fractures in mice.</title><p>Transcriptome-wide changes during femoral fracture healing in mice were analyzed using publicly available mRNA-seq data (GSE152677 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coates et al., 2019</xref>).

For this purpose, we performed immuno-fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) in the callus area after fracturing and stabilizing femora with an intramedullary pin. This analysis demonstrated that the number of SADS-positive senescent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Farr et al., 2016</xref>) in the callus was higher by ~6-fold with a peak on days 8 and 14 relative to the contralateral control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>).

To test this, we treated wild-type mice with D + Q one day before fracture and on a weekly basis post fracture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Based on our previous experiments where markers of senescence peaked on day 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B–F</xref>), we sacrificed one mouse cohort at this time point and performed gene expression analysis of callus tissue.

Notably, we detected significantly improved healing kinetics after the clearance of senescent cells with D + Q treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

Similarly, clearance of <italic>Cdkn2a<sup>Ink4a</sup></italic>-positive senescent cells using genetic approaches has been shown to reduce age-associated diseases and extend healthspan in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Braun et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chandra et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Farr et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Saul and Kosinsky, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xu et al., 2018</xref>). However, previous studies on skin wound healing have suggested a beneficial role of transiently appearing senescent cells in that process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Demaria et al., 2014</xref>). This, in large part, has formed the basis for the hypothesis that senescent cells, although detrimental in the context of aging, may be beneficial for tissue repair via the secretion of the SASP, in part by attracting immune cells and initiating the tissue repair process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kowald et al., 2020</xref>). However, whether this concept holds true across tissues beyond the skin is of considerable importance, particularly for the potential translation of senolytic therapies for osteoporosis. Indeed, a detrimental effect of senescent cell clearance on fracture repair would pose a substantial roadblock for the development of senolytic therapies for osteoporosis. Relevant to this issue, we demonstrate senescent cells in the dynamically healing bone and define the time course of appearance and subsequent disappearance of these cells from the fracture callus. Importantly, using both a genetic and pharmacological model, we reduce the senescent cell burden and demonstrate no adverse effects, but rather beneficial effects (i.e. increased callus volume in the <italic>Cdkn2a<sup>Ink4a</sup></italic> knock out model and accelerated timecourse of healing with senolytics) on fracture healing.</p><p>As noted earlier, we focused this initial study on young adult mice in order to avoid potential confounding due to aging and to define the possible physiological role of senescent cells in fracture healing. At a gene expression level and using two independent post-transcriptional techniques (SADS and TAF), which are the most specific markers for cellular senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Farr et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hewitt et al., 2012</xref>) we were able to first describe the appearance of senescent cells within the physiologically healing murine bone. Moreover, we established a timecourse of cellular senescence peaking on day 14 in healing long bones and made use of a genetic knock out model of <italic>Cdkn2a<sup>Ink4a</sup></italic>, the <italic>Cdkn2a<sup>LUC</sup></italic> mouse (<italic>19</italic>), to both visually detect and assess the role of <italic>Cdkn2a<sup>Ink4a</sup></italic> knock out on fracture healing. In line with the findings by Demaria et al. in skin wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Demaria et al., 2014</xref>), a transient increase of <italic>Cdkn2a<sup>Ink4a</sup></italic>-positive cells was detected in the final stages of the anabolic and beginning catabolic phase of fracture healing. The healing process itself, however, was not fundamentally changed by the functional reduction of <italic>Cdkn2a<sup>Ink4a</sup></italic> but the callus volume was significantly enhanced in mice with <italic>Cdkn2a<sup>Ink4a</sup></italic> deletion relative to wild-type controls.</p><p>Our analysis of publically available single-cell RNAseq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baryawno et al., 2019</xref>) indicated that MSCs in murine bone and bone marrow are an important cell population undergoing senescence and we further demonstrated effects of D + Q in clearing senescent MSCs in vitro. However, the precise identity of the cells undergoing transient senescence in the fracture callus remains unclear. This is particularly important in the fracture callus, as there are several stages of fracture healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Claes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marsell and Einhorn, 2011</xref>), including formation of a hematoma (~days 1–5), fibrocartilagenous phase (~days 5–11), bone formation (~days 11–18), and bone remodeling (after day 18); thus, multiple other cell types (e.g. cartilage cells, others) in addition to MSCs could be undergoing senescence, and characterizing these senescent cells is the focus of ongoing work in our laboratory.</p><p>The role of the SASP in the skeletal system has mostly been shown to be adverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Farr and Khosla, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Millerand et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yao et al., 2020</xref>). We demonstrate here a substantial increase in the SASP during fracture healing, with some SASP factors increasing during the inflammatory phase and others in early and late callus forming phases. Although multiple approaches have been used to subclassify the SASP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acosta et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Basisty et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coppé et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Özcan et al., 2016</xref>), we for the first time elucidated its components within healing bone and found specific <italic>Cdkn2a<sup>Ink4a</sup></italic> and <italic>Cdkn1a<sup>Cip1</sup></italic> clusters of associated SASP factors with a concordant timecourse during fracture healing. Elucidating the potential therapeutic applicability of these findings, we made use of a first-generation senolytic cocktail, D + Q. This treatment has successfully moved from preclinical studies after reducing the cellular senescence burden in bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Farr et al., 2017</xref>) and adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xu et al., 2018</xref>) and is currently in multiple clinical trials, including for the prevention and/or treatment of osteoporosis (NCT04313634). We demonstrated its efficiency in reducing MSC senescence in vitro and treated healing murine long bones in vivo with this senolytic regimen. Following senolytic treatment, the senescence marker <italic>Cdkn2a<sup>Ink4a</sup></italic> was substantially reduced, along with a number of SASP markers. The time course of bone healing was accelerated, and biomechanical bone parameters partly enhanced (i.e. maximal torque). Notably, some SASP markers, specifically <italic>Gdf15</italic> and <italic>Pdgfb</italic>, were increased after the senolytic treatment. It has been hypothesized that up to a certain threshold, a transient senescent burden may be favoring healing (e.g. skin wounds), while above this threshold there may be a failure of wound closure, as observed in chronic wounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Magalhães and Passos, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pratsinis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wilkinson and Hardman, 2020</xref>). Our findings suggest that cellular senescence in healing bone follows a transient time course that peaks around the second week of fracture healing, thereby potentially suppressing callus formation. Given that senolytics do not kill all senescent cells, but rather reduce their proportion (e.g. by ~30 % <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>) our data demonstrate that this reduction is sufficient to enhance callus formation and at least does not impair the biomechanical properties of the healed bone.</p><p>In addition to implications for senolytic therapies for osteoporosis, our findings also have potential biological implications. Specifically, the concept of senescent cells as physiologically facilitating tissue repair which, to date, has been definitively demonstrated principally in the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Demaria et al., 2014</xref>) may be overly simplistic. Thus, contrary to the skin and uniquely in the living organism, bone has the ability to fully recover without losing its integrity and form a scar. As such, it is possible that the transient appearance of senescent cells is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism during injury repair, with beneficial effects on skin wound healing, which is associated with scar formation. By contrast, the lack of scar formation in bone and the already highly inflammatory state following fracture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marsell and Einhorn, 2011</xref>) may render these transiently appearing senescent cells less useful and, as demonstrated in our study, potentially detrimental, to injury repair in bone. Clearly, further studies are needed to test this hypothesis, but our findings should stimulate a reconsideration of senescent cells as generally beneficial in the setting of tissue injury and repair.</p><p>In summary, we demonstrate that cellular senescence is present in fracture callus development using both transcriptional and more specific analyses evaluating distension of satellite heterochromatin and telomeric DNA damage, hallmarks of cellular senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">López-Otín et al., 2013</xref>). We established the time course of <italic>Cdkn2a<sup>Ink4a</sup></italic> or <italic>Cdkn1a<sup>Cip1</sup></italic> expression during fracture healing, associated well-described SASP components to these key senescent genes, and reduced the senescent burden with senolytics. Importantly, this approach did not impair, but rather enhanced the fracture healing process in vivo. Collectively, our findings have clinical implications for the development of senolytic therapies for osteoporosis and also have biological relevance for our concept of senescent cells as facilitating healing, as these beneficial versus detrimental effects of senescent cells on injury repair may vary across tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Maximum torque was the highest force that the bone could sustain before fracture, and stiffness was calculated from the linear portion of the loading curve (higher values for both are indicative of stronger bone) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Undale et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>mRNA-sequencing (mRNA-seq) and analysis mRNA sequencing data was obtained from GSE152677 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coates et al., 2019</xref>). Thirty-five female femoral fracture mRNA-seq datasets were aligned to the mouse reference genome mm10. The fastq-dump files were obtained from the BioProject PRJNA640062. Quality control of fastq files was carried out via FastQC (version 0.72) and reads were mapped to the mouse reference genome [mm10] using HISAT2 (version 2.1.0) on Galaxy (version 7). Read counts were generated using the featureCounts tool (version 2.0.1) and analyzed for differential gene expression using DESeq2 (version 2.11.40.6). Significantly differentially regulated genes were selected by a Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted <italic>P</italic>-value &lt; 0.05 and log2-fold changes above 0.5 or below –0.5.

Briefly, after soft tissue removal, a 7 mm section around the fracture site (and a 7 mm section at the same location on the intact contralateral site) was extracted and homogenized in QIAzol. Subsequent RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and targeted gene expression measurements of mRNA levels by qRT-PCR were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eckhardt et al., 2020</xref>). Total RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer’s instructions using QIAzol Lysis Reagent. Purification with RNeasy Mini Columns (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) was subsequently performed. On-column RNase-free DNase solution (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA), was applied to degrade contaminating genomic DNA. RNA quantity was assessed with Nanodrop spectrophotometry (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, DE). Standard reverse transcriptase was performed using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems by Life Technologies, Foster City, CA). Transcript mRNA levels were determined by qRT-PCR on the ABI Prism 7900HT Real Time System (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA), using SYBR green (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).

The slides were then hybridized in a humid chamber for 2 hr at RT. Sections were washed and mounted with vectashield DAPI-containing mounting media (Life Technologies) prior to image acquisition and analysis. The number of TAF per cell was quantified in a blinded fashion by examining overlap of signals from the telomere probe with γ-H2A.X. The mean number of TAF per cell in bone diaphysis and/ or callus was quantified using FIJI (Image J; NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA), and the percentage (%) of TAF-positive (TAF+) cells was calculated for each mouse based on the following criteria: % of cells with ≥1 TAF, % of cells with ≥2 TAF, and % of cells with ≥3 TAF, respectively.

The used animal numbers are indicated in the Figure Legends; all samples presented represent biological replicates. No mice, samples, or data points were excluded from analyses. Data were examined for normality and distribution using dot plots and histograms; all variables were examined for skewness and kurtosis. If the normality or equal variance assumptions for parametric analysis methods were not met, data were analyzed using non-parametric tests (e.g. Wilcoxon Rank Sum test, Mann-Whitney U test). For parametric tests, depending on the comparison, differences between groups were analyzed by independent samples t-test or one-way ANOVA, where justified as appropriate. When ANOVA determined a statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) effect, pairwise multiple comparisons were performed and the Tukey post-hoc method was applied. Statistical analyses were performed using either GraphPad Prism (Version 9.0) or R version 4.0.2.

However, the potential role of senescent cells in fracture healing has not been defined. In this elegant study, the authors have used publicly available mRNA-sequence data of murine femoral fractures to demonstrate increased expression of senescence and senescence-associated secretory phenotype markers during fracture healing. By using an appropriate genetic mouse model, the authors provide direct experimental evidence for the presence of senescent cells at the fracture site and that elimination of p16Ink4a expressing senescent cells led to improved fracture healing phenotype. These findings are relevant in terms of exploring the therapeutic utility of senolytic drugs to promote healing of delayed healing fractures in the elderly.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Modulation of fracture healing by the transient accumulation of senescent cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Subburaman Mohan as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Carlos Isales as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Roberto Pacifici (Reviewer #2); Lynda Bonewald (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Age and gender of mice used in various in vivo studies are not clearly described. Four month old male mice were used in the first study for the generation of closed diaphyseal femoral fractures. All NIH supported studies must include both male and female mice. It was not clear if this was this case for the studies described in this manuscript.</p><p>2) Although the callus bone volume, stiffness and maximum torque were increased in the D+Q treated mice, these changes did not reach statistical significance (Figure 6G and H). Since only 5 mice were evaluated for the fracture healing phenotype, the issue of whether lack of a significant effect is due to insufficient power should be discussed. If possible, it would be useful to increase the number of mice per group in order to achieve statistical significance. If this is not possible, the interpretation of these data should be toned down and less emphasis given to these findings in the discussion.</p><p>3) It is known that fracture healing is composed of distinct stages with changing cell populations. The authors offer the mesenchymal stem cell as the cell responsible for expressing senescence markers, but this requires further confirmation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Four month old male mice were used in the first study for generation of closed diaphyseal femoral fractures. The age and gender of mice used for the p16Luc study as well as gender of mice the D+Q study need to be described. 2) Although the callus bone volume and stiffness were increased in the D+Q treated mice, these changes did not reach statistical significance. Since only 5 mice were evaluated for the fracture healing phenotype, the issue of whether lack of a significant effect is due to insufficient power should be discussed. 3) Figure 3. Statistical analysis show that data in panel C and G are different for the two genotypes only at P&lt;0.05 (*). Therefore, the other designations of **, *** and *** can be eliminated. The same is true for figure 6.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is a very interesting and novel study that provides much needed novel information on the role of senescent cells in fracture healing. The study was carried out using an impressive array of state of the art techniques, including analysis of human data, in vitro studies and in vivo studies in mice.</p><p>The main aims of this study were to characterize the potential appearance of senescent cells during fracture healing and establish whether targeting cellular senescence with senolytics impacts facture healing dynamics. The study provides strong evidence that senescent cells are activated during fracture repair. These cells impair fracture healing, as their pharmacological removal accelerates fracture healing.</p><p>My only concern is about the lack of statistical significance of the data presented in Figure 6G and 6H. If possible, it would be useful to increase the number of mice per group in order to achieve statistical significance. If this is not possible, the interpretation of these data should be toned down and less emphasis given to these findings in the discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The data are very convincing with regards to the expression of senescent cells with fracture healing, however, it would be important to acknowledge and consider the different stages of fracture healing when interpreting the data-especially with regards to the assumption that it is MSCs that are responsible. There are several stages of fracture healing: days 1-5 hematoma, days 5-11 fibrocartilagenous cells, days 11-28 bony, days 18 and greater bone remodeling. Therefore, the assumption that MSCs are responsible is premature without examining the specific cell populations.</p><p>In the Abstract, it is stated that a subset of cells in the fracture callus displayed hallmarks of senescence but this subset is never characterized.</p><p>In Figure 1, it appears that p21 decreases soon after the fracture and p16 increases soon after the fracture. In the text it is stated that both are upregulated. This should be clarified.</p><p>In Figure 2, Days 4, 8, 14 and 28 post fracture are examined. It would be important to correlate with the different phases of fracture, to discuss what cell types are present as each stage has a different cell composition. For example, the initial anabolic phase is characterized by the recruitment of skeletal stem cells that go on to form the cartilaginous callus, then blood vessels, followed by bone. This anabolic stage is followed by a catabolic stage where the cartilagenous callus is replaced by primary bone and then bone remodeling occurs in which the marrow space and hematopoietic tissues are regenerated. It appears the p21 and p16 peak at day 14 when mainly cartilage is present. Could this suggest that cartilage may be the source of senescent cells? Which cells are positive for SADS and RAFs as shown in Figure 2 C and E?</p><p>Figure 3. The bioluminescent cells peaked at 14 days and were gone by 18 days. Were those chondrocytes or another cell type?

The study was carried out using an impressive array of state of the art techniques, including analysis of human data, in vitro studies and in vivo studies in mice.</p><p>The main aims of this study were to characterize the potential appearance of senescent cells during fracture healing and establish whether targeting cellular senescence with senolytics impacts facture healing dynamics. The study provides strong evidence that senescent cells are activated during fracture repair. These cells impair fracture healing, as their pharmacological removal accelerates fracture healing.</p><p>My only concern is about the lack of statistical significance of the data presented in Figure 6G and 6H. If possible, it would be useful to increase the number of mice per group in order to achieve statistical significance. If this is not possible, the interpretation of these data should be toned down and less emphasis given to these findings in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree this is an important issue and have now substantially expanded the D+Q study. Please see our response in point #2 of Essential Revisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The data are very convincing with regards to the expression of senescent cells with fracture healing, however, it would be important to acknowledge and consider the different stages of fracture healing when interpreting the data-especially with regards to the assumption that it is MSCs that are responsible. There are several stages of fracture healing: days 1-5 hematoma, days 5-11 fibrocartilagenous cells, days 11-28 bony, days 18 and greater bone remodeling. Therefore, the assumption that MSCs are responsible is premature without examining the specific cell populations.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, and this is, in fact, the focus of ongoing studies that we hope to complete in the coming year, although these data are not ready at this time for inclusion in our revision. Thus, we have appropriately modified the Discussion on page 19 in order to address this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the Abstract, it is stated that a subset of cells in the fracture callus displayed hallmarks of senescence but this subset is never characterized.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the Abstract to now state: “We also identified cells in the fracture callus that displayed hallmarks of senescence, including distension of satellite heterochromatin and telomeric DNA damage; the specific identity of these cells, however, requires further characterization.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 1, it appears that p21 decreases soon after the fracture and p16 increases soon after the fracture. In the text it is stated that both are upregulated. This should be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified the kinetics of <italic>p21<sup>Cip1</sup></italic>and <italic>p16<sup>Ink4a</sup></italic> changes following fracture on page 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 2, Days 4, 8, 14 and 28 post fracture are examined. It would be important to correlate with the different phases of fracture, to discuss what cell types are present as each stage has a different cell composition. For example, the initial anabolic phase is characterized by the recruitment of skeletal stem cells that go on to form the cartilaginous callus, then blood vessels, followed by bone. This anabolic stage is followed by a catabolic stage where the cartilagenous callus is replaced by primary bone and then bone remodeling occurs in which the marrow space and hematopoietic tissues are regenerated. It appears the p21 and p16 peak at day 14 when mainly cartilage is present. Could this suggest that cartilage may be the source of senescent cells? Which cells are positive for SADS and RAFs as shown in Figure 2 C and E?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree this is an important issue, and the precise identity of the transiently appearing senescent cells is the focus of ongoing work in our laboratory. We have expanded on this point in the Discussion on page 19.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3. The bioluminescent cells peaked at 14 days and were gone by 18 days.

We explicitly analyzed the overlap of the selected clusters and found that in comparison to the Lepr<sup>-</sup> MSC cluster, the Lepr<sup>+</sup> MSC cluster has a substantially higher SASP- and senescence-profile.

However, for purposes of power and based on mouse availability, specific experiments had to be conducted in a single sex, and this is now explicitly stated. In terms of combining sexes, we only combined sexes where the availability of mice was markedly limited (e.g., due to the difficulty of generating <italic>p16<sup>Ink4a</sup>-</italic>knockout mice) or where changes in gene expression were similar between sexes, and here we attempted to maintain as close a female/male distribution between the 2 groups as possible, as indicated in the Methods and Figure legends. In addition, as also now noted in the Statistical Methods section, we included sex as a co-variate in the statistical model in the limited instances when sexes were combined (please see figure legend 6: “For B: Univariate linear model with the covariate “sex”).
