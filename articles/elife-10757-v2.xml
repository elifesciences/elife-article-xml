In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, cellular rearrangements drive axis elongation. Cells exchange neighbours by converging into transient multicellular vertices which resolve through the assembly of new cell interfaces parallel to the AP axis. We found that new interfaces elongate in pulses correlated with periodic contractions of the surrounding cells. Inhibiting actomyosin contractility globally, or specifically in the cells around multicellular vertices, disrupted the rate and directionality of new interface assembly. Laser ablation indicated that new interfaces sustained greater tension than non-elongating ones. We developed a method to apply ectopic tension and found that increasing AP tension locally increased the elongation rate of new edges by more than twofold. Increasing dorsal-ventral tension resulted in vertex resolution perpendicular to the AP direction.

For example, the lungs form sacs that accommodate large volumes of air, while the skin forms a sheet to cover and protect our internal organs. One way to shape a tissue is for cells to swap places with their neighbours. During this rearrangement, the contacts between neighbouring cells break down before new contacts are formed with other cells. While the physical and molecular signals that guide the break down of cell contacts are well understood, less is known about how new contacts form.</p><p>Early in development, animal embryos establish a head-to-tail 'axis' that helps to guide where each tissue and organ will form in the body. In fruit fly embryos, the cell rearrangements that drive this process involve cells exchanging places with their neighbours by gathering around a single point. These temporary cell clusters are then organised via new cell contacts that form parallel to the head-to-tail axis.</p><p>Here, Yu and Fernandez-Gonzalez investigate the role of mechanical forces in forming new cell contacts as the head-tail axis elongates. The experiments show that disrupting the ability of the cells to generate mechanical forces inhibited the formation of new cell contacts and prevented cells from successfully swapping places. Conversely, when mechanical tension is applied at the rearrangement site, the assembly of new cell contacts happens faster. Furthermore, if the tension is applied in different orientations, new cell contacts form parallel to the direction of the mechanical force.</p><p>Yu and Fernandez-Gonzalez thus show that local mechanical forces direct the assembly of new cell contacts as the head-to-tail axis forms. These forces are most likely generated by cell contractions that appear to create mechanical tension at sites of cell rearrangement. How such physical forces are converted into molecular signals remains a question for future work.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10757.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10757.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>cell intercalation</kwd><kwd>cell mechanics</kwd><kwd>junctional remodeling</kwd><kwd>quantitative image analysis</kwd><kwd>laser ablation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>&lt;i&gt;D. melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Discovery Grant, 418438-13</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fernandez-Gonzalez</surname><given-names>Rodrigo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000196</institution-id><institution>Canada Foundation for Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Leaders Opportunity Fund, 30279</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fernandez-Gonzalez</surname><given-names>Rodrigo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000192</institution-id><institution>Ontario Ministry of Economic Development and Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Fund, 30279</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fernandez-Gonzalez</surname><given-names>Rodrigo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003579</institution-id><institution>University of Toronto</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Faculty of Medicine Dean's New Staff Fund, DF-2012-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fernandez-Gonzalez</surname><given-names>Rodrigo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000192</institution-id><institution>Ontario Ministry of Economic Development and Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Early Researcher Award, ER14-10-170</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fernandez-Gonzalez</surname><given-names>Rodrigo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003579</institution-id><institution>University of Toronto</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Barbara and Frank Milligan Graduate Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Jessica C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003579</institution-id><institution>University of Toronto</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Hayden Hantho Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Jessica C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Polarized assembly of cell-cell junctions drives <italic>Drosophila</italic> axis elongation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Axis elongation is a conserved morphogenetic process is which the basic body plan of an animal is established. In vertebrates, axis elongation involves convergence and extension movements mediated by cell intercalation, cell migration, and oriented cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bénazéraf and Pourquié, 2013</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, axis elongation occurs in an epithelial monolayer referred to as the germband, which lengthens by more than two-fold along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis of the animal, while narrowing along the dorsal-ventral (DV) axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The changes in germband architecture are largely driven by cell intercalation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Irvine and Wieschaus, 1994</xref>).</p><p>Cell intercalation facilitates changes in tissue architecture through neighbour exchange events. In vertebrates, cell intercalation drives many developmental processes, including primitive streak formation in chick embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Voiculescu et al., 2007</xref>); gut organogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chalmers and Slack, 2000</xref>), neural tube closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davidson and Keller, 1999</xref>), and elongation of kidney tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lienkamp et al., 2012</xref>) in <italic>Xenopus</italic>; epiboly in <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Keller, 1980</xref>) and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Warga and Kimmel, 1990</xref>); convergence and extension of the mesoderm in <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wilson et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shih and Keller, 1992</xref>), zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yin et al., 2008</xref>), and mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yen et al., 2009</xref>); and visceral endoderm migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Migeotte et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Trichas et al., 2012</xref>), eye lid closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heller et al., 2014</xref>), neural plate elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Williams et al., 2014</xref>), palate fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2015</xref>), and limb bud elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lau et al., 2015</xref>) in mouse.</p><p>During <italic>Drosophila</italic> axis elongation, cell intercalation is driven by polarized actomyosin contractility, which promotes the disassembly of interfaces separating anterior and posterior cell neighbours (AP interfaces), to form multicellular vertices where four or more cells converge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertet et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zallen and Wieschaus, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blankenship et al., 2006</xref>). Polarized disassembly of cell contacts is also associated with cell intercalation in chick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rozbicki et al., 2015</xref>)<italic>, Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shindo and Wallingford, 2014</xref>), and mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Williams et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lau et al., 2015</xref>). Following contraction of AP interfaces in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> germband, multicellular vertices are systematically resolved through the assembly of new contacts separating dorsal and ventral cell neighbours (DV interfaces, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). While vertex resolution and the subsequent assembly of new cell-cell interfaces drive tissue elongation, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate these processes. Myosin turnover between phosphorylated and unphosphorylated states is important for the directionality of vertex resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kasza et al., 2014</xref>). Computational modelling suggests that periodic contraction of the apical surface of germband cells, driven by pulsatile actomyosin networks, could promote the oriented assembly of new cell contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lan et al., 2015</xref>). However, the role of actomyosin contractility in vertex resolution remains unclear.</p><p>In this study, we combine quantitative imaging with biophysical and pharmacological manipulations to investigate the mechanisms of vertex resolution in <italic>Drosophila</italic> axis elongation. We find that the assembly of new interfaces during vertex resolution occurs in pulses associated with the periodic contraction of the cells anterior and posterior to the multicellular vertex. Pulsed actomyosin contractility in the cells around the vertex is critical for the directionality and rate of assembly of the new cell interface. Local, ectopic AP tension is sufficient to accelerate the assembly of new interfaces, and local DV tension can reorient vertex resolution. Together, our results demonstrate that local, periodic actomyosin contractility directs the resolution of multicellular vertices and promotes the assembly of new cell contacts during polarized cell rearrangements in <italic>Drosophila</italic> germband extension.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Pulsed assembly of new junctions during germband extension</title><p>To investigate the mechanisms of vertex resolution during <italic>Drosophila</italic> axis elongation, we used quantitative image analysis to measure the dynamics of assembly of new DV junctions in embryos expressing Resille:GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morin et al., 2001</xref>) to visualize cell outlines. We found that the assembly of new DV edges occurred in cycles of elongation and shortening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>, blue line), with a period of 126 ± 5 s (<italic>n</italic> = 110 edges). On average, elongation pulses increased edge length by 772 ± 46 nm, while shortening pulses decreased edge length by a significantly smaller amount, 114 ± 19 nm (<italic>n</italic> = 110 edges, p = 9.0 × 10<sup>−22</sup>), thus resulting in net edge elongation. Germband cells undergo characteristic cycles of apical area contraction and relaxation with a period of 130 ± 3 s, and predominantly oriented along the AP axis of the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fernandez-Gonzalez and Zallen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sawyer et al., 2011</xref>). To examine whether the anisotropic oscillations of germband cells were associated with the assembly of new cell junctions during vertex resolution, we compared the changes in length of the nascent DV edge to the changes in apical area of the cells immediately anterior or posterior to that DV edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). In a majority of cases (143/220 cell-edge pairs, 65%), we observed a negative correlation between changes in length of the new DV junction and changes in area of the cell anterior or posterior to it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To calculate the dominant relationship between changes in anterior/posterior cell area and new DV edge length, we quantified the correlations after shifting the edge length backward or forward in time. Reaching the maximum correlation with small time shifts would indicate in-phase oscillations, while maximum anti-correlation with small time shifts would suggest oscillations in anti-phase. We found that short time shifts of the edge length signal maximized the anti-correlation, while longer time shifts were necessary to maximize the correlation (p = 1.74 × 10<sup>−5</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>), further suggesting that pulses of new DV edge assembly are associated with the contraction of the anterior and posterior cells. Similar analyses demonstrated that changes in length of the new edge were predominantly positively correlated with changes in the apical area of the dorsal and ventral cells, which share the new edge (156/220 cell-edge pairs, 71%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

To investigate if actomyosin contractility is necessary for vertex resolution, we injected embryos expressing E-cadherin:GFP and myosin:mCherry with the Rho-kinase inhibitor Y-27632 at 100 mM. Rho-kinase is one of the main activators of myosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amano et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kimura et al., 1996</xref>), and treatment with Y-27632 abolishes the ability of germband cells to generate mechanical force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fernandez-Gonzalez et al., 2009</xref>). In Y-27632-injected embryos, germband cells displayed a rapid loss of myosin from their apical surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>), resulting in a dramatic reduction in the amplitude of apical area oscillation (p = 1.7 × 10<sup>−44</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–H</xref>). Inhibiting actomyosin contractility affected the directionality of vertex resolution: 9/25 vertices resolved within 30° of the DV axis in Y-27632-injected embryos, in contrast to 0/28 in water-injected controls (p = 0.02, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I,J’,K</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). In addition, for vertices that resolved along the AP axis, inhibiting Rho-kinase reduced the rate of new edge elongation with respect to controls (0.001 ± 0.080 μm/min vs. 0.28 ± 0.06 μm/min, respectively, p = 0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I,J,L</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>), suggesting that myosin activity facilitates the assembly of new DV interfaces.

To quantify tension, we used an ultraviolet (UV) laser to locally irradiate and sever DV interfaces in embryos expressing E-cadherin:GFP, and particle-tracking velocimetry to quantify the change in position of the tricellular vertices once connected by the severed interface. The instantaneous retraction velocity of the vertices is proportional to the tension sustained by the interface prior to ablation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hutson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fernandez-Gonzalez et al., 2009</xref>). We compared retraction velocities after ablation of control DV junctions that were not actively elongating (average length of 7.3 ± 0.3 μm, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and newly forming DV edges (average length of 3.4 ± 0.2 μm, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The retraction velocity after ablation of new DV junctions was 0.81 ± 0.08 μm/s, 32% greater than the retraction velocity after severing control DV edges (0.61 ± 0.03 μm/s, p <italic>=</italic> 0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), indicating that – assuming uniform viscoelastic properties – new DV edges sustain increased mechanical tension with respect to non-elongating edges with similar orientation. New DV interfaces displayed smaller angles between the anterior or posterior cell junctions (<italic>θ<sub>avg</sub></italic> = 136.6 ± 3.3°) than control DV interfaces, (<italic>θ<sub>avg</sub></italic> = 150.3 ± 3.4°, p = 0.02, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B,D</xref>), and the retraction velocity after laser ablation was significantly anti-correlated with the angle between the anterior or posterior cell junctions (<italic>r</italic> = −0.6, p = 2.9 × 10<sup>−5</sup>).

To this end, we used a UV laser to irradiate and destroy myosin networks in the cells anterior/posterior or dorsal/ventral to four-cell vertices. Cells expressed E-cadherin:GFP to visualize cell outlines, and myosin:mCherry to track the assembly of contractile networks. Cells were re-irradiated upon assembly of medial actomyosin networks to prevent the generation of contractile forces. Irradiated cells were not extruded in the course of these experiments. Controls were four-cell vertices in which the anterior/posterior or dorsal/ventral cell pairs were sham-irradiated with the UV laser fully attenuated using a neutral density filter. When the contractile activity of anterior/posterior cells was disrupted, 4/7 four-cell vertices did not resolve (their length was never greater than 1 μm for at least 1 min), in contrast to 0/10 vertices in sham-irradiated controls. In controls, the rate of new edge elongation calculated over 180 s was 0.47 ± 0.08 μm/min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,C</xref>). Preventing contraction of the anterior/posterior cells resulted in a significant reduction of the rate of new edge elongation to 0.18 ± 0.05 μm/min for the vertices that resolved (p = 0.03; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–C</xref>).

In contrast with the ablation of anterior/posterior cells, ablation of the DV cells did not prevent vertex resolution: 5/7 new DV interfaces reached a length of at least 1 μm, similar to 10/10 in controls. The initial rates of elongation were similar, with new DV interfaces elongating at a rate of 0.37 ± 0.11 µm/min over 60 s when contraction of the DV cells was disrupted, compared to rates of 0.50 ± 0.15 µm/min in sham-irradiated controls (p = 0.48, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F</xref>). However, ablation of the dorsal and ventral cells resulted in a significant reduction of the rate of new interface elongation over the subsequent 120 s of elongation, from 0.52 ± 0.11 μm/min in controls to -0.03 ± 0.08 μm/min (p = 0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F</xref>). Notably, in 3/5 vertices that resolved when dorsal/ventral cells were ablated, new DV edges formed but were not sustained beyond 1 min, collapsing back into vertices. Together, our data suggest that dorsal/ventral cells are necessary to sustain the elongation of new DV interfaces, but not the resolution of multicellular vertices.</p><p>To determine if mechanical tension from the anterior and posterior cells can promote the elongation of new DV interfaces during germband extension, we developed a method to apply ectopic local tension to resolving vertices based on wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Campinho et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fernandez-Gonzalez and Zallen, 2013</xref>). Upon wounding by irradiation with a UV laser, germband cells undergo apical constriction driven by medial-apical actomyosin networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Apical constriction of germband cells generates ectopic tension on the surrounding cell interfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>, arrowheads). We used a UV laser to wound the cells anterior and posterior to resolving vertices by irradiating their medial-apical surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>). Under sham-irradiation (UV laser fully attenuated using a neutral density filter), the cell area and medial myosin of the anterior and posterior cells remained largely unaffected, and the new DV interface elongated at a rate of 0.79 ± 0.14 μm/min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,C,E</xref>). Conversely, when the cells anterior and posterior were irradiated with UV light, myosin accumulated on the apical surface of the wounded cells and their apical areas decreased rapidly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,D</xref>), resulting in ectopic, AP-oriented tension on the resolving vertex. Under ectopic tension parallel to the AP axis, new DV junctions elongated at a rate of 1.73 ± 0.30 μm/min, 2.1-fold faster than the elongation rate in controls (p = 6.2 × 10<sup>−3</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

We compared the orientation and rate of new edge elongation in sham-irradiated embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) and in embryos in which we induced apical constriction of the cells dorsal and ventral to a four-cell vertex, increasing tension along the DV axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). All the four-cell vertices examined in control embryos (<italic>n</italic> = 12) resolved within 30° of the AP axis, and the rate of new interface assembly was 0.69 ± 0.13 μm/min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F,H</xref>). When we applied ectopic tension along the DV axis, the rate of new edge elongation was not affected (0.74 ± 0.18 μm/min, p = 0.8), but the orientation of the new edge changed and occurred within 30° of the DV axis in 13 out of 13 cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G,H</xref>). Together, our data indicate that local tension can promote and orient the assembly of new cell-cell interfaces, suggesting a central role for mechanical forces during vertex resolution in <italic>Drosophila</italic> axis elongation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Polarized junction remodelling drives changes in tissue architecture from worms to mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Walck-Shannon and Hardin, 2014</xref>). While junctional contraction and disassembly in the context of cell intercalation have been extensively explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertet et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blankenship et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rauzi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fernandez-Gonzalez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Levayer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bosveld et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shindo and Wallingford, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lau et al., 2015</xref>), little is known about the mechanisms that control the directional assembly of new cell contacts during neighbour exchange. We used quantitative imaging, and biophysical and pharmacological approaches to show that local mechanical forces can direct the assembly of new junctions during <italic>Drosophila</italic> germband extension. New junctions elongate in pulses anti-correlated with the periodic contractions of the cells anterior and posterior to the new contact. Inhibiting actomyosin contractility disrupts both the rate and directionality of new junction assembly. Disrupting contractility in the cells anterior and posterior to the new edge disrupts vertex resolution and slows down new edge elongation, while preventing contraction of the dorsal and ventral cells mainly affects the maintenance and lengthening of the new cell interface. Hypercontraction of the cells anterior and posterior to the new edge accelerates the rate of new edge assembly. Finally, applying ectopic tension orthogonal to the characteristic orientation of vertex resolution is sufficient to alter the direction of new edge formation, suggesting that mechanical forces associated with actomyosin contractility direct the assembly of new cell contacts during multicellular vertex resolution in germband extension.</p><p>We show that vertex resolution occurs under increased mechanical tension, in a process that requires actomyosin contractility. Consistent with this, expression of inactive or constitutively active forms of myosin in embryos lacking the wild-type motor protein disrupts the directionality of vertex resolution during germband extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kasza et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, mechanical tension is necessary for directional resolution of multicellular vertices in the mouse embryonic ectoderm during limb bud elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lau et al., 2015</xref>). In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> dorsal thorax, whose architecture is determined by neighbour exchange events, actomyosin contractility in new edges is tightly regulated to facilitate their elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bardet et al., 2013</xref>). Our data suggest that the increase in tension on the new contact may be caused locally by the pulsatile, anisotropic contraction of the cells around the resolving vertex. Interestingly, cells in the mouse limb bud ectoderm also display pulsed contractions that are disrupted in β-catenin mutants, and in these mutants the directionality of vertex resolution is lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lau et al., 2015</xref>). Together, these results are consistent with a general role for pulsed contractile activity in orienting and promoting cell intercalation.</p><p>We find that anterior/posterior and dorsal/ventral cells may play different roles during multicellular vertex resolution. Our data suggest that the anterior and posterior cells contribute to both vertex resolution and new edge elongation, while the dorsal and ventral cells are mainly necessary to support the elongation of the edge once the vertex has resolved. Recent mathematical modelling predicts that periodic actomyosin contractility in the medial-apical surface of anterior and posterior cells could drive the assembly of new edges during germband extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lan et al., 2015</xref>). The pulsed contraction of the anterior and posterior cells could cause rapid membrane reorganization in the dorsal and ventral cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pramanik et al., 2009</xref>), facilitating the assembly of an actin scaffold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pickering et al., 2013</xref>) and the formation of junctions. Junctional and cytoskeletal remodelling require intact DV cells, and possibly, the continued stimulus from AP cell pulsing. The implementation of optogenetic approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guglielmi et al., 2015</xref>) to locally inhibit membrane remodelling and junctional and cytoskeletal dynamics will reveal how these processes are coordinated across cells to promote directional cell rearrangements during epithelial morphogenesis.</p><p>The mechanisms by which mechanical tension regulates the assembly of new cell interfaces during germband extension remain unclear. An accumulation of filamentous actin is the first known step of vertex resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blankenship et al., 2006</xref>), and in this study, we found that blocking actin polymerization results in multicellular vertices that do not resolve. Thus, actin polymerization may play a central role in vertex resolution. Mechanical forces can control actin dynamics in vitro, possibly by inducing conformational changes in the formin family of actin regulators to favour faster and more frequent polymerization of actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Courtemanche et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Higashida et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jegou et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, actin filaments are less susceptible to severing in the presence of increased tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hayakawa et al., 2011</xref>), which may accelerate actin assembly at nascent cell interfaces. Understanding how mechanical forces impact the localization and dynamics of different actin regulators will contribute to elucidating the mechanisms by which tension promotes directional cell behaviours during <italic>Drosophila</italic> axis elongation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks</title><p>We used the following markers for live imaging: <italic>ubi-E-cadherin:GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oda and Tsukita, 2001</xref>), <italic>sqh-sqh:mCherry</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Martin et al., 2009</xref>), <italic>resille:GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morin et al., 2001</xref>), <italic>sqh-GFP:utrophin</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rauzi et al., 2010</xref>), and <italic>par-6</italic><sup>Δ</sup><italic><sup>226</sup>, par-6:GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wirtz-Peitz et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Time-lapse imaging</title><p>Stage-7 embryos were dechorionated in 50% bleach for 90 s, rinsed, glued ventrolateral side down to a glass coverslip using heptane glue, and mounted in a 1:1 mix of halocarbon oil 27 and 700 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).

The rate of elongation was calculated over the initial 90 s of interface elongation, unless indicated otherwise. Cell areas were quantified using an algorithm in which seeds were manually placed within each cell of interest in the first timepoint of a movie. Seeds were automatically expanded to delineate the cell boundaries using the watershed method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beucher, 1992</xref>), a region-growing algorithm. Seeds were subsequently propagated to the next time point using particle image velocimetry to account for cellular movement (Wang and Fernandez-Gonzalez, in preparation), and the process was iterated. To measure retraction velocities following laser ablation, we determined the change in distance between the two vertices delimiting the ablated interface, and divided this value by the sum of the ablation and the stack acquisition times.</p><p>In time-lapse images, fluorescence was measured from maximum intensity projections of three apical slices. Fluorescence intensities were background-subtracted using the most frequent pixel value (the mode) of a maximum intensity projection of three basal slices cropped around the region of interest (10 μm × 10 μm). Intensity values were corrected for photobleaching by dividing by the mean image intensity in each time point. To quantify myosin levels in new DV edges with respect to AP edges, we imaged embryos expressing myosin:mCherry, and measured fluorescence in manually traced cell interfaces. We subtracted the image mode from the myosin fluorescence measurements as an estimate of the background.</p><p>Oscillatory cell behaviours were characterized by the rate of change per minute of the corresponding magnitude, calculated as the difference of measurements collected 1 min apart. To calculate periods, rates of change were detrended by subtracting the line of best fit using the <italic>detrend</italic> function in Matlab (Mathworks). The period was computed as the inverse of the dominant frequency in a fast Fourier transform of the detrended signal. To calculate the mean change in edge length during the elongation or shortening steps of new DV edge formation, we quantified the area under the curve for positive (elongation) or negative (shortening) rates of length change. The resulting numbers were the total elongation or shortening for a given edge, which divided by the number of pulses yielded the mean change in length per elongation or shortening pulse. The correlation between signal pairs was determined using the <italic>corrcoef</italic> function in Matlab (Mathworks). To find the time shift required for minimum or maximum correlation between signal pairs, one signal was shifted forward and backward in time relative to the other, in increments of 10 s up to 240 s. With each increment, the correlation was recalculated. The resulting correlation curve was Gaussian-smoothed using a sigma of 10 s, and the time shifts required to obtain the first local minimum and maximum in the correlation values were determined.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Sample means were compared using Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Glantz, 2002</xref>).

The manuscript is of general interest since cell rearrangements are fundamental to many morphogenetic processes in both invertebrates and vertebrates. Such rearrangements involve shrinkage and expansion of junctions, and while most work in this area has focused on junction shrinkage, this work is notable for its focus on junction elongation.

The question arises, then, whether the receding of the junction is due to loss of tension in the A/P cells, or rather due to contraction of the D/V cells? We ask the authors to clarify this situation.

In the Results section the authors state that &quot;If actomyosin contractility in the cells anterior and posterior to the resolving vertex drives directional vertex resolution, then the nascent edge must be under tension&quot;. However, force balance is sufficient to generate a tensed junction upon formation, and it is well known that DV edges prior to cell rearrangement are characterized by a lower tension (they do not accumulate Myosin II). Therefore, the tension of the newly formed edge should be compared to the average junction tension. Overall it is difficult to be sure that the difference observed between &quot;new&quot; junctions and &quot;control&quot; junctions is not just due to their average difference in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The authors need to compare the tension in a pool of &quot;old&quot; and &quot;new&quot; DV junctions which have the same length averages.

Nonetheless, because cytochalasin had no such effect, your overall arguments remain convincing. Ideally, these data on Par complex localization should be discussed, as they do provide some important insights. If there's a good reason to leave the data out, this may be acceptable; but at a minimum, the paper needs to explicitly acknowledge that the Y compound has pleiotropic effects here, while the cytochalasin data make a strong case for actomyosin explaining the phenotypes reported.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10757.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Major comments: 1) The reviewers both find the correlation between DV junction elongation and the contractions of the neighboring cells to be of interest, but not entirely convincing as shown. The elongation of DV junctions was shown by the authors to be anti-correlated with changes of the surface areas of the Anterior and Posterior cells, but at the same time to be correlated with the surface area changes of Dorsal and Ventral cells. The question arises, then, whether the receding of the junction is due to loss of tension in the A/P cells, or rather due to contraction of the D/V cells? We ask the authors to clarify this situation. One possibility is asking if laser cutting of the anterior and posterior cells, perpendicular to the DV junction, releases the tension along the junction and thus prevents elongation. A related question is whether these AP contractions contribute only to junction elongation or also to the initial resolution of the multicellular vertices.</italic> To determine the relative contribution of anterior/posterior (A/P) or dorsal/ventral (D/V) cells to the elongation of new junctions parallel to the AP axis of the embryo, we ablated medial myosin networks in the cells A/P or D/V to resolving four-cell vertices. Repeated ablations were necessary to prevent the assembly of contractile actomyosin networks that drive pulsatile cell behaviours. We found that both A/P and D/V cells were necessary for the assembly of new DV interfaces (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Our data suggest that A/P and D/V cells may play different roles in vertex resolution and new interface elongation. When contraction of A/P cells was disrupted, vertex resolution was delayed with respect to controls, and the subsequent rate of new edge elongation decreased. In contrast, for D/V cell ablations, the initial steps of vertex resolution occurred at a similar rate as in controls, but after the new interface reached a length of approximately 1 µm, the elongation of the new interface stopped. We propose that contraction of A/P cells is necessary for the initial resolution of the multicellular vertex and the subsequent elongation of the new DV interface. D/V cells, on the other hand, may be necessary to sustain the elongation of the new DV interface that they share, by providing actin filaments and junctional molecules that stabilize that interface.</p><p>We have added a new figure (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) demonstrating the effects of A/P and D/V ablations on vertex resolution. We have also described our new results in the text (Results section):</p><p>“To further investigate the relative contribution of anterior/posterior and dorsal/ventral cells to new DV junction assembly during vertex resolution, we disrupted actomyosin contractility specifically in the anterior and posterior, or the dorsal and ventral cells. […] Together, our data suggest that dorsal/ventral cells are necessary to sustain the elongation of new DV interfaces, but not the resolution of multicellular vertices.”</p><p>Finally, we have discussed the possibility that A/P and D/V cells have different contributions to vertex resolution and new junction assembly (Discussion):</p><p>“We find that anterior/posterior and dorsal/ventral cells may play different roles during multicellular vertex resolution. […] The implementation of optogenetic approaches (Guglielmi, 2015) to locally inhibit membrane remodelling and junctional and cytoskeletal dynamics in the cells adjacent to resolving vertices will reveal the relative contributions of anterior/posterior and dorsal/ventral cells during vertex resolution and new interface elongation.”</p><p><italic>2) A second question relates to tension in elongating DV junctions across their lifetime. In the Results section the authors state that &quot;If actomyosin contractility in the cells anterior and posterior to the resolving vertex drives directional vertex resolution, then the nascent edge must be under tension&quot;. However, force balance is sufficient to generate a tensed junction upon formation, and it is well known that DV edges prior to cell rearrangement are characterized by a lower tension (they do not accumulate Myosin II). Therefore, the tension of the newly formed edge should be compared to the average junction tension. Overall it is difficult to be sure that the difference observed between &quot;new&quot; junctions and &quot;control&quot; junctions is not just due to their average difference in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The authors need to compare the tension in a pool of &quot;old&quot; and &quot;new&quot; DV junctions which have the same length averages. It would also be of interest to compare retraction velocities of freshly formed DV junctions in different times of the elongation cycle more generally, i.e. is the retraction speed different in shortening vs. expanding junctions?</italic> </p><p>Others and we showed that DV-oriented edges during germband extension are depleted of myosin (Bertet et al., 2004; Blankenship et al., 2006) and sustain reduced tension (Rauzi et al., 2008; Fernandez-Gonzalez et al., 2009). However, these studies did not distinguish between the more abundant, non-elongating, “control” DV junctions, and the less frequent “new” DV junctions. While new DV junctions also display low levels of myosin (Blankenship et al., 2006) and new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), our laser ablation data indicate that new DV junctions sustain increased tension with respect to control DV junctions. However, increased tension at new DV edges does not necessarily imply increased actomyosin contractility. Laser ablation experiments cannot distinguish between tension “actively” generated on a junction via actomyosin contractility at the junction itself, or tension “passively” sustained by a junction due to actomyosin contractility in other junctions or subcellular domains (e.g. the medial apical surface of cells) connected to the junction. In both situations the junction sustains increased tension, and ablation of the junction will result in the recoil of the vertices that the junction connected, at a velocity proportional to the tension sustained.</p><p>To clarify this point, we have added a new supplemental figure (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) showing that new DV edges display relatively low myosin levels, suggesting that the tension that new DV edges sustain must be generated elsewhere. We have discussed this figure in the text (Results section):</p><p>“Vertex retraction after laser ablation could result from actomyosin contractility at the interface or at another structure (for example, another interface or a medial apical surface) connected to the severed interface. New DV edges were myosin-depleted (Blankenship et al., 2006) (<italic>P</italic> = 4.3x10<sub>-5</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that vertex retraction after ablation of new DV edges was caused by tension generated elsewhere and exerted onto the new edge. Together, our data strongly suggest that mechanical tension parallel to the AP axis of the embryo contributes to vertex resolution.”</p><p>It is not possible to compare retraction velocities for control and new DV junctions of the same length, as by definition, new DV junctions will be shorter than control ones. However, if the difference in retraction velocity between new and control junctions was due to the reduced length of the new junctions, one would expect to see that shorter new junctions display greater recoil velocities than longer new junctions, and similarly for control junctions. Thus, to determine if the length of DV junctions correlates with the tension they sustain, we quantified the correlation between interface length and velocity of vertex retraction, both for control and new junctions. We found that there was no significant correlation between junction length and velocity of retraction after ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E-F</xref>), suggesting that the observed differences in recoil velocity between control and new junctions are not a consequence of the differences in length.</p><p>We have made the absence of a correlation between junction length and retraction velocity explicit, by including independent plots of interface length prior to ablation vs.retraction velocity (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E- F</xref>). On the new plots, we have indicated the value of the correlation between these two magnitudes to clearly demonstrate that interface length and ablation velocity are not correlated. This is also indicated in the text (Results section):</p><p>“Notably, no correlation was found between control or new DV interface length and instantaneous retraction velocity after ablation (<italic>r</italic> = 0.04 and 0.35, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E, F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that differences in retraction velocity between control and new DV edges are independent from interface length, and determined by whether the edge is being assembled.”</p><p>In addition to this, we have added a new Figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) showing examples of long edges with greater retraction velocities than short edges, both within the control and the new DV edge categories.</p><p>We investigated if tension on new DV junctions increased and decreased as junctions elongate or shrink, respectively. To this end, we conducted laser ablation experiments on new edges that were filmed for 2 min before ablation, and we calculated the rate of interface length change prior to ablation. Based on this, we classified interfaces as elongating, if their length was increasing immediately before ablation, or shortening, if their length was decreasing. The velocity of retraction for elongating interfaces (0.77 ± 0.10 µm/s, <italic>n</italic> = 10) was not significantly different from the velocity of retraction for shortening interfaces (0.74 ± 0.18 µm/s, <italic>n</italic> = 4, <italic>P</italic> = 0.87, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Author response image 1</xref>), suggesting that new DV interfaces do not experience significant changes in tension during the elongation and shortening phases of the edge assembly cycle. This result is consistent with the 6.8-fold greater magnitude of elongation pulses with respect to shortening pulses (772 ± 46 nm vs.114 ± 19 nm), which suggests that the increase in tension caused by the elongation phase may not be significantly alleviated by the shortening phase.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10757.019</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>New DV edges sustain similar tension during elongation and shortening.</title><p>Retraction velocity after laser ablation of new DV edges at the shortening (blue, <italic>n</italic> = 4 interfaces in 4 embryos) and elongation (red, <italic>n</italic> = 10 interfaces in 10 embryos) phases of the new edge assembly cycle.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10757.019">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10757.019</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-10757-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p> <italic>3) Atwood and Prehoda (CB, 2009) have shown that Y-27632 inhibits aPKC. The specificity of the Y-27632 treatment should therefore be established under the authors' experimental conditions. Is aPKC lost from the cortex in these animals?</italic></p><p>To determine if Y-27632 affected the dynamics of aPKC during axis elongation, we used a genomic rescue line (<italic>par-6<sub>Δ226</sub>, par-6:GFP</italic> (Wirtz-Peitz et al., 2008)) to determine the localization of the Par polarity complex, of which aPKC is a member, in Y-27632-injected embryos and water-injected controls. This allowed us to investigate the localization of the Par complex using a reporter that does not cause overexpression phenotypes. Upon treatment with Y-27632, Par-6:GFP accumulated in “bars” at the centre of junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 2A</xref>), similar to previous reports for Par-3, another member of the Par complex (Simoes et al., 2010). Therefore, defects in vertex resolution observed in embryos injected with Y-27632 could be caused by the loss of myosin localization at the apical cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>), by changes in the localization of the Par complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 2A</xref>), or by both. To more specifically address the role of actomyosin contractility in the elongation of new DV junctions, we treated embryos with 5 mM of Cytochalasin D, a drug that inhibits actin polymerization (Flanagan and Lin, 1980) and has been used to disrupt actomyosin contractility in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos (Martin et al., 2009). We found that Par-complex localization was not disrupted by treatment with 5 mM Cytochalasin D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 2B</xref>). However, Cytochalasin D treatment disrupted both actin and myosin dynamics in germband cells (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A, B, F-H</xref>), and the oscillatory behaviours of germband cells were significantly attenuated (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4C-E</xref>), suggesting that actomyosin contractility was disrupted. Similar to the results obtained when we injected embryos with Y-27632, we found that inhibition of actomyosin contractility using Cytochalasin D significantly affected the directionality and rate of new edge elongation during vertex resolution (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4F-K</xref>), further suggesting that actomyosin contractility is necessary for vertex resolution during <italic>Drosophila</italic> axis elongation.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10757.020</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Par complex localization is affected by Y-27632, but not by Cytochalasin D.</title><p>(<bold>A-B</bold>) Germband cells expressing Par-6:GFP at endogenous levels and injected with water (<bold>A</bold>), 100 mM Y- 27632 in water (<bold>A’</bold>), 50% DMSO (<bold>B</bold>) or 5 mM Cytochalasin D in 50% DMSO (<bold>B’</bold>).
