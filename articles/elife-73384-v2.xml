Pharmacological inhibition of ASIC1a reduces neurotoxicity and stroke infarct volumes, with the cysteine knot toxin psalmotoxin-1 (PcTx1) being one of the most potent and selective inhibitors. PcTx1 binds at the subunit interface in the extracellular domain (ECD), but the mechanism and conformational consequences of the interaction, as well as the number of toxin molecules required for inhibition, remain unknown. Here, we use voltage-clamp fluorometry and subunit concatenation to decipher the mechanism and stoichiometry of PcTx1 inhibition of ASIC1a. Besides the known inhibitory binding mode, we propose PcTx1 to have at least two additional binding modes that are decoupled from the pore. One of these modes induces a long-lived ECD conformation that reduces the activity of an endogenous neuropeptide. This long-lived conformational state is proton-dependent and can be destabilized by a mutation that decreases PcTx1 sensitivity. Lastly, the use of concatemeric channel constructs reveals that disruption of a single PcTx1 binding site is sufficient to destabilize the toxin-induced conformation, while functional inhibition is not impaired until two or more binding sites are mutated. Together, our work provides insight into the mechanism of PcTx1 inhibition of ASICs and uncovers a prolonged conformational change with possible pharmacological implications.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ion channels</kwd><kwd>toxins</kwd><kwd>pharmacology</kwd><kwd>protein engineering</kwd><kwd>fluorometry</kwd><kwd>stoichiometry</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003554</institution-id><institution>Lundbeckfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R303-2018-3030</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heusser</surname><given-names>Stephanie A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010665</institution-id><institution>H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>834274</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heusser</surname><given-names>Stephanie A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009910</institution-id><institution>Hartmann Fonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heusser</surname><given-names>Stephanie A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003554</institution-id><institution>Lundbeckfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R313-2019-571</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pless</surname><given-names>Stephan A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A peptide toxin with therapeutic potential in stroke and pain induces multiple long-lasting conformational changes in acid-sensing ion channels and affects how the channels respond to endogenous ligands.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are trimeric proton-gated cation channels expressed throughout the central and peripheral nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gründer, 2020</xref>).

Modulators can affect both ASIC activation and steady-state desensitization (SSD)—a state reached at sub-activating proton concentrations that reduces subsequent activation—but also metabotropic downstream signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kellenberger and Schild, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Venom-derived peptides are currently the most selective and potent modulators of ASIC function and therefore serve as valuable tools to gain insights into the mechanisms of ASIC modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cristofori-Armstrong and Rash, 2017</xref>). Psalmotoxin-1 (PcTx1) is a 40-residue cysteine knot peptide toxin extracted from tarantula venom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Escoubas et al., 2000</xref>). It acts as a potent gating modifier on most ASIC1a-containing channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2006</xref>) and shifts activation and SSD curves to more alkaline values, thereby effectively inhibiting the channel in the low nanomolar range at neutral pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cristofori-Armstrong and Rash, 2017</xref>). Structural studies have shown that PcTx1 binds to the subunit interfaces of cASIC1, forming contact points with the primary and complementary side of the acidic pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dawson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baconguis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). An aromatic side chain located at the entrance of the acidic pocket, F352 in human ASIC1a (F350 in mouse ASIC1a), plays an important role in PcTx1 activity because mutations to either alanine or leucine (or ASIC isoforms that naturally carry these residues at this position) display significantly attenuated PcTx1 sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sherwood et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sherwood et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Saez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Joeres et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cristofori-Armstrong et al., 2019</xref>). Additional species- and state-dependent factors greatly influence the functional outcome of PcTx1 modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sherwood et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cristofori-Armstrong et al., 2019</xref>), but fundamental mechanistic aspects of this interaction remain unresolved. For example, it remains unclear how many toxin molecules are required to obtain functional inhibition, despite the availability of structural information on the PcTx1-ASIC1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baconguis and Gouaux, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dawson et al., 2012</xref>). Further, little is known about the conformational consequences of the interaction in different functional states and under varying pH conditions. This is relevant since long-lived conformational changes could affect the activity of endogenous ASIC1a modulators.</p><p>Here, we show that PcTx1 adopts at least three distinct binding modes, of which one induces a long-lived conformational state in the ASIC1a ECD that alters the effects of the endogenous neuropeptide big dynorphin (BigDyn). Tracking the ECD conformational state further uncovers an unexpected decoupling from the state of the pore that has profound implications for the stoichiometry of the ASIC1a-PcTx1 interaction: while disrupting a single PcTx1 binding site in an ASIC1a trimer is sufficient to destabilize the long-lived PcTx1-induced ECD conformational state, functional inhibition of the channel is only affected when two or more PcTx1 binding sites are mutated. Collectively, we illustrate how a combination of voltage-clamp fluorometry (VCF) and subunit engineering provides detailed mechanistic insights on a potentially therapeutically relevant channel-toxin interaction and demonstrate how these findings affect fundamental pharmacological properties of the channel.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PcTx1 induces a long-lived ECD conformation in ASIC1a</title><p>First, we sought to establish the functional consequences of PcTx1 binding to mASIC1a. In line with previous findings, 30 nM of PcTx1 led to potent alkaline shifts in both the activation curve (ΔpH<sub>50_Act</sub> &gt; 0.5 pH units at pH 7.9; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>) and SSD of ASIC1a WT expressed in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes (ΔpH<sub>50_SSD</sub> ≈ 0.4 pH units; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Escoubas et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2005</xref>). This electrophysiological characterization provides a detailed description of how PcTx1 affects channel function, as assessed by the state of the pore. By contrast, it is unable to capture the extent and time course of possible conformational consequences caused by the toxin-channel interaction in the ECD of ASIC1a. It therefore remained unclear if potential toxin-induced conformational changes extend across the entire ECD and how long they persist. To this end, we introduced a cysteine residue into the mASIC1a ECD at amino acid position 80 or 105 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) as labeling of these positions with the environmentally sensitive Alexa Fluor 488 dye reliably reports on conformational changes related to channel gating and modulation by peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bonifacio et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borg et al., 2020</xref>). This allowed us to monitor changes in the fluorescence signal upon exposure to different proton or toxin concentrations and thus provide a proxy for ECD conformational changes at two spatially distant positions. For Alexa Fluor 488-labeled K105C mASIC1a (K105C*), application of pH 5.5 resulted in an inward current and a simultaneous upward deflection of the fluorescence signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The latter typically displayed a transient peak, which likely reflects a short-lived open state, followed by a sustained plateau with a pH dependence that was similar to the pH<sub>50_SSD</sub>, and thus likely reveals a transition related to a desensitized state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>; note that pH changes between 7.4 and 9.0 did not lead to any fluorescence changes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borg et al., 2020</xref>). Application of 300 nM PcTx1 at pH 7.4 resulted in slow upward deflection of the fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>), reminiscent of application of pH 7.0, which led to a similar functional inhibition of channel currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, and in stark contrast to the pH 7.0 application, the PcTx1-induced fluorescence signal displayed only a modest decrease after 3 min washout with pH 7.4. Post-PcTx1 exposure to pH 8.4 led to an immediate return of fluorescence to baseline level; yet, the fluorescence increased as soon as the pH was switched back to 7.4, suggesting the presence of a conformational change that is sustained at pH 7.4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, left panel). We observed similar effects with two other pH application protocols after PcTx1 exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, right panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1d</xref>).</p><p>To rule out a direct interaction between the fluorophore and PcTx1 or the possibility of a local conformational change, we also labeled the channel in position V80C of the palm domain (V80C*, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and characterized the pH and PcTx1 responses. Here, the direction of the fluorescence signals upon activation, desensitization, and application and washout of 300 nM PcTx1 at 0.3 pH units more alkaline than the pH<sub>50_fluorescence</sub> of V80C* were inverted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), but resulted in qualitatively similar effects as observed for K105C* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c and d</xref>). In light of the data obtained from K105C* and V80C*, we considered it implausible that the fluorescence changes are the consequence of a direct interaction between the dye and the peptide, but rather result from a global conformational change of the ECD after PcTx1 binding. We conclude that PcTx1 binding induces a long-lived conformational change and that this conformational alteration is not necessarily coupled to the channel pore.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>PcTx1 has three distinct binding modes, and pre-exposure can alter channel pharmacology</title><p>Next, we investigated the possibility that PcTx1 may have multiple distinct binding modes, as well as potential functional and pharmacological implications of the PcTx1-induced conformational states.</p><p>For this purpose, we first sought to define the PcTx1-induced inhibitory state in more detail.

Functional recovery from inhibition was dependent on washout time, but not activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1e</xref>), in line with previous observations of tight PcTx1 binding to the open state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2006</xref>). This finding emphasized a clear decoupling between the conformational state of the ECD and the functional inhibitory consequences at the level of the pore: while the pore slowly recovered from its inhibited state and regained its ability to conduct ions, the ECD conformation remained essentially unaltered, even after minutes of washout. We therefore suggest the presence of an ‘ECD<sub>only</sub>’ state, which is present following PcTx1 exposure and exists at neutral/low pH in the absence of PcTx1 in the solution. It causes long-lasting conformational alterations in the ECD but has no inhibitory effects on the pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p>Lastly, we sought to address the possibility of additional PcTx1-induced states beyond the ‘Global’ and the ‘ECD<sub>only</sub>’ state. To this end, we conducted a series of experiments in which we applied PcTx1 at pH 8.0, where PcTx1 neither activates the channel nor induces a significant increase in fluorescence. (i) If immediately after PcTx1 application (at pH 8.0) the channel is activated in the absence of PcTx1 and then washed with pH 7.4, the channel can enter into the long-lived ‘ECD<sub>only</sub>’ state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, left panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1f</xref>). (ii) Similarly, the ‘ECD<sub>only</sub>’ state can be reached by administering PcTx1 during a pH 8.0-induced closed state before exposing the now highly proton-sensitive channel to pH 7.4 or 7.0, which results in temporary activation and SSD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, middle panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1f</xref>). Thus, while exposure of PcTx1 at pH 8.0 has no effect on current and fluorescence, it primes the channel into a state where subsequent activation or desensitization can elicit a long-lived PcTx1-induced conformational state that is decoupled from the pore. (iii) But when a pH 8.0-induced closed state is maintained before, during, and after PcTx1 application, pH 7.4 is no longer able to elicit a conformational change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, right panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1f</xref>). This indicates that PcTx1 binding to the closed state is readily reversible at high pH. Based on the findings from these three experiments, we infer the presence of a third state that we term ‘Loose’: a loosely bound high pH state that is not associated with ECD conformational changes that can be detected by VCF, nor with changes to the functional state of the pore. The ‘Loose’ state can exist in the presence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) or after the exposure to PcTx1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and prolonged exposure of this ‘Loose’ state to high pH can wash off PcTx1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, right). A graphical summary of the proposed three states (‘Loose,’ ‘Global,’ and ‘ECD<sub>only</sub>’) is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>.</p><p>If correct, the ‘ECD<sub>only</sub>’ state would be expected to affect the activity of other ECD-targeting ASIC1a modulators. To test this possibility, we turned to BigDyn, a neuropeptide that competes with PcTx1 for the binding site and induces a distinct closed state in ASIC1a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sherwood and Askwith, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borg et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Leisle et al., 2021</xref>). The latter is indicated by a robust and distinct downward deflection of the K105C* fluorescence signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Strikingly, we found that when BigDyn (1 µM) is applied to the PcTx1-induced ‘ECD<sub>only</sub>’ state, the neuropeptide has a much less pronounced effect on the fluorescence signal than without PcTx1 pre-exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1g</xref>). To ensure that this effect is indeed specific to PcTx1, we conducted a control experiment in which we first applied BigDyn and then switched to PcTx1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In this case, the PcTx1-elicited fluorescence response post BigDyn exposure was unchanged compared to that observed in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1g</xref>). Conversely, reapplication of PcTx1 to the ‘ECD<sub>only</sub>’ state evoked a similar inhibitory and fluorescence response as the initial application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1g</xref>), indicating that a transition from the ‘ECD<sub>only</sub>’ to the ‘Global’ state is possible. In summary, these findings support the notion that the ‘ECD<sub>only</sub>’ state, although without immediate inhibitory consequences for the channel pore, does have direct implications for binding of other ECD-targeting compounds.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>F350L diminishes PcTx1 sensitivity and stability of toxin-induced conformation</title><p>Next, we wanted to establish how PcTx1 sensitivity and binding modes change in the F350L mutation that renders the channel virtually insensitive to the toxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sherwood et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Saez et al., 2015</xref>). We thus compared the PcTx1 sensitivity of the F350L mutant to that of WT mASIC1a at a pH that would neither activate nor steady-state desensitize the channels in the absence of the toxin (pH 7.9 for WT; pH 7.6 for F350L). Consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sherwood et al., 2009</xref>), introducing the F350L mutation reduced the pH sensitivity of activation and SSD, and the presence of 30 nM PcTx1 only led to a slight shift in pH<sub>50_SSD</sub>, with no discernible effect on channel activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>).

Notably, the fluorescence response curve of the K105C*F350L variant is about 0.1 pH units shifted towards more acidic pH compared to K105C* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). Taking this change into account, we applied PcTx1 at pH 7.3. Under these conditions, PcTx1 induced a similar slow-onset fluorescence signal as seen for K105C*, albeit slightly less pronounced, while the functional insensitivity of the F350L variant to PcTx1 remained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>), indicating that the channel can still enter the ‘ECD<sub>only</sub>’ state while the ‘Global’ binding mode is unfavorable.

Together, these data suggest that the functional PcTx1 insensitivity of the F350L variant primarily originates from a destabilization of the PcTx1-induced conformational states (‘Global’ and ‘ECD<sub>only</sub>’) rather than solely from impaired binding.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Contribution of individual F350L subunits to PcTx1 inhibition</title><p>The drastic reduction in PcTx1 sensitivity and notable destabilization of the PcTx1-induced ‘ECD<sub>only</sub>’ state through the F350L mutation provided a unique opportunity to determine the stoichiometric requirements for functional PcTx1 modulation, as well as the contribution of individual F350L-containing ASIC1a subunits to PcTx1 insensitivity. Conventional approaches are inapt to answer these fundamental questions as it is technically challenging to introduce targeted mutation in a single subunit within a homotrimer, and co-expression of non-concatenated WT and mutant subunits can lead to undesired, heterogeneous subunit assemblies precluding accurate interpretation of functional data. The use of concatemeric constructs helps to overcome these limitations. By fusing cDNAs of subunits of interest in the desired order, this approach predetermines the subunit composition and assembly of channels, allowing us to directly address questions such as the number of intact PcTx1 binding sites needed for functional inhibition. Importantly, the trimeric assembly of ASICs has proven to be highly amenable to this approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Joeres et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lynagh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wu et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>We therefore designed concatemeric ASIC1a constructs of triple WT subunits (WT/WT/WT) and constructs carrying the F350L substitution in one, two, or all three subunits (F350L/F350L/F350L) using a previously validated construct design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lynagh et al., 2017</xref>).

Here, we employ VCF and concatemeric ASIC1a constructs that carry a virtually PcTx1-insensitive mutation in one, two, or all three subunits to establish the stoichiometry of the ASIC1a-PcTx1 interaction. We establish three binding modes for PcTx1 and observe that at least one of them induces a ‘ECD<sub>only</sub>’ conformational change, which leaves the state of the pore unaffected but impacts binding of an endogenous peptide modulator. Collectively, our work provides mechanistic insight into the ASIC1a-PcTx1 interaction and emphasizes the potential of protein engineering approaches for detailed studies of protein−peptide interactions.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Origin of PcTx1-induced conformational changes</title><p>VCF experiments on K105C* and V80C* showed slow-onset PcTx1-induced fluorescence changes, indicating changes in the local environment of the fluorophore attached to the finger or palm domain, respectively. As outlined above, we deem it unlikely that the fluorescence changes are brought on by a direct interaction of PcTx1 with the fluorophore as the fluorescence signal follows opposite directions depending on the position used for labeling (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and G</xref>). This leaves the question if the conformational rearrangements reflect a transition into a different functional state or are related to more local PcTx1-induced conformational changes. The phenotype of the PcTx1-induced fluorescence change resembles the one observed for SSD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and we detect good agreement between the pH<sub>50_fluorescence</sub> with the pH<sub>50_SSD</sub> in all variants tested here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). This could suggest that the fluorescence change upon PcTx1 application reflects the transition of the channels from a closed to an SSD state upon PcTx1 application. However, this hypothesis is contradicted by several observations. First, during the washout of PcTx1 in K105C* or V80C*, the sustained fluorescence signal indicates a long-lived conformation not observed after SSD, and the channels can already be fully activated even before the fluorescence signal fully returns to baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Secondly, in the K105C*F350L and V80C*F350L variants, PcTx1 still introduces comparable conformational changes as seen for K105C* or V80C*, respectively, yet no functional inhibition could be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>), making it unlikely that channels have ever entered SSD. We therefore favor the notion that labeling allows us to track conformational changes that do not simply report on a known functional transition, but rather reflect unique ECD conformational alterations induced by PcTx1.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Identification of three distinct binding modes for PcTx1</title><p>Our data suggest the presence of three distinct binding modes for PcTx1: a ‘Loose,’ a tight ‘Global,’ and a tight ‘ECD<sub>only</sub>.’ We propose PcTx1 to bind loosely to the ASIC1a high-pH closed state that remains in the resting conformation even in the presence of PcTx1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and D</xref>). This association does not result in an ECD conformational change, possibly due to the acidic pocket remaining in an expanded configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yoder et al., 2018</xref>). Yet its physical nature is evident from the slight but consistent downward deflection in the fluorescence signal observed with PcTx1 application at pH 8.0, as well as the fact that it increases the proton sensitivity of the channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, middle panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Importantly, this association of PcTx1 is readily reversible as long as the channel remains in a closed state, possibly as a result of unfavorable conformational and/or electrostatic interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, right panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>In the ‘Global’ mode, PcTx1 induces an alteration of the ECD conformation and modifies gating, likely through tight coupling to the channel pore. Since PcTx1 acts as an ASIC1a gating modifier, its functional consequences are pH dependent and can be inhibitory or result in enhanced activation. When PcTx1 is applied at neutral pH, the channel enters a ‘Global’ mode that leads to subsequent inhibition of pH 5.5 currents. By contrast, enhanced activation becomes more apparent when pH 7.0 is used as a subsequent stimulus instead: while pH 7.0 does not activate the channel directly, prior exposure to PcTx1 reveals the enhanced activation that decreases during washout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The contribution of the left shift in activation is most obvious when the pH is subsequently changed to pH 8.4 before pH 7.0 exposure, which then reveals a return to the ‘Global’ state with enhanced activation.</p><p>Interestingly, an earlier study reported prolonged functional effects of PcTx1 even after washout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Escoubas et al., 2000</xref>), possibly due to slow dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dawson et al., 2012</xref>), indicating that the ‘Global’ binding mode can be long-lived. Here, we further observe conformational ECD changes that last substantially beyond the time frame of functional inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To our knowledge, this long-lasting ‘ECD<sub>only</sub>’ binding mode has not been characterized before. Several observations indicate that PcTx1 remains bound in a distinct binding mode, such as the persistent conformational ‘memory’ of the ‘ECD<sub>only</sub>’ state that appears to remain even after several functional and conformational transitions (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), the enhanced activation of the pH 7.0 current long after PcTx1 exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), and the slow dissociation constant described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dawson et al., 2012</xref>). However, we cannot ultimately rule out that PcTx1 unbinds and leaves the channel in a distinct resting state, or that membrane-associated PcTx1 diffuses to the binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gupta et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, a heterogenous distribution of modes is likely co-existing across the population of receptors expressed on the cell surface, thereby further complicating measurements and interpretations. Lastly, we would like to point out that future studies may be capable of uncovering additional binding modes, for example, those associated with PcTx1-induced potentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cristofori-Armstrong et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The potential physiological implications of this long-lasting conformational state are evident from our observation that it affects the activity of the endogenous neuropeptide BigDyn. And since increased BigDyn levels have been linked to acidosis-induced neuronal cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sherwood and Askwith, 2009</xref>), this long-lasting interference of the ‘ECD<sub>only</sub>’ conformation on the ASIC–BigDyn interaction could contribute to neuroprotective effects and provide a conceptually new route for ASIC-targeting therapeutics. Interestingly, such functionally silent states and conformations have previously been suggested to occur also in other ligand-gated ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dahan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pless et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pless and Lynch, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Munro et al., 2019</xref>) and could, at least in theory, be used to modulate protein–ligand and protein–protein interactions. We further speculate that long-lasting conformational changes could also interfere with recently proposed metabotropic functions of ASIC1a by altering intracellular protein–protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2020</xref>), although this will require additional verification.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The F350L mutation destabilizes PcTx1-induced conformational states</title><p>Consistent with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sherwood et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Saez et al., 2015</xref>), we observed that although the F350L mutation shifts the PcTx1 IC<sub>50</sub> by about three orders of magnitude, ASIC1a is not rendered completely insensitive towards PcTx1 modulation. Reduced PcTx1 inhibition could, in part, result from the reduced pH sensitivity of the F350L variant, in line with the critical role of pH on PcTx1 modulation observed for human and rat ASIC1a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cristofori-Armstrong et al., 2019</xref>). A mutant whose pH<sub>50</sub> is shifted towards higher proton concentrations (right-shifted) would show less inhibition even if PcTx1 sensitivity was maintained. However, our VCF experiments rule out decreased pH sensitivity as the main cause for reduced PcTx1 sensitivity since we corrected for the shifts in SSD and pH 5.5 is likely saturating for activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borg et al., 2020</xref>). Applied at pH 7.4, 300 nM PcTx1 (below the IC<sub>50</sub> of the unlabeled F350L variant) does not lead to conformational changes, but does so at pH 7.3, although no functional effects are observed. These experiments indicate that PcTx1 interacts with F350L* and introduces conformational changes despite the lack of functional consequences at these concentrations. This is in line with earlier results that suggested PcTx1 to still bind to F352L hASIC1a as pre-incubation with PcTx1 prevented the modulatory effects of BigDyn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sherwood and Askwith, 2009</xref>) and PcTx1 could still be crosslinked with the mutant channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Braun et al., 2021</xref>). Similarly, experiments from ASIC1a/2a concatemers of different subunit stoichiometries suggested that PcTx1 also binds to ASIC1a-2a interfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Joeres et al., 2016</xref>) despite the fact that ASIC2a subunits contain a leucine at the position corresponding to 350 in mASIC1a. Hence, the F350L mutation diminishes functional modulation by PcTx1, but not necessarily binding. Indeed, our fluorescence data indicate that the F350L mutation appears to destabilize the PcTx1-induced ‘ECD<sub>only</sub>’ state, leading to faster return of the fluorescence signal to baseline levels, suggestive of a closed <italic>apo</italic> state.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Stoichiometry of PcTx1 modulation</title><p>Structural data have recently provided a wealth of insight into the molecular details of where and how drugs or toxins bind to ion channels.

Oocytes were injected with 0.1–10 ng cRNA of mASIC1a (volumes between 9 and 50 nL) and incubated for 1–4 days at 18°C in Leibovitz’s L-15 medium (Gibco), supplemented with 3 mM L-glutamine, 2.5 mg/ml gentamycin, and 15 mM HEPES adjusted to pH 7.6. Typically, larger amounts of mutant mASIC1a cRNA were injected compared to WT mASIC1a. For electrophysiological recordings, oocytes were transferred to a recording chamber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dahan et al., 2004</xref>), continuously perfused (2.5 mL/min) with buffer containing (in mM) 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.8 BaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 5 HEPES, pH adjusted by NaOH or HCl. Solutions exchange was achieved using a gravity-driven 8-line automated perfusion system operated by a ValveBank module (AutoMate Scientific). In experiments where PcTx1 was used, all solutions were supplemented with 0.05% bovine serum albumin (≥98% essentially fatty acid-free, Sigma-Aldrich). Currents were recorded using microelectrodes (borosilicate capillaries 1.2 mm OD, 0.94 mm ID, Harvard Apparatus), backfilled with 3 M KCl (0.3–1.5 MΩ) and an OC-725C amplifier (Warner Instruments). The current signal was acquired at 500 Hz, filtered by a 50–60 Hz noise eliminator (Hum Bug, Quest Scientific) and digitized using an Axon Digidata 1550 Data Acquisition System and the pClamp (10.5.1.0) software (Molecular Devices). The current signal was further digitally filtered at 2.8 Hz using an 8-pole Bessel low-pass filter prior to analysis. Displayed current traces have been subjected to additional 50× data reduction.</p><p>Synthetic PcTx1 was obtained from Alomone Labs (&gt;95% purity). BigDyn was synthesized using automated solid-phase peptide synthesis, followed by purification via reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borg et al., 2020</xref>). Peptide stock solutions were prepared in MilliQ (18.2 MΩ resistivity) and stored at –20°C. Prior to recording, the peptide was diluted to the desired concentration in recording solution.</p><p>Concentration–response relationships of mASIC1a activation were determined by 20 s applications of solutions with decreasing pH values. Between each 20 s application, the oocytes were left to recover for at least 1 min in pH 7.4 solution (unless stated otherwise). The currents elicited by the 20 s application of acidic pH were normalized to the largest current size for each of individual oocyte tested. SSD concentration–response relationships were determined by exposing ASIC1a-expressing oocytes to a 20 s application of pH 5.6 (unless stated otherwise), while decreasing the resting pH in between applications of pH 5.6. In order to ensure that the observed current desensitization was not due to general current rundown, a final application of pH 5.6 was performed after a 2 min resting period at a resting pH that resulted in saturating current responses. Traces were used for further analysis only if the final pH 5.6 application resulted in currents that were ≥80% of the same resting pH prior to the SSD protocol. For testing the effect of PcTx1 on the ASIC1a current response, channels were activated by 20 s application of pH 5.6. Hereafter, the pH solution returned to resting pH to allow channel recovery. PcTx1 was then applied at the desired pH for 1 min prior to a 20 s application of pH 5.6. We tested addition of up to 3 μM PcTx1 to pH 7.4 buffer and 300 nM PcTx1 to pH 7.3 buffer, but did not measure an appreciable change in pH. For all protocols only traces with current sizes &lt;30 µA were used for further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Voltage-clamp fluorometry</title><p>For VCF, 5–20 ng of mASIC1a mRNA or 50 ng for concatemeric constructs were injected into oocytes that were then incubated for 2–7 days. On the day of the recording, oocytes w ere labeled by incubating them for 30 min with 10 μM Alexa Fluor 488 C5-maleimide (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at room temperature in OR2 solution containing (in mM) 82.5 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.4, subsequently washed twice with OR2, and stored in the dark until further use. Concatemeric constructs were kept in the dark for several hours as it tended to reduce background fluorescence. VCF recordings were done as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borg et al., 2020</xref>) using an inverse microscope (IX73 with LUMPlanFL N ×40, Olympus), an Olympus TH4-200 halogen lamp as light source, and using a standard GFP filter set (Olympus). The emission was detected using a P25PC-19 photomultiplier tube (Sens-Tech) and photon-to-voltage converter (IonOptix). Current and fluorescence signals were acquired, filtered, digitized, and digitally filtered as described for the other electrophysiology recordings.</p><p>For SSD and pH-dependent fluorescence measurements, running buffer at pH 7.6 was used. Labeled channels were activated for 20 s using pH 6.0, washed for 60 s with pH 7.6 buffer, exposed for 60 s to buffer at conditioning pH, and then directly activated again (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Control activations at pH 6.0 were conducted between each SSD measurement. For PcTx1 responses, running buffer at 0.3 pH units above the established pH<sub>50_fluorescence</sub> was used, unless stated otherwise. First channels were activated for 20 s with pH 5.5, washed for 60 s with running buffer before applying 300 nM PcTx1 for 80 s. Washout protocols either included 3 min exposure to running buffer, pH 8.4 buffer, or a mix of the two (20 s running buffer, 60 s pH 8.4, 40 s running buffer, 60 s pH 8.4). In experiments where PcTx1 was applied at pH 8.0 for 80 s, channels were subsequently either directly exposed to pH 7.4 or activated first with pH 5.5 for 20 s, or pH 8.0 for 80 s before switching to pH 7.4. Fluorescence levels 60 s after switching to pH 7.4 were compared to the levels reached during activation with pH 5.5. For BigDyn experiments, 1 µM BigDyn was applied at pH 7.4 either for 60 s before PcTx1 application or for 120 s once 300 nM PcTx1 had been washed off with pH 7.4 for 120 s.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Surface protein purification</title><p>Oocyte surface proteins were purified using the Pierce Cell Surface Protein Isolation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), modified here for oocytes as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lynagh et al., 2017</xref>). In brief, 30 oocytes were injected with RNA of a single mASIC1a construct. After 2 days of incubation, the oocytes were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and incubated for 25 min at room temperature with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin. Hereafter, the reaction was quenched and oocytes were washed with PBS. The oocytes were lysed, centrifuged, and the clarified supernatant was transferred to a spin column containing equilibrated NeutrAvidin Agarose and incubated for 1 hr at room temperature under gentle agitation. The flow-through was discarded, and the NeutrAvidin Agarose was washed and centrifuged. The wash procedure was repeated for a total of three times. Prior to elution, 200 µL SDS-PAGE sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, 1% SDS, 10% glycerol, pH 6.8) containing 50 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) was added and the column was incubated for 60 min at room temperature under agitation. The protein was then eluted by centrifugation. The concentration of protein was determined using the NanoDrop One<sup>C</sup> UV-Vis spectrophotometer, and the samples were stored at –20°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Western blot</title><p>Oocyte surface protein samples were denatured for 5 min at 90°C in LDS sample buffer containing reducing agent (50 mM DTT) (NuPAGE, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Protein samples (10–120 µg, dependent on the construct in order to obtain approximately equal band intensity), Novex Sharp pre-stained standard (Thermo Fisher Scientific), were separated by SDS-PAGE using a 4–12% Bis-Tris protein gel (NuPAGE, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Protein bands were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (0.45 µm, Thermo Fisher Scientific) in transfer buffer (NuPAGE, Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing 10% methanol (MeOH). After transfer, the PVDF membrane was rinsed with Tris buffered saline 20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.6 with 0.1% Tween-20 added (TBST), and subsequently blocked with 0.5% non-fat dried milk (AppliChem) in TBST using the Snap i.d. 2.0 Protein Detection System (Millipore). The blot was then incubated for 10 min at room temperature with a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-ASIC1a antibody (OSR00097W, Thermo Fisher Scientific) in blocking buffer followed by 10 min incubation at room temperature with goat anti-rabbit IgG/horseradish peroxidase-conjugate (1:10,000 dilution of 1 mg/mL stock in blocking buffer; A16110, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The blot was developed using enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents (Pierce ECL Western Blotting Substrate, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and visualized using a PXi Touch Gel Imaging System (Syngene).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data analyses were performed in Prism (8.0; GraphPad Software). Fluorescence baseline was adjusted for all fluorescence traces before analysis. For pH–response data, peak amplitudes were normalized to control activations, plotted as a function of pH, and fitted with the Hill equation constrained at min = 0 (and max = 1 for TEVC data) for each recording. The resulting EC<sub>50</sub> and Hill values were averaged to give the reported means ± 95 CI in the tables. For PcTx1 inhibition experiments, current responses after PcTx1 treatment were normalized to the current responses without PcTx1 incubation for each oocyte. The average data for the different PcTx1 concentrations were fitted using a Hill equation constrained at min = 0 and max = 1. For display in figures, a single fit to the average normalized responses (±95 CI) is shown. The change in fluorescence upon PcTx1 application was normalized to the neighboring pH 5.5 application. Washout of PcTx1 in VCF experiments was reported as the level of fluorescence under running buffer at the end of the 3 min washout relative to the PcTx1-induced fluorescence change. Fluorescence signal intensity was reported as percentage change relative to the baseline fluorescence level.</p><p>All bar diagrams and summarized data points are presented as mean ± 95 CI unless stated otherwise, and the number of replicates (n) represents individual experimental oocytes. Results were obtained from at least two batches of oocytes. An unpaired Mann–Whitney test was used to compare two groups. Multiple comparisons were made with one-way analysis of variance with Dunnett’s comparison to a control value (i.e., washout using running buffer). A significance level of p&lt;0.05 was applied for all analyses. All graphs and illustrations were made in Prism (8.0, GraphPad Software) and Illustrator CC (Adobe), and structure rendering was done using ChimeraX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pettersen et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>Reviewing editor, <italic>eLife</italic></p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Methodology, Resources, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Supervision, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Data tables.</title><p>(a).

Further details of these concerns are in the reviews, along with questions about the mechanistic implications and suggestions that we hope you will find helpful.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is a beautiful study. I have one major concern: that some the effects of solutions with higher concentrations of PcTx1 on F350L may result from a more acidic pH. There is no indication that pH was checked after addition of PcTx1. The PcTx1 solutions are made from synthetic peptide, which are commonly lyophilized from acidic solution. The amount of acid in lyophilizates can vary between preparations. Even a small amount of acid in the extracellular buffer could lead to steady state desensitization. 3 pieces of the data seem consistent with this acidic concern:</p><p>1) the Hill slopes &gt;1 for PcTx1 concentration-effect on F350L: this is consistent with H<sup>+</sup> desensitization, but not PcTx1 which shows no indication of cooperativity at lower concentrations.</p><p>2) the variability of inhibition at [PcTx1] {greater than or equal to} 100 nM (Figures 3E, 4G)</p><p>3) inexplicably dramatic difference in effect with pH 7.4 vs pH 7.3 solution (Figures 3F,G)</p><p>Could result from changes in pH after addition of PcTx1 from different lots?</p><p>Due to this concern, and the potential impacts on conclusions, I would suggest assessing whether the effects of PcTx1 solutions on F350L could result from merely a more acidic pH.</p><p>If this concern is without basis, I apologize for the trouble.</p><p>Small suggestions:</p><p>Page 5 &quot;…conformational change of the ECD upon PcTx1 binding.&quot;</p><p>Suggest changing to &quot;…after PcTx1 binding.&quot;</p><p>Page 17 &quot;VCF experiments rule out decreased pH sensitivity as the main cause for reduced PcTx1 sensitivity since we corrected from shifts in the SSD.&quot;</p><p>Might this statement be qualified due to unaccounted greater shifts of pH activation?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The PcTx1 stoichiometry (Figures 4 and 5) experiments are a valuable addition to the field. However, the long-lived effects of PcTx1 are the most intriguing aspect of the paper. It's well worth adding experiments to distinguish this novel conformation with states induced purely by pH, to more deeply contrast the proposed Global and ECDonly states and to test and refine their model.</p><p>The PcTx1-induced δ F signals observed with K105C* and V80C* are also seen with pH 6 stimulus (Bonifacio et al., 2014 Figure 1). And relatively weak pH stimulus (~ pH 6.9, Bonifacio et al., 2014 Figure 6) also produces δ F signals at these positions. PcTx1 works by increasing apparent affinity for protons (this study, Figure 1D). Very roughly, when the channel is incubated with PcTx1 at pH 7.4 it behaves as it would when alone at pH 7.1 or 7. I suspect that at either site, an SSD-style experiment from 7.4 to 7 would produce a δ F of similar direction but smaller magnitude as PcTx1 applied at 7.4 but the fluorescence would return to baseline much faster when moving back to 7.4.In other words, it would be good to compare the PcTx1+pH7.4-induced signal with that induced by a pH stimulus of similar functional consequence. This would further highlight that the conformation induced by PcTx1 at 7.4 is distinct from that induced by a functionally equivalent SSD causing stimulus.</p><p>In addition, the dissociation of Global from ECDo states could be done more rigorously through a few experiments. In the absence of PcTx1, pH 5.5 is saturating while pH 7 produces basically no current response. However, in the presence of PcTx1 pH 7 gives about 80% max response (Figure 1D). If the authors are correct that the ECDo state has uncoupled the ECD from the pore, than the pH 7 response should return back to near 0 in the ECDo state. Thus the relative response evoked by pH 7 could be used to distinguish the Global and ECDo states using the experiments in Figure 1E/G (left). After the PcTx1 application, stimulate with 7 and then repeat the stimulus 1-3 minutes into the washes. If the ECDo state is populated, the pH 7 response should be much smaller. However, if PcTx1 is still there in the Global state, the pH 7 responses should be relatively large. Alternative sweeps using pH 5.5 might be needed for normalizing purposes. The current amplitudes might be small with pH 7 stimulus but using a baseline of 7.5 or 7.6 might make the experiment more feasible. I think this would make for a much clearer distinction than the BigDyn experiment and much more compelling evidence for altered coupling (Figure 2 E,F).</p><p>The model in Figure 2D is very helpful in getting across the authors message but does imply PcTx1 is still bound in the ECDo state. I think this has problematic implications (see below). However, it can rather easily be tested by simply adding PcTx1 a second time. Using the protocol in Figure 1E/G (left), after PcTx1 incubation, pH 5.5 is applied and the current is much inhibited. pH 7.4 is applied and the fluorescence remains very different from baseline as the channels, presumably, enter the ECDo state. The model (Figure 2D) indicates PcTx1 is still bound in this state (but possibly to some distinct sub-site or altered pose?). If true, then applying PcTx1 again should do nothing. All PcTx1 sites are occupied by toxins holding the channel in the ECDo state. No new toxins can find spots so the fluorescence should be unchanged and the channels not modulated. However, if something else is going on (if PcTx1 has unbound but left the channel in a slightly different resting state for example), then a second PcTx1 application is likely to produce inhibition just as the first did. As above, I think this makes for a much more compelling distinction between Global and ECDo than the BigDyn experiment and a more explicit test of the model.</p><p>Why don't ASICs bound by PcTx1 always go into the ECDo state? If ASIC-PcTx1 complexes enter a novel long-lived non-modulated state where the toxin remains bound even well after removal from the bathing solution, then these complexes should also enter this same state when PcTX is still in the bathing solution. Fully toxin-bound channels should behave the same regardless of how much unbound toxin is floating around. From Results 4th para, all that is required for ECDo occupancy is PcTx1 plus &quot;conditions that temporarily activate and/or desensitize the channel&quot;. Thus unless I am much mistaken, the proposed ECDo state should form during typical SSD or pH response curves in the continual presence of PcTx1. You should get ECDo states in the pH response curve in Figure 1C (lower) for example. The pH 7.6 incubation followed by pH 5.5 challenge should trigger the formation of the ECDo state which should preclude modulation by PcTx1 at pH 7.4, and the current should come back. But instead you get inhibition. I think a stronger interpretation of this data is that PcTx1 unbinding enables a distinct resting state (as seen with δ F) with dampened fluorescence responses to BigDyn. The strength of ECD-pore coupling in this state, and it's occupancy by PcTx1, needs further experimental examination of the type suggested above.</p><p>A lot of the data might be explained by PcTx1 fluorescence and modulation have different stoichiometries. It could be that one bound PcTx1 induces a pretty big δ F (or even a global change in the trimer) but doesn't really provide much modulation. A second or third PcTx1 might produce smaller (or maybe even no) change in deltaF but the second and third are needed for channel modulation. Once you have a trimer saturated with PcTx1, sooner or later one PcTx1 and then a second will dissociate, leaving you with a channel that is no longer modulated, but that last residing PcTx1 keeps the fluorescence relatively high (or low for V80). This aligns nicely with their Figure 4G data. The only objection I see to this 'One PcTx1 changes Fluorescence, two change gating' model is the VCF in Figure 5. In 5C, two binding sites are disrupted. If the above model is correct, a single PcTx1 should give a high deltaF.</p><p>Is it possible the pH's for this experiment in 5C are not optimal? They use 7.4 all the way through. But the SSD for the concatemers in 5C is shifted acidic by ~ 0.2 pH units. If they repeat 5C using 7.2 as the basal pH, I wager they would get a pretty big δ F from just that one PcTx1 binding. This would further support the 'One PcTx1 for the F, two for the gating' idea.</p><p>Ultimately, I think this is a very interesting and useful paper which will make a sizeable impact in the field and completely solving the mechanism of the PcTx1-induced δ F shouldn't be a requirement for publication.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The main claim in this study is that changes in the magnitude of fluorescent signals generated by fluorescent molecules attached to ASIC1a arise from a global conformational change of the ECD induced by binding of PcTx1 to the channel. Since the most important evidence relies on the interpretation of this measurement, I would like further explanation on the following points:</p><p>a) The two residues chosen for placing the fluorescent labels (V80 and K105) are entirely exposed to water (resting, open, desensitized) in all the structures of human and chicken ASIC available today. Therefore, it is expected that the environment of those sites would not change significantly. Can the authors explain the reason of choosing specifically those two residues?</p><p>b) What is the mechanism of the small decrease in fluorescence seen after PcTx1 and pH 5.5 in Figure 1A and Figure 2A. Activation prior to the addition of PcTx1 produces a large increase in fluorescence in channels with K105C* but produces a small negative deflection when channels are activated after addition of the toxin; i.e., is the fluorescent signal produced only by desensitization but activation is silent? Is the downward deflection an artifact or reflects a physicala processs dismissed in the study? Please, provide an explanation.</p><p>c) Figure 2A the fluorescent signal shows persistence of 'a long-lasting desensitized conformation' induced by PcTx1 but channels are functional not desensitized. Please, explain what factor(s) determines the shift from one mode the other and whether in a single cell there is heterogeneity of modes.</p><p>d) The protocol in the first trace of Figure 2A shows multiple activations with low pH.

I have one major concern: that some the effects of solutions with higher concentrations of PcTx1 on F350L may result from a more acidic pH. There is no indication that pH was checked after addition of PcTx1. The PcTx1 solutions are made from synthetic peptide, which are commonly lyophilized from acidic solution. The amount of acid in lyophilizates can vary between preparations. Even a small amount of acid in the extracellular buffer could lead to steady state desensitization. 3 pieces of the data seem consistent with this acidic concern:</p><p>1) The Hill slopes &gt;1 for PcTx1 concentration-effect on F350L: this is consistent with H<sup>+</sup> desensitization, but not PcTx1 which shows no indication of cooperativity at lower concentrations.</p><p>2) The variability of inhibition at [PcTx1] {greater than or equal to} 100 nM (Figures 3E, 4G)</p><p>3) Inexplicably dramatic difference in effect with pH 7.4 vs pH 7.3 solution (Figures 3F, G)</p><p>Could result from changes in pH after addition of PcTx1 from different lots?</p><p>Due to this concern, and the potential impacts on conclusions, I would suggest assessing whether the effects of PcTx1 solutions on F350L could result from merely a more acidic pH.</p><p>If this concern is without basis, I apologize for the trouble.</p></disp-quote><p>This a good point and a reasonable concern. We have measured the pH before and after adding PcTx1 at concentrations up to 3 μM at pH 7.4 and 300 nM at 7.3 and saw no measurable changes in pH. This was performed with two different PcTx1 stocks from commercial sources. We therefore conclude that the abovementioned effects are not, or only marginally, due to PcTx1-induced acidification of the buffers. We have now added a statement in the method section to explicitly address this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Small suggestions:</p><p>Page 5 “…conformational change of the ECD upon PcTx1 binding.”</p><p>Suggest changing to “…after PcTx1 binding.”</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. The sentence has now been changed in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 17 “VCF experiments rule out decreased pH sensitivity as the main cause for reduced PcTx1 sensitivity since we corrected from shifts in the SSD.”</p><p>Might this statement be qualified due to unaccounted greater shifts of pH activation?</p></disp-quote><p>This could indeed be a concern. Based on previously published data of the K105C variant (PMID: 32165542), we know that pH 5.5 is a super-saturating proton concentration for activation. Given the relatively small shifts in SSD of the crossd variants, we would thus also expect pH 5.5 be saturating for those. We have added additional text on page 15 to directly address this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The PcTx1 stoichiometry (Figures 4 and 5) experiments are a valuable addition to the field. However, the long-lived effects of PcTx1 are the most intriguing aspect of the paper. It’s well worth adding experiments to distinguish this novel conformation with states induced purely by pH, to more deeply contrast the proposed Global and ECDonly states and to test and refine their model.</p><p>The PcTx1-induced δ F signals observed with K105C* and V80C* are also seen with pH 6 stimulus (Bonifacio et al., 2014 Figure 1). And relatively weak pH stimulus (~ pH 6.9, Bonifacio et al., 2014 Figure 6) also produces δ F signals at these positions. PcTx1 works by increasing apparent affinity for protons (this study, Figure 1D). Very roughly, when the channel is incubated with PcTx1 at pH 7.4 it behaves as it would when alone at pH 7.1 or 7. I suspect that at either site, an SSD-style experiment from 7.4 to 7 would produce a δ F of similar direction but smaller magnitude as PcTx1 applied at 7.4 but the fluorescence would return to baseline much faster when moving back to 7.4.In other words, it would be good to compare the PcTx1+pH7.4-induced signal with that induced by a pH stimulus of similar functional consequence. This would further highlight that the conformation induced by PcTx1 at 7.4 is distinct from that induced by a functionally equivalent SSD causing stimulus.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, this is a correct observation. The application of pH 7.0 leads to a similar ΔF and to similar inhibition as PcTx1. As correctly pointed out by the reviewer, and in contrast to the PcTx1 effect, the pH 7.0-induced effect washes out almost immediately. The pH-dependent effect on the fluorescence is shown in Figure 1 figure supplement 1A and for additional clarification we now added an inset of the below pH 7.0 application without a subsequent pH 5.5 stimulus. We have also provided additional text on page 4 and 14 to emphasize this observation</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, the dissociation of Global from ECDo states could be done more rigorously through a few experiments. In the absence of PcTx1, pH 5.5 is saturating while pH 7 produces basically no current response. However, in the presence of PcTx1 pH 7 gives about 80% max response (Figure 1D). If the authors are correct that the ECDo state has uncoupled the ECD from the pore, than the pH 7 response should return back to near 0 in the ECDo state. Thus the relative response evoked by pH 7 could be used to distinguish the Global and ECDo states using the experiments in Figure 1E/G (left). After the PcTx1 application, stimulate with 7 and then repeat the stimulus 1-3 minutes into the washes. If the ECDo state is populated, the pH 7 response should be much smaller. However, if PcTx1 is still there in the Global state, the pH 7 responses should be relatively large. Alternative sweeps using pH 5.5 might be needed for normalizing purposes. The current amplitudes might be small with pH 7 stimulus but using a baseline of 7.5 or 7.6 might make the experiment more feasible. I think this would make for a much clearer distinction than the BigDyn experiment and much more compelling evidence for altered coupling (Figure 2E,F).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these interesting suggestions. In the manuscript, we primarily focus on the inhibitory effect of PcTx1 (as indicated by the title) that are due to the left-shift of the SSD curve. By contrast, we did not focus on the change of the activation curve (and possibly related binding modes), nor the potentiating effect of PcTx1 observed by others (PMID: 30849303) in more detail.</p><p>However, since we were also curious about the outcome of the suggested experiments, we conducted additional VCF recordings on K105C*. Before discussing the results, we would like to point out that a direct comparison between the data in Figure 1D and the conditions that allow the best visualization of the ECD<sub>only</sub> state is not trivial: first, the labelled construct and the WT differ in their sensitivity to PcTX1 and pH, and second, the pH conditions between the VCF recordings in e.g. Figure 1E and the ones in Figure 1B are not the same.</p><p>Application of pH 7.0 to K105C* does not lead to any currents. However, application of PcTx1 at pH 7.4 and subsequent pH 7.0 stimulus leads to measurable channel activation. We think that this current represents the net result of two distinct phenomena: on the one hand, PcTx1 <italic>increases</italic> the current response due to the left-shift of the activation curve, but on the other hand, it also <italic>inhibits</italic> the pH 7.0-induced current via the left-shift of the SSD curve. In Figure 1B, D, the activation at pH 7.0 is more pronounced, since PcTx1 was administered at pH 7.9, thus leading to a smaller contribution of SSD (in Figure 2B, middle panel, we show that application of PcTx1 at pH 8.0 to K105C* leads to subsequent activation by pH 7.4).Once the channel is in the ECD<sub>only</sub> state, repeated pH 7.0 stimulation leads to decreasing currents. Surprisingly, temporary exposure to pH 8.4, followed by a subsequent pH 7.0 stimulus leads to about 50% activation. This indicates that (a) PcTx1 can still impact activation, even if the inhibitory effect is lost and (b) that the transition from the ‘Loose’ to the 'Global’ state is possible despite the absence of PcTx1 in the extracellular solution. We have added the experiment to Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and described it on pages 6 and 15. We have also further elaborated around the fact that there might be additional PcTx1 binding modes. We have highlighted that effects such as the potentiation exerted by PcTx1 add further complexity to the overall picture of the ASIC-PcTx1 interaction and will require additional exploration in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The model in Figure 2D is very helpful in getting crosss the authors message but does imply PcTx1 is still bound in the ECDo state. I think this has problematic implications (see below). However, it can rather easily be tested by simply adding PcTx1 a second time. Using the protocol in Figure 1E/G (left), after PcTx1 incubation, pH 5.5 is applied and the current is much inhibited. pH 7.4 is applied and the fluorescence remains very different from baseline as the channels, presumably, enter the ECDo state. The model (Figure 2D) indicates PcTx1 is still bound in this state (but possibly to some distinct sub-site or altered pose?). If true, then applying PcTx1 again should do nothing. All PcTx1 sites are occupied by toxins holding the channel in the ECDo state. No new toxins can find spots so the fluorescence should be unchanged and the channels not modulated. However, if something else is going on (if PcTx1 has unbound but left the channel in a slightly different resting state for example), then a second PcTx1 application is likely to produce inhibition just as the first did. As above, I think this makes for a much more compelling distinction between Global and ECDo than the BigDyn experiment and a more explicit test of the model.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this valuable suggestion. We have now conducted an experiment where we reapply PcTx1 to the ECD<sub>only</sub> state and included the results in Figure 2G, H. The fluorescence and the observed inhibitory effect on the subsequent pH 5.5-induced current are comparable between the two PcTx1 applications. This shows that newly applied PcTx1 can bind to the ECD<sub>only</sub> state and reintroduce inhibition. This further indicates that PcTx1-binding to the ECD<sub>only</sub> and the Global state are distinct, as indicated by the schematic in 2D – but this does not necessarily exclude PcTx1 unbinding (see also next comment). We are now considering these possibilities in more detail in the Discussion section on page 15.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why don’t ASICs bound by PcTx1 always go into the ECDo state? If ASIC-PcTx1 complexes enter a novel long-lived non-modulated state where the toxin remains bound even well after removal from the bathing solution, then these complexes should also enter this same state when PcTX is still in the bathing solution. Fully toxin-bound channels should behave the same regardless of how much unbound toxin is floating around. From Results 4<sup>th</sup> para, all that is required for ECDo occupancy is PcTx1 plus “conditions that temporarily activate and/or desensitize the channel”. Thus unless I am much mistaken, the proposed ECDo state should form during typical SSD or pH response curves in the continual presence of PcTx1. You should get ECDo states in the pH response curve in Figure 1C (lower) for example. The pH 7.6 incubation followed by pH 5.5 challenge should trigger the formation of the ECDo state which should preclude modulation by PcTx1 at pH 7.4, and the current should come back. But instead you get inhibition. I think a stronger interpretation of this data is that PcTx1 unbinding enables a distinct resting state (as seen with δ F) with dampened fluorescence responses to BigDyn. The strength of ECD-pore coupling in this state, and it’s occupancy by PcTx1, needs further experimental examination of the type suggested above.</p></disp-quote><p>The ECD<sub>only</sub> state can indeed bind newly applied PcTx1, shown now more explicitly with the suggested experiment in Figure 2G. For the global inhibitory state, PcTx1 is needed in the buffer, indicating distinct binding modes. However, it is indeed possible that there is a co-existing heterogenous population of different binding modes on the cell surface. We state this now more explicitly in the discussion on page 15. The question remains whether PcTx1 is bound to the ECD<sub>only</sub> state or whether it leaves it in a distinct resting state. Three observations indicate that PcTx1 remains bound to the channel (a) The ‘memory’ of the ECD<sub>only</sub> state persists even if the channel undergoes several functional and conformational transitions (e.g. Figure 1E). It thus is unlikely that it ‘locks’ the channel in a specific state; (b) The pH 7.0 stimulus experiments from comment #2 show that enhanced activation is still possible long after PcTx1 exposure, favoring a model where PcTx1 is still bound; (c) As pointed out by reviewer 3, Dawson <italic>et al.,</italic> 2012 (PMID: 22760635) have performed SPR experiments that indicate an extremely slow wash-off of PcTx1, again suggesting the presence of PcTx1 even after prolonged washouts. We hope that the added text in the discussion on page 15 covers this point sufficiently.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A lot of the data might be explained by PcTx1 fluorescence and modulation have different stoichiometries. It could be that one bound PcTx1 induces a pretty big δ F (or even a global change in the trimer) but doesn't really provide much modulation. A second or third PcTx1 might produce smaller (or maybe even no) change in deltaF but the second and third are needed for channel modulation. Once you have a trimer saturated with PcTx1, sooner or later one PcTx1 and then a second will dissociate, leaving you with a channel that is no longer modulated, but that last residing PcTx1 keeps the fluorescence relatively high (or low for V80). This aligns nicely with their Figure 4G data. The only objection I see to this 'One PcTx1 changes Fluorescence, two change gating' model is the VCF in Figure 5. In 5C, two binding sites are disrupted. If the above model is correct, a single PcTx1 should give a high deltaF.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we agree with the reviewer's observation that the PcTx1 fluorescence and modulation have different stoichiometries; this is what we refer as the decoupled PcTx1 effect. However, it appears that we arrive at this proposition from different angles. If we understand correctly, the reviewer brings up the possibility that binding of PcTx1 might have non-linear contributions to the magnitude of the fluorescent signals.</p><p>Conversely, we base our argumentation not primarily on the size of the PcTx1-induced ΔF, but rather focus on its washout. After all, the F350L mutation in a homomeric trimer still leads to a comparable ΔF (Figure 3G), indicating binding and introduction of the ECD<sub>only</sub> state, but the washout after 3 min is very distinct compared to that of K105C*. We thus argue that increasing numbers of F350L-containing subunits affect the stability of the ECD<sub>only</sub> state (Figure 3 G,H). While at this point we cannot rule out non-linear contributions of different PcTx1 molecules to the fluorescence signal, our observation about the increasing destabilization of the ‘ECD<sub>only</sub>’ remains valid since it is not based on the comparison of the magnitude of the PcTx1-induced ΔF.</p><p>We now bring up this point in the discussion on page 16.</p><p>Regardless of the above, the question of the contribution of just one PcTx1 molecule on the conformation to a specific subunit (especially in combination with the F350L mutations) is certainly interesting, and one that we ultimately would like to tackle in the future by fluorescently labelling only a subset of subunits. These experiments are, however, non-trivial for a number of reasons (extensive concatemer designs, complex fluorescence signals, etc) and will require a substantial amount of additional experimental work that would exceed the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is it possible the pH's for this experiment in 5C are not optimal? They use 7.4 all the way through. But the SSD for the concatemers in 5C is shifted acidic by ~ 0.2 pH units. If they repeat 5C using 7.2 as the basal pH, I wager they would get a pretty big δ F from just that one PcTx1 binding. This would further support the 'One PcTx1 for the F, two for the gating' idea.</p></disp-quote><p>While the SSD for the non-labelled constructs is indeed shifted, the labelled constructs all have a pH<sub>50_SSD</sub> and pH<sub>50_fluorescence</sub> of around 7.1 (Figure 5—figure supplement 1, Supplementary File 1b) and the experiments were thus performed at a suitable pH. However, as pointed out by the reviewer (and as seen clearly in Figure 3F,G) even small changes in pH can have a dramatic effect on the PcTx1-induced ΔF. It is thus possible that part of the reason why the signal is reduced in 5C is because of small variations in pH. Importantly, we also examine the stability of the ECD<sub>only</sub> state that is not necessarily dependent on the initial signal size (e.g. Figure 3G, see comment above). So, while we acknowledge that small pH variations might account for the reduced signal, we did our best to correct for it and base our conclusions not only on signal size, but also on the inferred stability of the ECD<sub>only</sub> state.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ultimately, I think this is a very interesting and useful paper which will make a sizeable impact in the field and completely solving the mechanism of the PcTx1-induced δ F shouldn't be a requirement for publication.</p><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. The main claim in this study is that changes in the magnitude of fluorescent signals generated by fluorescent molecules attached to ASIC1a arise from a global conformational change of the ECD induced by binding of PcTx1 to the channel. Since the most important evidence relies on the interpretation of this measurement, I would like further explanation on the following points:</p><p>a) The two residues chosen for placing the fluorescent labels (V80 and K105) are entirely exposed to water (resting, open, desensitized) in all the structures of human and chicken ASIC available today. Therefore, it is expected that the environment of those sites would not change significantly. Can the authors explain the reason of choosing specifically those two residues?</p></disp-quote><p>It is correct that the chosen residues show little displacements in structures of different channel states. Yet, a large number of residues throughout the ASIC ECD have been shown to be successfully labeled for VCF experiments. This has led to new knowledge about the coordinated movements of different domains during gating by for example the Kellenberger group (PMID: 24344244, PMID: 28320963). The reason for being able to detect fluorescence changes despite the absence of large conformational changes uncovered by structural methods is likely twofold: First, the fluorophores are exquisitely sensitive to even small changes in the chemical environment and VCF can thus detect even small and/or transient changes in the orientation of even a single side chain (which may not be apparent from structural work). Second, structures are only capable of providing snapshot of low-energy conformations of the channel and it is not necessarily known if they are functionally relevant. It is therefore possible (even likely!) that the number of possible conformations of ASIC1a exceeds the number of currently known structures. We have now made it clearer in the text on page 4 that we work with Cys mutations that have already been established previously and have been used extensively by others for VCF work. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, we are also including a control experiment where we exposed WT channels to the fluorescent dye and conduct the same recording as with K105C. The small change in fluorescence observed here is likely due to perfusion altering the position of the oocyte and is in fact absent in most control recordings with WT channels (see also previous work by us (PMID: 28949138) and others (PMID: 24344244, PMID: 28320963)).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>current (upper trace in black) and fluorescence (lower trace in red) recorded from labeled oocytes expressing K105C or WT mASIC1a.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-73384-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) What is the mechanism of the small decrease in fluorescence seen after PcTx1 and pH 5.5 in Figure 1A and Figure 2A. Activation prior to the addition of PcTx1 produces a large increase in fluorescence in channels with K105C* but produces a small negative deflection when channels are activated after addition of the toxin; i.e., is the fluorescent signal produced only by desensitization but activation is silent? Is the downward deflection an artifact or reflects a physical process dismissed in the study? Please, provide an explanation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for bringing up this point that we indeed did not comment on so far. The downward deflection is typically overserved in response to a strongly activating proton concentration, e.g. pH 5.5. In most recordings with K105C, the fluorescence signal of the pH 5.5 stimulus first reaches a peak before decreasing slightly towards a plateau. The decrease to this plateau level is what can be seen as negative deflections in pH 5.5 after PcTx1 exposure. We hypothesize that the peak likely reflects a short-lived open or other transient state, while the plateau state is likely related to a desensitized state (see also Figure S1A). This hints at the PcTx1-induced ECD<sub>only</sub> state indeed being different from e.g. a SSD state. It is not uncommon to see such multi-phasic fluorescent signals in ASICS (PMID: 24344244, PMID: 28320963), but the exact nature of them is often difficult to establish. This is especially true for oocyte recordings, which lack sufficiently high temporal resolution to accurately determine the kinetics of current and fluorescence. We have now added a short statement on the topic when describing the results on page 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Figure 2A the fluorescent signal shows persistence of 'a long-lasting desensitized conformation' induced by PcTx1 but channels are functional not desensitized. Please, explain what factor(s) determines the shift from one mode the other and whether in a single cell there is heterogeneity of modes.</p></disp-quote><p>We could not find this exact formulation in the text, but we assume that the reviewer refers to the functional washout versus the washout of the fluorescence of the PcTx1-induced state. In Figure 2A, the presence of PcTx1 induces a change in fluorescence and inhibits subsequent channel activation. It thus has an effect on the ECD conformation and the pore ('Global'). Upon washout, the current amplitude recovers within the first few minutes, indicating that the functional inhibitory effect of PcTx1 is lost. Conversely, the PcTx1-induced fluorescence change decreases only slightly over the course of the 3 min washout and at the end of the washout we are thus in a mode where we still see a conformational effect on the ECD, while the inhibitory effect on the pore is lost (ECD<sub>only</sub>). This mode therefore differs from the initial 'Global' state. As depicted in Figure 2D, one of the main differences between the two modes is the presence or absence of PcTx1 in the buffer for the 'Global' and 'ECD<sub>only</sub>' state, respectively. Reintroduction of PcTx1 to the buffer can thus lead from the 'ECD<sub>only</sub>' back to the 'Global' state, as now show in the new experiments in Figure 2G, H. We have now made changes to the text to describe the modes in more detail on pages 5, 6, 14 and 15 and have added the corresponding binding modes to the VCF traces in Figures 2, and Figure 2—figure supplement</p><p>1.</p><p>As for the second part of the above comment: In a single cell we would indeed expect there to be a heterogeneity of modes, which we now also address in the discussion on page 15.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) The protocol in the first trace of Figure 2A shows multiple activations with low pH. Have the authors considered whether channel activation plays a role in regaining function while the fluorescent signal remains high. In this case the protocol will differ by waiting 3 min after PcTx1 to apply the first activation.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question. We have now included this experiment in Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B and on page 6. The functional recovery from inhibition is not dependent on activation, but rather washout time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e) The authors write in the first paragraph of results: 'During a 3 min washout out with pH 7.4 solution, the fluorescence signal displayed only a modest decrease, while exposure …' Do they mean that the toxin was washed out during that period? PcTx could remain bound to the channel for much longer than 3 min as shown by Dawson et al., (DOI: 10.1038/ncomms1917) using SPR at pH 6.3 they measured KD = 1.79x10-9 M, Kon=7.99x105 M s, and Koff=1.4x10-3 that is a tao ~12 min, suggesting that after 3 min there is almost no washout of the toxin. The presence or absence of the toxin attached to the channels needs to be verified with additional experiments. Another caveat, is that affinity of the toxin may be also be pH dependent, complicating the interpretation of changes in fluorescence attributed to pH.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a crucial point. While Dawson <italic>et al.,</italic> could measure the k<sub>on</sub> and K<sub>off</sub>, the measurements do not offer any insight on the functional effect that PcTx1 has on the channel after a washout. In our work, we can actually show that the toxin leads to long-lasting conformational changes in the ECD, while it loses the ability to functionally inhibit the pore (Figure 2A). We have thus provided additional information on the presence of different PcTx1 binding modes that differentiate between the functional inhibitory effect on the pore and the conformational effects on the ECD. To address this point explicitly, we now bring up Dawson <italic>et al.,</italic> in this context in the discussion on page 15.</p><p>What our method also shows is indeed a dependence on pH. Changes between the 'Loose' and the 'ECD<sub>only</sub>' state appear to be highly pH dependent (e.g. Figure 1E–H, 2B).

The WT and fluorescently labelled constructs have intrinsically different PcTx1 sensitivities, and we thus characterize them separately and refrain from making direct comparisons between these.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>, we show that application of 30 nM PcTx1 leads to a slow increase in the fluorescent signal that does not reach a plateau within the 80 s that we typically use when applying PcTx1 (left). Longer application leads to a plateau after around 170 s (middle), with the total fluorescence deflection being comparable to that reached by application of 300 nM PcTx1 for 80s (right). To avoid complications arising from the slow and variable kinetics of the fluorescence signal at 30 nM PcTx1, we used 300 nM PcTx1 throughout.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>current (upper trace in black) and fluorescence (lower trace in red) recorded from labeled oocytes expressing K105C mASIC1a.</title><p>The dashed line indicates the 80 s mark since the start of the PcTx1 application.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-73384-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>As for the second part of the above comment: In additional experiments, we have established that reapplication of PcTx1 does not lead to an increase of the maximally reached fluorescence level and that subsequent activations have no significant effect on the persistent fluorescence signal of the ECD<sub>only</sub> state and we hope that the data now shown in Figure 2G, H and Figure 2A sufficiently clarify this point.</p></body></sub-article></article>
