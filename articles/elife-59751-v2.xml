considered the only source of dorsal horn calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a neuropeptide critical to the transmission of pain messages. Using a tamoxifen-inducible <italic>Calca<sup>CreER</sup></italic> transgenic mouse, here we identified a distinct population of CGRP-expressing excitatory interneurons in lamina III of the spinal cord dorsal horn and trigeminal nucleus caudalis. These interneurons have spine-laden, dorsally directed, dendrites, and ventrally directed axons. As under resting conditions, CGRP interneurons are under tonic inhibitory control, neither innocuous nor noxious stimulation provoked significant Fos expression in these neurons. However, synchronous, electrical non-nociceptive Aβ primary afferent stimulation of dorsal roots depolarized the CGRP interneurons, consistent with their receipt of a VGLUT1 innervation. On the other hand, chemogenetic activation of the neurons produced a mechanical hypersensitivity in response to von Frey stimulation, whereas their caspase-mediated ablation led to mechanical hyposensitivity. Finally, after partial peripheral nerve injury, innocuous stimulation (brush) induced significant Fos expression in the CGRP interneurons. These findings suggest that CGRP interneurons become hyperexcitable and contribute either to ascending circuits originating in deep dorsal horn or to the reflex circuits in baseline conditions, but not in the setting of nerve injury.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The ability to sense pain is critical to our survival. Normally, pain is provoked by intense heat or cold temperatures, strong force or a chemical stimulus, for example, capsaicin, the pain-provoking substance in chili peppers. However, if nerve fibers in the arms or legs are damaged, pain can occur in response to touch or pressure stimuli that are normally painless. This hypersensitivity is called mechanical allodynia.</p><p>A protein called calcitonin gene-related peptide, or CGRP, has been implicated in mechanical allodynia and other chronic pain conditions, such as migraine. CGRP is found in, and released from, the neurons that receive and transmit pain messages from tissues, such as skin and muscles, to the spinal cord. However, only a few distinct groups of CGRP-expressing neurons have been identified and it is unclear if these nerve cells also contribute to mechanical allodynia.</p><p>To investigate this, Löken et al. genetically engineered mice so that all nerve cells containing CGRP produced red fluorescent light when illuminated with a laser. This included a previously unexplored group of CGRP-expressing neurons found in a part of the spinal cord that is known to receive information about non-painful stimuli. Using neuroanatomical methods, Löken et al. monitored the activity of these neurons in response to various stimuli, before and after a partial nerve injury. This partial injury was induced via a surgery that cut off a few, but not all, branches of a key leg nerve.</p><p>The experiments showed that in their normal state, the CGRP-expressing neurons hardly responded to mechanical stimulation. In fact, it was difficult to establish what they normally respond to. However, after a nerve injury, brushing the mice’s skin evoked significant activity in these cells. Moreover, when these CGRP cells were artificially stimulated, the stimulation induced hypersensitivity to mechanical stimuli, even when the mice had no nerve damage. These results suggest that this group of neurons, which are normally suppressed, can become hyperexcitable and contribute to the development of mechanical allodynia.</p><p>In summary, Löken et al. have identified a group of nerve cells in the spinal cord that process mechanical information and contribute to touch-evoked pain. Future studies will identify the nerve circuits that are targeted by CGRP released from these nerve cells. These circuits represent a new therapeutic target for managing chronic pain conditions related to nerve damage, specifically mechanical allodynia, which is the most common complaint of patients with chronic pain.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pain</kwd><kwd>touch</kwd><kwd>CGRP</kwd><kwd>interneurons</kwd><kwd>spinal cord</kwd><kwd>mechanical sensitivity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>092208/Z/10/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Löken</surname><given-names>Line S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007435</institution-id><institution>Åke Wiberg Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Löken</surname><given-names>Line S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000135</institution-id><institution>NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35NS097306</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Basbaum</surname><given-names>Allan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>A102645</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Basbaum</surname><given-names>Allan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014895</institution-id><institution>Open Philanthropy Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Basbaum</surname><given-names>Allan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Although primary sensory neuron-derived calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) contributes to the processing of pain messages, an understudied population of dorsal horn CGRP-expressing interneurons also contributes to the processing of mechanical sensitivity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is the most prominent molecular marker of the peptidergic subpopulation of primary afferent nociceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basbaum et al., 2009</xref>). When released from peripheral terminals of sensory neurons, CGRP acts on endothelial cells that line blood vessels, producing pronounced vasodilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brain et al., 1985</xref>). Recent efforts to develop novel therapeutics in the management of migraine led to the successful development of antibodies that scavenge CGRP, reducing the vasodilation that triggers migraine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ho et al., 2010</xref>). When released into the superficial dorsal horn from the central branches of sensory neurons, CGRP, along with its co-occurring neuropeptide, substance P, potentiates the glutamatergic excitation of postsynaptic neurons, contributing to injury-provoked central sensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ryu et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Woolf and Wiesenfeld-Hallin, 1986</xref>). The latter process, in turn, contributes to the ongoing pain and profound hypersensitivity characteristic of both inflammatory and neuropathic pains. Interestingly, a recent study showed that pharmacological inhibition of CGRP receptor signaling in the periphery alleviates incision-induced mechanical and heat hypersensitivity, but not neuropathic pain, suggesting that primary sensory neuron-derived CGRP differentially influences injury-induced persistent pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cowie et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Despite much earlier reports, which used colchicine to enhance somatic CGRP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kruger et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tie-Jun et al., 2001</xref>) and a more recent report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McCoy et al., 2012</xref>) of small CGRP-positive cells in the dorsal horn of a reporter mouse, the prevailing view is that dorsal horn CGRP derives exclusively from afferents. Here, we took advantage of a tamoxifen-inducible <italic>Calca<sup>CreER</sup></italic> mouse line, which when crossed with a tdTomato reporter mouse, reveals a discrete population of CGRP-expressing interneurons that are concentrated in lamina III and inner lamina II of the spinal cord dorsal horn and trigeminal nucleus caudalis. Unlike dorsal horn vertical cells, which have ventrally directed dendrites and a dorsally directed axon, the CGRP interneurons have mainly dorsally directed dendrites and ventrally directed axons. A comprehensive functional analysis showed that these interneurons are minimally responsive to a host of acute, innocuous or noxious mechanical and chemical stimuli, despite the fact that electrical stimulation of Aβ afferents readily activates the cells. On the other hand, an innocuous mechanical stimulus evoked significant Fos expression in the setting of peripheral nerve injury and chemogenetic activation of the interneurons produced clear mechanical hypersensitivity. Conversely, caspase-mediated ablation of the neurons increased mechanical thresholds. We conclude that these CGRP-expressing interneurons engage deep dorsal horn nociresponsive circuits that contribute either to ascending circuits originating in deep dorsal horn or to the reflex circuits in baseline conditions, but not in the setting of nerve injury.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To map the distribution of CGRP-expressing neurons in the dorsal horn, we first crossed the <italic>Calca<sup>CreER</sup></italic> mouse line with a <italic>ROSA26<sup>fs-tdTomato</sup></italic> (Ai14) mouse line, hereafter referred to as CGRP-tdTomato. Adult mice were administered tamoxifen twice (150 mg/kg, at postnatal days 21–23), and as reported previously, this triggered tdTomato expression in primary sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Patil et al., 2018</xref>). However, we also recorded significant labeling of neurons in the dorsal horn and trigeminal nucleus caudalis (N. Caudalis; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Importantly, because the tamoxifen is administered at 3–4 weeks of age, we conclude that the pattern of expression is reflective of that found in the adult.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Validating the <italic>Calca<sup>CreER</sup></italic> transgenic mouse.</title><p>(<bold>a–c</bold>) Example of genetically labeled CGRP neurons from dorsal root ganglion of double transgenic <italic>Calca<sup>CreER</sup></italic>/tdTomato mice generated by crossing the <italic>Calca<sup>CreER</sup></italic> mouse line with a <italic>ROSA26<sup>fs-tdTomato</sup></italic> (Ai14) mouse line (CGRP-tdTomato).

We conclude that the pattern of CGRP-expression observed in the <italic>Calca<sup>CreER</sup></italic> mouse provides a reliable marker of CGRP-expressing neurons in the adult.</p><p>Unexpectedly, we also found large numbers of small tdTomato-positive neurons in the superficial dorsal horn and nucleus caudalis (notably in lamina III) and occasionally in more superficial layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e–f</xref>: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Consistent with previous literature, we did not detect CGRP-immunoreactivity in dorsal horn neurons using well-validated antibodies. However, by in situ hybridization we confirmed that <italic>Calca</italic> mRNA is present in neurons in the same regions of the spinal cord dorsal horn and nucleus caudalis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g–h</xref>), which is consistent with the single cell PCR reports of <italic>Calca</italic> message in subpopulations of dorsal horn neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Häring et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sathyamurthy et al., 2018</xref>). We speculate that the lack of CGRP immunostaining reflects rapid transport of the peptide from the cell body to its axon, which undoubtedly underlies the requirement for colchicine to demonstrate these neurons by immunocytochemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kruger et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tie-Jun et al., 2001</xref>). We found the CGRP-positive interneurons to be particularly abundant at the most caudal levels of the nucleus caudalis, markedly decreasing rostrally as the hypoglossal nucleus appears (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>CGRP dorsal horn neurons are excitatory interneurons</title><p>We next asked whether these CGRP-expressing neurons include both projection and interneurons. First, we injected the retrograde tracer Fluorogold (1%) into several brain areas that receive projections from the spinal cord dorsal horn. Despite an extensive analysis, which included injections into the ventrobasal and nucleus submedius (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yoshida et al., 1991</xref>) of the thalamus, lateral parabrachial nucleus (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2b–c</xref> for injection site in the parabrachial nucleus), and dorsal column nuclei, which are targeted by postsynaptic dorsal column neurons located in the region of lamina IV of the dorsal horn, we found no evidence of CGRP-expressing projection neurons. This finding was confirmed with an anterograde-tracing approach in which we injected an AAV1-flex-GCaMP6s virus unilaterally into the nucleus caudalis of <italic>Calca<sup>CreER</sup></italic>/tdTomato mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2a</xref>). After 4 weeks, we examined the brainstem, thalamus, and hypothalamus for GFP-labeled fibers, but found no evidence of long-distance axonal projections deriving from the lamina III CGRP cells.</p><p>By immunolabeling the CGRP-tdTomato neurons, we next determined that these cells are excitatory and define a unique subset of interneurons. First, the CGRP-tdTomato cells co-express Lmx1b (98%; 92/94 tdTomato cells), but not Pax2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), which are excitatory and inhibitory markers, respectively. Some of the CGRP-tdTomato cells populate inner lamina II, and here approximately 16% co-expressed PKCγ (31/187 tdTomato cells), a marker of a large population of excitatory interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Malmberg et al., 1997</xref>).

This was particularly the case when an antibody to tdTomato was used to detect the dorsal horn CGRP neurons. And unfortunately, although the cell body of the intracellularly recorded cells was readily filled with biotin dextran in electrophysiological slice preparations (see below), we never successfully filled dendrites or axons. Therefore, in a separate set of experiments, we first reduced the complement of primary afferent-derived CGRP-derived by making an intrathecal injection of capsaicin, 7 days prior to perfusing the mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cavanaugh et al., 2009</xref>).

First, the majority of lamina II radial cells have dendrites that arborize ventrally and axons that, if anything, project and collateralize dorsally, occasionally targeting presumptive projection neurons in lamina I. In contrast, not only do the CGRP interneurons have dorsally-directed dendrites, but almost all of their axons project ventrally and/or ventrocaudally.

However, as brushing was effective in the nerve injury setting, we hypothesized that a central sensitization rendered the CGRP neurons hyperexcitable.

To confirm this, we performed double in situ hybridization for <italic>Calca</italic> and <italic>Grp</italic>. Although the <italic>Grp</italic> interneurons predominated in a band just dorsal to the <italic>Calca</italic> interneurons, consistent with our previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Solorzano et al., 2015</xref>), we did find several instances of co-localization of <italic>Calca</italic> mRNA and <italic>Grp</italic> mRNA. Interestingly, however, when using immunohistochemistry, we found almost no overlap of GRP and CGRP in a double transgenic GRP-GFP/CGRP-tdTomato mouse line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11a–d</xref>). This difference is likely related to the fact that neurons labeled in the reporter mouse constitute less than half of the <italic>Grp</italic> mRNA-positive population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Solorzano et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dickie et al., 2019</xref>). Despite these discordant findings, we also examined the pattern of Fos expression provoked by injection of chloroquine (CQ), a strong pruritogen, into the cheek or hindpaw. To prevent scratching-induced Fos, the CQ injections were performed in anesthetized mice. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11e–f</xref> illustrates, despite considerable chloroquine-induced Fos expression, we found only an occasional double-labeled neuron. Furthermore, the number of scratching bouts induced by a subcutaneous calf injection of 100 μg chloroquine was comparable between control and CGRP-ablated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10e</xref>). We conclude that the CGRP interneurons, despite some overlap with GRP, likely do not transmit chemical itch, a finding consistent with the effects of deleting RORα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bourane et al., 2015b</xref>). Whether the CGRP interneurons are engaged in conditions in which mechanical stimulation can trigger itch (alloknesis) remains to be determined.</p><fig id="fig11" position="float"><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>GRP, CGRP, and pruritogen-evoked Fos expression.</title><p>Double in situ hybridization for tdTomato (red) and <italic>Grp</italic> (green) illustrates considerable mRNA co-expression in neurons of the dorsal horn (<bold>a</bold>) and nucleus caudalis (<bold>b</bold>) of CGRP-tdTomato mice. In contrast, immunocytochemical localization of GRP and tdTomato in a tamoxifen-treated <italic>Calca<sup>CreER</sup></italic>/tdTomato mouse that was crossed with a GRP-GFP reporter mouse revealed only occasional double labeling (arrow in inset) in the dorsal horn (<bold>c</bold>) or nucleus caudalis (<bold>d</bold>).

Many of these interneurons correspond to the <italic>Cck</italic>-negative subset of the RORα population in lamina III of the dorsal horn and trigeminal nucleus caudalis, are excitatory and are activated by electrical stimulation of non-nociceptive, Aβ primary afferents. In contrast to the <italic>Cck</italic>-expressing subset of RORα neurons, and despite their location in the so-called, low threshold mechanoreceptive recipient zone of the dorsal horn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraira et al., 2017</xref>), the CGRP interneurons do not express Fos in response to natural Aβ-mediated, innocuous mechanical stimulation (brushing or walking on a rotarod). We hypothesize that this reflects competition with the ongoing inhibition of these neurons (see below). As for the RORα population, the CGRP interneurons do not respond to noxious chemical stimulation. Even peripheral nerve injury, without superimposed stimulation, did not activate these neurons. On the other hand, brush stimulation in the nerve injury setting did activate the CGRP interneurons. Furthermore, and consistent with a limited contribution of these neurons in the setting of nerve injury, ablation of CGRP interneurons did not influence the magnitude of mechanical allodynia that develop following peripheral nerve injury. Interestingly, however, brush stimulation in the nerve injury setting did induce Fos in the CGRP interneurons. This distinction suggests that unless these neurons are rendered hyperexcitable, as occurs after nerve injury, only synchronous afferent input or direct neuronal sensitization (e.g. by DREADD activation) is sufficient to engage the circuits in which the CGRP interneurons participate. Consistent with this conclusion, chemically provoked (chemogenetic) synchronous activation of these neurons produced a significant mechanical hypersensitivity and conversely their ablation increased mechanical thresholds. Based on the predominant ventrally directed axonal arbors of these interneurons we suggest that the dorsal horn CGRP interneurons contribute either to ascending circuits originating in deep dorsal horn or to the reflex circuits in baseline conditions, but not in the setting of nerve injury. The fact that nerve injury-induced mechanical hypersensitivity persisted after ablation of the CGRP interneurons undoubtedly reflects the major contribution of other mechanosensitive afferents and dorsal horn interneurons. Indeed, we previously reported that the MrgprD subpopulation of sensory neurons is an important driver of the nerve-injury induced mechanical sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cavanaugh et al., 2009</xref>) and these afferents target interneurons located dorsal to the predominant band of CGRP interneurons.</p><p>RNA-Seq analyses have now defined at least 15 subsets of excitatory interneurons and 15 subsets of inhibitory neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Häring et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sathyamurthy et al., 2018</xref>). Ablation, optogenetic and chemogenetic studies further characterized those classes based on functional properties. Of note, an increasing number of dorsal horn interneurons that ‘gate’ mechanical pain have been identified. These include neurochemically distinct excitatory interneuron populations: transient VGLUT3, somatostatin, RORα, calretinin, and Tac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bourane et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Peirs et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Petitjean et al., 2019</xref>) and distinct inhibitory interneuron populations: dynorphin, calretinin, parvalbumin, and enkephalin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boyle et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">François et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Petitjean et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Petitjean et al., 2015</xref>). The CGRP-expressing interneurons define yet another population of dorsal horn interneurons that contributes to spinal cord processing of mechanical inputs. Interestingly, there is a striking laminar organization of these molecularly distinct populations of interneurons. For example, the transiently expressing VGLUT3 population is located ventral to the CGRP interneurons, receives low-threshold mechanoreceptive input and their chemogenetic activation also enhances mechanical sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Peirs et al., 2015</xref>). Dorsal to the CGRP interneuron are PKCγ and calretinin excitatory interneurons that contribute to nerve injury induced mechanical allodynia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Malmberg et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Neumann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Peirs et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Petitjean et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Smith et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>To what extent these mechanically driven neuronal populations are interconnected or whether they represent parallel, independent circuits activated under different mechanical pain conditions (e.g. naive vs injury vs inflammation) remains to be determined. Here, the unique morphology of the CGRP interneurons is instructive. In contrast to many of the interneuron populations whose axons arborize longitudinally (e.g. PKCγ cells) or dorsally (e.g. calretinin cells), the CGRP interneurons have ventrally-directed axons. In some respects, the CGRP interneurons resemble the lamina II radial cells described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grudt and Perl, 2002</xref> in the mouse, many of which are nociceptive, and the lamina III interneurons demonstrated in Golgi preparations in the cat and primate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beal and Cooper, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maxwell, 1985</xref>). The fact that the CGRP interneurons show delayed firing patterns is also consistent with the properties of excitatory lamina II radial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dickie et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grudt and Perl, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Punnakkal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yasaka et al., 2010</xref>). Surprisingly, despite their dorsal dendrites, which extend into lamina II, where many nociceptive afferents terminate, we found no evidence that the CGRP interneurons are activated by acute noxious inputs (capsaicin or formalin). On the other hand, we did detect an occasional polysynaptic input following synchronous electrical stimulation of primary afferent C fibers. Most importantly, compared to the lamina II radial cells, we recorded much more extensive ventral axon trajectories of the CGRP interneurons, which suggests that these interneurons engage very different circuits in the dorsal and potentially ventral horn. In this regard, the CGRP interneurons are distinct from the calretinin interneurons that target lamina I projection neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Petitjean et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>An RNA sequencing study of dorsal horn interneurons demonstrated expression of <italic>Calca</italic>, the gene that encodes CGRP, in different clusters of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Häring et al., 2018</xref>), including several that express <italic>Rora,</italic> the gene that encodes RORα. Consistent with those results, our in situ hybridization studies found extensive co-expression of <italic>Calca</italic> and <italic>Rora</italic>. In fact, almost 55% of the CGRP interneurons co-express RORα message and there are significant similarities in their anatomical and functional properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bourane et al., 2015b</xref>). Specifically, the majority of RORα interneurons are excitatory and approximately 1/3 has a radial morphology, with ventrally arborizing axons. Furthermore, both the CGRP and RORα interneurons receive a monosynaptic Aβ afferent input and interestingly, despite the lack of response to capsaicin, some neurons in both populations receive a polysynaptic A delta and C input. Consistent with the report that deletion of the RORα population did not influence itch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bourane et al., 2015b</xref>), and despite some overlap of the CGRP and GRP subsets of interneurons, we found that pruritogens did not activate (induce Fos) in the CGRP interneurons and ablation of CGRP interneurons did not influence scratching in response to exogenous pruritogens. There are, however, some striking differences between the RORα and CGRP interneurons. For example, although a majority of the RORα interneurons co-express <italic>Cck</italic>, the CGRP interneurons rarely do. Furthermore, whereas RORα interneurons are activated by innocuous mechanical stimuli (e.g. brushing) in both naive and injured conditions, the CGRP interneurons respond to innocuous stimuli only in the setting of nerve injury.</p><p>To our knowledge, the CGRP interneurons represent the first class of excitatory interneurons in lamina III that are unresponsive to innocuous mechanical stimulation under basal conditions despite receiving a monosynaptic Aβ input. One possibility is that the CGRP interneurons are tonically inhibited under normal conditions, which is consistent with our electrophysiological recordings showing bicuculline-mediated facilitation of these interneurons. Reduction of these inhibitory inputs in the setting of injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Torsney and MacDermott, 2006</xref>) would render the neurons responsive to an innocuous stimulus (e.g. brush). In turn, the ventrally directed axons of these interneurons could drive reflex withdrawal circuits, which is consistent with increased mechanical thresholds in the CGRP-interneuron ablated mice, and/or engage ascending nociceptive pathways located in deep dorsal horn. The fact that DREADD-mediated direct activation of many CGRP interneurons lowered mechanical withdrawal thresholds is consistent with that hypothesis. In other words, we suggest that sensitization of these neurons is critical to mechanisms that underlie Aβ-mediated mechanical allodynia in the setting of nerve injury. Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lu et al., 2013</xref> provided evidence for convergence of a primary afferent-derived Aβ and a tonic glycinergic inhibitory input to PKCγ interneurons, some of which we found express CGRP. Loss of this glycinergic inhibition allowed Aβ input to access lamina I nociceptive circuits. Other studies demonstrated a comparable outcome, in this case by a presynaptic glycinergic inhibition of non-nociceptive inputs to superficial dorsal horn neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sherman and Loomis, 1996</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Imlach et al., 2016</xref> proposed that decreased glycinergic inhibition is selective for radial cells in lamina II and likely contributes to neuropathic pain. We suggest that a comparable circuit involving the CGRP radial cells could uncover low threshold inputs to ventrally located nociceptive circuits, which in recent years have been largely ignored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wercberger and Basbaum, 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Mice were housed in cages on a standard 12:12 hr light/dark cycle with food and water ad libitum.

A VGLUT1-positive terminal was classified as forming a close apposition when (1) there was no space between the terminal and the DSRed-positive neuron for terminals lying side-by-side with a cell body or dendrite or when (2) the terminal and the DSRed-positive neuron were in the same focal plane for terminals overlying cell bodies or dendrites.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Cell counts</title><p>To analyze overlap by immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridization, we counted cells from four to five sections in at least three animals per experiment. By immunohistochemistry, we first counted the number of neurons in the DRG and TG that were tdTomato-positive (total 1266 cells, three mice) or CGRP-positive (total 1050 cells, three mice) and then determined the percentage of tdTomato-positive neurons that were CGRP double-labeled and vice versa. The number of dorsal horn tdTomato-positive cells that double-labeled for different markers (e.g. PKCγ, Lmx1b, Fos, calretinin, calbindin) are indicated in the Results. To conclude that cells were double-labeled by in situ hybridization we set a threshold of at least five fluorescent ‘dots’ for each probe in conjunction with a DAPI-positive nucleus. Quantification of caspase-mediated ablation of CGRP-positive spinal cord neurons was performed in 5 Caspase-injected CGRP-tdTomato mice and four saline-injected, CGRP-tdTomato control mice. We counted neurons positive for tdTomato or PKCγ ipsilateral and contralateral to the injection side, in 5–10 sections per mouse, and then determined the percentage of tdTomato- or PKCγ-positive neurons in the ipsilateral side relative to the contralateral side.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Viral vectors</title><p>For DREADD experiments we used a Cre and FlpO-dependent hM3D(Gq) adeno-associated virus: AAV1<monospace>--hEF1alpha/hTLV1-Fon/Con[dFRT-HA_hM3D(Gq)-dlox-hM3D(Gq)-I-dlox-I-HA_hM3D(Gq)(rev)-dFRT]-WPRE-hGHp</monospace> custom made by the University of Zurich Viral Vector Facility of the Neuroscience Center. For control injections, we used an AAV1.hSyn.eGFP.WPRE.SV40 from Addgene. For GCaMP-tracing experiments, we used an AV1.Syn.Flex.GCaMP6s.WPRE.SV40 from the Penn Vector Core, University of Pennsylvania. Note that we evaluated several Cre-dependent viral vectors for the tracing studies and only used those where specificity of expression was confirmed by lack of expression after injection into wild type mice. We waited at least 4 weeks to achieve stable viral expression before beginning the behavioral or neuroanatomical experiments. For Caspase-mediated ablation experiments, we used a Cre-dependent adeno-associated virus-expressing Caspase (AAV1‐flex‐taCasp3‐TEVp, titer: 1.5–2.8 × 10<sup>12</sup> viral particles/ml; Gene Therapy Vector Core at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Retrograde tracing</title><p>To study potential projection targets of the dorsal horn CGRP interneurons, we injected Fluorogold (1%) into several supraspinal sites known to receive projections from the spinal and medullary dorsal horns. We studied two mice for each location and allowed 5–9 days for tracer transport after which the mice were perfused with formaldehyde for subsequent histological analysis. We injected tracer into the following locations: ventrolateral thalamus (X:ML = 1.5, Y:AP = −1.82, Z:DV = 3.5; 500 or 800 nl); parabrachial nucleus (X = 1.25, Y = −4.95, Z = −3.6; 600 nl, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>); nucleus submedius of the thalamus (X = 0.5, Y = −1.43, Z = 4.25; 250 or 450 nl): dorsal column nuclei (400 nl).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>AAV injections</title><p>For all surgeries, the mice were administered carprofen (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) just prior to surgery and lidocaine (0.5%) was applied to the incision site. For the DREADD experiments, under 2% isoflurane anesthesia, we injected P14-16 <italic>Calca<sup>CreER</sup></italic>-Lbx<sup>FLPo</sup> mice and littermates with an AAV-GFP. We removed muscles that overlay the left side of the T13 and L1 vertebra to expose the lumbar enlargement. Without laminectomy, we then slowly inserted a glass micropipette (50 µm tip) through the dura and made two 400 nl rostrocaudally separated injections of viral solution. The micropipette was left in place for ~2 min after which overlying muscle and skin were closed. After recovering from the anesthesia, the mice were returned to their home cages.</p><p>For the GCaMP6-tracing studies, we made injections (300–800 nl) into the medullary dorsal horn in 8-week-old mice anesthetized with i.p. ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) or isofluorane (2%). For injections into the nucleus caudalis, we incised the dura overlying the cisterna magna, exposing the caudal medulla and made a unilateral injection of viral solution with a glass micropipette. After recovering from anesthesia, the mice were returned to their home cage. For Caspase-mediated ablation studies, each mouse received a total of 2.0 μl of viral stock solution of the AAV1‐flex‐taCasp3‐TEVp (ablated group) into the lumbar spinal cord. To measure post‐virus mechanical and thermal thresholds, we tested the mice 3 weeks after virus injection, before and 7 and 14 days after spared nerve injury. At the end of all behavioral testing, control and ablated mice were euthanized, perfused and tissues harvested for quantification of the caspase-mediated ablation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Behavioral analyses</title><p>We took several measures to blind the behavioral experiments. (1) DREADD-injected and control (GFP-injected) mice were housed together. (2) A different experimenter performed the injections of CNO (5.0 mg/kg in saline) or saline before behavioral testing. (3) The behavioral tester recorded each mouse’s eartag number after the test and was blind to the treatment (saline or CNO) that the mouse received or to which group the mouse belonged (AAV-GFP-injected or DREADD-injected). (4) Identification was made using records of eartag numbers after all testing was finalized.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Static mechanical allodynia</title><p>For these experiments, we determined hindpaw mechanical thresholds with von Frey filaments, and quantified results using the updown method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chaplan et al., 1994</xref>). The animals were habituated on a wire mesh for 2 hr on 2 consecutive days. On the next 2 days we recorded baseline thresholds, after a 1.5 hr of acclimatization on the wire mesh. After baseline determinations, the mice were injected with CNO or saline and then tested 30 min later. For all behavioral tests, either CNO or saline was injected every other day in a randomized fashion.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Acetone test (cold allodynia)</title><p>Mice were habituated for 30 min on a mesh in plexiglass cylinders. Next, we used a syringe to squirt 50 µl acetone onto the plantar surface of the paw. The responses of the mice directly after application of acetone were recorded on video for 30 s. Each paw was tested five times and we measured time (in seconds) spent lifting, licking or flinching the paw. Results are displayed as the average time across the five trials. Testing began 1 hr post injection of CNO or saline, with test days 48 hr apart.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Hargreaves test</title><p>For thermal threshold testing (heat), we first acclimatized the mice for 30 min in Plexiglass cylinders. The mice were then placed on the glass of a Hargreaves apparatus and the latency to withdraw the paw from the heat source was recorded. Each paw was tested five times and we averaged latencies over the five trials. Hargreaves tests were done 1 hr after the tests of static dynamic mechanical allodynia.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Pruritoception</title><p>We made a subcutaneous injection of 100 μl chloroquine (100 μg diluted in saline; Sigma‐Aldrich) into the left calf. Mice were immediately placed into cylinders and video recorded for 30 min. Behavior was scored as number of scratching/biting bouts of the injection area over the 30 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Rotarod test</title><p>Mice were acclimatized to the testing room and trained by placing them on an accelerating rotarod for a maximum of 60 s at low speed, three times with training taking place on two consecutive days. On testing days (48 hr apart), mice were injected with CNO or saline 30 min before being placed on the rotarod. Latency to fall was measured for up to 300 s. The procedure was repeated three times and latencies averaged across trials.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Spared nerve injury (SNI)</title><p>To induce mechanical hypersensitivity in a model of neuropathic pain we used the approach described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shields et al., 2003</xref>. Under isofluorane anesthesia (2%), two of the three branches of the sciatic nerve were ligated and transected distally, sparing the tibial nerve.</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>Fos expression: capsaicin and formalin</title><p>To study the effects of a chemical algogen, we injected 10 µl of 2% formalin in saline into the cheek (n = 3). In a separate group of anesthetized animals (n = 3), we made a unilateral injection of 20 µl capsaicin (1.0 µg/µl) into the hindpaw or the cheek. We perfused all mice ~ 1.5 hr after injection and immunostained sections of the lumbar cord (paw injections) or caudal medulla (cheek injections) for Fos.</p></sec><sec id="s4-23"><title>Fos expression: chloroquine</title><p>To study the effects of a pruritogen, under isofluorane anesthesia, mice (n = 3) received unilateral injections of chloroquine (200 µg) into either the hindpaw (20 μl) or cheek (50 μl).

Based on this time course, the mice were perfused 2 hr after nitroglycerin injection and sections of caudal medulla were immunostained for Fos.</p></sec><sec id="s4-25"><title>Fos expression: dynamic mechanical allodynia</title><p>To assess Fos expression in uninjured animals (n = 3), we first acclimatized the mice to brushing of the cheek, (Utrecht 225, pure red sable brush 6, Germany) while lightly restraining the mouse in a towel with its head exposed. We brushed the left cheek along the direction of the hairs for 45 min, with a one minute break every 10 min. To monitor Fos expression in the injured animals, we performed unilateral partial sciatic nerve injury (SNI, see above). One week after SNI, we used a paintbrush (5/0, Princeton Art and Brush Co.) to lightly stroke the injured hind paw, from heel to toe (velocity:~2 cm/s). Ninety minutes to 2 hr after brushing, the mice were anesthetized, perfused and spinal cord sections were immunostained for Fos. In a separate experiment, we also assessed Fos expression 1 week after SNI without applying a stimulus.</p></sec><sec id="s4-26"><title>Fos expression: rotarod test</title><p>Three mice were trained on a rotating rod for 60 min at a constant speed of 10 rpm. One week later the mice walked on the rotarod at 10 rpm for 1.5 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Neumann et al., 2008</xref>), after which they were anesthetized, perfused and lumbar spinal cord sections immunostained for Fos.</p></sec><sec id="s4-27"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Following our previous protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Etlin et al., 2016</xref>), we collected transverse lumbar and caudal medullary Vibratome (Leica) slices (350–400 μm) from 3 to 10 weeks old CGRP-tdTomato mice 5–7 days after tamoxifen injection. The sections were incubated in recording solution at 37°C for 1 hr and then transferred to a recording chamber (Automate Scientific) under an upright fluorescence microscope (E600FN; Nikon). The sections were superfused with recording solution at a rate of 1.0 ml/min and viewed with a CCD digital camera (Hamamatsu or DAGE-MTI). The transparent appearance of lamina II of the superficial dorsal horn and tdTomato-positive CGRP cells were obvious under near-infrared (IR) illumination. The patch pipettes were pulled to yield an impedance of 6–8 MΩ on a horizontal pipette puller (Sutter Instrument) from thin-walled, fire-polished, borosilicate glass filaments. The pipette solution composition was (in mM): K-methane sulfonate 140, NaCl 10, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 1.0, EGTA 1.0, HEPES 10, Mg-ATP 5.0, and NaGTP 0.5 and included 5.0 mg/ml of Biocytin (Sigma-Aldrich) for intracellular filling of the recorded cells. Neurons were approached with a micromanipulator (Sutter Instrument) while monitoring the resistance in voltage-clamp mode using the ‘Membrane Test’ module of pClamp10 software (Molecular Devices). To prevent clogging of the tip, we applied positive pressure to the pipette via a 1.0 ml syringe. After a seal was established with a cell, we ruptured its membrane by gently applying negative pressure to the pipette to secure a whole-cell configuration. Current and voltage signals were amplified using a DC amplifier (MultiClamp 700) and digitized using Digidata 1440a system (Molecular Devices) at 10 kHz and then stored for subsequent offline analysis.</p><p>In some experiments, we placed an attached dorsal root in a suction electrode to be stimulated electrically while simultaneously measuring evoked responses of the tdTomato-expressing neurons. To determine the fiber types providing input to the recorded neurons, and to assess the monosynaptic/polysynaptic nature of the Aβ, Aδ, and C fiber inputs, the dorsal roots were stimulated 20 times at the following frequencies and intensities (25 μA, 20 Hz for Aβ fibers; 100 μA, 2 Hz and occasionally 10 Hz for Aδ fibers; 500 μA, 1 Hz for C fibers).</p><p>For current clamp recordings, after whole cell configuration was achieved, action potentials were induced by current steps, from −10 to 150 pA, with an increment of 5.0 or 10 pA (pulse duration 300 ms). The rheobase was determined using a 5.0 pA increment current step (pulse duration 300 ms). Only neurons with a resting membrane potential of at least −40 mV and stable baseline were used for further experiments and analysis. The recording was abandoned with loss of spike overshoot. To determine the effect of the inhibitory inputs on excitability of the CGRP interneurons, slices were continuously perfused with 20 µM bicuculline and 4.0 µM strychnine and the rheobase measured before and after application of the GABA and glycine antagonists. After establishing a stable baseline recording, we maintained the neurons 10 pA below rheobase (pulse duration 300 ms, sweep intervals of 30 s), a current at which action potentials were never evoked. Next the bicuculline/strychnine solution was applied to the recording chamber. The appearance of an action potential signaled that the antagonists had removed a tonic inhibition of the CGRP interneurons.</p></sec><sec id="s4-28"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (IBM-SPSS version 24). Similarity of normality and variance were assessed before applying parametric or non-parametric tests. For analysis of the effect of CNO on mechanical hypersensitivity, we assessed interaction between treatment (CNO, saline or baseline) with group (DREADD-virus injected animals or GFP-virus injected animals) by repeated measures two-way ANOVA, including all conditions and groups. Statistics were calculated based on a type III sum of squares model and significant interaction effects were assessed using deviation from the mean of the control groups. The N was estimated based on variance for von Frey experiments using an a priori power calculation. Hargreaves and rotarod results were analyzed using Student’s t-tests. For acetone sensitivity we used the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Parametric and non-parametric tests are reported as mean ± SEM or by medians and inter-quartiles, respectively. Electrophysiological recordings of intrinsic membrane and action potential properties were calculated using custom-written Matlab scripts (MathWorks, Illinois) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Etlin et al., 2016</xref>). p Values were considered significant if p&lt;0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was supported by a Sir Henry Wellcome Fellowship 092208/Z/10/Z (LSL), Åke Wiberg Foundation (LSL), NIH: R35NS097306 (AIB), Wellcome Award: A102645 (AIB) and Open Philanthropy (AIB).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Löken et al. describes a novel type of interneurons expressing calcitonin gene releasing peptide (CGRP) in the spinal dorsal horn. The study characterizes a new group of dorsal horn neurons that may mediate nerve injury-induced mechanical hypersensitivity. These findings hold promise in understanding spinal mechanisms of pain and allodynia. The utilizes a number of state-of-the-art methodologies, including viral tracing, electrophysiology and chemogenetics.</p><p>The reviewers have reached agreement that the study has potential for <italic>eLife</italic>, but is premature in its current form. Given the restrictions imposed by the Covid crisis, the reviewers understand that performing major revisions may not be feasible and have therefore endeavored to find a minimal common basis for new experiments that would allay most of the major concerns.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The following changes are required:</p><p>1. There is consensus that silencing, rather than activating this subtype of CGRP cells, would strongly help understanding the role of these CGRP spinal neurons. This will require new experiments, but it seems essential to support the main conclusions of this study. This experiment would also help address other concerns the reviewers had.</p><p>2. There were multiple concerns regarding the electrophysiology experiments and c-Fos analyses shown in the manuscript. The reviewers have reached an agreement that most of these could be addressed by performing additional slice recordings intracellular recordings in current clamp mode to determine if the Aβ inputs to CGRP neurons are gated via feed forward inhibition and fail to produce action potential firing. These would also show subthreshold activity engaged by low threshold electric stimulation in physiological conditions, but not after injury and help explain the lack of c-Fos induction by sustained or repeated low threshold mechanical stimuli under naive conditions.</p><p>3.

There is consensus that silencing, rather than activating this subtype of CGRP cells, would strongly help understanding the role of these CGRP spinal neurons. This will require new experiments, but it seems essential to support the main conclusions of this study. This experiment would also help address other concerns the reviewers had.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers and now provide results of an extensive set of behavioral and anatomical experiments performed in animals in which we used a caspase-mediated approach to selectively ablate the CGRP interneurons from the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Consistent with what we hypothesized in the original manuscript, ablation of the CGRP interneurons selectively affected baseline mechanical responses to von Frey filaments. Responses to noxious thermal (heat and acetone) and pruritic stimuli did not differ. These findings corroborate our previous conclusion that the CGRP-expressing interneurons constitute a separate class of excitatory interneurons that are mechanically driven and contribute to the reflex circuits in the normal mouse.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. There were multiple concerns regarding the electrophysiology experiments and c-Fos analyses shown in the manuscript. The reviewers have reached an agreement that most of these could be addressed by performing additional slice recordings intracellular recordings in current clamp mode to determine if the Aβ inputs to CGRP neurons are gated via feed forward inhibition and fail to produce action potential firing. These would also show subthreshold activity engaged by low threshold electric stimulation in physiological conditions, but not after injury and help explain the lack of c-Fos induction by sustained or repeated low threshold mechanical stimuli under naive conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the importance of determining whether there is a tonic inhibitory regulation of the CGRP interneurons. To this end, we have significantly increased the number of neurons from which recordings were made, and most importantly, evaluated the effects of blocking any baseline inhibitory controls by incubating the slice with antagonists of GABAergic and glycinergic receptors. We found that under normal conditions, the CGRP interneurons receive a tonic inhibitory input. This was demonstrated in current clamp mode, in which we document that there is both a significant reduction in rheobase as well as an increase in resting membrane potential in the presence of the antagonists.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

An N of 3 mice for controls in behavioral experiments is not adequate.</p></disp-quote><p>As described in the Methods section, we performed in situ hybridization according to ACD’s protocol using RNAscope probes that are designed to ensure specificity and sensitivity. The specificity is achieved by the double Z probe strategy that requires a probe pair (ZZ) to simultaneously bind to the target in order to generate signal. Non-specific binding of single Z probes will not yield detectable signals. Since all RNAscope probes are designed by applying the same screening criteria and the assays are run under the same stringent conditions (hybridization and washing), a similar level of high specificity is expected for all probes. In addition, during the assay, to assess any nonspecific background in a particular run/sample, a negative control probe (bacterial gene dapB) was run in parallel with the same sample and yielded no signal. ACD’s website is an excellent source for more detailed information relating to probe design, selectivity and sensitivity: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://acdbio.com/science/how-it-works">https://acdbio.com/science/how-it-works</ext-link>.</p><p>Concerning sample size: as noted above we have significantly increased the number of CGRP positive interneurons from which recordings were made. In addition, with respect to the number of mice in behavioral experiments, please note that there were equal numbers of male and female mice (3 each). Thus, controls, in fact, contained 6 mice. And in the caspase studies included in the revision, sample sizes were 8 ablated and 6 controls.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

In fact, the Results section and Figure 6 - source data 1 show that all 5 of the 5 neurons tested responded to Aβ inputs. In contrast, only 2 of these neurons could be activated by intensities that we presume engaged C fibers. We have modified the text to make these findings clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

Although we were successful in detecting strong CGRP mRNA expression using <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization and strong Tdtomato expression in the CGRP-Cre-Tdtomato reporter mouse (in which the reporter gene is under the influence of the Calca gene promoter), to date our attempts to detect the CGRP peptide by immunohistochemistry have failed. However, as we wrote in the submitted manuscript the Hökfelt group did detect CGRP immunoreactivity in some dorsal horn spinal cord neurons (Tie-Jun et al., 2001). Their studies required colchicine treatment. As we wrote in the Results section: “the lack of CGRP immunostaining reflects rapid transport of the peptide from the cell body to its axon, which undoubtedly underlies the requirement for colchicine to demonstrate these neurons by immunocytochemistry”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
