Through unbiased genetic screening in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we discovered a novel short-sleep mutant we named <italic>argus</italic>. Positional cloning and subsequent complementation, CRISPR/Cas9 knock-out, and RNAi studies identified Argus as a transmembrane protein that acts in adult peptidergic neurons to regulate sleep. <italic>argus</italic> mutants accumulate undigested Atg8a(+) autophagosomes, and genetic manipulations impeding autophagosome formation suppress <italic>argus</italic> sleep phenotypes, indicating that autophagosome accumulation drives <italic>argus</italic> short-sleep. Conversely, a <italic>blue cheese</italic> neurodegenerative mutant that impairs autophagosome formation was identified independently as a gain-of-sleep mutant, and targeted RNAi screens identified additional genes involved in autophagosome formation whose knockdown increases sleep. Finally, autophagosomes normally accumulate during the daytime and nighttime sleep deprivation extends this accumulation into the following morning, while daytime gaboxadol feeding promotes sleep and reduces autophagosome accumulation at nightfall. In sum, our results paradoxically demonstrate that wakefulness increases and sleep decreases autophagosome levels under unperturbed conditions, yet strong and sustained upregulation of autophagosomes decreases sleep, whereas strong and sustained downregulation of autophagosomes increases sleep. The complex relationship between sleep and autophagy suggested by our findings may have implications for pathological states including chronic sleep disorders and neurodegeneration, as well as for integration of sleep need with other homeostats, such as under conditions of starvation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sleep</kwd><kwd>autophagy</kwd><kwd>genetics</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd>argus</kwd><kwd>blue cheese</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sehgal</surname><given-names>Amita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32AG056081-03</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bedont</surname><given-names>Joseph L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99NS118561-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bedont</surname><given-names>Joseph L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Unbiased and targeted genetic approaches reveal a link between sleep and autophagy that could be relevant for sleep function, and for understanding pathological consequences of chronic sleep loss.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sleep is a widespread behavior across animals with nervous systems and occupies a significant proportion of human life. The importance of sleep is evident in the consequences of its disruption, which range from impaired cognitive performance to serious health problems, and even death in some animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mignot, 2008</xref>). However, we still have limited understanding of the mechanisms that regulate sleep or the physiological functions served by it.</p><p>The fruit fly has been essential to identifying molecular mechanisms regulating sleep. Forward genetic screens in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> revealed several molecular sleep regulators and effectors later implicated in mammalian sleep. The first was the voltage-gated potassium channel Shaker; its mammalian homolog (Kcna2) was later shown to have corresponding effects in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cirelli et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Douglas et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, we previously identified <italic>redeye,</italic> a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAchR) alpha subunit gene required for sleep maintenance, although cholinergic signaling is typically thought of as wake-promoting, sleep-promoting cholinergic neurons that act through a related nicotinic receptor subunit were subsequently identified in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ni et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shi et al., 2014</xref>). The power of invertebrate behavioral screening is perhaps best demonstrated by a <italic>tour de force</italic> sleep mutant screen recently conducted in mice; homologs of the two sleep-regulating genes identified, Nalcn sodium leak channel and Sik3 kinase, were previously linked to sleep in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans,</italic> respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Flourakis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Funato et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van der Linden et al., 2008</xref>). Sleep genes originally identified in flies are increasingly also implicated in human sleep. Both voltage-gated potassium channels and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors were top hits in a genome-wide association study for polymorphisms associated with human sleep duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allebrandt et al., 2013</xref>). And autoantibodies to voltage-gated potassium channels have been found in people with Morvan’s syndrome, a neurological disorder associated with insomnia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barber et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>The fruit fly has already also proven valuable for interrogating functions of sleep. Proposed functions for sleep across organisms include memory consolidation, both synaptic and metabolic homeostasis, and waste clearance from the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mignot, 2008</xref>). Sleep promotes memory consolidation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dag et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Donlea et al., 2011</xref>), which is also reflected in the deep intertwinement of sleep and memory circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Haynes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Joiner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pitman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sakai et al., 2012</xref>). Meanwhile clearance effects implicated in mammals are inferred from sleep regulation of endocytosis across the <italic>Drosophila</italic> blood-brain barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Artiushin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mestre et al., 2020</xref>). Crucially, whether the varying functions of sleep represent independent outputs of a sleeping brain, or are linked in some manner, is unknown.</p><p>A large proportion of waste clearance in cells is mediated by macroautophagy (hereafter, autophagy), which recycles bulk material including protein aggregates and damaged organelles. Different types of autophagy can be induced by stimuli including accumulation of ubiquitinated protein, unfolded protein response, pro-apoptotic signaling, and metabolic stressors including amino acid starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hale et al., 2013</xref>). Factors involved vary by stimulus, but they converge on a core network of essential proteins that mediate nucleation, expansion, and maturation of an Atg8(+) autophagosome; loading of cargo; and ultimately lysosomal fusion, forming an autolysosome whose acidification and protease activity degrades the cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hale et al., 2013</xref>). Successful autophagy both remediates toxicity of its cargo and liberates metabolites for reuse by the cell. Autophagy crosstalk with other clearance mechanisms suggest it as a potentially important transducer or effector of sleep. Yet to our knowledge, no direct link between sleep and autophagy has been established.</p><p>Here, we report a novel short-sleeping mutant, <italic>argus</italic> (<italic>aus</italic>), derived from a screen of chemically mutagenized flies. The gene responsible for the mutant phenotype encodes an integral membrane protein whose loss in neurons, including in peptidergic subpopulations, reduces sleep by increasing accumulation of undigested autophagosomes. Genetic manipulations that block autophagy upstream of Atg8 recruitment to autophagosomes suppress the <italic>aus</italic> reduced sleep phenotype. Further, in the cases of an independently identified sleep mutant, <italic>blue cheese-58,</italic> and RNAis for several autophagy genes, prominently including <italic>atg1</italic> and <italic>atg8a/b</italic>, blockade of autophagosome production increases baseline sleep. Finally, we show that autophagosomes accumulate during the day, in a manner that can be acutely extended by sleep deprivation or curtailed by enforced sleep. Together, our data suggest that sleep regulates autophagy in a daily sleep:wake cycle, and sustained and/or strong changes in autophagosome level affects sleep amount. This model suggests that autophagy is a promising candidate for coupling sleep to its known functions in the healthy and neurodegenerative brain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>argus</italic> mutants have reduced sleep</title><p>As reported previously, we mutagenized newly isogenized <italic>iso31</italic> flies with ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS), generated independent lines, and screened F3 generation flies under 12:12 light:dark cycles for sleep phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shi et al., 2014</xref>).

A link between sleep and autophagy is further supported by our finding of additional sleep phenotypes upon downregulation of components of autophagic pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>).</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> is a powerful model for the use of unbiased approaches to identify the molecular basis of a physiological process of interest. Indeed, the molecular basis of the circadian clock was determined largely through forward genetic screens of the type used to isolate <italic>aus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dubowy and Sehgal, 2017</xref>). We and others have employed a similar forward genetics toolkit to discover sleep-regulating genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dubowy and Sehgal, 2017</xref>). These genes have provided insight into mechanisms that control daily sleep amount, but to date, they have not suggested functions of sleep. For the most part, the genes identified encode neuromodulators or regulators of neural excitability, which are likely required to modulate brain activity in response to homeostatic sleep need (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cirelli et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shi et al., 2014</xref>). The generation of sleep need is presumably linked to sleep function, but the nature of this remains elusive. The <italic>aus</italic> sleep mutant is unique, in that the mechanisms underlying its loss of sleep are likely relevant for sleep function (discussed below).</p><p>Our finding that <italic>aus</italic> regulates autophagy is consistent with its expression pattern spatially, temporally, and even intracellularly. <italic>aus</italic> is temporally elevated during the embryo cellularization and late larval / early pupal stages of fruit fly development, times of enhanced developmental autophagy. Indeed, high autophagy during the latter stage provided the first observation of the pathway in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kuhn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thurmond et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gaudecker, 1963</xref>). <italic>aus</italic> expression is also spatially enriched in tissues with high levels of developmental and adult autophagy, including brain, gut, and fat body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thurmond et al., 2019</xref>). Finally, this hypothesis is consistent with our bioinformatic predictions, as the cell membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus cellular compartments are all proposed donors of autophagosome membranes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nishimura and Tooze, 2020</xref>). We propose that Aus is required for transition of autophagosomes to autolysosomes, and so in its absence, autophagosomes accumulate.</p><p>To better understand the effect of autophagy disruptions on sleep, we exploited the vast existing mutant and RNAi resources available in <italic>Drosophila</italic> to conduct directed screening. This demonstrated sleep gain in multiple scenarios that impede the production of autophagosomes, including homozygotes for <italic>bchs58</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), a loss-of-function mutant known to impair autophagosome maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sim et al., 2019</xref>), and RNAi knockdown of a number of genes involved in autophagy initiation, autophagosome nucleation, and autophagosome maturation, in particular <italic>atg1</italic> and <italic>atg8a/b</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Using a subset of these tools that were too weak to drive sleep gain in wild-type flies, we find complete suppression of <italic>aus/+</italic> sleep loss by <italic>bchs/+</italic>, and rescue of <italic>aus/+</italic> and <italic>aus/aus</italic> sleep loss by pan-neuronal RNAi for either <italic>atg5</italic> or <italic>atg7</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–D</xref>). While the individual genes each have roles in additional pathways, the simplest explanation of consistent <italic>aus</italic> sleep rescue by three distinct autophagy gene loss-of-functions is that the observed autophagosome accumulation in <italic>aus</italic> mutants is a contributor to their short-sleeping phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Together, our findings of abnormal sleep in both the <italic>aus</italic> and <italic>bchs</italic> autophagy mutants, as well as knockdown effects of functionally related clusters of canonical autophagy genes, demonstrate that strongly and sustainably disrupting autophagy in adulthood perturbs sleep, such that high autophagosome levels decrease sleep, while low autophagosome levels increase sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B–D</xref>).</p><p>We then set out to determine whether this relationship reflects changes normally seen over the sleep-wake cycle. We found that Atg8a(+) autophagosomes accumulate during the waking hours and decrease during sleep, with autophagosome levels at daybreak increased by SD the preceding night, and autophagosome levels at nightfall decreased by gaboxadol-induced sleep the prior day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This demonstrated that at least one of two possibilities must be true in the absence of perturbations of autophagy: (i) sleep increases clearance of autophagosomes, and/or (ii) sleep decreases production of autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Given the lack of effect on autophagosome/autolysosome ratio in our daybreak/nightfall, SD, and gaboxadol experiments, our data are most consistent with sleep reducing autophagosome production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). An attractive etiological explanation for this observation is elevated metabolic activity during wake generating waste that could enhance the production of autophagosomes, leading to autophagosome accumulation that is then run down over extended sleep. That said, we cannot fully rule out autophagosome clearance changes that occur as a gradual or late-onset feature of sleep. Sleep enhancement of the degradation of debris and damaged cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Singh and Donlea, 2020</xref>) and the flushing of degraded wastes from the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Artiushin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xie et al., 2013</xref>) seem to hint at a role for sleep in autophagosome clearance, and we believe that this possibility deserves further study. Finally, our findings in wild-type brains likely generalize to mammals, as various endosome-autophagosome-lysosome axis puncta accumulate in mice under chronic sleep fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xie et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Regardless of whether autophagosome production, clearance, or both are affected during the normal sleep-wake cycle, our imaging data clearly show that waking increases and sleeping decreases autophagosome number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This is surprising given our mutant and RNAi data demonstrating that autophagosome level inhibits sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). The most parsimonious synthesis of these results is a model in which sleep inhibits autophagosome formation on a 24 hr timescale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>), while strong and/or sustained upregulation or downregulation of autophagosome levels is required to meaningfully modify sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B–D</xref>). At present, it is unclear whether the small, transient fluctuations we observed in autophagosome number during a typical single day:night cycle are able to feed back on sleep regulation, or whether sleep unidirectionally regulates autophagy when their relationship is not perturbed by other factors.</p><p>This relationship between sleep and autophagy nonetheless has interesting implications for pathology. For instance, maladaptive autophagy flux provides a potential mechanism that could reinforce sleep loss in chronic sleep loss disorders. While a single night of SD causes only a modest elevation of neuronal autophagosome number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E–H</xref>), over many daily cycles chronic sleep loss could establish a deleterious positive feedback loop, with cumulative accumulation of autophagosomes becoming a strong enough wake-promoting cue to further suppress sleep.</p><p>This could also represent a mechanism coupling sleep loss disorders to increased incidence of neurodegeneration, and a driver of progressively worsening sleep disturbance noted over the course of many neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Winer and Mander, 2018</xref>). Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease are characterized by aggregating pathological proteins that strongly inhibit the autolysosomal clearance of autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ling et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nixon et al., 2005</xref>). Chronically elevated autophagosome levels in this context may disrupt sleep much like <italic>aus</italic>, and chronic sleep loss may in turn exacerbate autophagosome accumulation and further depress sleep, again forming a deleterious feedback loop that in this case begins with extended perturbation of autophagy rather than sleep.</p><p>This then begs the etiological question of why the sleep system would evolve such a potentially disastrous feedback loop with the autophagy pathway, one of its regulated outputs. The particularly strong sleep-promoting effects of neuronal <italic>atg1</italic> knockdown provide a potential clue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A, C and D</xref>). Starvation is a well-known inducer of Atg1-dependent autophagy, and food scarcity is a common situation in nature that calls for both high levels of autophagy and suppression of sleep to allow for foraging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Erion et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hale et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, under starvation, the relationship we report for sleep and autophagosome levels would be adaptive. Given that the <italic>aus</italic> sleep-loss phenotype traces at least in part to neuropeptidergic populations, which are implicated in autophagy and also in behaviors such as feeding and sleep in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhukel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dubowy and Sehgal, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dus et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lieberman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Melcher et al., 2007</xref>), these populations may be particularly important for integrating homeostatic phenomena via changes in autophagosome levels. Examples of homeostatic integration are provided by findings that food-motivated learning in fruit flies is disrupted on a high-calorie diet, and that sleep is uncoupled from <italic>Drosophila</italic> memory consolidation by starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chouhan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Alterations in autophagosome level, or perhaps contents, could integrate external and internal nutritive cues and differentially promote coupling of learning and memory to the food and/or sleep homeostats based on the fly’s needs in a given situation. Indeed, it is tempting to speculate that under conditions of low sleep need and autophagosome level, autophagosomes may be important for clearing waste and maintaining overall cellular health, while very strong or prolonged disruptions to sleep or autophagy constitute a stress response able to modify behavior to adapt to environmental conditions. While we focus on the sleep homeostat in this manuscript, sleep’s link to autophagy may be important for integrating sleep with not just the feeding homeostat, but also circadian rhythms and other biological drives more generally. Indeed, the well-documented involvement of autophagy in a range of nutritive, maintenance, stress-response, developmental, and other cellular functions could potentially position it as a cell-autonomous integrator of homeostatic needs writ large.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks</title><p>The <italic>argus</italic> mutant line was obtained in a chemical mutagenesis screen as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shi et al., 2014</xref>).

We calculated relative transcript levels by ddCT.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Live imaging experiments</title><p>Brains from approximately 1 week old adult female flies singly housed on our lab’s standard yeast-molasses food were dissected and mounted in chilled artificial hemolymph (108 mM NaCl; 5 mM KCl; 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>; 8.2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>-6H<sub>2</sub>O; 4 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>; 1 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO4-H<sub>2</sub>O; 5 mM trehalose; 10 mM sucrose; 5 mM HEPES; 265mOsm and pH7.5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cohn et al., 2015</xref>). They were live imaged embedded in vacuum grease with a 40 X water immersion objective at 1.3 X digital zoom under a Leica confocal microscope at Alexa488 (green) and Alexa594 (red) wavelengths. Z-stacks containing ~60 μm of the central brain starting from the tips of the antennal lobes were captured.</p><p>Ilastik machine learning software was trained to isolate all mCherry(+) puncta from our Z-stacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berg et al., 2019</xref>). Briefly, for each experiment an equal number of representative brains from each group were marked for signal and noise in the red channel by a human scorer to train the Ilastik algorithm. Slices from the front, middle, and back of each stack were used, taking care to mark a range of diverse examples of signal and background. A similar number of markings were made between groups, to avoid biasing the algorithm. Ilastik’s prediction of signal and background was then reversibly overlaid on unmarked sample sections and visually inspected for accuracy by the human scorer. Once the algorithm passed inspection, simple segmentations of all brains were generated by Ilastik to define puncta and background for input into ImageJ. ImageJ was then used to measure mCherry(+) puncta count and size, and each mCherrry puncta’s green channel intensity from GFP. We then thresholded to background GFP intensity within each brain, and counted mCherry(+) puncta with green fluorescence intensity exceeding background to determine autophagosome and autolysosome percentages. The Ilastik algorithm was validated by quantifying autophagy following treatment with the autophagy-inducer rapamycin (see below).</p><p>Brains for Ilastik validation were incubated in artificial hemolymph supplemented with either 2 μM LC Laboratories rapamycin (Cat#: R5000) in ethanol vehicle, or ethanol vehicle alone, for ~2 hours prior to imaging. The drug condition was maintained for each group throughout imaging.</p><p>For sleep deprivation, flies were placed in DAM monitors in locomotor tubes filled with fresh yeast-molasses food on top of a mechanical deprivator. During the night preceding imaging, flies were shaken for a period of 2 s every 20 s to disrupt sleep, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Toda et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>For sleep induction, flies were flipped from regular yeast-molasses food onto yeast-molasses food supplemented with either Sigma-Aldrich gaboxadol hydrochloride (Cat#: T101) in water vehicle diluted to 0.1 mg/mL final concentration, or water vehicle alone, during ZT0-1. Flies were maintained on the supplemented food for ~12 hr before imaging from ZT12-14. Sleep was recorded for at ~11 hr after flip onto drugged food, to verify that we observed gaboxadol-induced sleep gain as previously described in the same flies whose brains were imaged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berry et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dissel et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistics were run in GraphPad Prism or JMP software. Shapiro-Wilkes tests were used to assess normality of each group for each individual experiment.

This finding was examined in contrast to a long-sleeping mutant, blue cheese, which exhibits impaired autophagosome maturation. The authors also showed that autophagosomes accumulate due to sleep deprivation, providing evidence for a bidirectional relationship between sleep and autophagy. These results identify autophagy as a potential function and regulator of sleep. The work is very exciting and experiments are well done, but important concerns remain and have been outlined below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The authors link regulation of autophagy directly to regulation of sleep using two non-standard regulators of autophagy (aus and bch), for which autophagic phenotypes may be an indirect consequence of defects in other functions. While it is true that knockdown of known autophagic regulators can compensate for their dysfunction and the sleep phenotype, knockdown of these autophagic regulators does not itself affect sleep in ways that fit their hypothesis. The authors show the correlation of autophagosome accumulation with sleep and sleep deprivation; however, it is unclear if sleep-related autophagy is distinct from circadian-regulated autophagy (ie, Ma et al., 2011) and if sleep deprivation-induced autophagy is distinct from starvation-induced autophagy. Moreover, if the authors' hypothesis is correct, then RNAi of autophagy components (Atg5, 7) should alter the autophagosome phenotype as well as the sleep phenotype. That said, these data are extremely exciting and provide a clear correlation between autophagy and sleep regulation.</p><p>However, the major concern is that there are mainly sleep phenotypes from manipulating autophagy in a disease context so it's not clear how relevant autophagy is for normal sleep. Metaphorically, If someone robs a bank and drives away, the fact that messing up all the stoplights in the city may prevent their escape doesn't necessarily tell us how law enforcement is supposed to work. That said, a mechanism connecting autophagy and sleep is highly appealing and would make sense in the context of the field. Therefore at least two more experiments could really tell us if autophagosome accumulation itself is important for normal sleep regulation. The authors should see if they can be done and if not feasible in a reasonable time, discuss the above concerns substantively and tone down the conclusions accordingly.</p><p>2. The first experiment is to look at autophagosome number over the missing parts of the circadian cycle in wild-type flies and, ideally, in the aus and/or bch mutants. In Ma et al., 2011, six time points from the mouse liver clearly show that liver autophagosomes accumulate during the day and decrease at night. Looking at other parts of the circadian cycle is critical to testing their model. If autophagosomes also accumulate during the day in fly brains, this would suggest that the act of decreasing (not increasing) autophagosomes causes sleep. This would make much more sense in the context of their findings. (Though would have to be explained regarding mouse sleep…) If, on the other hand, autophagosomes accumulate during the night in fly brains, this would argue for their model (as we understand it) in which autophagosome accumulation promotes sleep and excess accumulation &quot;breaks&quot; the homeostatic. The model itself is somewhat counter-intuitive and is not easy to reconcile with the Atg RNAi phenotype but we can accept that this may be happening in this case.</p><p>3. The second experiment really needed here is something that pins down the role of autophagy in normal sleep. There are many acceptable options for this point. If experiment 1 above shows that autophagosomes continue to accumulate and peak during the waking state and the decrease in autophagosomes (inhibition of autophagy?) triggers sleep, then the Atg7 RNAi (alone, not in disease context) makes a little more sense and these should have low autophagosome formation and therefore sleep more. If, on the other hand, the authors see the opposite result in experiment 1, it would be good to either test other classic autophagy mutants/RNAi for sleep phenotype or overexpress Atg1 and induce autophagy (ideally in a timed manner using an inducible driver such as elav geneswitch or heat-induced promoter) and examine the effects on sleep and autophagosome number. As a note, starvation induces autophagy (presumably increasing autophagosomes) and causes foraging behavior and sleep loss. This is consistent with their current model and, if true, then the prediction falls out that starvation of Atg5 and Atg7 RNAi mutants will not induce sleep loss.</p><p>The key for this model may be autophagy flux… that is, the flux through the autophagy pathway. There are GFP reporters for different types of autophagy targets and one can perform pulse-chase assays, monitoring GFP levels by microscopy or western blot. These experiments might be much more informative than static pictures at only two time points.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64140.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

That said, we acknowledge the reviewer’s point and have addressed it systematically by including a sleep screen of 135 RNAis covering 44 genes involved in autophagy. By expressing these under the control of pan-neuronal <italic>nsyb</italic>-gene switch (pan-neuronal, medium strength) or actin-gene switch (whole-fly, extremely strong) drivers, we were able to acutely induce knockdown in adulthood. We find that a number of RNAis, functionally clustered around initiation of autophagy and maturation of autophagosomes up to the point of Atg8 incorporation, increase sleep. This includes sleep increases with multiple distinct RNAis for <italic>Atg1</italic> and <italic>Atg8b</italic> (targets both <italic>8a</italic> and <italic>8b</italic> homologs).</p><p>The same screen showed that expression with the temporally drug-gated actin-gene switch driver increases baseline sleep with the same <italic>atg7</italic> RNAi allele we used to rescue <italic>aus</italic> sleep loss with the elav-Gal4 driver. The reduced sleep phenotype of elavGal4&gt;<italic>atg7</italic> knockdown alone was most likely due to developmental effects, which nevertheless was helpful for our purposes because rescue of <italic>aus</italic> by a manipulation that increased sleep by itself might have been interpreted as an additive effect.</p><p>In sum, the addition of this behavioral screen considerably strengthens the evidence supporting our hypothesis that perturbing autophagosome number can affect sleep. Courtesy of the many gain-of-sleep phenotypes we identify in our RNAi screen, we can now be reasonably confident that the previous lack of baseline sleep gain with canonical autophagy RNAis is due to the vagaries of RNAi knockdown efficiency and/or timing, rather than a refutation of our model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors show the correlation of autophagosome accumulation with sleep and sleep deprivation; however, it is unclear if sleep-related autophagy is distinct from circadian-regulated autophagy (ie, Ma et al., 2011) and if sleep deprivation-induced autophagy is distinct from starvation-induced autophagy. Moreover, if the authors' hypothesis is correct, then RNAi of autophagy components (Atg5, 7) should alter the autophagosome phenotype as well as the sleep phenotype. That said, these data are extremely exciting and provide a clear correlation between autophagy and sleep regulation.</p><p>However, the major concern is that there are mainly sleep phenotypes from manipulating autophagy in a disease context so it's not clear how relevant autophagy is for normal sleep. Metaphorically, If someone robs a bank and drives away, the fact that messing up all the stoplights in the city may prevent their escape doesn't necessarily tell us how law enforcement is supposed to work. That said, a mechanism connecting autophagy and sleep is highly appealing and would make sense in the context of the field. Therefore at least two more experiments could really tell us if autophagosome accumulation itself is important for normal sleep regulation. The authors should see if they can be done and if not feasible in a reasonable time, discuss the above concerns substantively and tone down the conclusions accordingly.</p><p>2. The first experiment is to look at autophagosome number over the missing parts of the circadian cycle in wild-type flies and, ideally, in the aus and/or bch mutants. In Ma et al., 2011, six time points from the mouse liver clearly show that liver autophagosomes accumulate during the day and decrease at night. Looking at other parts of the circadian cycle is critical to testing their model. If autophagosomes also accumulate during the day in fly brains, this would suggest that the act of decreasing (not increasing) autophagosomes causes sleep. This would make much more sense in the context of their findings. (Though would have to be explained regarding mouse sleep…) If, on the other hand, autophagosomes accumulate during the night in fly brains, this would argue for their model (as we understand it) in which autophagosome accumulation promotes sleep and excess accumulation &quot;breaks&quot; the homeostatic. The model itself is somewhat counter-intuitive and is not easy to reconcile with the Atg RNAi phenotype but we can accept that this may be happening in this case.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that ruling out circadian confounds for our manuscript is important. However, we respectfully disagree that simply measuring autophagy flux at more circadian timepoints is the best way to address this. In the absence of a homeostatic perturbation, the 24-hour pattern of autophagy posited by the reviewer as supportive of sleep control could still simply be a pattern driven by the circadian clock. We believe that examining the response of the autophagy system to homeostatic perturbation of sleep is the appropriate way to assess whether the sleep homeostat has a role distinct from the circadian clock. To this end, we now include both the previous-version SD experiment showing that loss of sleep at night increases daybreak Atg8a(+) puncta number, as well as a new gaboxadol experiment showing that pharmacologically enforced sleep during the day decreases nightfall Atg8a(+) puncta number (with no significant effects on AP/AL ratio or puncta size in either case). These results demonstrate a distinct role for the sleep homeostat.</p><p>Importantly, the results of the experiments above are consistent with our model. To be clear, we believe that the higher autophagosome number in the early night (ZT12-14, or 0-2 hours from lights off) reflects accumulation during the day. However, accumulation during the day does not argue for a decrease in autophagosomes causing sleep, as inferred by the reviewer, because: (1) the number is high in the early night when flies fall asleep, and (2) Prolonged wake (sleep deprivation) increases accumulation of autophagosomes.</p><p>Our mutant and RNAi data consistently suggest that strong and/or long-term elevation of autophagosome number inhibits sleep, while strong and/or long-term depression of autophagosome number promotes sleep. We thank the reviewers for their feedback on our model, as it led us to re-evaluate and arrive at what we believe is a more parsimonious and easier to understand synthesis of our data. As shown in our updated Figure 9, we believe that sleep regulates autophagy in a normal day/night cycle, and even under acute single-cycle manipulations of sleep such as in our mechanical SD and gaboxadol experiments. But effects of autophagy on sleep are only evident with a sufficiently strong and/or sustained change to autophagosome number, such as in the mutants we report here. Notably, all the mutant data support the hypothesis that a high/sustained decrease in autophagosomes promotes sleep and vice versa.</p><p>Finally, the reviewer’s comment suggests that we inadvertently gave the impression that we were proposing that sleep, NOT circadian rhythms, regulates autophagy in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons. This is not the case. Rather, we are asserting that the sleep homeostat plays a role (undoubtedly among other behavioral factors, including feeding and, likely, circadian rhythms) in regulating autophagy. To clarify this, we now explicitly state at the end of our discussion that sleep control of autophagy is not mutually exclusive with circadian and feeding control. Indeed, starvation and long-term circadian disruptions are two stimuli that may well be capable of driving autophagosome numbers low or high enough for a long period of time to exert an influence on sleep. The former possibility, in particular, we go into at some length elsewhere in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The second experiment really needed here is something that pins down the role of autophagy in normal sleep. There are many acceptable options for this point. If experiment 1 above shows that autophagosomes continue to accumulate and peak during the waking state and the decrease in autophagosomes (inhibition of autophagy?) triggers sleep, then the Atg7 RNAi (alone, not in disease context) makes a little more sense and these should have low autophagosome formation and therefore sleep more. If, on the other hand, the authors see the opposite result in experiment 1, it would be good to either test other classic autophagy mutants/RNAi for sleep phenotype or overexpress Atg1 and induce autophagy (ideally in a timed manner using an inducible driver such as elav geneswitch or heat-induced promoter) and examine the effects on sleep and autophagosome number. As a note, starvation induces autophagy (presumably increasing autophagosomes) and causes foraging behavior and sleep loss. This is consistent with their current model and, if true, then the prediction falls out that starvation of Atg5 and Atg7 RNAi mutants will not induce sleep loss.</p></disp-quote><p>We tested sleep behavior following RNAi knockdown of a large number of autophagy-relevant genes with inducible drivers and found results largely consistent with our hypothesis, as discussed at length above. There appears to be some confusion about our hypothesis, so to clarify, we find that autophagosomes increase with wakefulness and decline with sleep, potentially from accumulation of cellular waste during wake, which is then reduced during sleep. The new gaboxadol experiment, which shows a reduction in autophagosomes with induced sleep during the day (fruit flies’ normally active phase) supports this hypothesis. While this might suggest that an accumulation of autophagosomes drives sleep, we have no reason to believe that autophagy drives sleep in a daily cycle. On the other hand, a sustained change in autophagosome number affects sleep, but in the opposite direction from predictions based on the day:night profile, as demonstrated by <italic>bchs</italic> and <italic>aus</italic> mutant phenotypes and now supplemented by results of our RNAi-based sleep screen of autophagy regulators. All the mutant and RNAi phenotypes are consistent with a model in which a sustained increase in autophagosomes reduces sleep while a decrease increases sleep (Figure 9).</p><p>Such a persistent change in autophagosomes may occur in certain pathological conditions; for instance, the <italic>aus</italic> short-sleep with autophagosome accumulation situation is reminiscent of what is seen in neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer’s; interestingly, sleep is affected in these disorders. One notable ethological scenario where an effect of autophagosomes on sleep could be evolutionarily valuable is under conditions of food scarcity, where elevated autophagosome levels, required to release nutritional stores, need to be coordinated with extended waking to facilitate foraging.</p><p>We now more clearly define our model and explain its implications, in our model figure and Discussion sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The key for this model may be autophagy flux… that is, the flux through the autophagy pathway. There are GFP reporters for different types of autophagy targets and one can perform pulse-chase assays, monitoring GFP levels by microscopy or western blot. These experiments might be much more informative than static pictures at only two time points.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that experiments like the ones proposed would be interesting; however, addressing the contents of the sleep-regulated autophagosomes with reporters for different targets is a distinct question from whether the sleep homeostat influences autophagy to begin with. It would also be a very laborious and time-consuming effort that could take years. We are unable to conduct such studies in a reasonable amount of time for resubmission of the present manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
