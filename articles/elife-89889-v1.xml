However, the effects of MCS on neuronal hyperexcitability in AD are unknown. We investigated the effects of MCS in a well-established mouse model of AD with hyperexcitability, the Tg2576 mouse. The most common type of hyperexcitability in Tg2576 mice are generalized EEG spikes (interictal spikes [IIS]). IIS also are common in other mouse models and occur in AD patients. In mouse models, hyperexcitability is also reflected by elevated expression of the transcription factor ∆FosB in the granule cells (GCs) of the dentate gyrus (DG), which are the principal cell type. Therefore, we studied ΔFosB expression in GCs. We also studied the neuronal marker NeuN within hilar neurons of the DG because reduced NeuN protein expression is a sign of oxidative stress or other pathology. This is potentially important because hilar neurons regulate GC excitability. Tg2576 breeding pairs received a diet with a relatively low, intermediate, or high concentration of choline. After weaning, all mice received the intermediate diet. In offspring of mice fed the high choline diet, IIS frequency declined, GC ∆FosB expression was reduced, and hilar NeuN expression was restored. Using the novel object location task, spatial memory improved. In contrast, offspring exposed to the relatively low choline diet had several adverse effects, such as increased mortality. They had the weakest hilar NeuN immunoreactivity and greatest GC ΔFosB protein expression. However, their IIS frequency was low, which was surprising. The results provide new evidence that a diet high in choline in early life can improve outcomes in a mouse model of AD, and relatively low choline can have mixed effects. This is the first study showing that dietary choline can regulate hyperexcitability, hilar neurons, ΔFosB, and spatial memory in an animal model of AD.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>diet</kwd><kwd>Alzheimer's disease</kwd><kwd>dentate gyrus</kwd><kwd>hyperactivity</kwd><kwd>memory</kwd><kwd>excitability</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004866</institution-id><institution>New York State Office of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>no number</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ginsberg</surname><given-names>Stephen D</given-names></name><name><surname>Scharfman</surname><given-names>Helen E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG 055328</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scharfman</surname><given-names>Helen E</given-names></name><name><surname>Ginsberg</surname><given-names>Stephen D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000957</institution-id><institution>Alzheimer's Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AARFD-22-926807</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alcantara-Gonzalez</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN-2023-03400</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Botterill</surname><given-names>Justin J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Supplementing the diet in early life with choline improved memory, neuronal morphology, and neuronal activity in mice with a genetic form of Alzheimer's disease, whereas low choline had mixed effects.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Diet has been suggested to influence several aspects of brain health. One dietary intervention that has been studied extensively in rodents and humans is supplementation of the maternal diet with the nutrient choline (maternal choline supplementation [MCS]). MCS improves many aspects of brain health in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Zeisel and da Costa, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>). In normal rats, MCS also is beneficial, with numerous studies showing improved behavior in the adult offspring (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Meck and Williams, 2003</xref>).</p><p>In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), changes to the diet have been recommended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bourre, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Power et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mao et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lobo et al., 2022</xref>), including MCS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Strupp et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Velazquez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dave et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Judd et al., 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Judd et al., 2023b</xref>). One reason for the recommendation is that serum levels of choline are low in individuals with AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dave et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Judd et al., 2023b</xref>). In addition, using mouse models of AD, increased choline improved many characteristics of the disease, ranging from inflammation to glucose metabolism and the hallmark amyloid and tau pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dave et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Judd et al., 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Judd et al., 2023b</xref>). In the Ts65Dn mouse model of Down syndrome (DS) and AD, MCS led to improved memory and attention in Ts65Dn offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Strupp et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Powers et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Powers et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) in Ts65Dn mice, a hallmark of DS and AD, was reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kelley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Powers et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alldred et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gautier et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Here, we asked whether MCS would improve Tg2576 mice, a model of familial AD where a mutation in the precursor to amyloid β (Aβ), amyloid precursor protein (APP), is expressed by the hamster prion protein promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hsiao et al., 1996</xref>). This is a commonly used mouse model that simulates aspects of AD.</p><p>One of the reasons to use Tg2576 mice was to ask whether MCS would improve the hyperexcitability found in the mice. The Tg2576 mouse is ideal because hyperexcitability is robust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bezzina et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kam et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lisgaras and Scharfman, 2023</xref>), and BFCNs are likely to play a role in the hyperexcitabililty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kam et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lisgaras and Scharfman, 2023</xref>). In our past work, the primary type of hyperexcitability was interictal spikes (IIS), which are named because they occur in between seizures (ictal events) in epilepsy. They are studied by EEG. Importantly, IIS are found in numerous mouse models of AD (J20 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brown et al., 2018</xref>]; Ts65Dn <italic>Presenilin2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lisgaras and Scharfman, 2023</xref>]; amyloid precursor protein/Presenilin1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Shoob et al., 2023</xref>]), as well as patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Sanchez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Vossel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beagle et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Vossel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Vossel and Karageorgiou, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Vossel, 2023</xref>).</p><p>We also studied hyperexcitability reflected by high protein expression of ΔFosB, a transcription factor that is increased when neurons have been highly active over the prior 10–14 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">McClung et al., 2004</xref>). We studied ΔFosB in granule cells (GCs) of the dentate gyrus (DG) because numerous ΔFosB-expressing GCs occur when there are IIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">You et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">You et al., 2018</xref>). We also focused on GCs because we found that the cell layer of GCs (GCL) is where IIS are largest relative to area CA1 and overlying neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lisgaras and Scharfman, 2023</xref>). Moreover, closed-loop optogenetic silencing of GCs reduced IIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lisgaras and Scharfman, 2023</xref>).</p><p>We also asked whether behavior would improve if MCS reduced IIS frequency in Tg2576 mice. The basis for this question is in studies of epilepsy, where IIS disrupt cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Rausch et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aarts et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Holmes and Lenck-Santini, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kleen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kleen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gelinas et al., 2016</xref>).

The interval between testing was sufficiently long that it is unlikely that testing at 3 months affected testing at 6 months, but we cannot exclude the possibility. At 6 months of age, we perfusion-fixed mice, sectioned the brains, and evaluated NeuN and ΔFosB protein expression. NeuN was studied because it is a neuronal marker that is reduced in numerous pathological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buckingham et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kadriu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Matsuda et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Duffy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Duffy et al., 2015</xref>). We also assayed ΔFosB because it can be used to assay neuronal activity and therefore is complementary to EEG recordings. It also can be used to assess hyperexcitability of GCs.</p><p>The results showed a remarkable effect of the high choline diet. IIS and spatial memory were improved, as was NeuN and ΔFosB expression. Interestingly, the relatively low choline diet had mixed effects, reducing IIS frequency, but making NOL, ΔFosB, and NeuN worse. The mice also died prematurely relative to mice that were fed the high choline diet. We also report for the first time that there is loss of NeuN-ir in the DG hilus of Tg2576 mice, which is important because abnormal hilar neurons could cause GC hyperexcitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Sperk et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Scharfman and Myers, 2012</xref>).

The lack of preference reflects no inherent bias for one object vs. the other. We confirmed the lack of bias for each genotype and each diet during training. To conduct statistics, we first conducted a two-way ANOVA based on the training data with genotype or age (3 or 6 months) as factors. There were no effects of genotype (F(1,97) = 0.40, p=0.530) or age (F(1,70) = 1.94, p=0.167) on object exploration time. Then, we conducted a two-way ANOVA to ask whether diet played a role. The main factors were diet and age, and there also was no effect of diet (F(2,97) = 0.06, p=0.941) or age (F(2,70) = 2.94, p=0.058) on object exploration time. Thus, novel object exploration during training approached 50% in all treatment groups, independent of genotype and maternal diet, and at both ages.</p><p>Next, we confirmed that Tg2576 mice were deficient in the test phase of NOL when they were fed the standard mouse diet (the intermediate diet). First, we studied 3 months-old mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We used a two-way ANOVA with genotype and task phase (training vs. testing) as main factors. There was a significant main effect of the task phase (F(1,48) = 8.51, p=0.005) and a trend for a genotype effect (F(1,48) = 3.80, p=0.057). Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Duffy et al., 2015</xref>), Tukey–Kramer post hoc analyses revealed a significant increase in the exploration of the novel object during testing in WT (p=0.017) but not Tg2576 mice (p=0.676; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Thus, Tg2576 mice were impaired in NOL when fed the intermediate diet.</p><p>In contrast to Tg2576 mice fed the intermediate diet, Tg2576 mice that received the high choline diet showed memory for object location. Thus, a two-way ANOVA revealed a main effect of the task phase (F(1,72) = 46.16, p&lt;0.0001) but not genotype (F(1,72)=1.74, p=0.191). Tukey-Kramer post hoc analyses revealed a significant increase in the exploration of the novel object during testing in both WT (p=0.0003) and Tg2576 mice (p&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A3</xref>).

These data suggest that relatively low levels of choline during early life impaired spatial memory in both WT and Tg2576 mice. Thus, low choline had a significant adverse effect. Adverse effects are further supported by survival plots showing that there was more mortality at earlier ages in offspring exposed to the low choline diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> shows the results in 6 months-old WT and Tg2576 mice.

Tukey–Kramer post hoc tests showed that there was a significant increase in the exploration of the novel object in testing both in WT (p&lt;0.001) and Tg2576 (p=0.003).

This has been suggested for procedural learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Middei et al., 2004</xref>) but, to the best of our knowledge, it has not been shown for memory of objects.

Therefore, we initially examined NeuN-ir in Tg2576 mice. We found it was reduced and then asked if the high choline diet could restore it.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, relatively weak NeuN-ir was observed in Tg2576 that received the low choline diet and the intermediate diet compared to the high choline diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This observation is consistent with the vulnerability of the hilus to insult and injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Scharfman, 1999</xref>). To examine the septotemporal axis, quantification from 2 to 3 anterior coronal sections were averaged to provide a value for the septal pole of the DG and 2–3 posterior sections were averaged to assess the caudal DG. The most ventral, temporal levels were not sampled. There was no effect of diet (F(2,30) = 2.11, p=0.137) nor rostral-caudal level (F(1,30) = 0.02, p=0.877) but there was a significant interaction of diet and rostral-caudal level (F(2,30) = 3.88, p=0.036). A one-way ANOVA using anterior values showed a significant effect of diet (F(2,21) = 7.58, p=0.003) but this was not the case for posterior values (F(2,23) = 0.13; p=0.876). In the anterior DG, there was less NeuN-ir in mice fed the low choline diet versus the high choline diet (Tukey–Kramer post hoc test, p=0.029) and less NeuN in mice fed the intermediate versus high choline diet (p=0.003). The results suggest that hilar neurons of Tg2576 mice have reduced NeuN-ir and choline enrichment protected dorsal hilar neurons from NeuN loss in Tg2576 mice.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Choline supplementation improved NeuN immunoreactivity (ir) in hilar cells in Tg2576 animals.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of NeuN-ir staining in the anterior dentate gyrus (DG). 1.

Post hoc tests showed that low choline females were different from males fed the intermediate diet (p=0.007), and low choline males were also significantly different from males that had received the intermediate diet (p=0.006).

The high choline diet led to improved behavior in the NOL task, improved expression of ΔFosB, and reduced IIS frequency.</p><p>We also found surprising effects of treating mice with relatively low choline in the maternal diet. The low choline-treated Tg2576 mice had the least hilar NeuN-ir and most GCL ΔFosB protein expression. There was an impairment in the NOL task not only in low choline-treated Tg2576 mice but also WT mice. In addition, the low choline-treated Tg2576 mice showed premature mortality compared to Tg2576 mice fed the high choline diet. These results were surprising because the relatively low levels of choline have been considered by others to be normal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Moreno et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Mellott et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Velazquez et al., 2019</xref>). Our data suggest the low choline diet led to several adverse effects. Yet the IIS frequency was low in the low choline-treated Tg2576 mice, suggesting a beneficial effect. It is possible the chronic overexpression of GC ΔFosB led to reduced IIS by altering GC gene expression since ΔFosB regulates the GC transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Corbett et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">You et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Stephens et al., 2020</xref>). Alterations in GC transcription could impair IIS generation because the GCs appear to be a site where IIS are generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lisgaras and Scharfman, 2023</xref>). Altered GC gene expression might also explain the reduced performance in the NOL task of low choline-treated mice because the DG plays an important role in this NOL normally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lee et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>We showed for the first time that Tg2576 mice have pathology in the hilus at an early age in that hilar neurons are deficient in immunoreactivity to anti-NeuN antibody, and this occurs before amyloid plaque develops (after 6 months of age; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hsiao et al., 1996</xref>). Tg2576 offspring that were fed the high choline diet showed a restoration of hilar NeuN staining. Because hilar neurons play a role in NOL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bui et al., 2018</xref>), it is possible that rescue of hilar neurons by the high choline diet led to improved spatial memory. However, there was no significant correlation between the number of NeuN-ir hilar cells and testing for the NOL task. There was a significant correlation for the NOR task, with both low and high choline groups performing better when hilar NeuN-ir cell numbers were greater. The significant correlation with NOR test performance is consistent with a role of somatostatin-expressing hilar GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Nagarajan et al., 2024</xref>) and hilar glutamatergic mossy cells in NOR and object-related activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Botterill et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">GoodSmith et al., 2022</xref>).

One study of iron deficiency showed that choline supplementation improved NOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kennedy et al., 2014</xref>). Wistar rats treated with a diet high (5.0 g/kg) in choline had improved NOR relative to rats that had been fed a diet lower (1.1 g/kg) in choline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Moreno et al., 2013</xref>). In rats that were aged to 24 months, animals that had been fed a high choline diet showed improved NOR, but only in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Glenn et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Although few studies have examined the effects of MCS on hyperexcitability, our results showing the benefits of high choline are consistent with reports that a methyl-enriched diet (including choline but also betaine, folic acid, vitamin B12, <sc>l</sc>-methionine, and zinc) reduced spike wave discharges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Sarkisova et al., 2023</xref>) and audiogenic seizure severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Poletaeva et al., 2014</xref>) in the offspring. Also, perinatal ethanol treatment that increased excitability was mitigated by choline chloride injection from postnatal days 10–30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Grafe et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>To our knowledge, our study is the first to show that MCS can exert effects on IIS and ΔFosB. However, prior studies have shown that MCS in rats improved memory after severe seizures. Using a convulsant to induce several hours of severe seizures (status epilepticus [SE]), there is usually memory impairment in subsequent weeks; MCS reduced the impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Yang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Holmes et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Wong-Goodrich et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Our results are consistent with previous studies of mouse models of AD. In the APP/PS1 mouse model, where mutations found in AD are present in APP and PS1, it was shown that lifelong choline supplementation, using the high choline diet, improved memory in aged mice compared to a low choline diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Velazquez et al., 2019</xref>). Postnatal choline supplementation also improved memory in APP/PS1 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Other improvements were also shown in the APP/PS1 mice, such as increased choline acetyltransferase, the major enyzme for acetylcholine synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Mellott et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Velazquez et al., 2019</xref>). In 3xFAD mice, where there are three familial AD mutations, a diet without choline had numerous deleterious consequences, including increased Aβ and tau phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dave et al., 2023</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Adverse effects of the diet with relatively low choline</title><p>The relatively low choline diet had several adverse effects, which was surprising because the low choline levels are not considered very low in some prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Moreno et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Mellott et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Velazquez et al., 2019</xref>). However, the past studies using low choline did not test Tg2576 mice. Also, past studies sometimes used the diet for only part of gestation rather than all of gestation and stopped after birth instead of continuing until weaning. In contrast, we fed the diet throughout gestation and until weaning. Nevertheless, it is surprising. One possible explanation is an interaction of the low choline diet with the strain of the Tg2576 mice, SJL (Swiss James Lambert). To our knowledge, this strain has not been tested with different diets before. SJL mice descend from Swiss Webster and are prone to reticulum cell sarcoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Haran-Ghera et al., 1967</xref>). This strain is also characterized by vulnerability to infection causing a multiple sclerosis-like syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Linzey et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>One of the adverse effects was high mortality. Mice appeared to die in seizures. Mice also had high ΔFosB expression in the GCs. Another adverse effect was weak NeuN-ir in the hilus. For both WT and Tg2576 mice, NOL was impaired. These data suggest that the offspring of mothers fed the low choline diet were unhealthy. If mice were unhealthy, IIS might have been reduced due to impaired synchronization (despite high excitability in the DG). Another reason for reduced IIS is that the mice that had the low choline diet had seizures, which interrupted rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Less REM sleep would reduce IIS because IIS occur primarily in REM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kam et al., 2016</xref>). Also, seizures in the Tg2576 mice were followed by a depression of the EEG (postictal depression; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>) that would transiently reduce IIS. A different perspective is that the intermediate diet promoted IIS (rather than low choline reducing IIS). Instead of choline, a constituent of the intermediate diet may have promoted IIS.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>NeuN</title><p>As mentioned above, NeuN is a neuronal nuclear antigen that can be phosphorylated, and when that occurs the antibody to NeuN no longer binds to NeuN. NeuN is phosphorylated in response to oxidative damage, brain injury, and toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lind et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, it was of interest when we saw that hilar neurons of the DG showed reduced NeuN in Tg2576 mice. Hilar neurons are mainly glutamatergic mossy cells and somatostatin (SOM)/neuropeptide Y (NPY)-expressing GABAergic neurons (HIPP cells; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Houser, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Scharfman and Myers, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Scharfman, 2016</xref>), and both neuronal types are implicated in spatial memory functions of the GCs, as well as their excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Myers and Scharfman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Myers and Scharfman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Scharfman and Myers, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jinde et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Scharfman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Raza et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bui et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">GoodSmith et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Li et al., 2021</xref>). If damaged by the high intracellular APP and Aβ levels in young Tg2576 mice, the hilar neurons would be expected to show NeuN loss. This idea is consistent with deficits in SOM and NPY-stained cells in AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chan-Palay, 1987</xref>), indicating a vulnerability.</p><p>The reason for rescue of anterior hilar but not posterior hilar NeuN with the high choline diet is unclear. The greater sensitivity of dorsal neurons may be related to differences in gene expression patterns since some of the genes that are differentially expressed along the dorsal-ventral axis could affect vulnerability to insult or injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cembrowski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). However, there was a similar trend for the data in both anterior and posterior regions. The lack of statistical significance in posterior DG may simply have been due to a greater variance in the posterior DG data.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>∆FosB</title><p>Given that seizures are associated with elevated GC expression of ∆FosB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">McClung et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Corbett et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">You et al., 2017</xref>), the differences in ∆FosB protein expression levels observed here could be the result of increased seizures in animals that received the low choline diet. However, we did not detect a significant difference in seizures at 6 months of age, although there may have been a difference earlier in life or if we had recorded for a longer time. Interestingly, there may have been more seizures due to a reduced number of IIS. Thus, some evidence suggests that IIS can abort a seizure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Staley and Dudek, 2006</xref>).</p><p>∆FosB is a transcription factor that is linked to cognition. In the J20 mouse model of AD, elevated ∆FosB in GCs led to reduced cognition, and when ∆FosB was selectively reduced the cognition improved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Corbett et al., 2017</xref>).

One hypothesis that we are interested in is that MCS improves outcomes by reducing IIS. Reducing IIS would potentially reduce hyperactivity, which is significant because neuronal activity can increase release of Aβ and tau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cirrito et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cirrito et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bero et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Yamada et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Yamamoto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hettinger et al., 2018</xref>). IIS would also be likely to disrupt sleep since it represents aberrant synchronous activity over widespread brain regions. The disruption to sleep could impair memory consolidation since consolidation is a notable function of sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Graves et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Poe et al., 2010</xref>). Indeed, in AD patients, IIS and similar events, IEDs, are correlated with memory impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Vossel et al., 2016</xref>). Sleep disruption also has other negative consequences such as impairing normal clearance of Aβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Nedergaard and Goldman, 2020</xref>).</p><p>How would choline supplementation in early life reduce IIS of the offspring? It may do so by making BFCNs more resilient. That is significant because BFCN abnormalities appear to cause IIS. Thus, selective silencing of BFCNs reduced IIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lisgaras and Scharfman, 2023</xref>). The cholinergic antagonist atropine also reduces IIS when injected systemically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kam et al., 2016</xref>), and it reduced elevated synaptic activity of GCs in young Tg2576 mice in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alcantara-Gonzalez et al., 2021</xref>). These studies are consistent with the idea that early in AD there is elevated cholinergic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">DeKosky et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ikonomovic et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kelley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Mufson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kelley et al., 2016</xref>), while later in life there is cholinergic degeneration. Indeed, the overactivity of cholinergic neurons of the first months of life could cause the degeneration at older ages.</p><p>Why would MCS make BFCNs resilient? There are several possibilities that have been explored, based on genes upregulated by MCS. One attractive hypothesis is that neurotrophic support for BFCNs is retained after MCS but after a normal diet BFCNs decline in aging and AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gautier et al., 2023</xref>). The neurotrophins, notably nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, have been known for a long time to support the health of BFCNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Mufson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Niewiadomska et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Limitations</title><p>One of the limitations of the study was that the maternal diets were not matched exactly. Although the low and high choline diets only had differences in choline, the intermediate diet had different amounts of choline as well as other constituents (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Therefore, the only diet comparison with a difference restricted to choline is the low versus high choline diets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The intermediate diet was useful, however, because numerous studies in AD mouse models employ this standard diet.</p><p>In addition, groups were not exactly matched. Although WT mice do not have IIS, a WT group for each of the diets would have been useful. Sample sizes were also not matched exactly because several mice died. However, this is unlikely to have had a major effect because IIS were low in frequency in all groups over the last months of the study.</p><p>Regarding sex differences, there may have been differences if females had been separated by stage of the estrous cycle at death. This possibility is raised by prior data showing that rats and mice during proestrous and estrous mornings have hyperexcitability but not at other cycle stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Scharfman et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The Tg2576 mouse model is one of many murine models of AD, and as with all models there are inherent limitations.

There also is evidence that serum levels of choline are low in AD. Therefore, it is exciting to think that dietary choline might improve AD. Given the past work also shows benefits to mice that simulate DS, the benefits of choline supplementation appear to extend to DS. The present study adds to the growing consensus that MCS is restorative by showing that hyperexcitability and pathology in the DG of Tg2576 mice are improved by MCS. They also suggest that there may be some adverse effects of a relatively low level of choline in the diet.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-NeuN (mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# MAB377;

Two thresholds were used because some cells were lightly stained and others much more robust in their staining. The first threshold was most inclusive of immunoreactive cells. Presumably this group reflected cells with less neuronal activity as well as those with intense activity. Then a second analysis was done with the same sections using a higher threshold.

To determine the amplitude threshold, we calculated the root mean square (RMS) amplitude for noise in each recording during a 60 s segment of baseline activity. A period of baseline activity was selected that did not include any artifacts, which were defined as extremely large deflections much greater than any other activity, and composed of a waveform that was unlike any physiological activity. They typically were accompanied by a large shake in the animal, a cable hitting a part of the cage, or scratching the implant. The threshold for IIS was set at 9 standard deviations above the RMS amplitude. This threshold was selected because it identified IIS extremely well and excluded artifacts. The IIS in one of the hippocampal channels was used instead of another channel because of data suggesting IIS begin in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kam et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lisgaras and Scharfman, 2023</xref>). Following the automatic analysis of the IIS, the software’s detection accuracy was verified manually for each recording to ensure that all spikes appeared in all four channels and that no artifacts were included.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Statistical comparisons</title><p>Data are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). The significance was set to &lt;0.05 prior to all experiments. Tests were conducted using Prism software (GraphPad).</p><p>Parametric data comparing two groups used unpaired two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-tests. For &gt;2 groups, one-way ANOVA was used followed by Tukey–Kramer post hoc tests that corrected for multiple comparisons. For data with two main factors, two-way ANOVA was followed by Tukey–Kramer post hoc tests. Interactions are not reported in the results unless they were significant. For the analysis of IIS frequency from 1.2 months of age up to 6 months of age, a repeated-measures ANOVA (RMANOVA) was used.</p><p>Tests for normality (Shapiro–Wilk) and homogeneity of variance (Bartlett’s test) were used to determine whether parametric statistics could be used. When data were not normal, non-parametric data were used. When there was significant heteroscedasticity of variance, data were log transformed. If log transformation did not resolve the heteroscedasticity, non-parametric statistics were used. For non-parametric data, Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> tests were used to compare two groups and Kruskal–Wallis for &gt;2 groups. The post hoc tests were Dunn’s test for multiple comparisons.</p><p>For correlations, Pearson’s r was calculated. To compare survival curves, a log rank (Mantel–Cox) test was performed.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Reviewing editor, <italic>eLife</italic></p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed in accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

The cognitive abilities were assessed by the novel object recognition test and the novel object location test, performed in the same cohort of mice at 3 months and 6 months of age. Neuronal loss was tested using NeuN immunoreactivity, and neuronal hyperexcitability was examined using ΔFosB and video-EEG recordings, providing multi-level correlations between these different parameters.</p><p>The study was designed as a 6-month follow-up, with repeated behavioral and EEG measurements through disease development and multilevel correlations providing valuable and interesting findings on AD progression and the effect of early-life choline supplementation.
