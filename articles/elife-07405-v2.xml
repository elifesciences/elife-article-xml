The defining pathological features are fluid-filled cysts developing from nephric tubules due to defective flow sensing, cell proliferation and differentiation. The underlying molecular mechanisms, however, remain poorly understood, and the derived excretory systems of established invertebrate models (<italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>) are unsuitable to model CKDs. Systematic structure/function comparisons revealed that the combination of ultrafiltration and flow-associated filtrate modification that is central to CKD etiology is remarkably conserved between the planarian excretory system and the vertebrate nephron. Consistently, both RNA-mediated genetic interference (RNAi) of planarian orthologues of human CKD genes and inhibition of tubule flow led to tubular cystogenesis that share many features with vertebrate CKDs, suggesting deep mechanistic conservation. Our results demonstrate a common evolutionary origin of animal excretory systems and establish planarians as a novel and experimentally accessible invertebrate model for the study of human kidney pathologies.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07405.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07405.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07405.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Millions of people around the world are affected by cystic kidney diseases, which are amongst the most common inherited genetic disorders. Throughout their life, people with these diseases develop fluid-filled cysts in their kidneys, which stop these organs from working properly and can eventually lead to organ failure.</p><p>Healthy kidneys perform many vital roles in the body, including removing waste products and keeping the concentration of salts in the blood in balance. These activities depend on the kidneys filtering the blood, and then reabsorbing useful chemicals from the filtered fluid as it passes through small tubes called tubules. Cysts disrupt both of these processes.</p><p>Mutations in many different genes can cause cystic kidney diseases. Many of these genes encode proteins that are involved in the formation of cilia: hair-like structures that project from some cell membranes. Cilia on the cells that line tubules are thought to bend in response to the flow of fluid and then generate signals that dampen cell proliferation. This would explain how the loss of cilia could cause too many cells to develop, which would lead to the formation of cysts. But many of the molecular details are missing from this explanation. Previous studies in mammals and simple model organisms (such as fruit flies and roundworms) have sought to fill in the gaps, but each model has its own limitations.</p><p>Now, Thi-Kim Vu et al. propose that a flat worm called a planarian could provide a new and experimentally accessible animal model to study cystic kidney diseases. These flat worms get rid of their waste products via an excretory system that consists of branched tubules that spread throughout the body. Thi-Kim Vu et al. found that, like the tubules in the kidney, these tubules filter and then reabsorb chemicals from body fluids. Moreover, these processes are performed in different parts of the tubules, exactly as they are in the tubules in kidneys.</p><p>The genome of a flat worm called <italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic> contains many genes that cause cysts to form when their equivalents are mutated in humans. Reducing the expression of these genes (and others that are involved in cilia formation) also caused cysts to form in the flat worms.</p><p>These findings indicate that it is likely that the excretory systems of different animals have a shared evolutionary history. If so, the findings support the idea that cilia in kidney tubules send signals in response to fluid flow that affect kidney-specific stem cells. They also suggest that problems with these signals could be at the core of some human cystic kidney diseases. One of the next challenges will be to identify these cilia-associated signals. Finally, given that studies involving thousands of flat worms can be carried out with minimal cost, the ultimate goal is to develop flat worms into a new model to discover and investigate genes linked to human kidney diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07405.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07405.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>planaria</kwd><kwd>excretory system</kwd><kwd>cystic kidney disease</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37GM057260</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sánchez Alvarado</surname><given-names>Alejandro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sánchez Alvarado</surname><given-names>Alejandro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Planarians provide evidence for a common evolutionary origin of vertebrate and invertebrate excretory systems and provide a novel experimental model to study human kidney diseases.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The vertebrate kidney plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of organismal homeostasis in the face of changing external and internal conditions. Its myriad individual functions, including the removal of metabolic waste products, regulation of ion concentrations and acid/base balance, are all tied to two basic physiological processes: (1) the pressure-driven ultra-filtration of blood plasma across the glomerulus, whereby molecular sieves prevent the passage of large macromolecules (e.g., plasma proteins); and (2) the subsequent modification of the resulting filtrate during its passage through the epithelial nephron tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Ruppert and Smith, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Ruppert, 1994</xref>). The parallel operation of many millions of glomerulus/nephron units allows formidable filtration rates, amounting to 170 liters of primary filtrate/day in a healthy human adult. In line with the pivotal homeostatic roles of the kidney, kidney diseases pose a serious health problem. The most common human kidney disorders are cystic kidney diseases (CKDs), affecting nearly 12 million people worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Priolo and Henske, 2013</xref>). CKDs encompass a wide range of hereditary, developmental, and acquired conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bisceglia et al., 2006</xref>), all of which share the pathological hallmark of fluid-filled cysts developing in the kidney. This has led to the suggestion that the molecular mechanisms causing cyst formation are similar, or at least, share a common pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Watnick and Germino, 2003</xref>). The molecular cloning of multiple CKD mutations and the realization that the affected genes all function at the primary cilia, basal bodies or centrosomes, has given rise to the ciliary hypothesis as a unifying disease mechanism of CKDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Yoder et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mollet et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fliegauf et al., 2006</xref>). Accordingly, the primary cilia of tubule cells are thought to act as flow sensors, eliciting intracellular calcium fluxes through stretch sensitive polycystin channels in response to flow-driven bending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Praetorius and Spring, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nauli et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Praetorius et al., 2004</xref>). These signals are thought to constitutively dampen cell proliferation, such that loss of filtrate flow or interruptions in the signal transduction process precipitate chronic overproliferation and consequently cyst formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deane and Ricardo, 2012</xref>). However, major mechanistic aspects of the ciliary hypothesis remain poorly understood, including the integration of the calcium signal with downstream transcriptional regulation of cell behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Wilson and Goilav, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Uhlenhaut and Treier, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deane and Ricardo, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kotsis et al., 2013</xref>), the extent by which cyst development can be understood as chronic activity of endogenous repair mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deane and Ricardo, 2012</xref>), and the identity and origins of the ectopically overproliferating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Murer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Weimbs, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lodi et al., 2012</xref>). Further, these questions present an investigative challenge, given the poor experimental accessibility of the mammalian kidney as an internal and essential organ. The <italic>Xenopus</italic> pronephros and zebrafish pro- and mesonephric kidneys, therefore, are increasingly being explored as model systems for human kidney disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Drummond, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ebarasi et al., 2011</xref>). Compounding this problem is the fact that it has not been possible to bring the full power of invertebrate models in solving fundamental cell biological processes to the analysis of human kidney disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Igarashi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dow and Romero, 2010</xref>). Both <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> have highly derived excretory organs in which ultrafiltration is either entirely lacking (<italic>C. elegans</italic>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buechner, 2002</xref>]) or uncoupled from reabsorption/secretion (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dow and Romero, 2010</xref>]). Furthermore, the excretory cells of both organisms are lacking cilia as a further requirement for modeling CKDs. However, <italic>C. elegans</italic> or <italic>Drosophila</italic> are but two of the myriad invertebrate species and multiple studies have documented the existence of more complex excretory systems outside the <italic>Ecdysozoa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Ruppert and Smith, 1988</xref>). One such example is the excretory system of planarian flatworms. We and others have previously reported on intriguing similarities between planarian protonephridia and the vertebrate nephron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rink et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Scimone et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we carried out a systematic structure function comparison to systematically gauge the potential of planarian protonephridia as a model system for human kidney diseases. Our results demonstrate the structural coupling of cilia-driven ultrafiltration and filtrate modification in planarian protonephridia, as well as extensive topological homology of solute carrier expression domains with the vertebrate nephron. These structure/function homologies extend to common pathologies, including shared requirements of nephrin in the maintenance of the ultrafiltration barrier, and of nephrocystins in preventing the development of tubular cysts. Our results therefore establish planarian protonephridia as a novel and viable invertebrate model for studying human kidney development and diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Protonephridia are ultrafiltration devices in planarian</title><p>The planarian excretory system consists of branched epithelial tubules (protonephridia) distributed throughout the entire body plan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rink et al., 2011</xref>). The barrel-shaped flame cells capping the proximal tubule (PT) ends have been proposed to act as unicellular ultrafiltration devices solely on the basis of morphological evidence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Wilhelmi, 1906</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Wilson and Webster, 1974</xref>). To functionally test this premise, we adapted an assay previously used to demonstrate the ultrafiltration capacity of <italic>Drosophila</italic> nephrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Weavers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Zhuang et al., 2009</xref>). We co-injected two inert and differentially labeled tracer molecules of different sizes into the anterior planarian mesenchyme (10 kDa and 500 kDa molecular weight dextrans). Already at 2-hr post injection, we found robust tracer accumulation in protonephridia throughout the body, confirming their active role in extracellular fluid processing. Interestingly, only the small molecular weight tracer produced intense and continuous protonephridial labeling, whereas the large dextran displayed weak and patchy labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). Because the two tracer molecules in the injection mix carried equal numbers of fluorophores, the preferential accumulation of the small over the large dextran particles indicates molecular size filtration upon entry into the protonephridial system. We conclude from these experiments that planarian protonephridia, like vertebrate nephrons, combine ultrafiltration with filtrate modification in the same structure.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07405.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Protonephridia are ultrafiltration devices in planarians.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Whole-mount acetylated tubulin (AcTub) staining.

In the vertebrate nephron, the expression of a large number and diverse types of solute carrier (slc) transporters recovers essential molecules from the primary filtrate or secretes waste products into the tubule lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Landowski, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Raciti et al., 2008</xref>). The known substrate specificity of slc families together with their restricted expression in specific nephron segments establishes a structure/function topology of filtrate modification processes along the nephron. Towards the dual goal of identifying and mapping solute modification processes in planarian protonephridia, we set out to identify, clone and expression-map all solute carriers in the planarian genome. A systematic sequence homology search of the planarian <italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic> genome identified 318 <italic>slc</italic> genes. Reciprocal BLAST analysis and sequence alignments revealed that <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> slcs represent 43 slc families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Expression patterns of all <italic>slc</italic> genes were analyzed by in situ hybridization in intact asexual planarians. We obtained expression patterns for 287 genes in various tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2—figure supplement 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s9">Figure 2—figure supplement 9</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s10">Figure 2—figure supplement 10</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s11">Figure 2—figure supplement 11</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s12">Figure 2—figure supplement 12</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s13">Figure 2—figure supplement 13</xref>), with 49 of these displaying putative protonephridial expressions. The expression of such a large fraction of <italic>slc</italic> genes in protonephridial tubules already indicated a rich potential for solute modifications.</p><p>In order to establish a comprehensive structure-function map of protonephridia, we next mapped the expression domain of each protonephridial <italic>slc</italic> relative to two previously characterized markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, top; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>): (1) acetylated tubulin (AcTub) antibody staining, which marks flame cells and the adjoining PT segment; and (2) <italic>Smed-CAVII-1</italic>, which is expressed in the adjacent distal tubule (DT) segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rink et al., 2011</xref>). Markers for the domain distal to <italic>CAVII-1</italic> expression were not available at the beginning of this study. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) mapping of putative protonephridial <italic>slc</italic> genes against the two markers and general tubule anatomy (e.g., branched vs coiled PT segments) revealed a significantly greater complexity of protonephridial cell types than previously appreciated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s14">Figure 2—figure supplement 14</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s15">Figure 2—figure supplement 15</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s16">Figure 2—figure supplement 16</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s17">Figure 2—figure supplement 17</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s18">Figure 2—figure supplement 18</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s19">Figure 2—figure supplement 19</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s20">Figure 2—figure supplement 20</xref>). <italic>slc</italic> expression domains define at least three sub-domains within the PT (PT1, PT2, and PT3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>) and the non-overlapping expression of representative <italic>slc</italic> genes in 3-color FISH experiments demonstrates the significance of the inferred PT subdivisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s14">Figure 2—figure supplement 14</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s15">Figure 2—figure supplement 15</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s16">Figure 2—figure supplement 16</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s17">Figure 2—figure supplement 17</xref>). Similarly, we found that <italic>slc</italic> expression domains divide the DT into 2 sub-domains (DT1 and DT2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,D–F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s18">Figure 2—figure supplement 18F</xref>). Interestingly, the <italic>slc12a-4</italic> expression domain extended beyond <italic>CAVII-1</italic> expression, where it was co-expressed with a further cohort of 14 <italic>slc</italic> genes, including <italic>Smed-slc24a-3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s19">Figure 2—figure supplement 19</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Scimone et al., 2011</xref>]). Together, these 14 <italic>slc</italic> genes therefore define the so far unknown continuation of protonephridia beyond the <italic>CAVII-1</italic> expression domain, which for reasons detailed below we refer to as the ‘Collecting Duct’ (CD). Interestingly, CD marker expressing segments were exclusively located close to the dorsal body surface, supporting early reports suggesting that the protonephridial terminus was located in the dorsal epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Wilhelmi, 1906</xref>).

Clustering a subset of <italic>slc</italic> genes with known substrate specificity by substrate class and site of expression revealed a striking segregation of similar transport activities into similar regions of the protonephridial tubule, indicating the functional specialization of different segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, top). Because this subset of <italic>slc</italic> genes was intentionally chosen due to its known representation for transport activities of specific segments of the nephron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Raciti et al., 2008</xref>), this map afforded a basis for direct structure/function comparisons with the vertebrate nephron. Constructing a similar map of <italic>slc</italic> expression in the rodent metanephros based on published data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, bottom; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>) revealed striking parallel: Not only is the sequence of slc family expression very similar along the filtrate flow axis, but almost all nephron segments have clearly identifiable homologous segments in protonephridia. In vertebrates, the PT is responsible for the reabsorption of more than 70% of filtered solutes from the primary urine, including inorganic/organic ions and vital nutrients (glucose, amino acids, and vitamins). The homologous <italic>slc</italic> expression of planarian PT1-3 and the preferential labeling of PT1-2 by injected dextran (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) provide strong evidence that the proximal protonephridial segments are likewise primarily responsible for the recovery of filtered substances. The DT plays an important role in acid-base homeostasis by reabsorbing bicarbonates and secreting protons into the urine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carraro-Lacroix and Malnic, 2010</xref>). The corresponding expression of bicarbonate (e.g., <italic>Smed-slc4a-6</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s18">Figure 2—figure supplement 18A</xref>) or proton transporters (e.g., Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger <italic>Smed-slc9a-3</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) in DT1 and DT2 suggests a similar function of these protonephridial segments. Consistently, the RNAi knockdown of <italic>slc4a-6</italic> caused a measurable acidification of the intercellular milieu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), supporting a functionally conserved role of DT1-2 in planarian pH homeostasis. Moreover, the vertebrate CD comprises distinct cortical and medullary segments and mediates the bulk of water recovery/urine concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nielsen et al., 2002</xref>). The shared expression of the bicarbonate transporter <italic>Smed-slc4a-7</italic> and the ammonia transporter <italic>Smed-slc42a-2</italic> in the terminal segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) supports a basal homology between the CD and the corresponding protonephridial segment, which is why we have chosen to adopt the vertebrate nomenclature. However, the large number of additional <italic>slc</italic> genes expressed in the protonephridial CD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and the lack of aquaporin expression (not shown) suggest divergent functions.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07405.026</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Extensive structural and functional homology between planarian protonephridia and vertebrate nephrons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Tables summarize expression domains of selected <italic>slc</italic> genes in planarian protonephridia and rodent metanephros.

In terrestrial vertebrates, IT and CD have tightly linked functions in water conservation, whereby urea secretion by the IT establishes high extracellular solute concentrations that aid in water reabsorption from the CD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pannabecker, 2012</xref>). As freshwater animals, planarian protonephridia have to clear, rather than conserve water, providing a compelling rationale for why specifically IT and CD are divergent. Such functional diversity of IT/CD segments is also observed in the pronephric kidneys of freshwater vertebrates, such as zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Wingert and Davidson, 2008</xref>).

Both human nephrons and planarian protonephridia rely on pressure-driven ultrafiltration with subsequent filtrate modification during its passage through the nephridial tubules. This common design principle is significant for two reasons: first, many human kidney pathologies involve filtrate flow (see below); and second, the excretory systems of existing invertebrate model systems do not recapitulate this critical aspect. In fruitflies and other insects, ultrafiltration and filtrate modifications are carried out in separate cell types and organs (ultrafiltration: nephrocytes; filtrate modification: Malpighian tubules) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dow and Romero, 2010</xref>). <italic>C. elegans</italic> has a highly derived excretory system consisting of just a single cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buechner, 2002</xref>).

Further, in vertebrates, it is blood pressure and, ultimately, the heart that drives primary filtrate across the glomerular basement membrane and into the nephron. Planarians lack a circulatory system and therefore cannot solely rely on pressure-driven flow generation. The dense and vigorously beating cilia bundles of flame cells, and the multiciliated lining of the PT suggest instead that motile cilia are responsible for driving protonephridial ultrafiltration and flow. In fact, previous studies of protonephridia in other invertebrates strongly support this conclusion, including the direct observation of fluid flow cessation upon pharmacological inhibition of ciliary beating in the rotifer <italic>Asplanchna</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pontin, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Warner, 1969</xref>).</p><p>The nephrons of the adult human kidney also bear cilia. However, in contrast to the multiciliated and flow generating cilia of the planarian PT, the cells of the adult mammalian nephron bear a single, immotile primary cilium protruding into the lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Webber and Lee, 1975</xref>). Despite these structural and functional differences, we find that cilia are similarly crucial for the maintenance of organ homeostasis in both systems. In humans, loss of function of many genes involved in cilia biogenesis/function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eley et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hildebrandt and Otto, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Winyard and Jenkins, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kotsis et al., 2013</xref>) leads to overproliferation and cyst formation, including for example the NPHP proteins, that anchor the basal body to the cell membrane and are required for primary cilia formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Betleja and Cole, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Craige et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Omran, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Williams et al., 2011</xref>). The importance of cilia is thought to be due to their function as flow sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Winyard and Jenkins, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kotsis et al., 2013</xref>). Flow-induced bending is hypothesized to cause calcium influx via stretch sensitive polycystin channels, which subsequently inhibits cell proliferation via still unknown mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Praetorius and Spring, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nauli et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Praetorius et al., 2004</xref>). Unexpectedly, in spite of the very different structure and function of planarian protonephridial cilia, we found that they are similarly critical in maintaining form and function of the organ system. First, knockdown of the planarian homologues of NPHP proteins lead to overproliferation of protonephridial progenitors. Second, the ablation of cilia by <italic>IFT88(RNAi)</italic> or the inhibition of ciliary beating by interfering with axonemal dyneins leads to protonephridial progenitor overproliferation. Moreover, in both cases, accumulating protonephridial progenitors form dense aggregates with disorganized lumens that quickly compromise the osmoregulatory functions of the organs, leading to edema formation. Hence the disruption of planarian cilia leads to phenotypically very similar alterations as PKD in vertebrates. We therefore conclude that cilia-mediated flow sensing constitutes an ancient mechanism for maintaining excretory organ homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Cilia play a dual role as flow generator and flow sensor in the planarian protonephridia</title><p>Planarians have lost central components of centrosome duplication, which should therefore preclude their ability to form primary cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azimzadeh et al., 2012</xref>). Since planarians only appear to harbor motile cilia, the corollary of this argument would be that the cilia of the protonephridial tubule have a dual role as flow generators and as flow sensors. Our data cannot conclusively address this point, because the currently available experimental paradigms do not allow the requisite uncoupling between cilia and flow. NPHP proteins are generally thought to only be essential for immotile sensory cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eley et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Badano et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ferkol and Leigh, 2012</xref>) based on their involvement in anchoring basal body to the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Betleja and Cole, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Craige et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Omran, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Williams et al., 2011</xref>). Loss of NPHP ‘sensory’ machinery in the multiciliated tubule cells leads to cyst formation in planarians, indicating the putative flow-sensing role of protonephridial cilia. However, bronchiectasis, a classic phenotypic feature of PCD, has been found in many cases of NPHP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bagga et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bergmann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Moalem et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Wolf, 2015</xref>) as well as autosomal dominant PKDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Driscoll et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Moua et al., 2014</xref>), indicating impaired motor cilia function. Conversely, phenotypic features of defective sensory cilia, including retinitis pigmentosa and cystic kidneys, have been reported in PCD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kartagener and Horlacher, 1935</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Saeki et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Moore et al., 2006</xref>). These observations suggest an under-appreciated overlap between NPHP gene functions in motile cilia with that of PCD genes in immotile cilia, which makes it difficult to segregate flow generating and flow sensing roles of protonephridial cilia. However, recent work in vertebrate systems indicates that the transduction of sensory cues from the environment is a universal characteristic of all cilia, including motile cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Teilmann and Christensen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Shah et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting the likely existence of flow sensing role of motile cilia in planarian protonephridia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Schwartz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Teilmann and Christensen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Shah et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Quarmby and Leroux, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Takeda and Narita, 2012</xref>).</p><p>In humans, polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 are key components of cilia-mediated flow sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Praetorius and Spring, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nauli et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Praetorius et al., 2004</xref>). As stretch-activated calcium channels, these proteins are thought to transduce the mechanical bending of the cilium into a chemical signal. Planarians have homologues of both polycystins and their knockdown leads to defects in ciliated dorsal mechanosensory neurons, but interestingly, not in protonephridia (Vu HTK and Rink JC, unpublished). Hence flow sensing in planarian protonephridia likely utilizes different mechanisms. The future elucidation of the underlying mechanisms may uncover general mechanistic links between flow sensing and flow generating in motile cilia.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Cilia-driven fluid flow points to a shared ancestry of vertebrate and invertebrate excretory systems</title><p>Given the extensive evolutionary homology between excretory systems, how can the exclusive reliance on motile cilia driven flow generation in invertebrates be reconciled with their absence in adult vertebrate kidneys? The loss of motile cilia in vertebrate kidneys has been observed in coincidence with the increase in blood pressure in birds and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Marshall, 1934</xref>). This raises the possibility that the evolution of an extensively developed circulatory system in mammals rendered the flow-generating role of motile cilia redundant, and subsequently led to their loss from the adult kidney. The evidence for this hypothesis can be found in the embryology of the vertebrate kidney, which, as Ernst Haeckel argued, may indeed hint at phylogeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Haeckel, 1866</xref>). Many vertebrates display multiciliated flow generation during early developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">White, 1929</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lacy et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kramer-Zucker et al., 2005</xref>). For instance, the pronephric tubules of zebrafish contain multiciliated epithelial cells, and interference with cilia obstructs flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kramer-Zucker et al., 2005</xref>). In humans, motile cilia may even play a role at early kidney development, since multiciliated tubular cells have been observed at fetal stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Zimmermann, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Katz and Morgan, 1984</xref>). Furthermore, a number of human pathologies such as crescentic and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Katz and Morgan, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hassan and Subramanyan, 1995</xref>), as well as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Katz and Morgan, 1984</xref>) are associated with the appearance of multiciliated tubular cells. This suggests that the gene regulatory programs for the development of multiciliated cells remain intact and accessible even in vertebrates. Altogether, these observations suggest that cilia-driven pressure generation may be the ancestral state for excretory systems, and that the immotile primary cilia of the adult vertebrate kidney represents an evolutionary vestige of the cilia-driven flow filtration observed in more basal excretory organs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Structural/functional abnormalities of cilia lead to cyst formation in excretory organs of both planarians and vertebrates</title><p>Even though the exact flow sensing mechanisms remain to be identified, our data show that in planarians, these signals also affect cell proliferation. We observed a global increase of mitoses due to the specific overproliferation of protonephridial progenitors whenever cilia or fluid flow were affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–E</xref>). The aberrant proliferation and differentiation of these cells ultimately lead to dense cell accumulations with discontinuous lumens. In NPHP knockdown planarians, cysts primarily arise in the PT at early stage, but over time, progressively affect the DT as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The severity of the cystic phenotype intimately depends on global proliferation rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F–J</xref>), which, interestingly, is also the case in human CKDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Wilson and Goilav, 2007</xref>). However, not all aspects of the planarian <italic>NPHP(RNAi)</italic> phenotypes phenocopy human NPHP. In human NPHP, cysts arise at the corticomedullary junction of the kidneys, meaning that they mostly develop from the distal convoluted and collecting tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hildebrandt and Zhou, 2007</xref>). This discrepancy could be due to the differential distribution of cilia, which in planarians are only present in the PT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rink et al., 2011</xref>). Accordingly, PT cysts could be the direct consequence of cilia dysfunction, while structural alterations of the DT could be a secondary consequence of overproliferation of protonephridial progenitors. Conversely, cilia are found on the apical surface of most epithelial cells lining the human nephrons with the exception of the intercalated cells interspersed along the CD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Webber and Lee, 1975</xref>). Nevertheless, why cysts predominantly affect the distal convoluted and collecting tubules only, but not other tubule parts in human NPHP is still unknown.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Overall, the interplay between cilia and cell proliferation in protonephridial cyst formation is remarkably similar between humans and planarians. Therefore, in planarian protonephridia, cilia appear to generate a non-cell autonomous signal capable of regulating the proliferation of protonephridial progenitors and orchestrating their integration into the protonephridial tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>). The search for the flow-regulated progenitor populations in the adult vertebrate kidneys is currently an active area of research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Elger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diep et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">McCampbell and Wingert, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Rinkevich et al., 2014</xref>). The mechanisms constituting the non-cell autonomous signal between tubule cells and progenitor cells is a second missing element in our current understanding of human CKDs and the homeostatic role of flow sensing in general. Given the striking evolutionary conservation of flow sensing and flow-dependent progenitor proliferation between planarians and vertebrates, it seems likely that also this elusive signal is conserved. In this regard, the high speed and low cost of high-throughput RNAi screening in planarians therefore provides a novel experimental paradigm for gene discovery and mechanistic studies of human kidney diseases.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Planarian maintenance and irradiation</title><p>The CIW4 clonal line of <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> was maintained as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cebria and Newmark, 2005</xref>). 1 week starved animals were used for all experiments.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Janet Rossant (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Yukiko Yamashita, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. Another one of the reviewers, Friedhelm Hildebrandt, has also agreed to share his identity.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this manuscript, Alvarado and colleagues provide convincing evidence to show that the planarian excretory system, protonephridia, serves as a powerful model system to study mammalian kidney development and pathology such as cystic kidney disease. All reviewers agreed that this is an excellent paper, and raised no major concerns. They have several specific comments, which we suggest authors to address prior to publication. We decided to communicate all comments from reviewers to the authors, instead of summarizing points to be revised, as they contain encouraging comments and praises.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic>:</p><p>This manuscript by Vu et al. provides a comprehensive characterization of the planarian excretory system. The authors conducted systematic phylogenetic and expression analyses of the ∼300 solute carrier (slc) transporters encoded by the planarian genome, identifying 49 that were expressed in the protonephridia. By mapping the <italic>slc</italic> expression patterns relative to known excretory system markers, the authors were able to define six different domains within this system. Strikingly, clustering <italic>slc</italic> genes based upon known substrate specificity and comparing their expression domains to those observed in vertebrate nephrons revealed a remarkable degree of similarity in the overall structural/functional organization of the planarian and rodent systems. These parallels extend to mutations associated with cystic kidney diseases in humans. RNAi knockdowns of planarian nephrins resulted in ultrastructural defects in the slit diaphragms in planarian flame cells and disruption of filtration. RNAi knockdowns of nephrocystin homologs generated cyst-like structures within the protonephridial tubules. Remarkably, the formation of these cysts and the resulting osmoregulatory defects are dependent upon proliferation. Finally, the authors show that knockdowns of genes required for proper ciliary beating (and thus, fluid flow within the ducts) also produced cysts within the excretory system.</p><p><italic>eLife</italic> seeks to publish “authoritative” papers, and I can think of no better word to describe the truly impressive body of work that the authors present here. They convincingly show the many ways in which the planarian osmoregulatory system parallels such systems in vertebrates, providing an invertebrate model that can help us understand both the evolution of osmoregulatory systems and their pathologies. This beautiful paper sets the standard for how such work should be conducted in this organism and will help guide all future work on its excretory system.</p><p>To help strengthen the impact of this paper, I have only a few minor suggestions/comments that the authors may wish to consider addressing before publication:</p><p>1) The data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> are so striking that they warrant two separate figures: one emphasizing the spatial domains defined by <italic>slc</italic> expression (A-H), and another figure emphasizing the structural/functional conservation with the rodent (J-L). In its current form, with the panels reduced to accommodate all of the data, these important conclusions are underemphasized.</p><p>2) Ultrastructural analysis of the <italic>NPHS1</italic> (RNAi) flame cell shows loss of the slit diaphragms, so the observed loss of ultrafiltration (500 kDa dextrans can now enter the system) seems counterintuitive. It may be helpful for the readers if the authors could comment on how loss of the slit diaphragms can lead to loss of size selectivity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Friedhelm Hildebrandt)</italic>:</p><p>This manuscript describes the protonephridial excretory system of <italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic> (planaria). In the first part of the manuscript, authors extensively characterized the planarian excretory system by identifying solute carrier (slc) genes and mapping their expression, and revealed that the planarian protonephridium is structurally and functionally similar to the vertebrate nephron. In the second part of the manuscript, authors knocked down planarian orthologues of human genes which, if mutated, cause kidney diseases including nephrotic syndrome and nephronophthisis. Authors showed by knocking down planarian <italic>NPHS1</italic> and <italic>NEPH3</italic> that planarian flame cells are functional homologues of vertebrate podocytes. Knockdown of planarian nephrocystin orthologues (<italic>NPHP5</italic>, <italic>6</italic> and <italic>8</italic>) led to development of cyst-like structures in proximal tubule segments. In addition, authors found that the cyst formation in planaria depends on overproliferation of protonephridial progenitor cells and loss of cilia function as a fluid flow generator/sensor. These have been also suggested as disease mechanisms of human cystic kidney diseases. Based on these findings, authors concluded that the planarian protonephridium not only has structural and functional homologies, but also shares pathologies with human nephron. In conclusion, authors suggest the planarian protonephridum as a model system to study human kidney diseases.</p><p>This work is interesting and the data are generally clear and of high quality. The amount of work to characterize the protonephridial excretory system of planarians is enormous, and extensive, and it is convincing and will have an impact in the renal community. The following points need to be addressed before publication.</p><p>1) The authors showed that cyst formation depends on increased proliferation of protonephridia progenitors upon knockdown of <italic>NPHP8</italic>. Have authors checked the increased proliferation in planaria with <italic>NPHP5</italic>, <italic>NPHP6</italic>, <italic>IFT88</italic>, <italic>DNAHβ-1</italic> or <italic>LRRC6</italic> knockdown?</p><p>2) The authors claim that fluid flow, which may be generated by cilia, is important for tubular function based on knockdown of motile cilia genes. However, whether the cilia-driven flow exists in planarian excretory system is not clear in the current data. Another possible scenario is that the motile cilia in the protonephridia may be important in clearing waste materials in a similar way to the ‘mucociliary clearance’ in the respiratory systems. Therefore, this review recommends that authors should tone the ‘cilia-driven fluid flow’ down in the Results and Discussion section.</p><p>3) It seems that knockdown of either NPNP genes or PCD genes in planaria resulted in protonephridial cysts, in other words, the same pathologies. However, in humans NPHP and PCD are totally different entities and almost mutually exclusive. In most cases, NPHP genes do not affect motile cilia and PCD genes do not affect immotile cilia. In this regard, it may be possible that the mechanism of cyst formation in planaria is different from that in human. In addition, in human NPHP, cysts occur in corticomedullary junctions and most develops from distal convoluted tubules. But protonephric cysts in planaria form in proximal tubules. Please discuss about these issues.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07405.054</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>1) The data presented in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>are so striking that they warrant two separate figures: one emphasizing the spatial domains defined by</italic> slc <italic>expression (A-H), and another figure emphasizing the structural/functional conservation with the rodent (J-L).

In fact, many nephrotic syndrome patients present severe proteinuria in conjunction with podocyte foot process effacement without observable podocyte detachment or loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Furness et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lahdenkari et al., 2004</xref>). We integrated a new paragraph in the paper explaining the current hypothesis in the field about how such big molecules could traverse the effaced podocyte foot processes that envelope the basement membrane:</p><p>“Why would the fusion of foot processes into a continuous sheet result in loss of filtration size selectively […], yet the exact mechanisms remain to be determined in both humans and planarians”.</p><p>Reviewer #2 (Friedhelm Hildebrandt):</p><p><italic>1) The authors showed that cyst formation depends on increased proliferation of protonephridia progenitors upon knockdown of</italic> NPHP8<italic>.

We further added the analysis of <italic>IFT88-</italic> and <italic>LRRC50(RNAi)</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7–figure supplement 2</xref>) and found again an increase in proliferation. Altogether, the data aptly support a general increase in proliferation upon both impairment of the NPHP complex and cilia function.</p><p><italic>2) The authors claim that fluid flow, which may be generated by cilia, is important for tubular function based on knockdown of motile cilia genes. However, whether the cilia-driven flow exists in planarian excretory system is not clear in the current data. Another possible scenario is that the motile cilia in the protonephridia may be important in clearing waste materials in a similar way to the ‘mucociliary clearance’ in the respiratory systems. Therefore, this review recommends that authors should tone the ‘cilia-driven fluid flow’ down in the Results and Discussion section</italic>.</p><p>The reviewer raises an important point and we have therefore added more background information on how we reached this conclusion. Particularly, we included citations that have previously suggested fluid flow in protonephridia. For instance, Warner showed in his study of protonephridia in the rotifer <italic>Asplanchna</italic> that within 30 minutes after exposure to NiCl<sub>2</sub>, an inhibitor of cilia mobility, beating of cilia stopped and the bladder then ceased its normal fill-contraction cycle significantly, while other muscle and body movements appeared normal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Warner, 1969</xref>). Therefore, it is indeed likely that beating of the cilia is required to drive fluid flow into the protonephridial tubules. Additionally, cilia mobility has also been showed to be important for the generation of fluid flow into the pronephric tubules of zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kramer-Zucker et al., 2005</xref>) and amphibians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">White, 1929</xref>). The relevant section in the Discussion now reads:</p><p>“Planarians lack a circulatory system […] the direct observation of fluid flow cessation upon pharmacological inhibition of ciliary beating in the rotifer <italic>Asplanchna</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pontin, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Warner, 1969</xref>).”</p><p><italic>3) It seems that knockdown of either NPNP genes or PCD genes in planaria resulted in protonephridial cysts, in other words, the same pathologies. However, in humans NPHP and PCD are totally different entities and almost mutually exclusive. In most cases, NPHP genes do not affect motile cilia and PCD genes do not affect immotile cilia. In this regard, it may be possible that the mechanism of cyst formation in planaria is different from that in human. In addition, in human NPHP, cysts occur in corticomedullary junctions and most develops from distal convoluted tubules. But protonephric cysts in planaria form in proximal tubules. Please discuss about these issues</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this aspect of our phenotypes. We have included a discussion paragraph comparing/contrasting the planarian phenotypes with human pathologies. This section now reads:</p><p>“Planarians have lost central components of centrosome duplication […] suggesting the likely existence of flow sensing role of motile cilia in planarian protonephridia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Quarmby and Leroux, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Shah et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Takeda and Narita, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Teilmann and Christensen, 2005</xref>).”</p><p>“In NPHP knockdown planarians, cysts primarily arise in the PT at early stage […] why cysts predominantly affect the distal convoluted and collecting tubules only, but not other tubule parts in human NPHP is still unknown.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
