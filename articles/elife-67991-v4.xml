Their biogenesis through a circle-forming backsplicing reaction is facilitated by reverse-complementary repetitive sequences promoting pre-mRNA folding. Orthologous genes from which circRNAs arise, overall contain more strongly conserved splice sites and exons than other genes, yet it remains unclear to what extent this conservation reflects purifying selection acting on the circRNAs themselves. Our analyses of circRNA repertoires from five species representing three mammalian lineages (marsupials, eutherians: rodents, primates) reveal that surprisingly few circRNAs arise from orthologous exonic loci across all species. Even the circRNAs from orthologous loci are associated with young, recently active and species-specific transposable elements, rather than with common, ancient transposon integration events. These observations suggest that many circRNAs emerged convergently during evolution – as a byproduct of splicing in orthologs prone to transposon insertion. Overall, our findings argue against widespread functional circRNA conservation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>circRNA</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>mammals</kwd><kwd>splicing</kwd><kwd>transposons</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SIB PhD Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gruhl</surname><given-names>Franziska</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004412</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LT000158/2013-L</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Janich</surname><given-names>Peggy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>242597 (SexGenTransEvolution)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaessmann</surname><given-names>Henrik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>615253 (OntoTransEvol)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaessmann</surname><given-names>Henrik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NCCR RNA &amp; Disease (141735)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gatfield</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NCCR RNA &amp; Disease (182880)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gatfield</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>individual grant 179190</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gatfield</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Evolutionary analyses suggest that most mammalian circRNAs did not emerge from common ancestral circRNA precursors, arguing against widespread functional conservation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>First described more than 40 years ago, circular RNAs (circRNAs) were originally perceived as a curiosity of gene expression, yet they have gained significant prominence over the last decade (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kristensen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Patop et al., 2019</xref>). Large-scale sequencing efforts have led to the identification of thousands of individual circRNAs with specific expression patterns and, in some cases, specific functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Du et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hansen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Piwecka et al., 2017</xref>). CircRNA biogenesis involves so-called ‘backsplicing’, in which an exon’s 3’ splice site is ligated onto an upstream 5’ splice site of an exon on the same RNA molecule (rather than downstream, as in conventional splicing). Backsplicing occurs co-transcriptionally and is guided by the canonical splicing machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashwal-Fluss et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Starke et al., 2015</xref>). It can be facilitated by complementary, repetitive sequences in the flanking introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dubin et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jeck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashwal-Fluss et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liang and Wilusz, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ivanov et al., 2015</xref>). Through intramolecular base-pairing and folding, the resulting hairpin-like structures can augment backsplicing over the competing, regular forward-splicing reaction. Backsplicing seems to be rather inefficient in most cases, as judged by the low circRNA expression levels found in many tissues. For example, it has been estimated that about 60% of circRNAs exhibit expression levels of less than 1 FPKM (fragments per kilobase per million reads mapped) – a commonly applied cut-off below which genes are usually considered to not be robustly expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guo et al., 2014</xref>). Due to their circular structure, circRNAs are protected from the activity of cellular exonucleases, which is thought to favour their accumulation to detectable steady-state levels and, together with the cell’s proliferation history, presumably contributes to their complex spatiotemporal expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alhasan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Memczak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bachmayr-Heyda et al., 2015</xref>). Overall higher circRNA abundances have been reported for neuronal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Westholm et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gruner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rybak-Wolf et al., 2015</xref>) and during ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gruner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cortés-López et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>All eukaryotes (protists, fungi, plants, animals) produce circRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, it has been reported that circRNAs are frequently generated from orthologous genomic regions across species such as mouse, pig, and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rybak-Wolf et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Venø et al., 2015</xref>), and that their splice sites have elevated conservation scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">You et al., 2015</xref>). In these studies, circRNA coordinates were transferred between species to identify ‘conserved’ circRNAs. However, the analyses did not distinguish between potential selective constraints actually acting on the circRNAs themselves, from those preserving canonical splicing features of genes in which they are formed (termed ‘parental genes’ in the following). Moreover, even though long introns containing reverse complement sequences (RVCs) appear to be a conserved feature of circRNA parental genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rybak-Wolf et al., 2015</xref>), the rapid evolutionary changes occurring on the actual repeat sequences present a considerable obstacle to a thorough evolutionary understanding. Finally, concrete examples for experimentally validated, functionally conserved circRNAs are still rather scarce. At least in part, the reason may lie in the difficulty to specifically target circular vs. linear transcript isoforms in loss-of-function experiments; only recently, novel dedicated tools for such experiments have been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2021</xref>). Currently, however, the prevalence of functional circRNA conservation remains overall unclear.</p><p>Here, we set out to investigate the origins and evolution of circRNAs; to this end, we generated a comprehensive set of circRNA-enriched RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from five mammalian species and three organs. Our analyses unveil that circRNAs are typically generated from a distinct class of genes that share characteristic structural and sequence features. Notably, we discovered that circRNAs are flanked by species-specific and recently active transposable elements (TEs). Our findings support a model according to which the integration of TEs is preferred in introns of genes with similar genomic properties, thus facilitating circRNA formation as a byproduct of splicing around the same exons of orthologous genes across different species. Together, our work suggests that most circRNAs – even when occurring in orthologs of multiple species and comprising the same exons – may nevertheless not trace back to common ancestral circRNAs but have rather emerged convergently during evolution, facilitated by independent TE insertion events.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A comprehensive circRNA dataset across five mammalian species</title><p>To explore the origins and evolution of circRNAs, we generated paired-end RNA-seq data for three organs (liver, cerebellum, testis) in five species (grey short-tailed opossum, mouse, rat, rhesus macaque, human) representing three mammalian lineages with different divergence times (marsupials; eutherians: rodents, primates) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). For optimal cross-species comparability, all organ samples originated from young, sexually mature male individuals; we used biological triplicates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), with the exception of human liver (single sample) and rhesus macaque cerebellum (duplicates). From the RNA extracted from each sample, we generated two types of libraries; that is, with and without prior treatment of the RNA with the exoribonuclease RNase R. This strategy allowed us to enrich for circRNAs (in libraries with RNase R treatment) and to calculate the actual enrichment factors (from the ratio with/without RNase R treatment). Using a custom pipeline that took into account RNase R enrichment and other factors to remove likely false-positives and low expression noise (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), we then identified circRNAs from backsplice junction (BSJ) reads, estimated circRNA steady-state abundances, and reconstructed their isoforms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Study design, samples, datasets, and characterisation of circRNA properties and hotspots.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Phylogenetic tree of species analysed in this study and detected circRNAs.

Identified circRNAs were generally small in size, overlapped with protein-coding exons, frequently detectable only in one of the tissues, and were flanked by long introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The identification of circRNA heterogeneity and hotspot frequency is determined by sequencing depth and detection thresholds</title><p>Many genes give rise to multiple, distinct circRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Venø et al., 2015</xref>). Such ‘circRNA hotspots’ are of interest as they may be enriched for genomic features that drive circRNA biogenesis. A previous study defined hotspots as genomic loci that produced at least ten structurally different, yet overlapping circRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Venø et al., 2015</xref>). Reaching a specific number of detectable circRNA species for a given locus (e.g. 10 distinct circRNAs, as in the cited example) is likely strongly dependent on overall sequencing depth and on the CPM (counts per million) detection cut-off that is applied. We therefore compared circRNA hotspots identified at different CPM values (0.1, 0.05, and 0.01 CPM); moreover, to capture in a comprehensive fashion the phenomenon that multiple circRNAs can be generated from a gene, we considered genomic loci already as hotspots if they produced a minimum of two different, overlapping circRNAs at the applied CPM threshold. As expected, the number of hotspots – and the number of individual circRNAs that they give rise to – depend on the chosen CPM threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> for human and rhesus macaque data; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref> for other species). Thus, at 0.1 CPM only 16–27% of all detected circRNA-generating loci are classified as hotspots. Decreasing the stringency to 0.01 CPM increases the proportion of hotspot loci to 32–45%. At the same time, the fraction of circRNAs that originate from hotspots (rather than from non-hotspot loci) increases from 34–49% (0.1 CPM) to 59–76% (0.01 CPM), and the number of circRNAs per hotspot increases from 2 to 6. Together, these analyses show that with lower CPM thresholds, the number of distinct circRNAs that become detectable per locus increases substantially; the number of detectable individual circRNA-generating loci increases as well, yet this effect is overall smaller. Furthermore, we observed that in many cases the same hotspots produces circRNAs across multiple organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), with typically one predominant circRNA expressed per organ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The <italic>Kansl1l</italic> hotspot locus is a representative example: it is a hotspot in rat, where it produces six different circRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

Increasing the sensitivity of detection (i.e. lowering CPM thresholds) led to a substantial gain in the detectability of additional, low-expressed circRNA species, but less so of additional circRNA-generating genomic loci. These findings raised the question whether many of the circRNAs that can be identified reflected a form of gene expression noise that occurred preferentially at hotspot loci, rather than functional transcriptome diversity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>CircRNAs formed in orthologous loci across species preferentially comprise constitutive exons</title><p>We therefore sought to assess the selective preservation – and hence potential functionality – of circRNAs. For each gene, we first collapsed circRNA coordinates to identify the maximal genomic locus from which circRNAs can be produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In total, we annotated 5428 circRNA loci across all species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The majority of loci are species-specific (4103 loci; corresponding to 75.6% of all annotated loci); there are only comparatively few instances where circRNAs arise from orthologous loci in the different species (i.e. from loci that share orthologous exons in corresponding 1:1 orthologous genes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). For example, only 260 orthologous loci (4.8% of all loci) give rise to circRNAs in all five species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). A considerable proportion of these shared loci also correspond to circRNA hotspots (opossum: 28.0%, mouse: 43.6%, rat: 53.0%, rhesus macaque: 46.2%, human: 61.6%; calculated from hotspot counts in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and loci counts in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Thus, despite applying circRNA enrichment strategies for library preparation and lenient thresholds for computational identification, the number of potentially conserved orthologous circRNAs is surprisingly low. At first sight, this outcome is at odds with previous reports of higher circRNA conservation that were, however, frequently based on more restricted cross-species datasets (e.g. comparison human-mouse in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rybak-Wolf et al., 2015</xref>). Further analyses confirmed that also in our datasets, it was the use of additional evolutionary species that drove the strong reduction in potentially conserved circRNA candidates – see for example how the addition of the rat or of rhesus macaque datasets affect the human-mouse comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Evolutionary properties of circRNAs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) CircRNA loci overlap between species.

For example, assigning circRNA orthology simply based on parental gene orthology implies calling also those circRNAs ‘orthologous’ that do not share any orthologous exons, which directly argues against the notion of circRNA homology; that is, a common evolutionary origin (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Depending on the chosen stringency, the number of circRNA loci present in multiple species varies. For example: when considering the parental gene level (shown to the left), all four circRNAs depicted in the hypothetical example of this figure (circRNA-A.1, circRNA-A.2, circRNA-B.1, and circRNA-B.1) are located in the same orthologous locus. In contrast, when looking at the start and stop exons (right), only two circRNAs (circRNA-A.1 and circRNA-B.1) are generated from the same orthologous locus, whereas circRNA-A.2 and circRNA-B.2 - previously classified as ‘orthologous’ – are now found in different loci and labeled as species-specific. Depending on the classification, the number of shared circRNA loci thus differs and may influence the interpretation of results.

To assess whether circRNA exons were distinct from non-circRNA exons in their conservation levels, we calculated phastCons scores for different exon types (circRNA exons, non-circRNA exons, UTR exons). CircRNA exons showed higher phastCons scores than exons from the same genes that were not spliced into circRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This would be the expected outcome if purifying selection acted on functionally conserved circRNAs. However, other mechanisms may be relevant as well; constitutive exons, for example, generally exhibit higher conservation scores than alternative exons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Modrek and Lee, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ermakova et al., 2006</xref>). We thus analysed exon features in more detail. First, the comparison of phastCons scores between exons of non-parental genes, parental genes and circRNAs revealed that parental genes were per se highly conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>): 85–95% of the observed median differences between circRNA exons and non-parental genes could be explained by the parental gene itself. Next, we compared the usage of parental gene exons across organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We observed that circRNA exons are more frequently used in isoforms expressed in multiple organs than non-circRNA parental gene exons. Finally, we analysed the sequence composition at the splice sites, which revealed that GC amplitudes (i.e. the differences in GC content at the intron-exon boundary) are significantly higher for circRNA-internal exons than for parental gene exons that were located outside of circRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, these observations (i.e. increased phastCons scores, expression in multiple tissues, increased GC amplitudes) prompt the question whether the exon properties associated with circRNAs actually reflect at their core an enrichment for constitutive exons. Under this scenario, the supposed high conservation of circRNAs may not be directly associated with the circRNAs themselves, but with constitutive exons that the circRNAs contain. Thus, even many of the circRNAs ‘shared’ across species might actually not be homologous. That is, rather than reflecting (divergent) evolution from common ancestral circRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, left panel), they may frequently have emerged independently (convergently) during evolution in the lineages leading to the different species, thus potentially representing ‘analogous’ transcriptional traits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, right panel).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>CircRNA parental genes are associated with low GC content and high sequence repetitiveness</title><p>To explore whether convergent evolution played a role in the origination of circRNAs, we set out to identify possible structural and/or functional characteristics that may establish a specific genomic environment (a ‘parental gene niche’) that would potentially favour analogous circRNA production.

We realised that the increased GC amplitudes at circRNA exon-intron boundaries (see above, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) were mainly caused by a local decrease of intronic GC content rather than by an increase in exonic GC content (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). We subsequently explored the hypothesis that GC content could serve to discriminate parental from non-parental genes and grouped all genes into five categories from low (L) to high (H) GC content (isochores; L1 &lt;37%, L2 37–42%, H1 42–47%, H2 47–52% and H3 &gt;52% GC content) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

We used parental vs. non-parental gene as the response variable of the model, and several plausible explanatory variables. These were: GC content; exon and transcript counts; genomic length; number of repeat fragments in sense/antisense; expression level; phastCons score; tissue specificity index. After training the model on a data subset (80%), circRNA parental gene predictions were carried out on the remainder of the dataset (20%) (see Materials and methods). Notably, predictions occurred with high precision (accuracy 72–79%, sensitivity of 75%, specificity 71–79% across all species) and uncovered several significantly associated features (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Consistently for all species, the main parental gene predictors are low GC content (log-odds ratio -1.84 to -0.72) and increased number of exons in the gene (log-odds ratio 0.30 to 0.45). Furthermore, features positively associated with circRNA production are increased genomic length (log-odds ratio 0.17 to 0.26), increased proportion of reverse-complementary areas (repeat fragments) within the gene (log-odds ratio 0.20 to 0.59), increased expression levels (log-odds ratio 0.25 to 0.38) and higher phastCons scores (log-odds ratio 0.45 to 0.58) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>).

We therefore asked whether among the features that our regression analysis identified for parental genes, some would be suitable to further distinguish hotspots. First, we assessed whether hotspots were more likely to be shared between species than parental genes that produced only a single circRNA isoform. The applied regression model indeed detected a positive correlation between the probability of a parental gene being a hotspot and having orthologous parental genes across multiple species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>); moreover, log-odds ratios increased with the distance and number of species across which the hotspot was shared (e.g. mouse: 0.29 for shared within rodents, 0.67 for shared with eutherian species and 0.72 for shared within therian species). We next interrogated whether any particular feature would be able to specify circRNA hotspots among parental genes. A single factor, low GC content, emerged as a consistent predictor for circRNA hotspots among all circRNA-generating loci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>). As expected, the predictive power was lower than that of the previous models, which were designed to discriminate parental vs. non-parental genes and which had identified low GC content as well. These findings imply that hotspots emerge across species in orthologous loci that offer similarly favourable conditions for circRNA formation, most importantly low GC content. The increased number of circRNAs that become detectable when CPM thresholds are lowered (see above, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) is also in agreement with the sporadic formation of different circRNAs whenever genomic circumstances allow for it. Overall, our observations suggest that differences between hotspot and non-hotspot loci, or between high and low abundance circRNAs, are quantitative rather than qualitative in nature. Thus, the comparison of high vs. low expression circRNAs (based on 90% expression quantile; below = low, above = high expression) indicated the same set of properties, albeit amplified, in the highly expressed circRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp9">Supplementary file 9</xref>). Parental genes of highly expressed circRNAs in opossum, rhesus macaque and human yielded higher prediction values in our generalised linear model, which was consistently driven by low GC content (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp9">Supplementary file 9</xref>). High expression circRNAs were also more likely to be expressed in all three tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5A</xref>) and to originate from a hotspot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5B</xref>), and they were more often shared across multiple species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp10">Supplementary file 10</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, our analyses thus reveal that circRNA parental genes are characterised by a set of distinct features: low GC content, increased genomic length and number of exons, higher expression levels and increased phastCons scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). These features were detected independently across species, suggesting the presence of a unique, syntenic genomic niche in which circRNAs can be produced (‘circRNA niche’). While helpful to understand the genomic context of circRNA production, these findings do not yet allow us to distinguish between the two alternative models of divergent and convergent circRNA evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). To elucidate the evolutionary trajectory and timeline underlying the emergence of the circRNAs, we sought to scrutinize the identified feature ‘complementarity and repetitiveness’ of the circRNA niche. Previous studies have associated repetitiveness with an over-representation of small TEs – such as primate Alu elements or the murine B1 elements – in circRNA-flanking introns; these TEs may facilitate circRNA formation by providing RVCs that are the basis for intramolecular base-pairing of nascent RNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ivanov et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jeck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wilusz, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liang and Wilusz, 2014</xref>). Interestingly, while the biogenesis of human circRNAs has so far been mainly associated with the primate-specific (i.e. evolutionarily young) Alu elements, a recent study has highlighted several circRNAs that rely on the presence of the more ancient, mammalian MIR elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yoshimoto et al., 2020</xref>). A comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary age of TEs in circRNA-flanking introns could thus provide important insights into the modes of circRNA emergence: the presence of common (i.e. old) repeats would point towards divergent evolution of circRNAs from a common circRNA ancestor, whereas an over-representation of species-specific (i.e. recent) repeats would support the notion of convergent circRNA evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>CircRNA flanking introns are enriched in species-specific TEs</title><p>Using our cross-species datasets, we investigated the properties and composition of the repeat landscape relevant for circRNA biogenesis – features that have remained poorly characterised so far. As a first step, we generated for each species a background set of ‘control introns’ from non-circRNA genes that were matched to the circRNA flanking introns in terms of length distribution and GC content. We then compared the abundance of different repeat families within the two intron groups. In all species, TEs belonging to the class of Short Interspersed Nuclear Elements (SINEs) are enriched within the circRNA flanking introns as compared to the control introns. Remarkably, the resulting TE enrichment profiles were exquisitely lineage-specific, and even largely species-specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In mouse, for instance, the order of enrichment is from the B1 class of rodent-specific B elements (strongest enrichment and highest frequency of &gt;7.5 TEs per flanking intron) to B2 and B4 SINEs. In rat, B1 (strong enrichment, yet less frequent than in mouse) is followed by ID (Identifier) elements, which are a family of small TEs characterised by a recent, strong amplification history in the rat lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim and Deininger, 1996</xref>); B2 and B4 SINEs only followed in 3rd and 4th position. In rhesus macaque and human, Alu elements are the most frequent and strongly enriched TEs (around 14 TEs per intron), consistent with the known strong amplification history in the common primate ancestor (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Batzer and Deininger, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Pre-mRNA folding into a hairpin with a paired stem (formed by the flanking introns via the dimerised RVCs) and an unpaired loop region (carrying the future circRNA) leads to a configuration that brings backsplice donor and acceptor sites into close proximity, thus facilitating circRNA formation. In order to serve as efficient RVCs via this mechanism, TEs likely need to fulfil certain criteria. Thus, the dimerisation potential is expected to depend on TE identity, frequency, and position. In the simplest case, two integration events involving the same TE (in reverse orientation) will lead to an extended RVC stretch. Yet also different transposons belonging to the same TE family will show a certain degree of sequence similarity that depends on their phylogenetic distance; sequence differences that have evolved are likely to compromise the base-pairing potential. To account for such effects, we sought to calculate the actual binding energies for RVC interactions and combine this analysis with phylogenetic distance information, thus potentially allowing us to detect the most likely drivers of circRNA formation, as well as their evolutionary age.</p><p>Our analyses revealed that relatively few specific dimers represented the majority of all predicted dimers (i.e. top-5 dimers accounted for 78% of all dimers in flanking introns in opossum, and for 50%, 55%, 43%, and 38% in mouse, rat, rhesus macaque and human, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Given the high abundance of young, still active transposons in the respective genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), we suspected that simply basing our further analyses of dimerisation potential on phylogenetic distance between different TEs would not provide sufficient resolution. Indeed, as shown for mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–D</xref>), phylogenetic age separates large subgroups, but not TEs of the same family whose sequences have diverged by relatively few nucleotides. By contrast, classification by binding affinities creates more precise, smaller subgroups that lack, however, the information on phylogenetic age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Therefore, we combined both age and binding affinity information into an overall ‘pairing score’ (see Materials and methods). Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that this measure efficiently separated different TE families and individual family members, with PC1 and PC2 explaining approximately 76% of observed variance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Importantly, this analysis suggests that the most frequently occurring dimers (top-5 dimers are depicted with blue connecting lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) are formed by recently active TE family members. In mouse, an illustrative example are the dimers formed by the B1_Mm, B1_Mus1, and B1_Mus2 elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), which are among the most recent (and still active) TEs in this species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Across species, our analyses allowed for the same conclusions. For example, the dominant dimers in rat were the recently amplified ID elements, and not the more abundant (yet older in their amplification history) B1 family of TEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim and Deininger, 1996</xref>). In opossum, the most prominent dimers consisted of opossum-specific SINE1 elements, which are similar to the Alu elements in primates, but possess an independent origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gu et al., 2007</xref>). Finally, within the primate lineage, the dimer composition was more uniform, probably due to the high amplification rate of the AluS subfamily (&gt;650000 copies) in the common ancestor of Old World monkeys and the relatively recent divergence time of macaque and human (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deininger, 2011</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, the above analyses of RVCs revealed that dimer-forming sequences in circRNA flanking introns were most frequently composed of recent, and often currently still active, TEs. Therefore, the dimer repertoires were specific to the lineages (marsupials, rodents, primates) and/or (as most clearly visible within the rodent lineage) even species-specific.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Flanking introns of shared circRNA loci are enriched in evolutionarily young TEs</title><p>We next compared the dimer composition of introns from shared vs. species-specific circRNA loci. We reasoned that in the case of shared circRNA loci that have evolved from a common, ancestral circRNA, we would detect evidence for evolutionarily older TE integration events and shared dimers as compared to species-specific, younger circRNA loci. For our analysis, we took into account the frequency, enrichment, and age of the TEs and, moreover, their degradation rate (milliDiv; see below) and the minimal free energy (MFE) of the dimer structure.</p><p>First, we analysed the dimer composition of flanking introns in shared and species-specific circRNA loci. We extracted the top-100 most and least frequent dimers of all circRNA loci, and compared their enrichment factors and mean age (categorised for simplicity into four groups: 1 = species-specific, 2 = lineage-specific, 3 = eutherian, 4 = therian) across the two groups of parental genes (shared and species-specific). The analysis revealed that the most frequent dimers are consistently formed by the youngest elements in both groups of genes, and that the frequency distribution of the top-100 dimers was significantly different between species (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> for rat and human; other species in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). In rat, for instance, all top-5 dimers are composed of repeats from the youngest ID family members; in human, dimers involving AluY elements are strongly enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). On average, most dimers occur at least once or twice per shared circRNA gene, corresponding to a 1.4- to 2.1-fold enrichment in comparison to species-specific circRNA loci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp11">Supplementary file 11</xref>). Conceivably, the multiple resulting dimerisation possibilities could act cumulatively to position circRNA exons for backsplicing. Furthermore, we observed that many RVCs overlapped each other, so that one repeat in one RVC could dimerise with different repeats in multiple other RVCs. Due to the increased frequency of young repeat elements in shared circRNA loci, these ‘co-pairing possibilities’ further increase the number of possible dimers that can be formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Continuously attracting new transposons could contribute to the mechanism that sustains backsplicing and underlies reproducible circRNA expression levels. Moreover, through the recurring addition of new functional repeats, new dimerisation potential would be generated that could make older TEs redundant and allow them to rapidly degrade, thus explaining why ancient TE integration events are no longer detectable. If a circRNA is functionally important for the organism, especially the young, dimerisation-competent repeats may evolve under purifying selection and maintain their pairing ability. We therefore reasoned that low degradation rates in young dimers of shared circRNA loci could hint at functionality. We followed up this idea by analysing the degradation rates of repeats based on their milliDiv values. Briefly, the RepeatMasker annotations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Smit et al., 2013</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://repeatmasker.org">http://repeatmasker.org</ext-link>; see Materials and methods) provide a quantification of how many ‘base mismatches in parts per thousand’ have occurred between each specific repeat copy in its genomic context and the repeat reference sequence. This deviation from the consensus sequence is expressed as the milliDiv value. Thus, a high milliDiv value implies that a repeat is strongly degraded, typically due to its age (the older the repeat, the more time its sequence has had to diverge). Low milliDiv values suggest that the repeat is younger (i.e. it had less time to accumulate mutations) or that purifying selection prevented the accumulation of mutations.</p><p>Following this rationale, we determined in each species the degradation rates for the repeats forming the top-5 dimers. Comparing their milliDiv values species-specific parental genes revealed no significant differences in any of the species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> – left panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref> – left panel). Because degradation rates alone may not fully capture the actual decline in pairing strength within a dimer (e.g. compensatory changes and dimer length are not/poorly accounted for), we further analysed actual binding energies. To this end, we selected the least-degraded dimer for every parental gene in both groups (shared/species-specific) and calculated the minimal free energies (MFEs) of dimer formation. We detected no difference between the groups, suggesting that dimers of shared circRNA loci are not subject to a specific selection pressure, but degrade identically to dimers in species-specific circRNA loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> – right panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref> – right panel). Furthermore, we observed that dimers comprising ‘intermediate age’ repeats (i.e. B1_Mur2, B1_Mur3, B1_Mur4, present in Muridae) could be found in the species-specific ‘least-degraded’ dimers, yet they were absent from the shared group, which rather contained the top-1/top-2 most enriched and youngest dimers (e.g. AluSx+AluY and AluSx1+AluY in human <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>; ID_Rn1+ID_Rn1 and ID_Rn1+ID_Rn2 in rat) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3C</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, we conclude that circRNAs are preferentially formed from loci that have attracted transposons in recent evolutionary history. Even in the case of shared circRNA loci the actual repeat landscapes, dimer predictions, transposon ages and degradation rates, as well as RVC pairing energies, are most consistent with the model that circRNAs are analogous features that have been formed by convergent evolution, rather than homologous features originating from a common circRNA ancestor.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Different mechanistic scenarios to explain the origins and evolution of circRNAs have been considered in the field (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Patop et al., 2019</xref>). In our study, we have investigated this topic through the analysis of novel, dedicated cross-species datasets. Notably, we propose that many circRNAs have not evolved from common, ancestral circRNA loci, but have emerged independently through convergent evolution, most likely driven by structural commonalities of their parental genes. Thus, the modelling of parental genes uncovered features that are associated with circRNA biogenesis, in support of the concept of a ‘circRNA niche’ in which circRNAs are more likely to be generated: genetic loci giving rise to circRNAs are generally long, exon-rich and located in genomic regions of low GC content. In the case of orthologous parental genes, these structural characteristics are shared as well, and they have led to shared integration biases for transposons, that is to shared, genomic ‘TE hotspots’.</p><p>It is well established that intronic TE insertions are critical for circRNA biogenesis as they provide reverse-complementary sequences for intramolecular pre-mRNA folding via TE dimers, giving rise to the secondary structures that facilitate productive backsplicing. Important new insights that our study provides on circRNA evolution come from the deep analysis of the transposon landscapes, including the TE identities, their ages, degradation rates and dimerisation potentials. Thus, because the actual TEs predicted as most relevant for dimerisation are mostly not shared across species and are evolutionarily young, we propose that the resulting circRNAs are evolutionarily young as well. In line with this interpretation, circRNAs from orthologous genes frequently do not involve exactly the same 5' and 3' backsplice sites and thus do not encompass precisely the same orthologous exons, but show partial exon overlap across species (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These findings all argue for a model of convergent evolution at shared circRNA loci, with circRNAs and TEs co-evolving in a species-specific and dynamic manner.</p><p>Our model provides an explanation for how circRNAs can arise from orthologous exonic loci across species even if they themselves are not homologous (i.e. they do not stem from common evolutionary precursors that emerged in common ancestors). Importantly, if most circRNAs are evolutionarily young, then, by extension, it is overall rather unlikely that they fulfil crucial functions. This idea is in agreement with the generally low expression levels of circRNAs that have been reported and with accumulation patterns that are frequently tissue-specific and confined to post-mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Westholm et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, these and other main conclusions of our study overlap with those of two independent manuscripts (with complementary data and analyses) that have appeared in press (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xu and Zhang, 2021</xref>) and as a publication preprint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Santos-Rodriguez et al., 2021</xref>), respectively, while we were preparing the revised version of our manuscript.</p><p>Why is it frequently the same (orthologous) genes that produce circRNAs, and why do the circRNA hotspots often overlap between species, that is they share common exons? A plausible explanation lies in how TE integration is tolerated. Briefly, intronic TE integration in the vicinity of an intron-exon boundary will likely alter local GC content. For example, GC-rich SINE elements integrating close to a splice site would locally increase intronic GC and thereby decrease the GC amplitude at the intron-exon boundary. Especially in GC-low environments, this can interfere with the intron-defined mechanism of splicing and cause mis-splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amit et al., 2012</xref>). By contrast, TE integration close to a very strong splice site with a strong GC amplitude – as typically found in canonical exons – would have lower impact. Hence, it would be tolerated better than integration close to alternative exons, whose GC amplitudes are less pronounced. Indeed, our analyses show that circRNA exons are typically canonical exons with strong GC amplitudes. While at first sight, circRNA exons thus appear to be endowed with rather specific, evolutionarily relevant properties – most notably with increased phastCons scores – it is probable that these are a mere consequence of a higher tolerance for TE integration in introns flanking canonical exons.</p><p>Many additional characteristics associated with circRNAs – identified in this study or previously by others – can be linked to how the impact of TEs on splicing and transcript integrity is likely to be tolerated. Depending on the site of TE integration, potentially hazardous ‘transcript noise’ will arise, and these instances will be subject to purifying selection. In particular, TE integration into exons (changing the coding sequence) or directly into splice sites (affecting splicing patterns) will lead to erroneous transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, the probability that an integration event is tolerated, will be overall lower in short and compact genes as compared to genes with long introns; of note, long genes are also GC-poor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhu et al., 2009</xref>). These characteristics overlap precisely with those that we identify for circRNAs, which are also frequently generated from GC-poor genes with long introns, complex gene structures, and that contain many TEs.</p><p>An interesting feature – not analysed in our study, but previously associated with circRNAs – is RNA editing. In particular, introns bracketing circRNAs are enriched in A-to-I RNA editing events, and the RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1 has been reported as a specific regulator of circRNA expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ivanov et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rybak-Wolf et al., 2015</xref>). However, A-to-I editing is also a well-known defense mechanism that has evolved to suppress TE amplification. For example, A-to-I RNA editing is associated with intronic Alu elements to inhibit Alu dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lev-Maor et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Athanasiadis et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, it is quite likely that associations between RNA editing and circRNA abundances are a secondary effect from the primary purpose of A-to-I editing, namely the inhibition of Alu amplification. A similar case can be made for DNA methylation that interferes with TE amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yoder et al., 1997</xref>) and has been linked to circRNA production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Enuka et al., 2016</xref>). Or, in the case of <italic>N<sup>6</sup></italic>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A), it has recently been proposed that this highly prevalent RNA modification is also involved in dynamically regulating circRNA abundances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Park et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Di Timoteo et al., 2020</xref>). Yet the link of circRNAs to m<sup>6</sup>A, which is known to influence many steps of mRNA metabolism (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zaccara et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2020</xref>), may simply reflect the general targeting of erroneous transcripts for degradation.</p><p>In summary, our evolutionary data and the above considerations lead us to conclude that many circRNAs are likely a form of transcript noise – or, more precisely, of mis-splicing – that is provoked by TE integration into parental genes. This conclusion is in full agreement with the observation that in rat neurons, there is a direct correspondence between the pharmacological inhibition of canonical splicing and increased circRNA formation, preferentially affecting circRNAs with long introns and many transposons/RVCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Altogether, these conclusions make it likely that the majority of circRNAs do not have specific molecular functions, although functional circRNAs have arisen during evolution, as demonstrated in several studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hansen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Du et al., 2016</xref>), presumably from initially non-functional (noise) variants whose emergence was facilitated by the aforementioned mechanisms. During this process, a functional circRNA may ultimately even become independent from the original RVC-based regulation. Evolving from a sequence-based backsplice mechanism to a protein-based one (i.e. relying on RNA-binding proteins, RBPs) could render regulation more versatile and more controllable. Indeed, RBPs have emerged as important regulators of several circRNAs (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashwal-Fluss et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Okholm et al., 2020</xref>). The functions of circRNAs seem to be diverse and may often involve the positive or negative regulation of their own parental genes at different expression layers (transcription/splicing, translation, post-translational modification) through various mechanisms (e.g. competition with linear mRNA splicing, microRNA sponge effects, mRNA traps) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shao et al., 2021</xref>). For several of these functional roles, the exact exons/exon portions that form the circRNA, or which elements in the flanking introns drive the process, may not be important, but rather the general maintenance of circularization at a locus during evolution. In this way, diverting mRNA output to non-functional, dead-end circular transcripts could for example represent a mechanism to limit parental gene expression or to control genes that have transformed into transposon sinks.</p><p>Finally, we would like to note that circRNAs have emerged as reliable disease biomarkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Memczak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bahn et al., 2015</xref>), and their utility for such predictive purposes is not diminished by our conclusion that most circRNAs are unlikely to fulfil direct functions – on the contrary. Even if an altered circRNA profile will likely not indicate causal involvement in a disease, it could hint at misregulated transcription or splicing of the parental gene, at a novel TE integration event, or at problems with RNA editing or methylation machineries. The careful analysis of the circRNA landscape may thus teach us about factors contributing to diseases in a causal fashion even if many or perhaps most circRNAs may not be functional but rather represent transcript noise.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Data deposition, programmes, and working environment</title><p>The raw data and processed data files discussed in this publication have been deposited in NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Edgar et al., 2002</xref>) and are accessible through the GEO Series accession number GSE162152.

Anchors are remapped with bowtie2 on the reference genome. Mapped anchor pairs are filtered for (1) being on the same chromosome, (2) being on the same strand and (3) for having a genomic mapping distance to each other of a maximum of 100 kb. Next, anchors are extended upstream and downstream of their mapping locus. They are kept if pairs are extendable to the full read length. During this procedure, a maximum of two mismatches is allowed. For paired-end sequencing reads, the mate read not mapping to the backsplice junction can often be mapped to the reference genome without any problem. However, it will be classified as ‘unmapped read’ (because its mate read mapping to the backsplice junction was not identified by the standard procedure). Next, all unpaired reads are thus selected from the accepted_hits.bam file generated by TopHat2 (singletons) and assessed for whether the mate read (second read of the paired-end sequencing read) of the anchor pair mapped between the backsplice coordinates. All anchor pairs for which (1) the mate did not map between the genomic backsplice coordinates, (2) the mate mapped to another backsplice junction or (3) the extension procedure could not reveal a clear breakpoint are removed. Based on the remaining candidates, a backsplice index is built with bowtie2 and all reads are remapped on this index to increase the read coverage by detecting reads that cover the BSJ with less than 20 bp, but at least 8 bp. Candidate reads that were used to build the backsplice index and now mapped to another backsplice junction are removed. Upon this procedure, the pipeline provides a first list of backsplice junctions. The set of scripts, which performs the identification of putative BSJs, as well as a short description of how to run the pipeline are deposited in the Git Repository ncSplice_circRNAdetection (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Frenzchen/ncSplice_circRNAdetection">https://github.com/Frenzchen/ncSplice_circRNAdetection</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gruhl, 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-3"><title>Trimming of overlapping reads</title><p>Due to small DNA repeats, some reads are extendable to more than the original read length.

The trimming is part of our custom pipeline described above, and the step will be performed automatically if the scripts are run.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-4"><title>Generation of high confidence circRNA candidates from the comparison of RNase R-treated vs. -untreated samples</title><p>The detection of circRNAs relies on the identification of BSJs. These are, however, often only covered by a low number of reads, which carries considerable risk of mistaking biological or technical noise for a real circRNA event. Their circular structure makes circRNAs resistant to RNase R treatment – a feature that is not generally expected for spurious RNA molecules that are linear but may nevertheless resemble BSJs. We therefore compared BSJs between RNase R-treated and -untreated samples and determined whether BSJs detected in an untreated sample are enriched in the RNase R-treated sample. To generate a high-confidence dataset of circRNA candidates from the comparison of untreated and treated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), we applied the following filtering steps (please also consult <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> for a step-by-step description of filtering outcomes, using the mouse samples as an example.)</p><p>Filtering step 1 - mapping consistency of read pairs. When mapping paired-end sequencing data, both reads should ideally map to the genome (paired-end = ‘pe’). However, in some cases, one of the mate reads cannot be mapped due to the complexity of the genomic locus. These reads are reported as ‘singletons’ (‘se’). For each potential BSJ, we thus analysed the mapping behaviour of both read mates. BSJs for which read pairs in the untreated and RNase R-treated sample of the same biological replicate mapped both either in ‘pe’ or ‘se’ mode were kept; BSJs for which for example a read pair mapped in ‘pe’ mode in the untreated biological sample, but in ‘se’ mode in the RNase R-treated sample of the same biological replicate (and vise versa) were considered weak candidates and removed. This filtering step removed approximately 1% of the total, unique BSJs detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><p>Filtering step 2 - presence of a BSJ in untreated samples. We hypothesized that for circRNAs to be functionally important, they should generally be expressed at levels that are high enough to make them detectable in the normal samples, that is without RNase R treatment. We thus removed all BSJs which were only present in RNase R-treated samples, but undetectable in any of the untreated, biological replicates (cut-off for absence/presence = minimum one read mapping to BSJ). This filtering step removed approximately 75% of the initially detected BSJs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><p>Filtering step 3 - enrichment after RNase R treatment. RNase R treatment leads to the enrichment of BSJs in the total number of detected junctions due to the preferential degradation of linear RNAs. To calculate the enrichment factor, BSJs were normalised by the size factor (as described in Materials and methods, section <italic>Reconstruction of circRNA isoforms</italic>) of each sample and the mean normalised count was calculated for each condition (untreated and RNase R-treated). Next, the log2-enrichment for RNase R-treated vs. -untreated samples was calculated. All BSJs for which the log2-enrichment was below 1.5 were removed. This filtering step removed another 15% of the originally detected unique BSJs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><p>Filtering step 4 - minimum expression levels.

We then compared read coverage for junctions outside and inside the BSJ for each gene and used the log2-change of junctions outside the backsplice junction to construct the expected background distribution of change in junction coverage upon RNase R treatment. The observed coverage change of junctions inside the backsplice was then compared to the expected change in the background distribution and junctions with a log2-change outside the 90% confidence interval were assigned as circRNA junctions; a loose cut-off was chosen, because involved junctions can show a decrease in coverage if their linear isoform was present at high levels before (degradation levels of linear isoforms do not correlate with the enrichment levels of circRNAs). Next, we reconstructed a splicing graph for each circRNA candidate, in which network nodes are exons connected by splice junctions (edges) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Heber et al., 2002</xref>). Connections between nodes are weighted by the coverage in the RNase R-treated samples. The resulting network graph is directed (because of the known circRNA start and stop coordinates), acyclic (because splicing always proceeds in one direction), weighted and relatively small. We used a simple breadth-first-search algorithm to traverse the graph and to define the strength for each possible isoform by its mean coverage. Only the strongest isoform was considered for all subsequent analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-7"><title>Reconstruction and expression quantification of linear mRNAs</title><p>We reconstructed linear isoforms based on the pipeline provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Trapnell et al., 2012</xref> (Cufflinks + Cuffcompare + Cuffnorm).

Overall considerations of this kind have recently also been outlined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Patop et al., 2019</xref>.</p><p>Level 1 - Parental genes: One-to-one (1:1) therian orthologous genes were defined between opossum, mouse, rat, rhesus macaque and human using the Ensembl orthology annotation (confidence intervals 0 and 1, restricted to clear one-to-one orthologs). The same procedure was performed to retrieve the 1:1 orthologous genes for the eutherians (mouse, rat, rhesus macaque, human), for rodents (mouse, rat), and primates (rhesus macaque, human). Shared circRNA loci between species were assessed by counting the number of 1:1 orthologous parental genes between the five species. The analysis was restricted to protein-coding genes.</p><p>Level 2 - circRNA locus: To identify shared circRNA loci, all circRNA exon coordinates from a given gene were collapsed into a single transcript using the <italic>bedtools merge</italic> option from the BEDTools toolset with default options. Next, we used liftOver to compare exons from the collapsed transcript between species. The minimal ratio of bases that need to overlap for each exon was set to 0.5 (<italic>-minMatch=0.5</italic>). Collapsed transcripts were defined as overlapping between different species if they shared at least one exon, independent of the exon length.</p><p>Level 3 - start/stop exon: To identify circRNAs sharing the same first and last exon between species, we lifted exons coordinates between species (same settings as described above, <italic>liftOver, -minMatch=0.5</italic>). The circRNA was then defined as ‘shared’, if both exons were annotated as start and stop exons in the respective circRNAs of the given species. Note, that this definition only requires an overlap for start and stop exons, internal circRNA exons may differ.</p><p>Given that only circRNAs that comprise corresponding (1:1 orthologous exons) in different species might at least potentially and reasonably considered to be homologous (i.e. might have originated from evolutionary precursors in common ancestors) and the Level 3 definition might require strong evolutionary conservation of splice sites (i.e. with this stringent definition many shared loci may be missed), we decided to use the level 2 definition (circRNA locus) for the analyses presented in the main text, while we still provide the results for the Level 1 and 3 definitions in the supplement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Importantly, defining shared circRNA loci at this level allows us to also compare circRNA hostspots which have been defined using a similar classification strategy.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>Clustering of circRNA loci between species</title><p>Based on the species set in which shared circRNA loci were found, we categorised circRNAs in the following groups: species-specific, rodent, primate, eutherian, and therian circRNAs. To be part of the rodent or primate group, the circRNA has to be expressed in both species of the lineage. To be part of the eutherian group, the circRNA has to be expressed in three species out of the four species mouse, rat, rhesus macaque and human. To be part of the therian group, the circRNA needs to be expressed in opossum and in three out of the four other species. Species-specific circRNAs are either present in one species or do not match any of the other four categories. The usage of multiple species for defining shared loci, allowed to define ‘mammalian circRNAs’ with high confidence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To define the different groups, we used the cluster algorithm MCL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Enright et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dongen, 2000</xref>). MCL is frequently used to reconstruct orthology clusters based on blast results. It requires input in <italic>abc</italic> format (file: <italic>species.abc</italic>), in which <italic>a</italic> corresponds to event a, <italic>b</italic> to event b and a numeric value <italic>c</italic> that provides information on the connection strength between event a and b (e.g. blast p-value). If no p-values are available as in this analysis, the connection strength can be set to 1.

Exons were further classified into UTR-exons and non-UTR exons using the ensembl field ‘feature = exon’ or ‘feature = UTR’. Since conservation scores are generally lower for UTR-exons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pollard et al., 2010</xref>), any exon labelled as UTR-exon was removed from further analyses to avoid bias when comparing circRNA and non-circRNA exons. Genomic coordinates of the remaining exons were collapsed using the <italic>merge</italic> command from the BEDtools toolset (<italic>bedtools merge input_file -nms -scores collapse</italic>) to obtain a list of unique genomic loci. PhastCons scores for all exon types were calculated using the conservation scores provided by the UCSC genome browser (mouse: phastCons scores based on alignment for 60 placental genomes; rat: phastCons scores based on alignment for 13 vertebrate genomes; human: phastCons scores based on alignment for 99 vertebrate genomes). For each gene type (parental or non-parental), the median phastCons score was calculated for each exon type within the gene (if non-parental: median of all exons; if parental: median of exons contained in the circRNA and median of exons outside of the circRNA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-4"><title>Tissue specificity of exon types</title><p>Using the DEXseq package (from HTSeq 0.6.1), reads mapping on coding exons of the parental genes were counted.

For rhesus macaque, the repeat annotation was only available for the rheMac3 genome. RVC coordinates were thus lifted from rheMac2 to rheMac3 (<italic>liftOver, -minMatch=0.5</italic>), which led to a significant drop of overlapping repeats and RVCs in comparison to the other species (only ~20% of RVCs could be intersected with an annotated repeat).

conserved occurrence of circRNAs across species is the indirect consequence of convergent insertion of different, species-specific transposable elements and therefore possibly the by-product of independent, recent transposon insertions, rather than the product of natural selection acting on conserved functions of circRNAs. Thus, the paper offers a novel perspective for considering circRNAgenesis and evolution and is relevant to the question of whether most circRNAs have active functions or are by-products of transcriptional noise.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Circular RNA repertoires are associated with evolutionarily young transposable elements&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Juan Valcárcel as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary</p><p>Gruhl et al., sequenced thousands of circular (RNase R-resistant) RNAs from 3 organs in 5 different species and carried out detailed analyses of the genomic loci involved in the generation of these transcripts, whose heterogeneity increases with sequence coverage, suggesting substantial noise, but limited conservation across species. They identify loci with high circRNA production (hotspots), which are enriched in conserved circRNAs, and features associated with them, including GC amplitudes and content, genomic length and exon number, expression in multiple tissues, conservation scores and sequence repetitiveness in the introns flanking exons undergoing circularization by back-splicing. The authors link the latter to enrichment in repetitive transposable elements (TEs) and the detailed characterization of these TEs in different species leads the authors to propose that conservation in circRNA production across species is the result of convergent evolution through independent insertion of evolutionarily young, species-specific TEs in the introns flanking the circularized exons.</p><p>This study tackles an interesting and timely topic, namely the extent to which circRNAs perform biological functions or are rather byproducts of transcriptional noise. While previous publications have linked circRNA biogenesis to transposable elements located in flanking introns, even in evolutionary terms (e.g. Ivanov et al., Cell Rep 2015, PMID: 25558066; Dong et al., RNA Biol 2017, PMID: 27982734; and Ji et al., Cell Rep 2019, PMID: 30893614), the manuscript provides novel perspectives on the evolutionary origin of circRNAs and can have general implications for understanding their biosynthesis and function.</p><p>While the authors build a convincing argument using the data they have generated, the number of circRNAs analyzed remain a small fraction of currently annotated circRNA datasets, which raises the question of how general is the model put forward by the authors. A second, complementary question is whether the model applies to highly abundant circRNAs -which may be the subset more enriched in functional circRNAs.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The authors collected three organs from five species for RNA sequencing to annotate circRNAs for their subsequent analysis, and obtained about 4,500 circRNAs in human and much fewer in other four species. However, significantly more circRNAs have been previously reported. for example, in some publicly-available circRNA databases, such as circAtlas (Wu et al., Genome Biol 2020, PMID: 32345360), circBase (Glažar et al., RNA 2014, PMID: 25234927), CIRCpedia (Zhang et al., Genome Res 2016, PMID: 27365365), more than 400,000 circRNAs are annotated from human samples. Very recently, two publications by using third generation sequencing technologies further confirmed a large number of circRNAs in human (including Xin et al., Nat Commun 2021, PMID: 33436621 and Zhang et al., Nat Biotechnol 2021, PMID: 33707777). It is not clear why the authors only used their own circRNA annotation for the current study, as this might lead to a significant bias in the downstream analysis (e.g. affecting the parental genes of circRNAs to be compared to genes that do not generate circRNAs).</p><p>2. A complementary question is whether the model put forward by the authors applies to highly abundant circRNAs, which are likely to be enriched in functional circRNAs, as the sense in the field is that only highly abundant circRNAs -particularly in the nervous system- might be functional. Can the authors partition their assessment of conservation for the different quantiles of expression? It is indeed possible that only circRNAs in the top quantile of expression will provide insights into the potential functional importance of circRNAs. The authors could also take the opposite approach: for those few circRNAs for which some functionality has been proven, are the pattern of evolution and elements flanking the circularizable exons similar to the ones they describe generally?</p><p>3. The authors identified circRNAs using RNAseR-treated samples. While RNAseR enriches generally for circRNAs, the authors don't have data reporting the abundance of the circRNAs in mock treated samples. Without a mock control is impossible for the authors to determine the actual resistance to the degradation by the exonuclease and hence determine which potential backsplicing junctions are really coming from circular molecules. The authors could do at least for some of the tissues/species show that the circRNAs they identified have been previously shown to be real (e.g., by a canonical comparison mock vs RNAseR treated samples).</p><p>4. For the analysis of enriched TEs of flanking introns of circRNAs or circRNAs shared across species, except the ages of TEs, other factors should be also included in these analyses. For example, whether pairing abilities of RVCs alone can explain the phenomenon? Whether the number of RVCs in the flanking introns is related to the conserved or species specific circRNAs? In addition, In this case, the general conclusion about circRNA biogenesis and TE insertion events can be biased.</p><p>Suggested text revisions:</p><p>a. The discussion should further elaborate the concept that at least for some circRNAs, their main functionality is to regulate/limit the expression of the host gene, hence the exact exons that form circRNAs might not be important. Therefore it would not so important which exon in particular makes the cirRNA or even which elements in the flanking introns are driving this process but rather the existence of this during evolution. This is relevant especially for those circRNAs for which the circular molecules are abundant in comparison with the linear mRNAs generated from the locus and there are at least some cases in the literature in which has been shown that production of the circRNA comes at the expense of the linear transcript.</p><p>b. Discuss the evolutionary implications of the observation that circRNAs in fruitfly is not driven by intronic pairing of repetitive/transposable elements (Westholm, et al., Cell Rep 2014, PMID: 25544350).</p><p>c. On page 6, the authors stated &quot;Coding genes in rhesus macaque and human are characterised by a bimodal GC content distribution&quot;. The H3 category contains all genes with GC content &gt; 52% while L2 category contains genes with 37-42% GC contents (Figure 3A). It is not correct to define it as bimodal GC content distribution when the group standard has a large difference.</p><p>d. More data are needed to sustain the statement &quot;circRNA parental genes are characterised by low GC content and high sequence repetitiveness&quot;. Low GC content and high sequence repetitiveness may be the consequences of the long intron length of parental genes and/or the enrichment of repeat elements in long introns. More stringent conditions, like comparable intron lengths between circRNA and non-circRNA parent genes would need to be set up for this type of comparison.<italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I would recommend the authors to consider the following revisions:</p><p>1. There seems to be some contradiction between the argument that circRNAs tend to be generated from constitutive, widely expressed exons and the statement on page 3 that circRNAs &quot;showed considerable tissue-specificity&quot;.</p><p>2. The authors may want to elaborate further on the possible links between the preferred genomic architectures of circRNAs hotspots and the concept of exon definition (e.g. enrichment in long flanking introns and differences in GC content between exons and introns, as reported by Ast and colleagues).</p><p>3. The predictive model generated by the authors produces very impressive results. In addition to sequence complementarity, a number of protein factors have been shown to support the formation of stem-loop structures associated with back splicing, including hnRNP L, MBNL1 or PTB. The authors may be in an excellent position to assess whether the presence of potential binding sites for these proteins contributes evolutionarily to the generation of circRNAs (or subtypes of them). More specifically, does the inclusion of binding sites for these factors improve the performance of their predictive model?</p><p>4. Figure 4A: it would be good to provide some measurement of the statistical relevance of the enrichment scores observed.</p><p>5. Figure 5 and related discussion about evolutionary age of TEs associated with circRNA biogenesis: is it possible that dimers co-evolving over long periods of time accumulate mutations but retain -through compensatory changes- their capacity to form base pairing interactions leading to looping out and back-splicing?<italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this manuscript entitled &quot;Circular RNA repertoires are associated with evolutionarily young transposable elements&quot;, Franziska Gruhl et al., applied a series of computational analyses to investigate the evolution of circRNAs. They first generated several RNA-seq samples from three organs in five species. Based on their analysis with these newly generated, but limited, samples, they concluded a negative correlation between &quot;circRNA hotspot&quot; and CPM threshold with some genomic features (including low GC content, long genomics length and so on) related to circRNA parental genes. By performing an RVC (reverse complements) analysis, authors showed enrichment of species-specific TEs in circRNA flanking introns and more evolutionarily young TEs enriched in flaking introns of circRNA loci shared across species. However, since most of their findings are obtained from limited datasets of circRNAs, the overall analyses in this current version are not strong enough to support their conclusion. In addition, some other publications have already suggested the correlation between circRNA biogenesis and TE, and compared circRNAs across (more) species to depict its evolutionary expression pattern (for example Ivanov et al., Cell Rep 2015, PMID: 25558066; Dong et al., RNA Biol 2017, PMID: 27982734; and Ji et al., Cell Rep 2019, PMID: 30893614), and thus the significancy and novelty of this current manuscript was unclearly described.</p><p>1. The main pitfall of the current manuscript is to use a relatively small size of samples for analysis, which could lead to misleading conclusions. The authors collected three organs from five species for RNA sequencing to annotate circRNAs for their subsequent analysis, and obtained about 4,500 circRNAs in human and much fewer in other four species. Strikingly, significantly more circRNAs have been previously reported (many references in the field). Specifically, in some publicly-available circRNA databases, such as circAtlas (Wu et al., Genome Biol 2020, PMID: 32345360), circBase (Glažar et al., RNA 2014, PMID: 25234927), CIRCpedia (Zhang et al., Genome Res 2016, PMID: 27365365), more than 400,000 circRNAs are annotated in human samples. Very recently, two publications by using third generation sequencing technologies further confirmed a large number of circRNAs in human (including Xin et al., Nat Commun 2021, PMID: 33436621 and Zhang et al., Nat Biotechnol 2021, PMID: 33707777). It is not clear why the authors only used their own circRNA annotation for the current study, and this limited number of circRNAs may lead to significant bias in the downstream analysis. For example, the number of circRNA parental genes or non-circRNA parental genes would be totally different with distinct sets of circRNAs.</p><p>2. For the analysis of enriched TEs of flanking introns of circRNAs or circRNAs shared across species, except the ages of TEs, other factors should be also included in these analyses. For example, whether pairing abilities of RVCs alone can explain the phenomenon? Whether the number of RVCs in the flanking introns is related to the conserved or species specific circRNAs? In addition, in an evolutionary view of circRNAs, it has been reported that circRNAs in fruitfly is not driven by intronic pairing of repetitive/transposable elements (Westholm, et al., Cell Rep 2014, PMID: 25544350). In this case, the general conclusion about circRNA biogenesis and TE insertion events can be biased.</p><p>3. At page 6, the authors stated &quot;Coding genes in rhesus macaque and human are characterised by a bimodal GC content distribution&quot;. The H3 category contains all genes with GC content &gt; 52% while L2 category contains genes with 37-42% GC contents (Figure 3A). It is not suitable to define it as bimodal GC content distribution when the group standard has a large difference.</p><p>4. More data are needed for the statement &quot;circRNA parental genes are characterised by low GC content and high sequence repetitiveness&quot;. Low GC content and high sequence repetitiveness may be the consequences of the long intron length of parental genes and/or the enrichment of repeat elements in long introns. More stringent conditions, like comparable intron lengths between circRNA and non-circRNA parent genes, should be set up for this type of comparison.</p><p>The regulation of circRNA biogenesis can be complex. It should be careful to evaluate different conditions to draw a convincing conclusion. The major pitfall of this study is to use relatively small population of circRNAs for the evolutionary study, which may lead to biased findings. In addition, more stringent controls are required for analyses throughout the study. The Discussion part seems to be unusually long, containing lots of assumptions that are needed to be proven. Please shorten.<italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors address an interesting and timely topic: what is the evolutionary conservation pattern of circular RNAs (circRNAs). For doing so, the authors first utilize RNAseR-RNAseq to identify circRNAs in five mammalian species. They then determine their conservation utilizing different criteria and find several conserved and even predictive features of genes harboring circRNAs in these species. Interestingly, the authors discover that few circRNAs arise from orthologous exonic loci across the studied species. Moreover, the small conservation seems to arise from convergent evolution driven by young specie-specific transposable elements.</p><p>One of the strengths of the manuscript is the topic, general idea and some parts of the analysis, like the sections in which the authors identify features of genes hosting circRNAs (including the hot spot analysis). While the methodology while determining the evolution of circRNAs is also appropriate, it seems to me that the authors have oversimplified some of the issues and should consider additional possibilities and limitations of their own data. For example, the authors identified circRNAs using RNAseR-treated samples. While RNAseR enriches generally for circRNAs, the authors don't have any data of the abundance of the circRNAs in mock treated samples. This is problematic for two reasons: 1. Some of the potential circRNAs might not be bona fide circRNAs; 2. Probably most of the circRNAs identified and further analyzed are of very low abundance and more likely to be noise/irrelevant. In addition, the authors utilize all the potential circRNAs for their genomic features and evolutionary assessments. This is also problematic, as the general sense in the field is that only highly abundant circRNAs might be functional. In this sense, the suggestion that most circRNAs are transcriptional noise is not new. Last but not least, the manuscript does not take into account the possibility that at least for some circRNAs, their main functionality is to regulate/limit the expression of the host gene, hence the exact exons that form circRNAs might not be important.</p><p>The manuscript is interesting and timely. However, the conclusions are too broad and the specific issues need to be addressed experimentally and/or by doing additional analysis.</p><p>More specifically:</p><p>– The approach for circRNA detection is at least problematic. Without a mock control is impossible for the authors to determine the actual resistance to the degradation by the exonuclease and hence determine which potential backsplicing junctions are really coming from circular molecules. One thing the authors could do is at least for some of the tissues/species show that the circRNAs they identified have been previously showed to be real (e.g., by a canonical comparison mock vs RNAseR treated samples).</p><p>– Authors seems to ignore that in vivo studies focused on highly expressed circRNAs. Can the authors partition their assessment of conservation for the different quantiles of expression? Indeed, I would believe that only circRNAs in the top quantile of expression are the ones that will really give insights into the potential functional importance of circRNAs.</p><p>– Notion of noise for lowly expressed circRNAs is prevalent in the field and the key question is whether the circRNAs expressed in the neural system at high levels have function. So only on those circRNAs is relevant to determine evolutionary conservation. Indeed, the authors could take the opposite approach; for those few circRNAs for which some functionality been proven, are the pattern of evolution and elements flanking the circularizable exons similar to the ones they describe generally?</p><p>– The manuscript ignores potential cis regulatory mechanisms of circRNA biogenesis. One could argue that an important feature of a given locus is to produce circRNAs as a way to limit the amount of linear RNA. In this sense, it would not so important which exon in particular makes the cirRNA or even which elements in the flanking introns are driving this process but rather the existence of this during elevation. This is relevant especially for those circRNAs for which the circular molecules are abundant in comparison with the linear mRNAs generated from the locus and there are at least some cases in the literature in which has been shown that production of the circRNA comes at the expense of the linear transcript. The authors could include this also as a criterion for evolution and not rule it out based on some theoretical assumptions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.67991.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The authors collected three organs from five species for RNA sequencing to annotate circRNAs for their subsequent analysis, and obtained about 4,500 circRNAs in human and much fewer in other four species. However, significantly more circRNAs have been previously reported. for example, in some publicly-available circRNA databases, such as circAtlas (Wu et al., Genome Biol 2020, PMID: 32345360), circBase (Glažar et al., RNA 2014, PMID: 25234927), CIRCpedia (Zhang et al., Genome Res 2016, PMID: 27365365), more than 400,000 circRNAs are annotated from human samples. Very recently, two publications by using third generation sequencing technologies further confirmed a large number of circRNAs in human (including Xin et al., Nat Commun 2021, PMID: 33436621 and Zhang et al., Nat Biotechnol 2021, PMID: 33707777). It is not clear why the authors only used their own circRNA annotation for the current study, as this might lead to a significant bias in the downstream analysis (e.g. affecting the parental genes of circRNAs to be compared to genes that do not generate circRNAs).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewers for raising the issue – this is indeed an important point to clarify. It is true that the publications and circRNA databases cited by the Reviewers have reported on very high numbers of molecularly distinct circRNA molecules, whereas we base our study on circRNA counts that are in the low thousands.</p><p>1) The most important answer to why we “only used [our] own circRNA annotation for the current study” lies in the unavailability of comparable data from previous studies. It is correct that we could have retrieved hundreds of thousands of circRNA sequences that have been reported from human samples and cell lines in the literature, yet we would not have been able to obtain matched data from, for example, opossum or macaque organs. In our experience, it is key for clean, unbiased evolutionary analyses to generate datasets in parallel and with the same methodology. We therefore do not think that it would have been a good option to use the large published human datasets and compare them with data from the other species that we would anyway have to generate ourselves. Thus, the most straightforward solution consisted in acquiring all biological samples ourselves, subsequently allowing us to ensure the best possible consistency of organs and of the data production and analysis pipelines. In particular, (i) all organs originated from young, sexually mature male individuals; (ii) our highquality biological samples, RNA and library preparations are fully traceable; (iii) the data was produced for all samples in parallel using the most appropriate experimental protocols.</p><p>We also note, however, that we actually did analyse complete published datasets, too, in order to independently validate some of our findings – please see the analysis of the human-mouse-rat datasets from Werfel et al., 2016; now in Figure 3 – Figure supplement 4.</p><p>2) Second, why do we “only” report on a few thousand circRNAs, as compared to the published hundreds of thousands? To understand this difference, we need to elaborate slightly more. The first important point to make is that the publications cited by the reviewers – for example the two most recent ones by Xin et al., and by Zhang et al., both from 2021 – actually used relatively permissive conditions for circRNA detection and annotation. We will explain this just below using the publication by Xin et al., in addition, at the end of this reply to Essential Revision 1 (see “Supplementary Rebuttal Information”), we provide a table that analyzes data from the three databases mentioned by the reviewers (circAtlas, circBase, CIRCpedia) and that summarizes why we think that an inclusion of the reported circRNAs would not have been helpful for our study.</p><p>With regard to the example of Xin et al., one should first note that this particular study is based on RNase R-treated samples, without the use of additional mock-treated libraries. We, however, used both library types and the enrichment factor between treated vs. mock treated as one of the criteria to define high-confidence circRNAs (see Essential revision 3). Moreover, the study by Xin et al., is based exclusively on a cancer-derived cell line, HEK293. HEK293 cells are hypotriploid (64 chromosomes) and are cytogenetically not very stable (as compared to organ samples that are the basis of our study). Chromosomal instability can easily be envisioned to lead to exon rearrangements that would lead to de novo creation of BSJs and abnormal splicing events that are not biologically relevant in vivo. Next, Xin et al., prepared 6 libraries - i.e. 3 technical library replicates sequenced from 2 biological HEK293 cell samples - and reported on around 40’000-60’000 BSJs/circRNA isoforms per library. Of note, before applying our enrichment/filtering steps to remove noise/sporadic BSJ detection in our samples, the numbers of BSJs that we detect are within the same order of magnitude (see Supplementary File 2). Please also note that in Xin et al., even for the “high confidence BSJs” (defined as BSJs with absolute read count = 2 across all libraries), the similarity even between technical replicates appears to be relatively modest (see Figure 2a-b in Xin et al.,), which indicates that there may be an issue with rather lenient thresholds for circRNA calling (“noise”).</p><p>In summary, we think that estimates such as the “more than 400’000 circRNAs from human samples” are the result of (i) the inclusion of many cancer cell line samples in the databases that contribute with abnormal gene expression and splicing events and of (ii) relaxed thresholds – in some studies a single reported BSJ read in a single sample is sufficient for entry into the database. We are not convinced that these (in part stochastically occurring?) BSJs are suitable for downstream analyses like those that we carry out in our study.</p><p>3) As mentioned in the above paragraphs and shown in Supplementary File 2, we actually do obtain relatively high numbers of BSJs/circRNAs per library (i.e. in the tens of thousands); why, then, do we base our downstream analyses nevertheless only on a few thousand circRNAs?</p><p>The reason lies in various filtering steps, which are described in Materials and Methods and also shown in Supplementary File 2 for the example of the human libraries. For human liver, cerebellum and testis we thus begin with approximately 25,000, 50,000 and 40,000 detected BSJs, respectively, per tissue sample (=per biological replicate). After removing poorly mapped events and merging across biological replicates and RNase-treated and -untreated samples, these correspond to a total number of 66,405 (liver), 137,615 (cerebellum) and 94,831 (testis) unique BSJs (RNase-treated and -untreated combined). Of the various filtering steps indicated in Supplementary File 2, the ones that decrease the numbers most strongly are the following: Filtering step 2 leads to a reduction by about 75%; briefly, in this step we remove those circRNAs that can be detected in RNase R-treated samples, but not at all in any of the untreated ones. The rationale behind this filtering step is to remove the very low expression BSJs that would be considered “absent” if only based on RNase R-untreated RNA samples. In Filtering step 3 we analyse enrichment of BSJs in RNase R-treated vs. untreated samples; we remove the BSJs for which the log2-enrichment of treated vs. untreated libraries is less than 1.5. This step removes around 15% of the original read count. Finally, in Filtering step 4, we calculate the mean RPM value for each BSJ across untreated replicate libraries, and keep the BSJs with an RPM &gt; 0.05. We consider these loci strong circRNA candidates and use them for our subsequent analyses.</p><p>Taken together, we think we understand the Reviewers’ concern that “it is not clear why the authors only used their own circRNA annotation for the current study, as this might lead to a significant bias in the downstream analysis (e.g. affecting the parental genes of circRNAs to be compared to genes that do not generate circRNAs)”. However, we would like to argue that our approach is actually suited to precisely reduce bias that could occur when combining other studies’ circRNA annotations where available (i.e. using circRNAs that were discovered in other human or mouse samples/studies), and compare them to our data from the more unconventional species such as opossum or macaque, for which only little data is publicly available. Second, our filtering pipeline is designed to provide a pool of robust parental genes and circRNAs rather than a collection of inconsistently or sporadically expressed circRNAs (e.g. circRNAs that may be specific only to some cancer cell lines).</p><p>Supplementary File 2 has been newly added to the manuscript; in addition, a new section in Materials and methods, entitled “Generation of high confidence circRNA candidates from the comparison of RNaseR-treated vs. -untreated samples” now explains in detail the various filtering steps.</p><table-wrap id="resptable1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><caption><title>Analysis of circRNA databases.</title><p>Evolutionary analyses are sensitive and prone to the amplification of noise.

A complementary question is whether the model put forward by the authors applies to highly abundant circRNAs, which are likely to be enriched in functional circRNAs, as the sense in the field is that only highly abundant circRNAs -particularly in the nervous system- might be functional. Can the authors partition their assessment of conservation for the different quantiles of expression? It is indeed possible that only circRNAs in the top quantile of expression will provide insights into the potential functional importance of circRNAs. The authors could also take the opposite approach: for those few circRNAs for which some functionality has been proven, are the pattern of evolution and elements flanking the circularizable exons similar to the ones they describe generally?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewers for this excellent suggestion. We have taken the proposed approach and compared properties of the top 10% most highly expressed circRNAs with the lower 90%. We have included these interesting analyses in the revised manuscript – mainly in Supplementary File 9, with further information in Supplementary File 10 and Figure 3—figure supplement 5.</p><p>First, we compared the general properties of the highly expressed vs. other circRNAs. In short, this analysis revealed that highly expressed circRNA are more likely to be expressed in all three tissues of a species, to be generated from a hotspot, and to be shared between species. Second, we went to the generalised linear model (Table 1) that we used in our study to distinguish parental vs. non-parental genes. Within the model, we compared the prediction values for the highly vs. lowly expressed circRNAs. For opossum, rhesus macaque and human, we found that the highly expressed parental genes were associated with higher prediction values. This effect was mainly driven by GC content (opossum, rhesus macaque, human) and genomic length (rhesus macaque, human).</p><p>In summary, our analyses therefore suggest that the overall model that we put forward in our study also applies to highly expressed circRNAs. The overall higher shared-ness of this group of circRNAs makes it probable that potentially functional circRNAs are more likely to be found in this group as well. These findings have been integrated in the manuscript.</p><p>Finally, we have analysed known functional circRNAs in our model – please see Figure 3-Figure supplement 3, “Properties of ‘functional circRNAs’ from literature.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors identified circRNAs using RNAseR-treated samples. While RNAseR enriches generally for circRNAs, the authors don't have data reporting the abundance of the circRNAs in mock treated samples.

We fully agree with the Reviewers’ assessment that to conclude actual resistance to RNase R treatment (and thus, likely, circularity), a mock control is required. All RNase R-treated libraries of our study were accompanied by a parallel library from the same RNA preparation, but without prior RNase R treatment. In our previously submitted version, this information could be found, for example, in Figure 1—figure supplement 1. Moreover, we had described the use of the mock-treated samples in the materials as methods in two separate paragraphs. We therefore feel that this “Essential Revision” item does not require additional analyses (or experiments), but rather an improvement in presentation in the main text, in order to avoid misunderstandings. We have thus adapted the manuscript now giving all essential information at the beginning of the Results section. We have also moved the figure panel that shows the RNase R treatment vs. control strategy from Figure 1—figure supplement 1 to Figure 1 to show the protocol details more prominently. Finally, in the Materials and methods section, we have expanded the explanation of the various steps for filtering and RNase R enrichment analyses – see new section entitled “Generation of high confidence circRNA candidates from the comparison of RNase R-treated vs. -untreated samples”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. For the analysis of enriched TEs of flanking introns of circRNAs or circRNAs shared across species, except the ages of TEs, other factors should be also included in these analyses. For example, whether pairing abilities of RVCs alone can explain the phenomenon? Whether the number of RVCs in the flanking introns is related to the conserved or species specific circRNAs? In addition, In this case, the general conclusion about circRNA biogenesis and TE insertion events can be biased.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewers for the opportunity to clarify these issues. To address them, we have conducted a more refined analysis of the dimer composition in the flanking introns of shared and species-specific circRNA loci. The obtained results have led to a change in the presentation and layout of the final part of the Results section (“Flanking introns of shared circRNA loci are enriched in evolutionarily young TEs”) and of Figure 5.</p><p>We would like to point out that our comparison of TEs in flanking introns in shared and species-specific circRNAs was – already in the first version of the manuscript – based on multiple variables, notably: the phylogenetic distance (=age) of the TE, the number of observed dimers (=frequency), their degradation rates (=milliDiv), as well as the binding affinity of a given dimer (=minimal free energy, MFE). However, after having received the Reviewers’ comments and upon reexamining our original manuscript version, we realised that we had indeed not made this sufficiently clear in text and figures.</p><p>We have therefore made the following changes. First, we already clarified some of the conceptual points in Figure 4 (where we analyse parental vs. non-parental genes). We now make it clearer where and how age and binding affinity are assessed in Figure 4C-F (mouse) and Figure 4—figure supplement 2 (other species). In particular, it should now be clearer that Figure 4D refers to age and Figure 4E to binding energy. The former use of the phrase “binding score” was changed in the new version to “TE pairing score (age + MFE)”, to indicate that it integrates both the components age and binding energy (Figure 4F).</p><p>The major changes relating to Essential revision 4 we implemented in Figure 5, where shared vs. species-specific circRNAs are compared. Current Figure 5A and Figure 5-Figure supplement 1 now show the dimer count per gene on the x- and y-axis (the corresponding panel in the previous manuscript version was based on total count); the “per gene” analysis facilitates the interpretation of enrichment in shared vs. species-specific dimer counts. Furthermore, we have included a new supplementary figure – Figure 5—figure supplement 2 – to portray the increase of possible dimers that can be formed (“dimer interaction landscape”) due to increased number of dimers in the flanking introns of shared vs. species specific circRNA loci.</p><p>Next, we reconsidered how we could calculate more precisely the actual degradation rates of the relevant dimers; the outcome is found in the new Figure 5C and Figure 5-Figure supplement 3 (left panel). Briefly, we now show a comparison of milliDiv values between the individual predicted dimer-forming repeats – rather than the mean milliDiv values from repeats of the same dimer, as in the old version – should conceptually be a more precise approach. With this analysis, we now conclude that degradation levels between top-5 dimers do not differ between the flanking introns of shared and species-specific circRNA loci. Because degradation rates alone may not fully capture the actual decline in pairing of the dimer, we next added the analysis of the actual binding affinity for all top-5 dimers (Figure 5, right panel) calculated from the individual genomic sequences (rather than from the reference sequence). In the next analysis, we selected for each gene the least degraded dimer, i.e. the one that is strongest and that is likely to form (see Material and Methods). Again these analyses showed no significant difference between the flanking introns of shared and species-specific circRNA loci, fully in line with our model.</p><p>We believe that these changes have significantly improved our analysis. However, our deep analyses of dimer landscapes are rather novel; in this context, we would like to note that we are quite aware that dimer formation will be the result of a complex interplay between TE frequency, degradation levels, and sequence affinity – how these individual parameters should be weighted and how they can be integrated into a quantitative measure is not simple to evaluate. Nevertheless, all our analyses suggest that degradation rates and sequence affinities are fairly similar between shared and species-specific circRNA loci; we therefore also assume that TE frequency is one of the driving factors for circRNA formation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Suggested text revisions:</p><p>a. The discussion should further elaborate the concept that at least for some circRNAs, their main functionality is to regulate/limit the expression of the host gene, hence the exact exons that form circRNAs might not be important. Therefore it would not so important which exon in particular makes the cirRNA or even which elements in the flanking introns are driving this process but rather the existence of this during evolution. This is relevant especially for those circRNAs for which the circular molecules are abundant in comparison with the linear mRNAs generated from the locus and there are at least some cases in the literature in which has been shown that production of the circRNA comes at the expense of the linear transcript.</p></disp-quote><p>We now more clearly include this point towards the end of the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Discuss the evolutionary implications of the observation that circRNAs in fruitfly is not driven by intronic pairing of repetitive/transposable elements (Westholm, et al., Cell Rep 2014, PMID: 25544350).</p></disp-quote><p>We have looked at the cited publication in some detail in order to see how we could best accommodate this suggested text revision. First, we noticed that the publication is relatively careful in its wording and does not explicitly state that “circRNAs in fruitfly is not driven by intronic pairing of repetitive/transposable elements”. A telling statement from the paper is, for example: “However, overall, it appears that <italic>Drosophila</italic> RNA circularization does not appear to be driven by flanking sequence or structural complementarity, as in mammals.” - the authors are thus very careful in their wording in order to avoid overstating this particular point. Closer examination of their data shows, for example, in Figure S3A that their approach using MEME recovers one short substring of the ALU element described by Jeck et al., (2012) in human circRNA flanking introns (although, of note, this Figure unfortunately does not show the same analysis in control introns). In Figure S3B, a comparison of <italic>Drosophila</italic> introns (500 nt window) recovers some repetitive sequences that are of lower complexity and found in both circRNA and non-circRNA introns, and that are therefore dismissed as possible transposable element substrings. Still, their Figure S4B actually does show that circRNA flanking introns contain significantly better stem-loop-potential than non-circRNA introns, especially for short sequence window sizes (interestingly, the effect is clear until window sizes of 100 nt, but absent when using a 500 nt window, possibly indicating that the MEME analysis could have resulted in other outcomes when using smaller windows as well). Westholm et al., do not extensively develop the lack of evidence for intron pairing or repetitive/transposable elements in their study, but concentrate on other main findings. As it stands and only based on this study, therefore, we feel it would be misleading to develop and discuss evolutionary scenarios in our mammalian-centric study.</p><p>The situation is also further complicated by the fact that Kramer et al., (2015) (PMID: 26450910) actually have suggested a role for intronic repeats in circRNA biogenesis in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Also Ashwal-Fluss et al., (2014) (PMID 25242144) identify numerous reverse complementary repeats between the two flanking introns of the mbl circRNA (see Figure S2B in their publication). Despite the specific role of MBL in this circularisation event, this finding suggests that sequence-dependent pre-mRNA folding may have an additional, and possibly more ancestral, role in circRNA biogenesis in this particular example (reviewed in Patop et al., (2019) PMID: 31343080). Finally, there is good evidence for reverse-complement sequence mediated circRNA biogenesis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (Ivanov et al., 2015; PMID 25558066). With all these caveats to be navigated – and with the idea of simplifying/shortening our discussion in view of other reviewers’ comments, we hope the editor and reviewers will accept that we prefer not to dedicate a part of the discussion to conservation of circRNA biogenesis beyond the subject of our mammal-based study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c.

There seems to be some contradiction between the argument that circRNAs tend to be generated from constitutive, widely expressed exons and the statement on page 3 that circRNAs &quot;showed considerable tissue-specificity&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now rephrased this sentence to be clearer:</p><p>“Identified circRNAs were generally small in size, overlapped with protein-coding exons, frequently detectable only in one of the tissues, and were flanked by long introns (Figure 1—figure supplement 3).”</p><p>This wording is better compatible with the main underlying reason for “tissue-specificity”, namely that the stochastic splicing noise around the constitutive exons will not lead to reproducible circle formation across all tissues. Second, similar to linear alternative splicing, one needs to differentiate between the transcript and exon level: alternative RNA isoforms can show tissue-specific expression patterns, while being partially composed of the same (constitutive) exons – the exon itself can be considered expressed in multiple tissues (because it is used in multiple, but different isoforms), yet the transcript is not.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors may want to elaborate further on the possible links between the preferred genomic architectures of circRNAs hotspots and the concept of exon definition (e.g. enrichment in long flanking introns and differences in GC content between exons and introns, as reported by Ast and colleagues).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this would be a very interesting idea to address in the future. However, we felt that in its current state the manuscript was already quite loaded with information analyses, including comments that we should shorten the discussion. We therefore did not extend our analyses in this additional direction at this point. We hope the Reviewer will find this decision acceptable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The predictive model generated by the authors produces very impressive results. In addition to sequence complementarity, a number of protein factors have been shown to support the formation of stem-loop structures associated with back splicing, including hnRNP L, MBNL1 or PTB. The authors may be in an excellent position to assess whether the presence of potential binding sites for these proteins contributes evolutionarily to the generation of circRNAs (or subtypes of them). More specifically, does the inclusion of binding sites for these factors improve the performance of their predictive model?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an excellent point and opportunity for further in-depth analyses.</p><p>It is indeed possible that circRNAs become first expressed by the formation of hairpin-like structures driven by TEs in their flanking introns. In a second step (and in case that the circRNA has conferred a benefit for the organism), circRNA expression may be stabilised by the evolution of new binding sites for proteins such as hnRNP proteins, MBNL1 and PTB. At the same time, this reduces the selective pressure on the TE, leading to its degradation and circRNA candidates without detectable dimers. While we focus on the “first steps” towards the expression of a circRNA, the integration of binding site information from external datasets to understand “what happens next” can be considered an excellent starting point for a follow up study. Yes, as for the previous point, we found this interesting request too complex to accommodate at this point, and thus beyond the scope of this first study. We do, however, expand a bit more on RBPs in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Figure 5 and related discussion about evolutionary age of TEs associated with circRNA biogenesis: is it possible that dimers co-evolving over long periods of time accumulate mutations but retain -through compensatory changes- their capacity to form base pairing interactions leading to looping out and back-splicing?</p></disp-quote><p>The Reviewer raises an interesting point. Our modified Figure 5 (see above, Essential revision 4) now looks at aspects of this idea by calculating the actual binding energies of the local TE copies predicted to form dimers.</p><p>In general, however, we would think that most sequence changes – even the compensatory ones – are rather random in nature than selected for. The most relevant TEs that we identify are SINE elements, which are rather GC-rich, but integrate into GC-poor environments. Our analyses (not shown in the manuscript) indicate that many of the mutations we observe are G/C -&gt; A/T changes, for which we would tend to hypothesize that they occur as a consequence of the GC-poor environment to which the integrated TE is adapting. This GC adaptation to the local GC content will happen in both TEs of the dimer in parallel, which can lead on average to more seemingly “compensatory” mutations than expected. However, these compensatory changes would not be driven by selective pressure, but by the local GC content. Therefore, although it is possible that a few of them are real compensatory mutations, it would represent a major project to properly identify, classify and analyse these signals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>[…]</p><p>The regulation of circRNA biogenesis can be complex. It should be careful to evaluate different conditions to draw a convincing conclusion. The major pitfall of this study is to use relatively small population of circRNAs for the evolutionary study, which may lead to biased findings. In addition, more stringent controls are required for analyses throughout the study. The Discussion part seems to be unusually long, containing lots of assumptions that are needed to be proven. Please shorten.</p></disp-quote><p>The first part of Reviewer #2’s recommendations (“The major pitfall of this study is to use relatively small population of circRNAs […]”) is largely overlapping with Essential revision 1 at the beginning of this rebuttal document. Please refer to this section for a detailed response.</p><p>The context of the second statement “In addition, more stringent controls are required for analyses throughout the study.“ is not fully clear from the above paragraph. However, in the more detailed “Public evaluation summary”, we find as point 4 the statement: “More data are needed for the statement &quot;circRNA parental genes are characterised by low GC content and high sequence repetitiveness&quot;. Low GC content and high sequence repetitiveness may be the consequences of the long intron length of parental genes and/or the enrichment of repeat elements in long introns. More stringent conditions, like comparable intron lengths between circRNA and non-circRNA parent genes, should be set up for this type of comparison.”</p><p>We agree with the Reviewer that it is important to account for a possible dependence of variables, as shown by the example that the Reviewer cites: GC content and sequence repetitiveness will clearly not be independent from intron length. This is precisely why we used generalised linear models, which is the state-of-the-art approach when multiple correlated dependent variables are predicted. To avoid possible biases by correlated variables, we have also assessed all variables for multicollinearity before including them into the analysis (see Material and Methods, section Generalised linear models). We prefer this approach of a global model that includes all potential predictive parameters, over the Reviewer’s suggestion of individual comparisons of single features, precisely because such comparisons are prone to biases like the one described by the Reviewer.</p><p>The third point – shortening of discussion and removal of assumptions – is well taken. We have substantially restructured and rewritten the discussion accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>[…]</p><p>The manuscript is interesting and timely. However, the conclusions are too broad and the specific issues need to be addressed experimentally and/or by doing additional analysis.</p><p>More specifically:</p><p>– The approach for circRNA detection is at least problematic. Without a mock control is impossible for the authors to determine the actual resistance to the degradation by the exonuclease and hence determine which potential backsplicing junctions are really coming from circular molecules. One thing the authors could do is at least for some of the tissues/species show that the circRNAs they identified have been previously showed to be real (e.g., by a canonical comparison mock vs RNAseR treated samples).</p></disp-quote><p>This point has been answered under Essential Revision 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Authors seems to ignore that in vivo studies focused on highly expressed circRNAs. Can the authors partition their assessment of conservation for the different quantiles of expression? Indeed, I would believe that only circRNAs in the top quantile of expression are the ones that will really give insights into the potential functional importance of circRNAs.</p></disp-quote><p>This point has been answered under Essential Revision 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Notion of noise for lowly expressed circRNAs is prevalent in the field and the key question is whether the circRNAs expressed in the neural system at high levels have function. So only on those circRNAs is relevant to determine evolutionary conservation. Indeed, the authors could take the opposite approach; for those few circRNAs for which some functionality been proven, are the pattern of evolution and elements flanking the circularizable exons similar to the ones they describe generally?</p></disp-quote><p>The largest part of this point, too, is picked up by several of the Essential revisions - please refer to the beginning of this document. Moreover, please see Figure 3-Figure supplement 3 for an analysis of known, functional circRNAs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The manuscript ignores potential cis regulatory mechanisms of circRNA biogenesis. One could argue that an important feature of a given locus is to produce circRNAs as a way to limit the amount of linear RNA. In this sense, it would not so important which exon in particular makes the cirRNA or even which elements in the flanking introns are driving this process but rather the existence of this during elevation. This is relevant especially for those circRNAs for which the circular molecules are abundant in comparison with the linear mRNAs generated from the locus and there are at least some cases in the literature in which has been shown that production of the circRNA comes at the expense of the linear transcript. The authors could include this also as a criterion for evolution and not rule it out based on some theoretical assumptions.</p></disp-quote><p>We now dedicate more space to this important concept in the discussion of the revised manuscript (see also above our response to suggested text revisions).</p></body></sub-article></article>
