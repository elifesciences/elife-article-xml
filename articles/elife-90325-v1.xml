Cortical development in rhesus macaque is known to recapitulate multiple facets of cortical development in humans, including the complex composition of neural stem cells and the thicker supragranular layer. To characterize temporal shifts in transcriptomic programming responsible for differentiation from stem cells to neurons, we sampled parietal lobes of rhesus macaque at E40, E50, E70, E80, and E90, spanning the full period of prenatal neurogenesis. Single-cell RNA sequencing produced a transcriptomic atlas of developing parietal lobe in rhesus macaque neocortex. Identification of distinct cell types and neural stem cells emerging in different developmental stages revealed a terminally bifurcating trajectory from stem cells to neurons. Notably, deep-layer neurons appear in the early stages of neurogenesis, while upper-layer neurons appear later. While these different lineages show overlap in their differentiation program, cell fates are determined post-mitotically. Trajectories analysis from ventricular radial glia (vRGs) to outer radial glia (oRGs) revealed dynamic gene expression profiles and identified differential activation of <italic>BMP</italic>, <italic>FGF</italic>, and <italic>WNT</italic> signaling pathways between vRGs and oRGs. These results provide a comprehensive overview of the temporal patterns of gene expression leading to different fates of radial glial progenitors during neocortex layer formation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>scRNA-seq</kwd><kwd>neural progenitor</kwd><kwd>macaque cortex</kwd><kwd>prenatal neurogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>China Academy of Medical Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021-I2M-1-024</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peng</surname><given-names>Xiaozhong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>China Academy of Medical Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021-I2M-1-019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shu</surname><given-names>Pengcheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100018537</institution-id><institution>National Science and Technology Major Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021ZD0200902</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peng</surname><given-names>Xiaozhong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100018925</institution-id><institution>Overseas Expertise Introduction Center for Discipline Innovation (&quot;111Center&quot;)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BP0820029</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peng</surname><given-names>Xiaozhong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A useful single-cell resource provides the prenatal macaque different cell types’ gene expression profiles in the parietal cerebral cortex lobe.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The neocortex is the center for higher brain functions, such as perception and decision-making. Therefore, the dissection of its developmental processes can be informative of the mechanisms responsible for these functions. Several studies have advanced our understanding of the neocortical development principles in different species, especially in mice. Generally, the dorsal neocortex can be anatomically divided into six layers of cells occupied by distinct neuronal cell types. The deep-layer neurons project to the thalamus (layer VI neurons) and subcortical areas (layer V neurons), while neurons occupying more superficial layers (upper-layer neurons) preferentially form intracortical projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jabaudon, 2017</xref>). The generation of distinct excitatory neuron (EN) cell types follows a temporal pattern in which early-born neurons migrate to deep layers (i.e. layers V and VI), while the later-born neurons migrate and surpass early-born neurons to occupy the upper layers (layers II–IV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rakic, 1974</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, several transcription factors (TFs) are sequentially expressed in neural stem cells to control the specification of daughter neurons, while very few such TFs have been identified in mammals thus far. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), Telley and colleagues found that daughter neurons exhibit the same transcriptional profiles of their respective progenitor radial glia (RG), although these apparently heritable expression patterns fade as neurons mature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Telley et al., 2019</xref>). However, the temporal expression profiles of neural stem cells and the contribution of these specific temporal expression patterns in determining neuronal fate have yet to be wholly clarified in humans and non-human primates (NHP). Over the years, NHP have been widely used in neuroscience research as mesoscale models of the human brain. Therefore, exploring the similarities and differences between NHP and human cortical neurogenesis could provide valuable insight into unique features during human neocortex development.</p><p>In mammals, RG cells are found in the ventricular zone (VZ), where they undergo proliferation and differentiation. The neocortex of primates exhibits an extra neurogenesis zone known as the outer subventricular zone (OSVZ), which is not present in rodents. As a result of evolution, the diversity of higher mammal cortical RG populations increases. Although ventricular radial glia (vRG) is also found in humans and NHP, the vast majority of RG in these higher species occupy the OSVZ and are therefore termed outer radial glia (oRG). oRG cells retain basal processes but lack apical junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hansen et al., 2010</xref>) and divide in a process known as mitotic somal translocation, which differs from vRG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ostrem et al., 2014</xref>). vRG and oRG are both accompanied by the expression of stem cell markers such as <italic>PAX6</italic> and exhibit extensive self-renewal and proliferative capacities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Betizeau et al., 2013</xref>). However, despite functional similarities, they have distinct molecular phenotypes. Previous scRNA-seq analyses have identified several molecular markers, including <italic>HOPX</italic> for oRGs, <italic>CRYAB</italic>, and <italic>FBXO32</italic> for vRGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pollen et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, oRGs are derived from vRGs, and vRGs exhibit obvious differences in numerous cell-extrinsic mechanisms, including activation of the <italic>FGF-MAPK</italic> cascade, <italic>SHH</italic>, <italic>PTEN/AKT</italic>, and <italic>PDGF</italic> pathways, and oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) levels. These pathways and factors involve three broad cellular processes: vRG maintenance, spindle orientation, and cell adhesion/extracellular matrix production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Penisson et al., 2019</xref>). Some TFs have been shown to participate in vRG generation, such as <italic>INSM</italic> and <italic>TRNP1</italic>. Moreover, the cell-intrinsic patterns of transcriptional regulation responsible for generating oRGs have not been fully characterized.</p><p>ScRNA-seq is a powerful tool for investigating developmental trajectories, defining cellular heterogeneity, and identifying novel cell subgroups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Luecken and Theis, 2019</xref>). Several groups have sampled prenatal mouse neocortex tissue for scRNA-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ruan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Di Bella et al., 2021</xref>), as well as discrete, discontinuous prenatal developmental stages in humans and NHP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pollen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Trevino et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nowakowski et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Eze et al., 2021</xref>). The diversity and features of primate cortical progenitors have been explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hansen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Betizeau et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pollen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pebworth et al., 2021</xref>). The temporally divergent regulatory mechanisms that govern cortical neuronal diversification at the early post-mitotic stage have also been focused on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yuan et al., 2022</xref>. However, studies spanning the full embryonic neurogenic stage in the neocortex of humans and other primates are still lacking. Rhesus macaque and humans share multiple aspects of neurogenesis, and more importantly, the rhesus monkey and human brains share more similar gene expression patterns than the brains of mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bakken et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bernard et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zeng et al., 2012</xref>). To establish a comprehensive, global picture of the neurogenic processes in the rhesus macaque neocortex, which can be informative of neocortex evolution in NHP, we sampled neocortical tissue at five developmental stages (E40, E50, E70, E80, and E90) in rhesus macaque embryos, spanning the full neurogenesis. Through strict quality control, cell-type annotation, and lineage trajectory inference, we identified two broad transcriptomic programs responsible for the differentiation of deep-layer and upper-layer neurons. We also defined the temporal expression patterns of neural stem cells, including oRGs, vRGs, and intermediate progenitors, and identified novel TFs involved in oRG generation. These findings substantially enhanced our understanding the development and evolution of the neocortex in primates.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>scRNA-seq analysis of cell types in the developing macaque neocortex</title><p>In order to establish a comprehensive view of the cellular composition of the rhesus macaque brain at different prenatal stages, we conducted scRNA-seq on the dissected parietal lobes of eight total rhesus macaque embryos, spanning five developmental stages of prenatal neurogenesis, including E40 (stage of peak neurogenesis) and E50 (Layer 6 formation); as well as at E70 (Layer 5 formation), E80 (Layer 4 formation), and E90 (Layer 2–3 formation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rakic, 1974</xref>). We obtained a transcriptomic atlas from 53,259 cells after filtering out low-quality cells and removing potential doublets. Each embedding was visualized using uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) of dimension reduction using Seurat, which identified 28 distinct cell clusters. All cell clusters present in the samples were then annotated into cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>) based on their expression of molecular markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B to C</xref>).

The parietal lobe is the center of the somatic senses and is significant for interpreting words as well as language understanding and processing. In this study, the parietal lobe area was selected mainly because of the convenience of sampling the dorsal neocortex. The neocortex of NHP rhesus macaque resembles that of humans in many aspects. Thus, a comprehensive investigation of macaque neurogenesis can improve our understanding of neocortical development and evolution. For this purpose, we performed scRNA-seq in prenatal neocortical tissues of macaque. Our data support previous omics studies of prenatal macaque brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bakken et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Luo et al., 2021</xref>) and recently published human neocortex development studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhaduri et al., 2021</xref>). We constructed a single-cell resolution transcriptomic atlas of the developing macaque neocortex, which we then used to identify dynamically expressed genes that likely contribute to the maturation of distinct neuron types, temporal expression patterns of neural stem cells, and the generation of oRGs.</p><p>The existence of oRGs has long been demonstrated in humans and primates through live imaging and immunostaining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hansen et al., 2010</xref>). ORGs share similarities in their patterns of gene expression with vRGs (e.g. <italic>SOX2</italic>, <italic>PAX6</italic>, and <italic>NESTIN</italic>) but also specifically express several genes (such as <italic>MOXD1</italic>, <italic>HOPX</italic>, and <italic>FAM107A</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pollen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nowakowski et al., 2016</xref>). Recently, the molecular mechanisms associated with the generation and amplification of oRGs were shown to include signaling pathways such as the <italic>FGF-MAPK</italic> cascade, <italic>SHH</italic>, <italic>PTEN/AKT</italic>, and <italic>PDGF</italic> pathways, as well as proteins such as <italic>INSM</italic>, <italic>GPSM2</italic>, <italic>ASPM</italic>, <italic>TRNP1</italic>, <italic>ARHGAP11B</italic>, <italic>PAX6</italic>, and <italic>HIF1α</italic>. A number of these proteins were validated by genetic manipulation of their activities or expression in mouse, ferret, and marmoset (; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kalebic et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xing et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Heide et al., 2020</xref>). The dynamically expressed genes and pseudotime trajectories from vRGs to oRGs presented in this work are in agreement with these previous reports. In addition to known regulators, we detected differential expression of transporters and ion channel regulators in oRGs, such as <italic>ATP1A2</italic>, <italic>ATP1B2</italic>, and <italic>SCN4B</italic>. Indeed, hyperpolarization in mouse apical progenitors has been shown to promote the generation of IPCs and indirect neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vitali et al., 2018</xref>), although it remains unclear if similar mechanisms contribute to the development of the primate neocortex.</p><p>The sequential generation of cortical neurons has long been observed in both rodents and primates, and many TFs are known to drive post-mitotic specification of neuronal progeny, mainly in rodents. Here, we found genes conserved across species, such as <italic>FEZF2</italic> and <italic>TBR1</italic>, involved in specifying deep-layer neurons in the macaque neocortex. The Slingshot pseudotime analysis, which reflected the expression pattern of genes during appropriate lineage trajectories, suggests that some genes are lineage-restricted or even involved in lineage fate determination. For example, <italic>FEZF2</italic>, <italic>PPP1R1B</italic> (also known as <italic>DARPP32</italic>), <italic>SOX5</italic>, <italic>LMO3</italic>, and <italic>CELF4</italic> may be involved in the fate specialization of deep neurons; in contrast, <italic>TMOD1</italic>, <italic>PID1</italic>, <italic>LINGO1</italic>, <italic>CRYM</italic>, and <italic>MEF2C</italic> for upper-layer neurons. Notably, <italic>FEZF2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Molyneaux et al., 2005</xref>) and <italic>SOX5</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Leone et al., 2008</xref> have been confirmed associated with deep-layer neuron specification in mice, while others, such as <italic>TMOD1</italic>, <italic>PID1</italic>, and <italic>LINGO1</italic>, have not been reported before, and their potential functions in the fate specification of cortical projection neurons need to be further explored. To date, only a very limited set of genes have been shown to function in specifying neuronal progeny in progenitor cells, which suggests that regulation in progenitors is more complex than in neurons, where a single TF can trigger a transcriptional cascade to promote the maturation of neurons. In the current study, we found two types of genes (Dynamic type 1 and 5), which have gradually altered expression patterns along with the neurogenic stage, indicating a transition in cell state in both vRGs and oRGs. In addition to these gradual transition genes, we also identified sets of genes (Dynamic types 2–4) with sharp changes in expression during neurogenesis, which likely function in specifying different neuronal subtypes. These findings led us to postulate that a combination of biological processes and pathways change over time to coordinate gradual transitions from neural stem cells to daughter neurons.</p><p>This study also faces limitations. During the macaque prenatal neurogenesis, dorsal RG cells generate ENs by direct and indirect neurogenesis. In general, the number of progenitor cells gradually decreases throughout development, with progenitor cells generating deep neurons in the early stage of development and upper ENs in the later stages. We observed the disappearance of two subclusters of ENs (EN5 and EN10) from later-stage samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Besides, the number of neurons at the E90 time point was relatively small. This disappearance could also be explained by the development of axons and dendrites, which have higher morphological complexity and greater vulnerability, because mature neurons at E90 with abundant axons and processes were hard to settle into micropores of the BD method for single-cell capture. Due to the fixed size of the BD Rhapsody microwells, this sing-cell capture method might be less efficient in capturing mature ENs but has a good capture effect on newborn neurons at each sampling time point. In conclusion, based on the BD cell capture method feature, the immature neurons at each point are more easily captured than mature neurons in our study, so the generation of ENs at different developmental time points can be well observed, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, which aligns with our research purpose. Nonetheless, this transcriptomic atlas uncovers the molecular signatures of the primary cell types and temporal shifts in gene expression of differentiating progenitor cells during neocortex layer formation, thus providing a global perspective into neocortical neurogenesis in the macaque.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal</title><p>Animals and frozen tissue samples from prenatal rhesus macaque (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>) were provided by the National Medical Primate Center, Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

Upon cDNA synthesis, each cDNA molecule was tagged on the 5′ end (the 3′ end of a mRNA transcript) with a molecular index and cell label indicating its cell of origin. Whole-transcriptome libraries were prepared using the BD Resolve single-cell whole-transcriptome amplification workflow. In brief, the second strand of cDNA was synthesized, followed by ligation of the adaptor for universal amplification. Eighteen cycles of PCR were used to amplify the adaptor-ligated cDNA products.

Then, cells were filtered to retain only higher quality (with less than 7.5% mitochondrial gene counts, less than 5.5% ribosomal gene counts, and detected genes above 400 and less than 6000).

The authors profiled eight prenatal rhesus macaque brains at five timepoints (E40, E50, E70, E80, and E90) and obtained a total of around 53,000 high-quality cells for downstream analysis. The dataset provides a high-resolution view into the developmental processes of early and mid-fetal macaque cortical development and will potentially be a valuable resource for future comparative studies of primate neurogenesis and neural stem cell fate specification. Their analysis of this dataset focused on the temporal gene expression profiles of outer and ventricular radial glia and utilized pesudotime trajectory analysis to characterize the genes associated with radial glial and neuronal differentiation. The rhesus macaque dataset presented in this study was then integrated with prenatal mouse and human scRNA-seq datasets to probe species differences in ventricular radial glia to intermediate progenitor cell trajectories.

Overall, despite some uncertainties surrounding the clustering and annotations of certain cell types, the manuscript provides a valuable scRNA-seq dataset of early prenatal rhesus macaque brain development. The dynamic expression patterns and trajectory analysis of ventricular and outer radial glia provide valuable data and lists of differentially expressed genes (some consistent with previous studies, others reported for the first time here) for future studies.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.90325.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript by Xu et al., is an interesting study aiming to identify novel features of macaque cortical development.

We are encouraged by the many positive comments regarding the significance of our findings and the value of our data. Regarding the reviews’ concern on cell classification, we used several additional marker genes to explain the identification of cell clusters and subclusters. We have further analyzed and rewrote part of the text to address the concerns raised. Here is a point-by-point response to the reviewers’ comments and concerns. Figures R1-R9 were provided only for additional information for reviewers and were not included in the revisedmanuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In the article &quot;Temporal transcriptomic dynamics in developing macaque neocortex&quot;, Xu et al. analyze the cellular composition and transcriptomic profiles of the developing macaque parietal cortex using single-cell RNA sequencing. The authors profiled eight prenatal rhesus macaque brains at five timepoints (E40, E50, E70, E80, and E90) and obtained a total of around 53,000 high-quality cells for downstream analysis. The dataset provides a high-resolution view into the developmental processes of early and mid-fetal macaque cortical development and will potentially be a valuable resource for future comparative studies of primate neurogenesis and neural stem cell fate specification. Their analysis of this dataset focused on the temporal gene expression profiles of outer and ventricular radial glia and utilized pesudotime trajectory analysis to characterize the genes associated with radial glial and neuronal differentiation. The rhesus macaque dataset presented in this study was then integrated with prenatal mouse and human scRNA-seq datasets to probe species differences in ventricular radial glia to intermediate progenitor cell trajectories. Additionally, the expression profile of macaque radial glia across time was compared to those of mouse apical progenitors to identify conserved and divergent expression patterns of transcription factors.</p><p>The main findings of this paper corroborate many previously reported and fundamental features of primate neurogenesis: deep layer neurons are generated before upper layer excitatory neurons, the expansion of outer radial glia in the primate lineage, conserved molecular markers of outer radial glia, and the early specification of progenitors. Furthermore, the authors show some interesting divergent features of macaque radial glial gene regulatory networks as compared to mouse. Overall, despite some uncertainties surrounding the clustering and annotations of certain cell types, the manuscript provides a valuable scRNA-seq dataset of early prenatal rhesus macaque brain development. The dynamic expression patterns and trajectory analysis of ventricular and outer radial glia provide valuable data and lists of differentially expressed genes (some consistent with previous studies, others reported for the first time here) for future studies.</p><p>The major weaknesses of this study are the inconsistent dissection of the targeted brain region and the loss of more mature excitatory neurons in samples from later developmental timepoint due to the use of single-cell RNA-seq. The authors mention that they could observe ventral progenitors and even midbrain neurons in their analyses. Ventral progenitors should not be present if the authors had properly dissected the parietal cortex. The fact that they obtained even midbrain cells point to an inadequate dissection or poor cell classification. If this is the result of poor classification, it could be easily fixed by using more markers with higher specificity. However, if it is the result of a poor dissection, some of the cells in other clusters could potentially be from midbrain as well. The loss of more mature excitatory neurons is also problematic because on top of hindering the analysis of these neurons in later developmental periods, it also affects the cell proportions the authors use to support some of their claims. The study could also benefit from the validation of some of the genes the authors uncovered to be specifically expressed in different populations of radial glia.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer’s comments and apologize for the shortcomings of tissue dissection and cell capture.</p><p>We used more marker genes for major cell classification, such as SHOX2, IGFBP5, TAC1, PNYN, FLT1, and CYP1B, in new Figure 1D, to improve the cell type annotation results. We improved the cell type annotation results by fixing cluster 20 from C20 as Ventral LGE-derived interneuron precursor and cluster by the expression of IGFBP5, TAC1, and PDYN; fixing cluster 23 from meningeal cells to thalamus cells by the expression of ZIC2, ZIC4, and SHOX2. These cell types were excluded in the follow-up analysis. Due to EN8 being previously incorrectly defined as midbrain neurons, it resulted in a misunderstanding of the dissection result as a poor dissection. After carefully reviewing the data analysis process, we determined that EN8 was a small group of cells in cluster 23 mistakenly selected during excitatory neuron analysis, as shown in Figure R5(A), which was corrected after revision. In the revised manuscript, we deleted the previous EN8 subcluster and renumbered the rest of the excitatory neuron subclusters in the new Figure 2.</p><p>In addition, we also improved the description of sample collection as follows: “We collected eight pregnancy-derived fetal brains of rhesus macaque (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>) at five prenatal developmental stages (E40, E50, E70, E80, E90) and dissected the parietal lobe cortex. Because of the different development times of rhesus monkeys, prenatal cortex size and morphology are different. To ensure that the anatomical sites of each sample are roughly the same, we use the lateral groove as a reference to collect the parietal lobe for single-cell sequencing (as indicated by bright yellow in Figure S1A) and do not make a clear distinction between the different regional parts including primary somatosensory cortex and association cortices in the process of sampling”. As shown in Figure S1A, due to the small volume of the cerebral cortex at early time points, especially in E40, a small number of cells beyond the dorsal parietal lobe, including the ventral cortex cells and thalamus cells, were collected during the sampling process with the brain stereotaxic instrument.</p><p>In this study, the BD method was used to capture single cells. Due to the fixed size of the micropores, this method might be less efficient in capturing mature excitatory neurons. However, it has a good capture effect on newborn neurons at each sampling time point so that the generation of excitatory neurons at different developmental time points can be well observed, as shown in Figure 2, which aligns with our research purpose.</p><p>To verify the reliability of our cell annotation results, we compared the similarity of cell-type association between our study and recently published research(Micali N, Ma S, Li M, et al. Science. doi:10.1126/science.adf3786.PMID: 37824652), using the scmap package to project major cell types in our macaque development scRNA-seq dataset to GSE226451.

The presentation of the data highlighting novel findings could also be clarified at higher resolution, and dissected through additional informatic analyses. Additionally, the presentation of ideas and goals of this manuscript should be further clarified. A major gap in the study rationale and results is that the data was collected exclusively in the parietal lobe, yet the rationale and interpretation of what this data indicates about this specific cortical area was not discussed. Last, a few textual errors about neural development are also present and need to be corrected.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank you for your comments and suggestions concerning our manuscript. The comments and suggestions are all valuable and helpful for revising and improving our paper and the essential guiding significance to our research. We have studied the comments carefully and made corrections, which we hope to meet with approval. We have endeavored to address the multiple points raised by the referee.</p><p>To support the reliability of our data and newly identified features, we verified terminal oRG differentiation genes in the recently published macaque telencephalic development dataset(Micali N, Ma S, Li M, et al. Science. doi:10.1126/science.adf3786.PMID: 37824652) (GEO accession: GSE226451). The results of Figure R2 show that the gene expression showed states/stages. Most of the oRG terminal differentiation markers genes identified in our study were also expressed in the oRG cells of the GSE226451 dataset. In particular, the two datasets were consistent in the expression of ion channel genes ATP1A2, ATP1A2, and SCN4B.</p><p>Our research results mainly explore the conserved features of neocortex development across species. By comparing evolution, we found the types of neural stem cells in the intermediate state, their generative trajectories, and gene expression dynamics accompanying cell trajectories. We further explored the stages of transcriptional dynamics during vRG generating oRG. More analysis was performed through transcriptional factor regulatory network analysis. We performed the TFs regulation network analysis of human vRG with pyscenic workflow. The top transcription factors of every time point in human vRG were calculated, and we used the top 10 TFs and their top 5 target genes to perform interaction analysis and generate the regulation network of human vRG in revised figure 6. In comparison of the pyscenic results of mouse, macaque and human vRG, it was obvious that the regulatory networks were not evolutionarily conservative. Compared with macaque, the regulatory network of transcription factors and target genes in humans is more complex. Some conserved regulatory relationships present in more than one species are identified, such as HMGN3, EMX2, SOX2, and HMGA2 network at an early stage when deep lager generation and SOX10, ZNF672, ZNF672 network at a late stage when upper-layer generation.</p><p>Although the parietal lobe is the center of the somatic senses and is significant for interpreting words as well as language understanding and processing. In this study, the parietal lobe area was selected mainly because of the convenience of sampling the dorsal neocortex. As we described in the Materials and Methods section as follows: “Because of the different development times of rhesus monkeys, prenatal cortex size and morphology are different. To ensure that the anatomical sites of each sample are roughly the same, we use the lateral groove as a reference to collect the parietal lobe for single-cell sequencing (as indicated by bright yellow in Figure S1A) and do not make a clear distinction between the different regional parts including primary somatosensory cortex and association cortices in the process of sampling”.</p><p>Thanks for carefully pointing out our manuscript's textual errors about neural development.We have corrected them which were descripted in the following response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary: The study adds to the existing data that have established that cortical development in rhesus macaque is known to recapitulate multiple facets cortical development in humans.

We agree with the reviewer that the cell number in our study is lower than in recently published studies. The scRNA sequencing in this study was completed between 2018 and 2019, the early stages of the single-cell sequencing technology application. Besides, we have been unable to get extra macaque embryos to enlarge the sample numbers recently since rhesus monkey samples are scarce. Therefore, the number of cells in our study is relatively small compared to recently published single-cell studies.</p><p>The dataset suggested by the reviewers is extremely valuable, and we tried to perform analysis as the reviewer suggested to explore temporal expression patterns in different species of parietal cortex. The dataset from PMCID: PMC8494648 provides the developing human brain across regions from gestation week (GW)14 to gestation week (GW)25. Since this data set only covers the middle and late stages of embryonic neurogenesis, it did not fully match the developmental time points of our study for integration analysis. However, we quoted the results of this study in the discussion section.</p><p>The human regulation analysis with pyscenic workflow was added into new figure 6 for the comparison of different species vRG regulatory network.

Throughout the manuscript, the term &quot;embryonic&quot; or &quot;embryogenesis&quot; is used in reference to all timepoints (E40-E90) in this study.

Additionally, cluster 20 appears to be subclustered by itself in the progenitor subcluster UMAP (Figure 3A) suggestive of a batch effect or cells with low quality. The investigation, quality control, and proper annotation of this cluster 20 is necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate for the reviewer’s suggestion. We detected specific expression marker genes of cluster 20, cells in this cluster specifically expressed VIM, IGFBP5 and TAC. According to the cell annotation results from a published study, we relabeled cluster 20 as ventral LGE-derived interneuron precursors (Yu, Yuan et al. Nat Neurosci. 2021. doi:10.1038/s41593-021-00940-3. PMID: 34737447.). Cluster 20 cells have been deleted in the new Figure 3A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Figure 1B UMAP - it is unexpected that meningeal cells would cluster topographically closer to the excitatory neuron cluster (one could even argue that the meningeal cell cluster is located within the excitatory neuron clusters) instead of next to or with the endothelial cell clusters. This is suspicious for a mis-annotated cell cluster. ZIC2 and ZIC3 were used as the principal marker genes for meningeal cells. However, these genes are not specific for meninges (PanglaoDB) and had not been identified as marker genes in a developmental sc-RNAseq dataset of the developing mouse meninges (DeSisto et al. 2020). Additional marker genes (COL1A1, COL1A2, CEMIP, CYP1B1, SLC13A3) may be helpful to delineate the identity of this cluster and provide more evidence for a meningeal origin.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the constructive advice. The violin plot in Author response image 3 has checked additional marker genes, including COL1A1, COL1A2, CEMIP, and CYP1B2. Cluster 23 does not express these marker genes but specifically expresses thalamus marker genes SHOX2(Rosin, Jessica M et al. Dev Biol. 2015. doi:10.1016/j.ydbio.2014.12.013.

According to the gene expression results, we corrected the cell definition of cluster 23 to thalamic cells in the revised manuscript. Specifically, we added marker genes SHOX2 and CYP1B1 in the new Figure 1D violin plot and corrected the cell definition of cluster23 from meninges to thalamus cells in the revised manuscript and figures.</p><fig id="sa4fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Vlnplot of additional markers in cluster 23.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-90325-sa4-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. From Figure 1A, it appears that astrocytes (cluster 13) are present at E40 and E50 timepoints. This is inconsistent with literature and experimental data of the timing of the neuron-glia switch in primates and inconsistent with the claim within the text that, &quot;Collectively, these results suggested that cortical neural progenitors undergo neurogenesis processes during the early stages of macaque embryonic cortical development, while gliogenic differentiation... occurs in later stages.&quot; The clarification of the percentage of astrocytes at each timepoint would clarify this point.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the suggestion, we have statistically analyzed the percentage of astrocytes (cluster 13) at each time point. The statistical results showed that the proportion of astrocytes was low to 0.1783% and 0.1046% at E40 and E50 time points, and increased significantly at E80 and E90, suggesting the onset of macaque gliogenesis might be around embryonic 80 days to 90 days. The result was consistent with published research on the timing of the neuron-glial transition in primates (Rash, Brian G et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2019. doi:10.1073/pnas.1822169116. PMID: 30894491). Besides, we thought that the cells in cluster 13 captured at E40 to E50 time points, with a total number of less than 200, maybe astrocyte precursor cells expressing the AQP4 gene (Yang, Lin, et al.

In the description of the previous version of the manuscript, we misidentified the cells of the EN8 as midbrain cells.

As the violin diagram in Author response image 4 shows, other developing midbrain markers OTX2, NR4A2, and PAX7 did not express in EN8, but thalamus marker genes SHOX2, TCF7L2, and NTNG1 were highly expressed in EN8. Besides, dorsal cortex excitatory neuron markers NEUROD2, NEUROD6, and EMX1 were not expressed in EN8, which suggests that EN8 might not belong to cortical cells. After carefully reviewing the data analysis process, we determined that EN8 was a small group of cells in cluster 23 mistakenly selected during excitatory neuron analysis, as shown in Figure R5(A), which was corrected after revision.

I was unclear what the main takeaway for readers should be. Similarly, the discussion of previous studies and the importance for comparing human and macaque could be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the suggestion and apologize for the shortcomings of the introduction part. We have rewritten the section and added additional clarification in the revised introduction. In the revised manuscript, the contents of the introduction are as follows:</p><p>“The neocortex is the center for higher brain functions, such as perception and decision-making. Therefore, the dissection of its developmental processes can be informative of the mechanisms responsible for these functions. Several studies have advanced our understanding of the neocortical development principles in different species, especially in mice. Generally, the dorsal neocortex can be anatomically divided into six layers of cells occupied by distinct neuronal cell types. The deep- layer neurons project to the thalamus (layer VI neurons) and subcortical areas (layer V neurons), while neurons occupying more superficial layers (upper-layer neurons) preferentially form intracortical projections1. The generation of distinct excitatory neuron cell types follows a temporal pattern in which early-born neurons migrate to deep layers (i.e., layers V and VI), while the later- born neurons migrate and surpass early-born neurons to occupy the upper layers (layers II-IV) 2. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, several transcription factors are sequentially explicitly expressed in neural stem cells to control the specification of daughter neuron fates, while very few such transcription factors have been identified in mammals thus far. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), Telley and colleagues found that daughter neurons exhibit the same transcriptional profiles of their respective progenitor radial glia, although these apparently heritable expression patterns fade as neurons mature3. However, the temporal expression profiles of neural stem cells and the contribution of these specific temporal expression patterns in determining neuronal fate have yet to be wholly clarified in humans and non-human primates. Over the years, non-human primates (NHP) have been widely used in neuroscience research as mesoscale models of the human brain. Therefore, exploring the similarities and differences between NHP and human cortical neurogenesis could provide valuable insight into unique features during human neocortex development.</p><p>In mammals, radial glial cells are found in the ventricular zone (VZ), where they undergo proliferation and differentiation. The neocortex of primates exhibits an extra neurogenesis zone known as the outer subventricular zone (OSVZ), which is not present in rodents. As a result of evolution, the diversity of higher mammal cortical radial glia populations increases. Although ventricular radial glia (vRG) is also found in humans and non-human primates, the vast majority of radial glia in these higher species occupy the outer subventricular zone (OSVZ) and are therefore termed outer radial glia (oRG). Outer radial glial (oRG) cells retain basal processes but lack apical junctions 4 and divide in a process known as mitotic somal translocation, which differs from vRG 5. VRG and oRG are both accompanied by the expression of stem cell markers such as PAX6 and exhibit extensive self-renewal and proliferative capacities 6. However, despite functional similarities, they have distinct molecular phenotypes. Previous scRNA-seq analyses have identified several molecular markers, including HOPX for oRGs, CRYAB, and FBXO32 for vRGs7. Furthermore, oRGs are derived from vRGs, and vRGs exhibit obvious differences in numerous cell-extrinsic mechanisms, including activation of the FGF-MAPK cascade, SHH, PTEN/AKT, and PDGF pathways, and oxygen (O2) levels. These pathways and factors involve three broad cellular processes: vRG maintenance, spindle orientation, and cell adhesion/extracellular matrix production8.</p><p>Some transcription factors have been shown to participate in vRG generation, such as INSM and TRNP1. Moreover, the cell-intrinsic patterns of transcriptional regulation responsible for generating oRGs have not been characterized.</p><p>ScRNA-seq is a powerful tool for investigating developmental trajectories, defining cellular heterogeneity, and identifying novel cell subgroups9. Several groups have sampled prenatal mouse neocortex tissue for scRNA-seq 10,11, as well as discrete, discontinuous prenatal developmental stages in human and non-human primates 7,12 13,14. The diversity and features of primate cortical progenitors have been explored 4,6,7,15. The temporally divergent regulatory mechanisms that govern cortical neuronal diversification at the early postmitotic stage have also been focused on 16. Studies spanning the full embryonic neurogenic stage in the neocortex of humans and other primates are still lacking. Rhesus macaque and humans share multiple aspects of neurogenesis, and more importantly, the rhesus monkey and human brains share more similar gene expression patterns than the brains of mice and humans17-19. To establish a comprehensive, global picture of the neurogenic processes in the rhesus macaque neocortex, which can be informative of neocortex evolution in humans, we sampled neocortical tissue at five developmental stages (E40, E50, E70, E80, and E90) in rhesus macaque embryos, spanning the full neurogenesis period. Through strict quality control, cell type annotation, and lineage trajectory inference, we identified two broad transcriptomic programs responsible for the differentiation of deep-layer and upper-layer neurons. We also defined the temporal expression patterns of neural stem cells, including oRGs, vRGs, and IPs, and identified novel transcription factors involved in oRG generation. These findings can substantially enhance our understanding of neocortical development and evolution in primates.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why is this study focused on the parietal lobe?

This needs to be changed in the discussion of the results.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestion. We have fixed the manuscript as the reviewer suggested. The description in the revised manuscript has been fixed as follows: “According to the expression of the marker genes, we assigned clusters to cell type identities of neurocytes including radial glia (RG), outer radial glia (oRG), intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs), ventral precursor cells (VP), excitatory neurons (EN), inhibitory neurons (IN), oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPC), oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, ventral LGE-derived interneuron precursors and Cajal-Retzius cells, or non-neuronal cell types including microglia, endothelial, meninge/VALC(vascular cell)/pericyte, and blood cells. Based on the expression of the marker gene, cluster 23 was identified as thalamic cells, which are small numbers of non-cortical cells captured in the sample collection at earlier time points. Each cell cluster was composed of multiple embryo samples, and the samples from similar stages generally harbored similar distributions of cell types.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It's important to define the onset of gliogenesis in the text and figure. What panels/ages show this?</p></disp-quote><p>We identified the onset of gliogenesis by statistically analyzing the percentage of astrocytes (cluster 13) at each time point and added the result in Figure S1. The statistical results showed that the proportion of astrocytes was deficient at E40 and E50 time points and increased significantly at E80 and E90, suggesting the onset of macaque gliogenesis might be around embryonic 80 days to 90 days. The result was consistent with published research on the timing of the neuron-glial transition in primates (Rash, Brian G et al. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 201. doi:10.1073/pnas.1822169116.

Is it capture bias, dissociation challenges (as postulated for certain neuronal subtypes in the discussion), or programmed cell death at this time point?</p></disp-quote><p>We thought it was because mature neurons at E90 with abundant axons and processes were hard to settle into micropores of the BD method for single cell capture. Due to the fixed size of the BD Rhapsody microwells, this sing-cell capture method might be less efficient in capturing mature excitatory neurons but has a good capture effect on newborn neurons at each sampling time point. In conclusion, based on the BD cell capture method feature, the immature neurons at each point are more easily captured than mature neurons in our study, so the generation of excitatory neurons at different developmental time points can be well observed, as shown in Figure 2, which aligns with our research purpose.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors state: &quot;We then characterized temporal changes in the composition of each EN subcluster. While the EN 5 and EN 11 (deep-layer neurons) subclusters emerged at E40 and E50 and disappeared in later stages, EN subclusters 1, 2, 3, and 4 gradually increased in population size from E50 to E80 (Figure 2D).&quot; What about EN7? It's labeled as an upper layer neuron that is proportionally highest at E40. Could this be an interesting, novel finding? Does this indicate something unique about macaque corticogenesis?

In subsequent integrated cross-species analyses, macaque excitatory neurons showed similar transcriptional characteristics to human excitatory neurons. In general, excitatory neurons tend to have a greater diversity in the cortex of animals that are more advanced in evolution (Ma, Shaojie et al. Science. 2022. doi:10.1126/science.abo7257.

Clearly identifying the difference between IPC generated from vRG and oRG at the transcriptional level in our single-cell transcriptome dataset is difficult. We hypothesized that the IPCs produced by both pathways have highly similar transcriptional features.

Some conserved regulatory TFs present in more than one species are identified, such as HMGN3, EMX2, SOX2, and HMGA2 at an early stage when deep- lager generation and SOX10, ZNF672, and ZNF672 at a late stage when upper-lay generation.</p><p>Besides, we performed some comparative analysis with our macaque dataset and the newly published macaque telencephalon development dataset. The results were only used to provide additional information to reviewers and were not included in the revised manuscript.</p><p>To verify the reliability of our cell annotation results, we compared the similarity of cell-type association between our study and recently published research(Micali N, Ma S, Li M, et al. Science. doi:10.1126/science.adf3786.PMID: 37824652), using the scmap package to project major cell types in our macaque development scRNA-seq dataset to GSE226451. The river plot in Author response image 1 illustrates the broadly similar relationships of cell type classification between the two datasets. Otherwise, we used more marker genes for cell annotation to improve the results of cell type definition in new Figure 1D. Besides, the description of distinct excitatory neuronal types has been improved in the new Figure 2.</p><p>Furthermore, we verified terminal oRG differentiation genes in the recently published macaque telencephalic development dataset(Micali N, Ma S, Li M, et al. Science. doi:10.1126/science.adf3786.PMID: 37824652) (GEO accession: GSE226451). The results of Authro response image 2 show that the gene expression showed states/stages. Most of the oRG terminal differentiation markers genes identified in our study were also expressed in the oRG cells of the GSE226451 dataset. In particular, the two datasets were consistent in the expression of ion channel genes ATP1A2, ATP1A2, and SCN4B.</p></body></sub-article></article>
