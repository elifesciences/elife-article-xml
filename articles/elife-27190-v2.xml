It has been considered a gastrulation process unique to amphibians, but we show that at the cell level, endoderm internalisation exhibits characteristics reminiscent of bottle cell formation and ingression, known mechanisms of germ layer internalisation. During ingression proper, cells leave a single-layered epithelium. In vegetal rotation, the process occurs in a multilayered cell mass; we refer to it as ingression-type cell migration. Endoderm cells move by amoeboid shape changes, but in contrast to other instances of amoeboid migration, trailing edge retraction involves ephrinB1-dependent macropinocytosis and <italic>trans</italic>-endocytosis. Moreover, although cells are separated by wide gaps, they are connected by filiform protrusions, and their migration depends on C-cadherin and the matrix protein fibronectin. Cells move in the same direction but at different velocities, to rearrange by differential migration.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27190.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In most animals, the early embryo consists of a single layer of cells that forms a hollow sphere. This simple structure first gains complexity by organising into multiple layers that are fated to become specialised tissues in the adult, such as muscle or skin. To form the primitive gut, a group of cells known as the endoderm must move from the surface to the interior in a process called gastrulation.</p><p>Since the early 1900s, the sea urchin and the frog have been the standard species used to study gastrulation. In sea urchin embryos, gastrulation entails bending the sheet of cells that form the surface of the embryo inward at a predetermined site to generate a pocket that will become the digestive system. By contrast, frog embryos begin gastrulation as multilayered structures, and the embryo’s surface does not bend. Furthermore, classic studies of frog gastrulation have found that cells do not leave the surface of the embryo to enter its interior. So despite generations of students having learned about how gastrulation occurs in backboned animals from studying frogs, the cell behaviours that internalise the endoderm are still not understood.</p><p>Wen and Winklbauer now show that endoderm cells in the frog move using the same set of behaviours that cells in other organisms use to break loose from or bend sheets of cells. Individual cells move by simultaneously pushing their front end forward while retracting their rear in a peculiar manner, by engulfing their own cell surface at a large scale. In the frog embryo, this movement is coordinated into an organised pattern where cells use the surfaces of their slower or stationary neighbours to propel past each other, and then slow down to return the favour. This constitutes a newly defined type of movement referred to as ingression-type migration.</p><p>Frog embryos are remarkably large because each of their cells is packed with yolk to support development until the animals are able to feed. As an adaptation to this large size, some frog gastrulation movements appear unusual. However, Wen and Winklbauer show that the cell behaviours that drive these movements are similar to the behaviours of cells in single-layered embryos, and indeed the behaviour of single-celled organisms such as amoebae. Further research is now needed to investigate how these cells find their way straight to the interior of the embryo.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>gastrulation</kwd><kwd>cell migration</kwd><kwd>cadherin</kwd><kwd>fibronectin</kwd><kwd>ephrin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP-53075</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Winklbauer</surname><given-names>Rudolf</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The cellular behaviours that underlie the internalization of the multilayered endoderm anlage in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> link the ancestral mode of vertebrate gastrulation to common, epithelial-based mechanisms of gastrulation in non-vertebrate animals.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The basic body plan of metazoans is established by gastrulation, and at its core is the movement of endoderm and mesoderm from the surface to the interior of the embryo. Among invertebrates, the pre-gastrulation embryo typically consists of a single-layered epithelium, and a common mechanism of germ layer internalisation is invagination, the inward bending of an epithelium at a pre-localised site. A classic example of gastrulation by invagination is the sea urchin embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kominami and Takata, 2004</xref>), and more recently, the invagination of the mesoderm during gastrulation in the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> has been thoroughly studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rauzi et al., 2013</xref>). Another major internalisation mechanism is ingression, where individual cells leave the epithelial layer to move interiorly. Both modes of internalisation can occur in the same organism. For example, primary mesenchyme ingression precedes invagination in the sea urchin embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Katow and Solursh, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kominami and Takata, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Within chordates, cephalochordates and tunicates develop from a single-layered blastula. Ingression is not observed in these groups, and internalisation of germ layers occurs by invagination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shook and Keller, 2008</xref>). Although the blastula wall is single-layered in ascidian tunicates, it is thick relative to the size of the embryo, and the vegetal cells in particular are comparatively large, which gives ascidian invagination a distinctive appearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Satoh, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sherrard et al., 2010</xref>). The transition to the third chordate group, vertebrates, is characterised by a sharp increase in egg size along with the formation of a thick multilayered epithelium that surrounds a blastocoel cavity. Whereas the animal side of the embryo can secondarily become single-layered, the vegetal half always remains as a multilayered cell mass. The corresponding ancestral mode of vertebrate gastrulation, conserved in lampreys, lungfish, and amphibians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Collazo et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shook and Keller, 2008</xref>), must adapt to this condition. In a second wave of further egg size increase, meroblastic cleavage again requires adaptation of gastrulation movements in various vertebrate groups. For example, germ layer internalisation occurs by ingression at a novel structure, the primitive streak, in birds and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arendt and Nübler-Jung, 1999</xref>).</p><p>In the ancestral mode of vertebrate gastrulation, mesoderm is internalised by involution or ingression at the blastopore lip, and the supra-blastoporal endoderm by involution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shook and Keller, 2008</xref>). The multilayered structure of the sub-blastoporal endoderm of the vegetal cell mass precludes invagination, and ingression of the vegetal surface is also absent. Thus, the question arises of how the vegetal endoderm is internalised. Surprisingly, despite endoderm internalisation being a defining feature of gastrulation, it has scarcely been studied in lower vertebrates. Even in the African clawed frog, <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>, the most extensively studied model of vertebrate gastrulation, the inward movement of the sub-blastoporal vegetal endoderm has only been analysed at the tissue level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Winklbauer and Schürfeld, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ibrahim and Winklbauer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Papan et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>X. laevis</italic>, the cone-shaped vegetal endoderm is initially narrow inside at the blastocoel floor (BCF), and wide at its outer, epithelial surface. At the equator, it is surrounded by an annulus of mesoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Keller, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Keller, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bauer et al., 1994</xref>). At the onset of gastrulation, the vegetal cell mass surges animally into the embryo. It narrows at its vegetal-most part, expands at the BCF, rolls the anterior mesoderm against the ectoderm and displaces the posterior mesoderm in the vegetal direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Winklbauer and Schürfeld, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ibrahim and Winklbauer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Papan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Winklbauer and Damm, 2012</xref>). When a mid-sagittal slice of the vegetal half of the gastrula is explanted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), the entire process continues in isolation and appears as rotational movements on the dorsal and the ventral sides, which gave rise to the term vegetal rotation (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Further dissection of explants revealed that vegetal rotation is based on active, region-specific tissue deformations within the vegetal cell mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Winklbauer and Schürfeld, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ibrahim and Winklbauer, 2001</xref>). However, the cellular mechanisms that drive vegetal rotation are not known, and it is not understood how these processes are related to other modes of gastrulation in chordates.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27190.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Tissue movements during <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> gastrulation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fate map and tissue deformation of <italic>X. laevis</italic> germ layers for stages 10–13.

We show that endoderm cells undergo elongation and region-specific re-orientation at the onset of gastrulation and move by amoeboid migration without involving lamellipodial, filopodial or bleb-like protrusions. Spatially graded differences in movement velocity lead to orderly cell rearrangements as cells move over and between each other. Rearrangement by such differential migration narrows the vegetal-most part of the tissue and expands the animal part, which leads to the inward surge of the vegetal mass. During migration, endoderm cells are separated by wide interstitial gaps, which are bridged by dynamic filiform protrusions. Despite these gaps, C-cadherin is required to maintain cell migration, and interaction with the extracellular matrix (ECM) protein fibronectin (FN) is also necessary. A peculiar mode of ephrinB1-dependent trailing edge retraction by macropinocytosis and <italic>trans</italic>-endocytosis, combined with the amoeboid characteristics of endoderm cell translocation, suggests that vegetal rotation is a modification of invagination or ingression adapted to the multilayered structure of the vegetal mass, and is based on ingression-type cell migration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The BCF expands by endoderm cell rearrangement and oriented cell shape changes</title><p>To analyse vegetal rotation, we first quantified tissue shape changes performed by vegetal slice explants. Beginning at gastrulation, the upper region of explants expanded, and the BCF widened by 1.8-fold in two hours before reaching a plateau. Simultaneously, the equatorial waist of explants narrowed by 0.75-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). At the cell level, cell rearrangement within the exposed-surface plane of the explant, rearrangement by cells moving in and out of this plane, and cell elongation in region-specific patterns were apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Average cell number increased from 11.7 to 17.3 at the BCF, remained unchanged along the animal–vegetal (A–V) axis, and decreased from 21.3 to 14.3 along the waists of explants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Cells also elongated slightly with the onset of rearrangement in explants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In embryos, cell elongation was less pronounced, as seen by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Cell elongation was accompanied by cell re-orientation and alignment, and elongation was predominantly in the direction of movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2s1sdata1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A—source data 1</xref>). After explant excision, cells were on average obliquely oriented in all regions. During the next half hour, cells in the top layers turned parallel to the BCF, while those in the middle layers aligned with the A–V axis. Thus, cells near the BCF became perpendicularly oriented relative to cells in the center. Orientation changed similarly in the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> Data; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2s1sdata1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B—source data 1</xref>). In particular, cells of the expanding BCF flattened in parallel to the tissue surface, perpendicular to cells located farther vegetally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Cells of the vegetal epithelial layer are known to remain at the surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Keller, 1978</xref>), but occasionally they showed apical constriction and became wedge-shaped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>Our data support the notion that a combination of cell rearrangement and oriented cell elongation underlies the distinct shape change of vegetal explants. To estimate the relative importance of these processes, we considered in detail a representative explant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Here, the narrowing of the equator was due to a decrease in cell number, as in other explants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In part, this was because of a disappearance of cells at the lateral explant margins, which was to some extent offset by the elongation of former sub-marginal cells in parallel to the equator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We suggest that this ‘edge effect’ was an explant artifact. In the remaining central section of the equator, cell numbers decreased by 0.64 (from 14 to 9 cells), matching the 0.64-fold decrease in equator length. Apparently, the slight elongation of cells perpendicular to the equator in the center of the explant was offset by a similarly slight net increase in apparent cell size. Cell disappearance was rare in the center of the explant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>); thus, in-plane cell rearrangement constituted the major morphogenetic process to narrow the lower part of the explant.</p><p>Cells disappeared at the lateral margins both above and below the equator, and to a lesser extent sub-marginally below the equator. However, cells appeared at the explant surface only above the equator, which contributed to expansion of the explant upper region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). As shown below, this type of intercalation was mostly due to superficial cells moving laterally to expose deeper cells. Importantly, cell lengthening parallel to the BCF also contributed to the region’s lateral expansion. Directly at the BCF, net cell number increased 1.3-fold (from 13 to 17 cells), and the remainder of the total 1.8-fold length increase (i.e. a 1.4-fold contribution) was due to oriented cell lengthening and some increase in apparent cell size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). As described in the following paragraph, cell lengthening is an integral part of endoderm cell movement; thus, cell rearrangement and its associated cell movements seemed to be the main mechanisms driving vegetal rotation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Amoeboid migration of endoderm cells</title><p>We next determined the mechanism by which vegetal cells rearrange. Generally, two basic processes of cell neighbour exchange have been identified. An intensively studied paradigm is epithelial cell intercalation by junction remodelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertet et al., 2004</xref>). For example, in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> gastrula ectoderm, a cell–cell boundary constricts and resolves to separate two neighbouring cells while a new, perpendicularly oriented contact is formed between previously non-attached cells. An analogous mechanism was proposed for mesenchymal cell rearrangement in <italic>X. laevis</italic> mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shindo and Wallingford, 2014</xref>). However, mesenchymal rearrangement can also be driven by the migration of cells over each other. A defining feature of migration is that a cell establishes new contacts on a substratum and detaches from previous contacts, thus changing its position. When two cells migrate over each other, one cell serves as substratum at a given instance for the other to translocate across it. For rearrangement by junction remodelling, no such distinction can be made as the common contact areas between two cells shrink or expand together.</p><p>During vegetal rotation, the endoderm cells rearranged by amoeboid migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). While cells wedged themselves between neighbours, they underwent cycles of cell body elongation in the direction of movement, expansion of the cell front, narrowing of the cell rear, and retraction of the trailing edge. Cell shapes reminiscent of the amoeboid motility cycle were also seen in the embryo using SEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–C</xref>).

Again, the trailing edge reduced its contact with the cell behind, but membrane undulations suggesting cell detachment also occurred laterally. Occasionally, vesicles appeared inside the cell.

To achieve tissue remodelling, rearrangements must be patterned globally such that small local cell displacements translate into large-scale shape change at the tissue level. In the endoderm, the more vegetal part narrows laterally, whereas the animal part expands. In the narrowing region, the elementary rearrangement event consisted of a merging of cell columns. In groups of contiguous cells, animal–vegetal neighbours separated because of the higher velocities of more animally positioned cells, whereas their lateral neighbours converged to fill the spaces left after separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). Cells also partially or completely disappeared into the deeper layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref>). To a lesser extent, this type of rearrangement also contributed to the narrowing of explants below the equator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><media id="video2" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-27190-video2.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27190.014</object-id><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>Endoderm cell rearrangement.</title><p>Neighbour exchange of central endoderm cells during differential migration viewed from a magnification of <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>.

Such a velocity gradient was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Relative to the vegetal surface, cells moved faster when they were located farther animally, up to a zone near the BCF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). Movement was also slightly faster in the center of the explant compared to the periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>); that is, cell movements were not restricted to the endoderm periphery as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Winklbauer and Schürfeld, 1999</xref>). The timing of explant excision could account for this discrepancy, as vegetal rotation initially spreads from the periphery to the center of the vegetal mass.</p><p>Rearrangement by the merging of cell columns is easily conceptualised for cells racing side by side on an external surface. However, difficulty arises in a multilayered tissue when a cell is supposed to move consistently slower than the cells directly ahead of it, while it must attach to them to propel itself forward. Using the front cells as substratum would imply that the rear cell moved faster than these cells and would overtake them. As a solution, we found that individual cell movements were intermittent and neighbouring cells usually translocated at different velocities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Discontinuous movement allowed cells to temporarily use adjacent cells as substratum during bursts of locomotion, and in turn, these cells served as substratum for neighbouring cells in subsequent steps. Nevertheless, average velocity changed gradually in the direction of movement, which promoted cell rearrangement. The migration of single endoderm cells <italic>in vitro</italic> (see below) suggested that their translocation was intrinsically intermittent.</p><p>In the upper, laterally expanding zone, the A–V velocity gradient was inverted. In explants, cells that were at or near the BCF still moved fast, but changed the direction of their migration (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>) from animal to lateral (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>). Consequently, the A–V component of their velocity gradually diminished as they approached the BCF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This reversal of the velocity gradient changed the direction of intercalation from mediolateral to animal–vegetal; faster cells coming from behind inserted themselves between the slower cells ahead. As cells did not slow down, but changed direction to move sideways, and because cells were elongated in the direction of their active movement, this cell reorientation also contributed to the expansion at the BCF (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Lastly, as cells migrated away from the central axis, they intercalated not so much by merging of cell rows in the plane of the explant surface, but by exposing cells deeper in the explant; that is, by intercalation perpendicular to the surface plane (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In the embryo, cells were also obliquely oriented below the BCF and parallel to the BCF at the surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G,H</xref>). Together, our data suggest that at the BCF, elongated cells move laterally and cells from deeper layers insert themselves into gaps that open, which expands the BCF. Eventually, the BCF cells will line the remnant of the blastocoel cavity, and as it shrinks and disappears, they will merge with the deep endodermal cell mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ewald et al., 2004</xref>).</p><media id="video3" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-27190-video3.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27190.015</object-id><label>Video 3.</label><caption><title>Cell rearrangement at the BCF.</title><p>Movement of cells near the BCF in explants viewed from a magnification of <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>.

However, their mutual attachment integrated their diverging migration trends. As an expression of this effect, net cell movement and cell orientation were not fully aligned in explants. While adjacent cells move in parallel, their long axes diverged such that cells drifted sideways to some extent. Both active movement of the cells in the direction of their long axes and passive drift imposed by the surrounding cells appeared to contribute to their net translocation. When active and passive components are aligned, net movement should be fastest. This behaviour was indeed observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4s1sdata1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>), which indicates that cells do not migrate individually as within a rigid ECM scaffold, but mutually affect their trajectories.</p><p>Regional velocity differences were correlated with cell packing densities in the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I,J</xref>). Endoderm cells were close to each other near the vegetal pole, but became less densely packed toward the BCF. At a given A–V level, packing decreased toward the center of the embryo. The channels that separate cells were narrower near the vegetal base and wider more animally and centrally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). Loose cell packing could reflect lower adhesion, and in calcium-free medium, explants do indeed dissociate faster in the animal region (Wen and Winklbauer, unpublished). In turn, low adhesion could facilitate migration through reduced resistance to movement. In summary, in both zones of the vegetal endoderm, rearrangement was based on gradients of cell velocity in the direction of movement toward the BCF, that is, on the average velocity increasing or decreasing in this direction. We refer to this migration-based intercalation mechanism as differential migration.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Endoderm cells form contacts across large interstitial spaces</title><p>To investigate how cells could migrate across each other whilst separated by large gaps, we further characterised cell–cell interactions.

When injected into blastula stage embryos, RGD peptide caused cell rounding and detachment by the gastrula stage. Embryos injected with RGE control peptide appeared normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Thus, FN was required to maintain endoderm cell adhesion in the embryo. Exposure of vegetal slice explants to RGD peptide also perturbed cell morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G,H</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). Compared with control RGE peptide treatment, RGD-treated cells became significantly more rotund. However, because cells can deviate randomly from a spherical shape, we determined the component of elongation that paralleled the A–V axis, that is the approximate axis of migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This ‘elongation congruity’ was unity in RGD-treated cells, which indicated that elongation was indeed random and not aligned with migration, in contrast to control peptide treated explants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>).

Our results depict vegetal rotation as an adaptation of a more ancient, epithelial-type morphogenetic process to the multilayered structure of gastrula tissues in vertebrates, and place it in the context of endoderm internalisation in other metazoans. We argue that endoderm cell movement strikingly resembles the ingression of cells during gastrulation in other organisms, except that it occurs in the deep cells of a multilayered tissue. We have termed the underlying cell behaviour ingression-type migration.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Endoderm internalisation by ingression-type, differential cell migration</title><p>In invertebrates, internalisation of mesoderm and endoderm starts from a single-layered cell array, typically an epithelium. In the sister group to vertebrates, the urochordates, a single layer of endoderm cells invaginate by constricting apically and laterally, thus inverting its wedge shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Satoh, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sherrard et al., 2010</xref>). In <italic>X. laevis</italic>, the corresponding region has increased dramatically in size. The large vegetal blastomeres also initially form a single-layered array, but soon become subdivided into a multilayered vegetal cell mass by periclinal and anticlinal cleavage divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>). Nevertheless, the vegetal endoderm as a whole performs a similar inversion of its wedge-shaped configuration to narrow at the external surface and to widen inside the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bauer et al., 1994</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>). This tissue deformation is based on deep cell rearrangement. The outer, epithelial layer does not invaginate except in a small zone at its margin where bottle cells form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>). Otherwise, the epithelium constricts moderately to accommodate the narrowing of the vegetal mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Keller, 1978</xref>), and later bends upward at its periphery during archenteron formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Evren et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>). However, the epithelial layer retains its integrity, and cells do not leave the surface by ingression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Keller, 1978</xref>).</p><fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27190.037</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Ingression-type cell migration during <italic>X.</italic></title><p><italic>laevis</italic> vegetal rotation.

Amoeboid migration is typically seen when single cells move through three-dimensional ECM or between stationary cells, as documented for human leukocytes, zebrafish primordial germ cells, and cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mandeville et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sahai and Marshall, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wolf et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blaser et al., 2006</xref>). <italic>X. laevis</italic> vegetal endoderm provides an example of amoeboid translocation in the context of collective cell movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11D</xref>). Previously, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holtfreter (1944)</xref> noted that in the salamander <italic>Ambystoma</italic>, prospective endoderm cells take on a ‘sausage shape’ when isolated, and engage in an ‘obscure gliding movement’. Amoeboid creeping of elongated endoderm cells on agarose was also observed for the newt <italic>Cynops pyrrhogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kubota, 1981</xref>), and ‘sausage-like’ cells were isolated from the endoderm of the frog <italic>Rana pipiens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">LeBlanc et al., 1981</xref>). These findings suggest that amoeboid migration is a widespread mechanism for amphibian endoderm internalisation.</p><p>Several sub-types of amoeboid migration can be distinguished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Paluch et al., 2016</xref>), but the specific mechanism of amphibian endoderm cell translocation is not known. Amoeboid translocation is typically associated with low substratum adhesion and movement in confined spaces where traction is generated by repeated cell shape changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Paluch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Te Boekhorst et al., 2016</xref>). Vegetal endoderm is indeed the least cohesive tissue in the gastrula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">David et al., 2014</xref>), and cells cycle through elongation of the cell body, bulging of the cell front, and narrowing and retraction of the trailing edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11E</xref>). <italic>Ambystoma</italic> endoderm cells also employ shape changes <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holtfreter, 1944</xref>), whereas <italic>C. pyrrhogaster</italic> cells glide continuously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kubota, 1981</xref>). However, all of these cells can move in isolation while lightly attached to a surface, without the need for lateral confinement, which excludes mechanisms such as ‘chimneying’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yip et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, cells move their yolk-filled contents forward relative to sites of substratum attachment, but no uropod pushes the cytoplasm by myosin II-powered contractions, and the yolk platelets show no signs of flowing within cells in a fountain movement; instead, they rigidly maintain their relative positions. In <italic>C. pyrrhogaster</italic> endoderm cells, membrane flows continuously from the front to the rear end, relative to a yolk-filled interior that behaves as a coherent body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kubota, 1981</xref>). Further study will be necessary to identify the mechanism that moves the cell content forward relative to the substratum-attached membrane.</p><p>The most striking difference from other instances of amoeboid migration is seen at the cell’s rear end. Instead of being pulled forward by a uropod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vicente-Manzanares et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lämmermann et al., 2008</xref>), the trailing edge of <italic>X. laevis</italic> endoderm cells is at least in part resorbed by massive macropinocytosis. Likewise, in <italic>C. pyrrhogaster</italic> endoderm cells, large vesicles accumulate and membrane protrusions are present at the rear end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kubota, 1981</xref>). The combination of locomotion by amoeboid leading-edge behaviour and macropinocytotic tail retraction links endoderm locomotion more closely to bottle cell invagination and ingression than to other examples of amoeboid migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C,D</xref>).</p><p>Invagination by bottle cell formation, and gastrula-stage ingression in the sea urchin or at the primitive streak of birds and mammals, start similarly. The basal end of cells bulges interiorly while the apical portion narrows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>). This is the end state in bottle cell invagination. Ingressing cells continue to move to the inside, across like cells from which they are separated by ECM-filled gaps, without using locomotory protrusions, until they detach from the surface, retract their necks, and leave the epithelial layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balinsky and Walther, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Perry et al., 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Granholm and Baker, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wakely and England, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Batten and Haar, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Katow and Solursh, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Komazaki, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Viebahn et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee and Harland, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Williams et al., 2012</xref>). During this process, the apical cell surface forms actin-rich protrusions and internalises large vesicles, which often become packed into clusters. This process resembles macropinocytosis, which can occur at the apical membrane of epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mettlen et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, cytoplasm-filled vesicles-within-vesicles occur in bottle cells of <italic>X. laevis</italic> and the newt <italic>Triturus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Perry et al., 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee and Harland, 2010</xref>), and the pinching-off of such a vesicle was captured in a mouse primitive streak cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Batten and Haar, 1979</xref>). Based on their co-occurrence with labelled ephrinB1-containing vesicles, we tentatively identified similar structures in <italic>X. laevis</italic> endoderm as the products of <italic>trans</italic>-endocytosis. This mechanism drives cell–cell separation upon Eph receptor–ephrin interaction – these molecules actually form strong bonds – by one cell engulfing the interaction site including the membrane of the adjacent cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gaitanos et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The high protrusive activity associated with intense vesicle formation at the trailing edge of endoderm cells, combined with the amoeboid translocation of the cell body, suggests that vegetal cell migration may be derived from an invagination or ingression process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C,D</xref>). A further commonality between endoderm cell migration and ingression is that cells use each other as substratum for translocation in a collective cell movement. Whereas amoeboid migration in general is considered to be independent of specific cell adhesion mechanisms, <italic>X. laevis</italic> endoderm cells require interaction with FN and cadherin for proper migration.</p><p>Bottle cells form transiently or permanently during ingression or invagination, respectively, and both processes are mechanistically related. For example, whereas mesoderm invaginates in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, it ingresses in the midge <italic>Chironomus riparius</italic>, and a change in the expression of one or two effector genes of Snail is sufficient to switch between the two mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Urbansky et al., 2016</xref>). In vegetal endoderm cells, the stereotypical motile behaviour characteristic of ingression is executed repeatedly, constituting a special case of amoeboid translocation, ingression-type migration. Ingression proper is absent from the vegetal epithelial layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Keller, 1978</xref>), and we propose that vegetal rotation is derived from invagination. Apical constriction of vegetal epithelial layer cells was occasionally observed in the SEM. Because deep vegetal cells do not possess an apical domain through which they would be linked, they simply move past each other when executing their program of bottle cell formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C,D</xref>).</p><p>Endoderm migration is directional, with cells initially polarised in the A–V direction, which suggests that during the cleavage divisions that generate the multilayered structure of the vegetal mass, the primary apical–basal polarity of the vegetal blastomeres is transmitted to all deep cells by an unknown mechanism. Animal–vegetal polarisation of the vegetal mass is apparent in the graded cell packing density along this axis. Moreover, numerous genes show A–V differences in expression at the initial gastrula stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Taverner et al., 2005</xref>). For example, a hyaluronic acid synthase is expressed in the animal half of the vegetal cell mass, consistent with hyaluronan supporting the extended interstitial space in this region. Likewise, the Wnt/planar cell polarity components Frizzled-7 and Prickle are enriched in the animal part of the region. Whether cells are also individually polarised or gain polarity and orientation cues during migration from these spatial inhomogeneities remains unclear. Endoderm cells migrating on FN-gelatin are polarised, but we do not know whether this polarity is identical to that within the tissue, or generated by spontaneous symmetry breaking <italic>in vitro</italic>. The cues that re-orient endoderm cells as they approach the BCF likewise remain to be identified.</p><p>Cell rearrangement by junction remodelling in epithelial monolayers has been extensively studied, but less detailed information is available for the corresponding processes in multilayered tissues. Differential migration may be an archetypical mode of rearrangement in such compact tissues. Mesoderm involution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Evren et al., 2014</xref>) and the radial intercalation of prechordal mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Damm and Winklbauer, 2011</xref>) are examples of this mechanism in the <italic>X. laevis</italic> embryo. Likewise, the dorsal migration of lateral mesoderm in zebrafish involves differential migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Roszko et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yin et al., 2009</xref>), and fin or limb bud morphogenesis in fish and mice, respectively, depend on three-dimensional patterns of cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ede et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wyngaarden et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mao et al., 2015</xref>). Vegetal rotation is another example of cell rearrangement by differential migration. Appropriately graded velocity differences have been observed in explants, and time-lapse X-ray microtomography revealed similar velocity gradients in the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moosmann et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title><italic>Cell</italic>–<italic>cell interaction in the vegetal cell mass</italic></title><p>Like ingressing cells in the sea urchin, chicken or mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balinsky and Walther, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Granholm and Baker, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wakely and England, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Batten and Haar, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Katow and Solursh, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Komazaki, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Viebahn et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee and Harland, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Williams et al., 2012</xref>), translocating endoderm cells in <italic>X. laevis</italic> and other amphibians (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nakatsuj and Nakatsuj, 1975</xref>) are separated by prominent interstitial gaps. ECM material is present in the gaps, but a self-supporting, <italic>trans</italic>-cellular ECM structure is unlikely to permeate the endoderm for several reasons. First, when fixed for TEM, the ECM collapses locally into densely stained, isolated globules at the surface of cells, and when endoderm is dissociated in calcium-free medium, no conspicuous, stable ECM scaffold remains. Secondly, vegetal explants deform rapidly beyond their initial contours by cell migration, a behaviour that is difficult to reconcile with a stable, pre-formed matrix scaffold as an external substratum. In addition, the movement of individual endoderm cells is the resultant of active and passive components, which is inconsistent with individual cells migrating through a stable, external ECM scaffold. Lastly, proteins that form covalently cross-linked ECM structures, such as collagens, laminin or fibrillin, are not expressed in the early gastrula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Winklbauer and Ettensohn, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Thus, the ECM in the vegetal cell mass is best viewed as a cell surface coat that contributes to weak and flexible adhesion between cells. A highly hydrated, space-filling constituent of the ECM in the <italic>X. laevis</italic> gastrula is hyaluronic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Müllegger and Lepperdinger, 2002</xref>), which may act as a spacer between cells, whereas FN contributes to cell adhesion. FN and its receptor α5β1 integrin are expressed in gastrula endoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Winklbauer and Ettensohn, 2004</xref>), and the knockdown of FN diminishes cell–cell contacts in the endoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barua et al., 2017</xref>). Likewise, inhibition of FN–integrin interaction with RGD peptide leads to vegetal cell detachment. FN-mediated cell–cell adhesion has been demonstrated for other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Robinson et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">2004</xref>). FN inhibition impedes endoderm cell migration and affects internalisation of the vegetal endoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ramos and DeSimone, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Winklbauer and Keller, 1996</xref>), which may be a consequence of diminished adhesion, or due to reduced integrin signalling.</p><p>Vegetal endoderm cells are also connected via small direct membrane contacts and filiform lateral protrusions. Despite the infrequent occurrence of cell–cell contact, C-cadherin is required for proper endoderm cell migration. Cadherins couple cells mechanically, but also act as signalling molecules that control the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Priya and Yap, 2015</xref>). During cell rearrangement by junction remodelling, both roles are important to drive neighbour exchanges in cells closely attached to each other through adherens junctions. In the loosely packed endoderm, knockdown of C-cadherin impedes lateral cell–cell contacts through attenuation of filopodia formation. Cells round up and fail to translocate, but tissue cohesion is still retained; we speculate that here C-cadherin mainly assumes a signalling role. Cadherin-based contact could control the lateral cell cortex through the recruitment of α-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Drees et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amack and Manning, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Winklbauer, 2015</xref>), and permit for example the lengthening of the cell body as an essential step in translocation. Altogether, amoeboid migration in the vegetal endoderm is not independent of specific adhesion mechanisms. This difference from other instances of amoeboid translocation may reflect the fact that endoderm cells move not single, but as a coherent mass to rearrange by differential migration.</p><p>Interstitial space between migrating amoeboid cells is common in vertebrate embryos. In sections, it often appears as channels between cells that run in parallel to the longitudinal axes of the cell bodies, are of even width, and follow the contours of neighbouring cells, consistent with cell–cell attachment across the gaps (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Granholm and Baker, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Viebahn et al., 1995</xref>). This pattern is also seen in adult tissues of basal metazoans, such as in poriferan archaeocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Weissenfels, 1982</xref>), where cell adhesion is mediated by large, space-filling carbohydrate–protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fernàndez-Busquets and Burger, 2003</xref>). Movement of a space-filling ECM, together with the migrating cells that it surrounds, has been observed, for example, in the chicken gastrula, when internalised mesoderm moves away from the primitive streak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vanroelen et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Van Hoof and Harrisson, 1986</xref>). The amoeboid migration of cells in contact with each other through ECM coats may be an ancestral mechanism of cell rearrangement and morphogenesis in metazoans.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal husbandry</title><p>Adult <italic>X. laevis</italic> were housed in aquaria, water temperature 19–20°C.

Embryos were then cured at 65°C overnight. Semi-thin (1–1.5 µm) sections were made using a Leica RM2235 microtome, and ultrathin (90–100 nm) sections were prepared using a Leica EM UC6 microtome. Semi-thin sections were stained with 1% toluidine blue for sample inspection under bright-field microscopy, while ultrathin sections were stained using 3% uranyl acetate and Reynold’s lead citrate to provide contrast for imaging using the Hitachi HT7700 transmission electron microscope operated at 80 kV.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Tissue surface tension assay</title><p>Tissue aggregates round up into drop-shapes <italic>in vitro</italic>. The drop-shape of an aggregate at equilibrium represents a balance of forces between tissue surface tension (which acts to minimise the tissue into a sphere) and gravity (which acts to flatten the tissue). Given that gravity is known, tissue surface tension can be deduced by the Laplace equation using the curvature radii of the aggregate profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">David et al., 2009</xref>). Since surface tension is numerically equal to surface energy, which is the energy required to expand the surface of a droplet by a unit of area which is also equal to half of the energy required to split a droplet into two equal parts (i.e. creating two new surfaces); tissue surface tension is an effective measure of tissue cohesion. Tissue excised from the early gastrula (at NF stage 10 unless otherwise specified) were placed in a well for 30 min to facilitate rounding. Tissue aggregates were transferred onto BSA-coated tissue culture dishes to equilibrate for 2 hr before aggregate curvature profiles were imaged using an inclined mirror calibrated at a 45° angle to the substrate surface. Tissue surface tension was quantified using a modified Axisymmetric Drop-Shape Analysis (ADSA; Del <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Río and Neumann, 1997</xref>) adapted for use with tissue explants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">David et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Luu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">David et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Single cell migration assay</title><p>Endoderm cells were isolated using tissue dissected from a central column of the vegetal cell mass between the vegetal pole and the blastocoel floor and incubated in cell dissociation buffer (88 mM NaCl, 1 mM KCl, 2.4 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 10 mM Hepes (+NaOH), pH 7.4) to separate cells. Culture dishes were coated with 10% (w/v) fish skin gelatin (Sigma-Aldrich) over-night then surface coated with bovine plasma FN (5 µg/cm<sup>2</sup>; Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 hr at room-temperature prior to seeding.

LWR was measured using cell outlines captured from time-lapse videos of membrane-labelled explants and scanning electron micrographs of mid-sagittally fractured embryos in various gastrulation stages as indicated. To assess whether cell elongation was congruent with the direction of cell migration, we analysed cell congruity ratio with respect to the animal-vegetal trajectory. Cell body orientation was measured by determining the angle of the long-axis of cells relative to the vertical axis. To determine the long-axis of individual endoderm cells, best-fit ellipses were matched to traced cell outlines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blanchard et al., 2009</xref>). Individual fittings were manually checked to contain the same area, orientation and centroid as the original cell. The long-axis of the ellipse was then used as to represent the long-axis of cells. Cell movement trajectories were tracked using MtrackJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Meijering et al., 2012</xref>). Cell displacement and velocity measurements were made by connecting the centroid of individual cells from lapsed time-points. Cell path alignment was measured by determining the angle of cell displacement path relative to the long-axis of cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All experiments were replicated at least three times, and representative images are shown.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Diethard Tautz as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Although vegetal internalization movements were observed in amphibian gastrulae as long ago as the 1930's, it was only in 1999 that Dr. Winklbauer and colleagues described in detail the extensive reshaping of the vegetal endoderm in gastrulating <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos and explants and recognized that it (&quot;vegetal rotation&quot; as they called it) is an active, region-specific, morphogenetic process essential to <italic>Xenopus</italic> gastrulation. After an interval of some years, the current article by Drs. Winklbauer and Wen provides new information about the patterned cell rearrangements occurring during vegetal internalization as a whole and on the cellular activities that underlie internalization. Results include:</p><p>1) Characterization (with morphometrics) in the whole embryo and explants of the structured heterogeneity of cell behaviors in the animal-to-vegetal and central-to-peripheral dimensions of the vegetal endoderm with regard to speeds of movement of the large yolky endoderm cells, the size of intercellular spaces, the contacts between cells, and the changes of direction as cells approach and enter the blastocoel floor, greatly expanding its surface area (more than 20-fold as indicated by the red lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and apposing the gastrulated mesoderm and ectoderm layers of the embryo. Deep endodermal cells appear to undergo extensive, relative migration, often moving in past each other in a vegetal to animal direction, perhaps with temporarily immobile neighbors as a substratum for intermittent moving cells, which in turn stop moving and serve as substratum. The authors suggest that this &quot;differential migration&quot; of cells is largely responsible for the reshaping of the vegetal endoderm.</p><p>2) Characterization at the individual cell level of changes of cell shape and neighbor contacts during morphogenesis, by use of a combination of morphometrics, TEM, SEM, fluorescence microscopy (e.g., membrane and actin labeling), and movies of live cells in explants and on gelatin-fibronectin surfaces. Cell movement seems to occur in the absence of forward-projecting lamellipodia or other protrusions often seen in migrating cells, and instead to involve a form of amoeboid locomotion, which the authors characterize. They identify ephrinB1-dependent macropinocytosis and <italic>trans</italic>-endocytosis, and active filopodial protrusive activity at the trailing edges of cells, and transient c-cadherin-dependent filiform protrusions along the cells' lateral surfaces. They suggest that amoeboid movement involves a cyclic bulging out of the anterior end of the cell, anterior-directed movement of cytoplasm, and recession and retraction of the tail end with a trafficking of vesicles during retraction (macropinocytosis and transcytosis). This is the first characterization of cell behaviors for this kind of morphogenesis. They report the cessation of vegetal internalization movements after knockdown and overexpression of fibronectin (matrix), C-cadherin (cell contacts and signaling), and ephrin B1 (cell-cell signaling). The Winklbauer lab has used many of these methods in previous published studies. The 8 movies are helpful as some of the key observations are best shown in them.</p><p>3) The authors suggest that &quot;ingression-type migration&quot; is a term best describing the morphogenetic activity of vegetal endoderm cells, after they compare it to the ingressions and bottle cell invaginations preformed by other cell populations during gastrulation. They note that ingression-type migration probably arose in the evolution of fish (except teleosts) and amphibians with large yolky eggs, as a means to deal with a yolky multilayered endoderm portion of the embryo, whereas gastrulating embryos of most other animal groups have only a single-layered vegetal region that internalizes (e.g. ascidian, amphioxus, echinoderms, <italic>Drosophila</italic>).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The three reviewers found the work to be a novel and valuable contribution to the area of cellular/developmental biology, specifically, mechanisms of morphogenesis. The authors are the experts on vegetal internalization-Dr. Winklbauer discovered it. The manuscript is well organized and clearly written (see minor comments below for further clarification). The paper is challenging to read closely since there are 11 figures, many with 8-10 panels, and then 8 movies, with many images and morphometric analyses to scrutinize and to integrate with written text and legends. Nonetheless, the manuscript form seems suitable for the author's thorough presentation of complex visual material and morphometric analysis. The reviewers expect that after the authors attend to various issues of the written presentation, the manuscript will likely be acceptable for publication.</p><p>The authors have three main conclusions about vegetal internalization to get across to the reader, namely, the existence and importance of:</p><p>1) the patterned &quot;differential migration&quot; of cells within the vegetal endoderm,</p><p>2) the amoeboid movement cycle of cells as driving the deformation of the vegetal endoderm, and</p><p>3) ingression-type migration as a term best characterizing the overall morphogenesis.</p><p>The authors provide clear summary statements of the conclusions, but we suggest that they indicate through their wording that these are models and interpretations seeming to them to best fit the data, as opposed to final proofs.</p><p>Related to this, the authors have focused mostly on the migration aspect of vegetal endoderm internalization. However, as they introduce the Results section, they say, &quot;…this tissue deformation must be due to cell rearrangement, cell shape change, cell orientation, or any combination of these factors.&quot; And, &quot;…our data support the notion that a combination of cell rearrangement and oriented cell elongation underlie the distinct shape change of vegetal explants.&quot; Then the results focus mostly on amoeboid migration-driven, cell-on-cell, rearrangements as the major contributor to overall morphogenesis.</p><p>We ask the authors to give the reader a roughly quantitative evaluation of relative contributions of other factors to the overall morphogenesis such as cell shape change (a lot of new surface is generated, vegetal central cells seem to get long and thin), and intercalation of cells in the z-axis (see the various movies in which the z-axis is the mediolateral axis of the embryo) that also deserve consideration. We don't think new data, such as additional movies are needed, but a rough quantification of the relative contributions other processes would help the reader to assess the magnitude of contribution of amoeboid migration to the overall morphogenesis.</p><p>Reviewers ask if there might be a better term that &quot;vegetal rotation&quot;-such as just vegetal internalization or vegetal ingression-since &quot;rotation&quot; doesn't seem to describe much of the morphogenesis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27190.040</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>The three reviewers found the work to be a novel and valuable contribution to the area of cellular/developmental biology, specifically, mechanisms of morphogenesis.

We addressed these points by adding two and a half paragraphs to the first Results section, a new panel to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (i.e. new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), and multiple lines where appropriate in the following sections. Overall, we confirmed that cell rearrangement by migration is the main driver of endoderm tissue shape change. Cell elongation in an orientated fashion contributes to a lesser extent, but it is part of the amoeboid mode of cell migration anyway and thus not an independent mechanism. However, as the reviewers pointed out, intercalation in the z-plane was significant, and we took this process into consideration. In the time lapse recordings, we found no clear evidence that cells were actively migrating from deep layers into the surface layer of explants. Instead, it appeared that surface cells were moving apart locally to expose deep cells below, in this way giving rise to a z-plane intercalation event. We therefore assumed that migration occurs mainly in the x-y-plane of the explant, and z-plane intercalations are mostly “passive”. We acknowledge, however, that near the blastocoel floor a z-component of active movement would actually be expected, due to cell re-orientation.</p><p><italic>Reviewers ask if there might be a better term that &quot;vegetal rotation&quot;-such as just vegetal internalization or vegetal ingression-since &quot;rotation&quot; doesn't seem to describe much of the morphogenesis.</italic> </p><p>The term “vegetal rotation” was introduced with the original description of the process (Winklbauer and Schürfeld, 1999), and used since then by us and others for lack of a better term, although a rotational movement is indeed observed in large explants filmed over a sufficiently long time period (Winklbauer and Schürfeld, 1999), and in intact embryos using X-ray diffraction imaging (e.g. Moosmann et al., 2013) or NMR (Papan et al., 2007). With the present manuscript, we intend to replace the term on the basis of a more refined description of the process, but to refer to it, we still had to use this established term. Nevertheless, we changed the wording now so as to minimize its occurrence in the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
