non-randomised trial of sequencing at 14 acute UK hospital trusts.

In a ‘per-protocol’ sensitivity analysis, there was an impact on IPC actions in 20.7% of HOCI cases when the SRT report was returned within 5 days.

Sequencing technologies can now be used for local outbreak investigation in near real time, and this was implemented by some research centres for evaluation of nosocomial transmission from the early stages of the pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Meredith et al., 2020</xref>). It has been demonstrated that sequencing can provide additional information on outbreak characteristics and transmission routes in comparison to traditional epidemiological investigation alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Meredith et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lucey et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Snell et al., 2022b</xref>). However, limited data are available on the feasibility of routine use of sequencing for infection prevention and control (IPC), or on its direct impact on IPC actions and nosocomial transmission rates.</p><p>Throughout the pandemic, nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been a major concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbas et al., 2021</xref>), with hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) accounting for more than 5% of lab-confirmed cases from March to August 2020 in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhattacharya et al., 2021</xref>) and representing 11% of COVID-19 cases within hospitals in this period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Read et al., 2021</xref>). HAIs also frequently occur within a very vulnerable population with high levels of mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhattacharya et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Oliver, 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ponsford et al., 2021</xref>). There is therefore an unmet need to develop interventions that can reduce the occurrence of nosocomial transmission. The aims of this study were to determine the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing in informing acute IPC actions and reducing the incidence of HAIs when used prospectively in routine practice, and to record the impact of sequencing reports on the actions of IPC teams.</p><p>When this study was planned in the summer of 2020, there was imperfect knowledge regarding the dominant mode of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Greenhalgh et al., 2021</xref>), and it was not possible to predict the future course of the pandemic. In conducting this study, substantial difficulties were encountered in implementing the intervention and in responding effectively to any insights generated. As such, this report serves as a record of the challenge of conducting research within a pandemic as well as being a conventional study summary report.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a prospective multiphase non-randomised trial to evaluate the implementation and impact of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing for IPC within 14 acute NHS hospital groups in the UK. All sites were linked to a COG-UK sequencing hub, 13 were university hospitals and 1 a district general hospital. We implemented a bespoke sequence reporting tool (SRT) intervention, developed and previously evaluated for this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stirrup et al., 2021</xref>), and assessed the importance of turnaround time for sequencing and reporting. The study included integral health economic and qualitative process evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Flowers et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The study design comprised a planned 4-week baseline data collection period, followed by intervention periods defined by the time from diagnostic sampling to return of sequence data to IPC teams, comprising 8 weeks of ‘rapid’ (&lt;48 hr) turnaround sequencing and 4 weeks of ‘longer’ (5–10 days) turnaround sequencing for each site. Target turnaround time was 48 hr from diagnostic sampling to return of the SRT report during the ‘rapid’ sequencing phase, and 5–10 days for the ‘longer-turnaround’ phase. Eight sites implemented ‘rapid’ followed by ‘longer-turnaround’ phases with five doing the opposite. One site did not implement longer-turnaround sequencing because they considered it a reduction in their standard practice, comprising outbreak sequencing with weekly meetings to discuss phylogenetic analyses; they nonetheless completed the baseline phase of the study without use of the SRT or automated feedback to IPC teams on all hospital-onset COVID-19 infection (HOCI) cases. The order of the intervention phases was pragmatically determined in some sites by the need to first run the ‘longer-turnaround’ phase to develop sample transport and sequencing procedures before attempting the ‘rapid’ sequencing phase, and the ordering was decided in the remaining sites to ensure a mixture of intervention phases over calendar time – there was no randomisation process in deciding the order of study phases.</p><p>Data were recorded in all phases for all patients meeting the definition of a HOCI, that is, first confirmed test for SARS-CoV-2 &gt;48 hr after admission and without suspicion of COVID-19 at the time of admission. During the intervention phases, and for at least 3 weeks prior to any intervention period to enable linkage to recent cases, participating sites aimed to sequence all SARS-CoV-2 cases including both HOCI and non-HOCI cases.</p><p>The SRT aimed to integrate sequence and patient data to produce concise and immediately interpretable feedback about cases to IPC teams via a one-page report. Sites were also able to apply other methods (e.g. phylogenetics) to the sequence data generated, where this was part of their usual practice. Guidance regarding IPC actions was not specified as part of this study. Sites were expected to follow current national guidelines, which evolved throughout the course of the pandemic. Sequencing data from healthcare workers (HCWs) could be utilised in the SRT system, and this was implemented by 8/14 sites. Whether this was done depended on availability of HCW samples for each lab as staff testing was generally managed separately to patient testing. HCW testing protocols followed national guidelines.</p><p>Data collection on patient characteristics and on implementation and impact of the intervention was conducted using a central study-specific database. Ethical approval for the study was granted by NHS HRA (REC 20/EE/0118), and the study was prospectively registered (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04405934">ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04405934</ext-link>).</p><p>The primary outcomes of the study as defined in the protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blackstone et al., 2022</xref>) were (1) incidence of IPC-defined SARS-CoV-2 HAIs per week per 100 currently admitted non-COVID-19 inpatients, and (2) for each HOCI, identification of linkage to individuals within an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 nosocomial transmission using sequencing data as interpreted through the SRT that was not identified by pre-sequencing IPC evaluation during intervention phases. The second outcome used all observed HOCI cases as the denominator, and so represented the proportion of cases in which sequencing provided information regarding potential transmission routes where none had been previously uncovered.</p><p>Secondary outcomes were (1) incidence of IPC-defined SARS-CoV-2 hospital outbreaks per week per 1000 non-COVID-19 inpatients; (2) for each HOCI, any change to IPC actions following receipt of SRT report during intervention phases; and (3) any recommended change to IPC actions (regardless of whether changes were implemented). There was considered to be an impact on IPC actions if this was recorded for any of a number of predefined outcomes (e.g. enhanced cleaning, visitor and staffing restrictions, provision of personal protective equipment), or if it was stated that the report had effected any change to IPC practice on that ward or elsewhere within the hospital. The proportion of HOCI cases for which IPC reported the SRT report to be ‘useful’ was added as a further outcome.</p><p>To support standardisation across sites, ‘IPC-defined SARS-CoV-2 HAIs’ were considered to be all HOCIs with ≥8 days from admission to symptom onset (if known) or sample date (i.e. UK Health Security Agency definition of a probable/definite HAI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Public Health England, 2020</xref>).</p><p>An IPC-defined SARS-CoV-2 hospital outbreak was defined as at least two HOCI cases on the same ward, with at least one having ≥8 days from admission to symptom onset or sample date. Outbreak events were considered to be concluded once there was a period of 28 days prior to observation of another HOCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Public Health England, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Further details of outcome definitions are given in Appendix 1.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We used three approaches: intention-to-treat analysis to assess the overall impact of sequencing on IPC activity and the incidence of HAIs, per protocol site-based analysis on a subset of high-performance sites, and pooled analysis to describe how turnaround time was related to impact on IPC irrespective of study phase. Inclusion of sites in the per protocol analysis was based on the proportion of sequence reports returned and speed of return in the rapid phase. Thresholds to define this group were determined following review of the data but before analysis of outcomes.</p><p>Incidence outcomes were analysed using mixed effects negative binomial regression models, which in this context correspond to Poisson regression with an additional overdispersion parameter. Data for the first week of each intervention period, or in the first week of return to intervention following a break, were considered transition periods and not considered as direct evidence regarding the intervention effect. Analysis was conducted with calendar time divided into ‘study weeks’ running Monday–Sunday. Models were adjusted for calendar time, the proportion of current inpatients that were SARS-CoV-2 positive, as well as local community SARS-CoV-2 incidence for each study site, using 5 knot restricted cubic splines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kahan et al., 2016</xref>). The number of inpatients not positive for SARS-CoV-2 was considered an exposure variable (defining ‘person-time’ at risk of nosocomial infection). Differences between study phases were evaluated using adjusted incidence rate ratios.</p><p>The primary outcome of identification of SARS-CoV-2 nosocomial transmission using sequencing data and secondary outcomes relating to changes to IPC actions and the ‘usefulness’ of SRT reports were analysed using mixed effects logistic regression models, without covariable adjustment or removal of cases from the first week of each intervention phase. Marginal proportions from fitted models were reported for rapid- and longer-turnaround intervention phases, and differences in outcomes between these phases were evaluated. If the SRT report was not returned, this was interpreted as a ‘failure’, that is, no change to IPC action; however, we also present percentages for these outcomes restricted to HOCIs where the SRT report was returned.</p><p>For both incidence and ‘per HOCI’ outcomes, we accounted for the structure of the data with hierarchical exchangeable normally distributed random effects for each study site, and for each study phase within each study site. Analyses were conducted using Stata V16, with figures generated using the <italic>ggplot2</italic> package for R V4.0.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 2170 HOCIs were recorded for the study between 15 October 2020 and 26 April 2021.

The criteria for this analysis were decided after data collection but prior to data analysis, as per the statistical analysis plan (SAP). However, we acknowledge that the ‘higher performing sites’ did not meet the target turnaround time for reporting in the rapid phase; criteria were therefore set to split the sites into upper and lower 50% based on the level of implementation.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Plots of the median turnaround time against the percentage of hospital-onset COVID-19 infection (HOCI) cases with sequence reporting tool (SRT) reports returned for the rapid (left panel) and longer-turnaround (right panel) sequencing phases across the 14 study sites.</title><p>The size of each circle plotted indicates the number of HOCI cases observed within each phase for each site, with letter labels corresponding to study site.

The impact of phase on detecting nosocomial linkage was similar.</p><p>IPC teams more commonly reported finding the sequence reports useful in the rapid sequencing, 303/428 (70.8%) compared to the longer-turnaround phase, 107/215 (49.8%) (although this association was reversed on analysis within the multi-level mode specified, OR 0.82 rapid vs. longer-turnaround, 0.12–5.46; p=0.82), and the difference was more pronounced in the ‘per protocol’ analysis (79.0 vs. 27.2%, respectively; OR 3.44, 0.28–42.61; p=0.41). We explored this association further using the actual time to return of the reports, going beyond the analyses pre-specified in the SAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In the ‘per protocol’ analysis, an impact on IPC actions was observed in 20.7% (45/217) of HOCI cases in which the SRT report was returned within 5 days, but in very few cases beyond this, with this trend less apparent when data from all sites were considered. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> also displays a strong decline in reported usefulness of the SRT with increasing turnaround time, both across all sites and in the ‘per protocol’ analysis. Sequence reports were considered useful in 79.1% (182/230) of cases if returned within 5 days for all sites (169/216, 78%, in ‘per protocol’ analysis). However, we note that many of the HOCI cases with SRT returned within 5 days were from a single study site, and some sites did not seem to have clearly differentiated ‘useful’ SRT reports when completing data collection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Plots of the proportion of returned sequence reporting tool (SRT) reports that had an impact on infection prevention and control (IPC) actions (<bold>a</bold>,<bold> b</bold>) and that were reported to be useful by IPC teams (<bold>c</bold>,<bold> d</bold>).</title><p>Data are shown for all sites in (<bold>a</bold>) and (<bold>c</bold>), and for the seven sites included in the ’per protocol’ sensitivity analysis in (<bold>b</bold>) and (<bold>d</bold>).

SRT reports also suggested post-admission infection in the majority of indeterminate HAIs (diagnosed 3–7 days from admission) (176/223, 78.9%).</p><p>Our analysis models reveal important findings beyond the effect of the intervention. The analysis model for the incidence of HAIs identified independent positive associations with the proportion of current SARS-CoV-2-positive inpatients, the local community incidence of new SARS-CoV-2 cases (which peaked from December 2020 to January 2021, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5</xref>), and calendar time (modelled as ‘study week’). Adding the proportion of local community cases that were Alpha (lineage B.1.1.7) variant did not lead to a statistically significant improvement in model fit (p=0.78). The observed weekly HOCI incidence rates varied substantially from 0 to 7.6 per 100 SARS-CoV-2 negative inpatients, with peaks aligning with those for local community incidence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figure 4</xref>).</p><p>From modelling outbreaks, positive associations were similarly found for both hospital prevalence and community incidence of SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">Appendix 1—figure 6</xref>). The median number of HOCIs per IPC-defined outbreak event was four, with the largest observed outbreak including 43 HOCIs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>).</p><p>Extensive qualitative analyses (Mapp et al., under review; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Flowers et al., 2022</xref>) found high levels of acceptability for the SRT sequencing reports, which supported decision-making about IPC activity (e.g. stand down some IPC actions or continue as planned). In several sites, the major barriers to embedding and normalising the SRT within existing systems and processes were overcome. The SRT did provide new and valued insights into transmission events, outbreaks, and wider hospital functioning but mainly acted to offer confirmation and reassurance to IPC teams. Critically, given the context of the study within the pandemic timeline, the capacity to generate and respond to these insights effectively on a case-by-case basis was breached in most sites by the volume of HOCIs, and the limits of finite human and physical resource (e.g. hospital layout).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Cost of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing</title><p>Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing in the 10 laboratories which performed the tests for the sites included in the study showed that mean per-sample costs were on average higher for rapid (£78.11) vs. longer-turnaround (£66.94) sequencing.

The study was run as part of routine practice within the NHS, and the challenges faced in implementing the intervention reflected the context and barriers in winter 2020–2021 in the UK. We did not demonstrate a direct impact of sequencing on the primary outcome of the incidence of HAIs, either on full analysis or when restricted to the higher performing sites, and the overall proportion of cases with nosocomial transmission linkage identified using sequencing that had been missed by IPC investigation was &lt;10% in the intervention phases. However, on post hoc exploratory investigation among those sites with the most effective implementation of the sequencing intervention we showed that feedback within 5 days of diagnosis allowed for maximal impact on IPC actions. IPC teams, particularly in the ‘per protocol’ analysis, were almost all positive in their perception of the utility of viral sequencing for outbreak investigation.</p><p>The study was undertaken during a period of extreme strain on the NHS, with hospitals described as being ‘in the eye of a COVID-19 storm’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Oliver, 2021a</xref>). Sites reported that they lacked the additional resources, in terms of staff and bed space, needed to respond effectively to insights generated by sequencing. Furthermore, if the study were repeated now then IPC teams would have more evidence-backed tools at their disposal, such as increasing respirator usage. As such, we do not believe that the null result for the impact on incidence of nosocomial transmission should be taken as strong evidence for a general lack of effectiveness of viral WGS for IPC.</p><p>Outbreak investigations are inherently complex and must take account of uncertainty regarding transmission links, even in the presence of high-quality genomic data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lindsey et al., 2022</xref>). Interventions centred on IPC practices often need to be evaluated at the hospital level in order to allow for impacts on transmission across an institution as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">O’Hara et al., 2019</xref>), meaning that large multicentre studies are required to generate high-quality evidence. Standardisation of data collection with complex structures across multiple hospital sites is a considerable challenge. A review of IPC practice guidelines conducted prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic found that most recommendations were based on evidence from descriptive studies, expert opinion, and other low-quality evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mitchell et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The use of viral WGS for public health surveillance has become firmly established in the UK for SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">The COVID-19 Genomics UK consortium, 2020</xref>). This enabled early detection of the increased transmissibility and health impact of the Alpha variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Volz et al., 2021</xref>) and subsequent monitoring of the Delta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mishra et al., 2021</xref>) and Omicron variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrews et al., 2022</xref>). However, whilst viral WGS for acute outbreak investigation has been shown for both SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Meredith et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Snell et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lumley et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li et al., 2021</xref>) and other viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Houldcroft et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Roy et al., 2019</xref>) to better identify sources of hospital-acquired infections and transmission chains, its impact on the management and outcome of nosocomial infection has not previously been quantified. Our study provides a substantial body of evidence regarding the introduction of viral WGS into routine IPC practice, its potential usage for outbreak management, and the challenges that need to be overcome to achieve implementation across the UK.</p><p>There are several limitations that may have impacted the results of this study. The study was conducted between October 2020 and April 2021. In this period, the local community incidence for the study sites ranged from &lt;50 to &gt;1200 weekly cases per 100,000 people. There were corresponding large variations in the healthcare burden of COVID-19, with several sites recording weeks when more than half of all inpatients were SARS-CoV-2 positive. High community infection rates and associated increases in the incidence of HOCI cases contributed to difficulties for site research teams in generating good quality viral sequences and reports for all HOCI cases within target time frames.</p><p>Our qualitative analyses also found that the capacity of sites to react to information generated by the sequencing intervention was breached by the volume of HOCI and admitted COVID-19 cases (“we’ve been basically deluged”, IPC staff) in combination with the finite personnel resources and limited physical space for isolation that was available (“The trouble is when you have so many wards going down and such a high prevalence of COVID, your actions are kind of the same regardless”, IPC staff). It may therefore be more achievable to develop effective systems for rapid viral WGS and feedback for endemic respiratory viruses at lower and more consistent levels, and more timely reporting of results might be associated with greater impact on IPC actions. As well as acute changes to IPC actions, there is the potential for routine pathogen sequencing to allow prospective IPC practice and policies to be refined. This could enable a longer-term reduction in the incidence of nosocomial infection at any given site, and such effects would be less dependent on turnaround time of sequencing in any given case. However, the capacity of sites to make such informed adjustments to IPC practice was limited during peaks in incidence of SARS-CoV-2 over the time scale of this study.</p><p>Planning this study and developing the data collection forms during the early stages of a novel viral pandemic was challenging, as in the summer of 2020 there were still ongoing debates around the primary mode of viral transmission and optimal IPC practice, and global supply chains for personal protective equipment were strained. In the planning of an equivalent study now, there would be a greater focus on adjustments to ventilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen and Ibrahim, 2021</xref>), air filtration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Conway Morris et al., 2022</xref>), and respirator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ferris et al., 2021</xref>) usage. It would also be possible to be more prescriptive and standardised regarding the recommended changes to IPC practice in response to sequencing findings, with the potential that our improved knowledge and available tools might facilitate a measurable impact on the incidence of nosocomial transmission.</p><p>The peak in SARS-CoV-2 levels from December 2020 to January 2021 corresponded to the rise of the highly transmissible Alpha variant in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Volz et al., 2021</xref>). We did not find that the local prevalence of the Alpha variant was associated with the incidence rate of HAIs, beyond any effect mediated by higher community incidence. This matches the conclusions of a previously reported sub-study analysis using data from our sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boshier et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The study intervention made use of a bespoke SRT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stirrup et al., 2021</xref>). The SRT combined both patient metadata and sequencing data, providing a single-page, easily interpretable report for IPC teams. It also facilitated standardisation of data collection across sites. Interestingly, while HOCIs diagnosed 3–7 days after admission are generally excluded from assessments of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Oliver, 2021b</xref>), because of difficulty in distinguishing them from community-acquired infections, the SRT reported the majority (78.9%) of these indeterminate HAIs as being hospital-acquired. This confirms findings from a retrospective study using genomic linkage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lumley et al., 2021</xref>), and may reflect a shorter incubation time for the Alpha variant compared to earlier variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Snell et al., 2022a</xref>; although this remains uncertain; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blanquart et al., 2022</xref>), indicating that definitions used for monitoring and reporting may need to be kept under active review. Variants with shorter incubation times would lead to a greater importance for the rapidity of feedback in informing adjustments to IPC actions.</p><p>A number of limitations of the SRT were recognised, and work is ongoing to rectify these for future studies. The SRT’s probability calculations did not include patient and HCW movements. The SRT gave feedback on cases that could plausibly form part of the same outbreak but did not identify direct transmission pairs or networks, as has been done in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lindsey et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Illingworth et al., 2022</xref>). HCW sequencing data could not be incorporated at all sites due to logistical and data management and access constraints. Implementation of an improved tool with these features might help to better identify routes of transmission within a hospital that could be interrupted, for example, through changes to the management of ward transfers for patients, isolation policies or identification of areas within the hospital linked to high risk of transmission. Finally, samples with less than 90% genome coverage were not included within the reporting system, despite the fact that they may still be useful for phylogenetic analyses.</p><p>The study sites varied in their ability to process sequence and metadata and generate and distribute reports in a timely manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), and the targeted turnaround times for reporting were not achieved at any of the sites for the majority of HOCIs in either the ‘rapid’ or ‘longer turnaround’ phases. Sites that had established teams with existing genomics expertise and on-site sequencing facilities were generally more successful at implementing the SRT into clinical practice (Mapp et al., under review). There is a need to focus on how sequencing and reporting processes can be integrated within local infrastructure and tailoring of local processes to ensure clear chains of communication from diagnostic labs through to the IPC team. Precisely understanding the barriers to achieving rapid turnaround times is key to future IPC use of viral WGS and is currently being analysed in a follow-up secondary analysis. Standardising and automating more of the SRT production pipeline will also help reduce the implementation burden at sites.</p><p>The study covered a period in which a national vaccination programme was initiated for HCWs and the elderly population in the UK, commencing with those ≥80 years from 8 December 2020. We had planned to include data on the proportion of HCWs who had received at least one vaccine dose as a variable in the analysis of incidence outcomes. This was subsequently not included because data was only available from 10 sites, for which rollout of HCW vaccination was broadly consistent. As such, any effect of HCW or patient vaccination on the incidence outcomes would form part of the estimated association with calendar time.</p><p>With the sequencing technology now available and high levels of interest in viral genomics for public health, there is the potential to incorporate viral WGS into routine IPC practice. Many publications have already highlighted the utility of viral sequence data for changing IPC policy and auditing the management of outbreaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Meredith et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Snell et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lumley et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Houldcroft et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Roy et al., 2019</xref>). We did not demonstrate an effect of our sequencing intervention on our primary outcome of the incidence of HAIS, and there were challenges in the implementation of the intervention. However, our study provides the first prospective evidence that with faster turnaround times, viral sequences can inform ongoing IPC actions in managing nosocomial infections; on post hoc exploratory analysis results returned within ≤5 days from sampling to result changed the actions of IPC teams in around 20% of cases. The SRT, by rapidly combining sequence and patient metadata, was also better able than standard IPC definitions alone to distinguish hospital and community-acquired infections within a clinically relevant time scale. The difference in the cost of rapid compared with longer-turnaround hospital sample sequencing is low relative to the overall cost level at present (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table4">Appendix 1—table 4</xref>). Assuming SARS-CoV-2 sequencing for public health purposes continues, the added cost of rapid sequencing for IPC purposes could potentially be offset by the benefits accrued.</p><p>While we did not show an impact of sequencing on the numbers of HAIs or outbreaks, the evidence that these correlated with the high community SARS-CoV-2 rates suggests that factors beyond the control of IPC were influential. Our study nonetheless provides valuable evidence regarding the implementation and utility of this technology for IPC, and potentially it will have a greater positive impact on IPC practice outside of the burdens and resource constraints imposed by a pandemic. Importantly for future research, we provide a wealth of data on why the study worked better at some sites than others, and the challenges that would need to be overcome to make full use of viral genome sequencing for IPC practice more widely. It remains to be demonstrated that viral sequencing can have a direct impact on clinical outcomes such as the incidence of HAIs, and further prospective studies with refined implementation of similar interventions are required to address this.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>has an unpaid role as Deputy Chair, British Medical Association London Regional Council.

estimation</title><p>There was uncertainty in the number of HOCIs that would be identified at each site during each of the intervention periods, with the rapid sequencing phase being 8 weeks’ duration. We assumed that there may be an average of 10 HOCIs/week per site during this intervention period, a total of 80 per site. Within a typical site this would allow us to estimate the proportion of HOCIs with genotypic linkage to another case(s) not detected by IPC processes with minimum precision of ±9.4%. Similarly, we would be able to estimate the proportion of HOCIs where an action is taken that would not have occurred without sequencing within ±9.4%, with a pooled estimate of key proportions across the 14 sites implementing rapid sequencing within ±6.5% assuming an intra-cluster correlation coefficient of 0.05.</p><p>Comparing the proportion of HOCIs with genotypic linkage to another case(s) not detected by IPC processes between rapid testing and delayed testing phases across all sites, the study aimed for at least 80% power to detect a percentage point difference of 11% (two-sided test with alpha = 0.05, considering proportions of 55.5% vs. 44.5% which would be associated with minimum power for a difference of this magnitude).</p><p>For the outcome of weekly incidence of IPC-defined HOCIs, using an approximate normal distribution for weekly counts there was 86.7% power to demonstrate a reduction from 12 IPC-defined HOCIs per week in the baseline phase to 10 per week during the rapid testing phase across all sites, under 5% significance level two-tailed testing. However, these calculations correspond to a variance of 12 for weekly counts based on the Poisson distribution, but the presence of over-dispersion of weekly counts would lead to a lower power to detect a difference. Using an overdispersion parameter of 0.82 based on retrospective analysis of data from Sheffield and Glasgow (dataset as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stirrup et al., 2021</xref>) resulted in 81% power to detect a reduction in mean weekly incidence from 12.5 to 10.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s9"><title>Planned secondary outcomes dropped from formal analysis</title><p>We did not carry out formal statistical analysis for the following planned secondary outcomes:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Weekly incidence of IPC + sequencing-defined SARS-CoV-2 hospital outbreaks, measured as incidence rate per week per 100 non-COVID-19 inpatients, during each phase of the study based on case report forms.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The number of HCW periods of sickness/self-isolation as assessed as a proportion of the number of staff usually on those wards impacted by HOCI cases, for all phases of the study.</p></list-item></list><p>The first of these was dropped prior to analysis because of incomplete sequencing coverage of HOCI cases in the intervention phases – it was not felt that this would add useful information given the level of sequencing achieved and the null results for other incidence outcomes. The second was dropped (again prior to any statistical analysis) because of low levels of data completion at most of the study sites. Data collection on HCW absence was discontinued whilst the study was ongoing in order to reduce the administrative burden for sites and due to difficulties in accessing this data for research staff (with staff data being recorded on separate systems to patient data).</p><p>We also omitted specific reporting of the secondary outcome of ‘Ideal changes to IPC actions following receipt of sequencing report’. This was because no recommended changes to IPC actions were recorded that were also recorded as ‘not implemented’.

However, this was dropped because these supplementary data could not be obtained from four sites (and one site was only able to provide partial data). Where available, the data showed the rollout of HCW vaccination to be broadly consistent across sites. As such, any effect of HCW vaccination on the incidence outcomes would be incorporated into estimates of variation in relation to calendar time.</p><p>Local community incidence was not included within the SAP, but was added as an adjustment factor for incidence models because within-hospital prevalence of patients admitted for SARS-CoV-2 did not correlate perfectly with local incidence (e.g. due to triage of COVID-19 patients to different hospitals).</p><p>The proportion of HOCI cases in which the sequencing report feedback was considered to be ‘useful’ was added as a secondary outcome.</p><p>It was stated in the SAP: “We will conduct sensitivity analyses excluding study sites and/or periods with suboptimal implementation of the trial intervention, both in terms of overall population sequencing coverage for HOCIs and the turnaround time for sequence reports being returned to IPC teams. The exact criteria for this will be decided amongst the study team before any analysis has been conducted.” This forms the basis for the ‘per protocol’ analyses presented. It was not possible to prespecify the exact criteria. After data collection for the study had been completed, it became clear that none of the sites had met target turnaround times for sequence reporting in the intervention phases, and so it was decided to set criteria to select the 50% ‘higher performing’ sites.</p><p>It was stated in the SAP: “If the target turnaround time for sequence generation and reporting is missed for a substantial proportion of HOCI cases in each of the intervention phases, then results [for Impact on IPC actions] will also be reported separately for the subset of cases for which the intervention was implemented within the target timeframe.” Because the proportion of HOCI cases with SRT report returned within the target time frame was low for the rapid intervention phases, we instead reported the association of this outcome with turnaround time more generally.</p><p>The SAP did not state that unadjusted estimates would be reported for the incidence rate ratios for HAIs and outtbreaks, but these have been added for completeness in response to the comments of a Reviewer (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table5">Appendix 1—table 5</xref>).</p><p>Weekly incidence rates for outbreak events are displayed as ‘/1000 inpatients’ rather than ‘/100 inpatients’ to improve display.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s18"><title>Small sample correction</title><p>The topic of small sample corrections for cluster randomised and other cluster-structured studies (e.g. stepped wedge trials) with outcomes that are not normally distributed is an area of ongoing active research. To our knowledge, there do not exist any studies regarding appropriate corrections for clustered data when analysing an outcome with negative binomial distribution.

A recommendation regarding this decision was made by the study investigators and agreed with the TSC-DMC. The decision was determined by the course of the epidemic and the progress of vaccination among key risk groups, and by the quantity of data collected by the end of Period 3. The decision was not based on any interim evaluation of the effect of the sequencing intervention under investigation on the incidence of nosocomial infection.</p><p>A decision was made to stop the study at the end of Period 3 because the total sample size was close to that projected for the study, and few new HOCI cases were being recorded at this point in time.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s20"><title>Further details for incidence model specification</title><p>The primary outcome of incidence of SARS-CoV-2 HAIs was analysed using a mixed effects negative binomial regression model. This acts as an extension of a Poisson regression model, with an additional parameter allowing for overdispersion (for a Poisson model the variance is always the mean for any given combination of covariables and conditional on random effect terms). The negative binomial regression model is a generalised linear model, which uses a log-link function for the expectation of the outcome variable. In our analysis, we used nested independent normally distributed random effects for each study site, and for each study phase within each study site, which were incorporated into the ‘linear predictor’ for the expectation of the outcome variable as for other forms of linear mixed effects model. The variance of the two random effects components of the model was estimated within the maximum likelihood estimation for the model.</p><p>The command used in Stata to run this model was of the form:</p><p><code xml:space="preserve">menbreg n_HAIs i.study_phase_analysis prop_cov_sp_* study_week_sp_* community_inc_sp_*, exposure(exposure_pw) || site_anon: || study_phase:, irr dispersion(constant)</code></p><p>Where the dataset under analysis included one row per study week at each site, with the variables defined as</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>n_HAIs: Number of HAIs observed at each sites in each study week</p></list-item><list-item><p>study_phase_analysis: Intervention phase for each study week, with separate categories for the first week of each intervention phase at each site (to allow for 1 week to pass before potential impact on incidence of HAIs)</p></list-item><list-item><p>prop_cov_sp_*: Spline basis variables for proportion of inpatients who were SARS-CoV-2 positive at each site in each study week</p></list-item><list-item><p>study_week_sp_*: Spline basis variables for adjustment for calendar time</p></list-item><list-item><p>community_inc_sp_*: Spline basis variables for local community incidence for each site in each study week</p></list-item><list-item><p>exposure_pw: person-weeks of SARS-CoV-2 negative inpatients at each site for each study week (i.e. sum of patient-time at-risk for nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection)</p></list-item></list></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s21"><title>Qualitative analyses</title><p>An exploratory, qualitative process evaluation using iterative programme theory employed semi-structured interviews with 39 diverse healthcare professionals between December 2020 and June 2021.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Marc J Bonten as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jos van der Meer as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Ben S Cooper and Mark Pritchard (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The questions raised by the reviewers address clarifications and interpretation of data, and we invite you to respond to these.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Interpretational questions, comments</p><p>The turnaround times achieved are, definitely for the &quot;rapid&quot; part, much longer than was targeted, with overall 9,3% reported in time. This implies that even in the settings tested (which I consider &quot;as good as it gets&quot;) these targets were too optimistic. Yet, there is a clear difference in reporting time between the 2 strategies, and that difference, as achieved, was not associated with a beneficial outcome on any of the measured outcome parameters. In fact, the proportion of HOCI in which an unexpected linkage was detected based upon WGS was low in both study phases. And the changes in IPC that were realized were infrequent (7.4-7.8%), and associated with short turnaround times. My interpretation would be that reporting of WGS was still too slow to act as a true intervention, and, therefore, no effects could be demonstrated, as stated &quot;In 91.9%, (589/641, Table S2) of cases the reports were interpreted as supportive of IPC actions already taken.&quot;</p><p>Nevertheless, it was stated that &quot;Extensive qualitative analyses[15] found high levels of acceptability for the SRT sequencing reports, which supported decision-making about IPC activity (e.g. stand down some IPC actions or continue as planned).&quot;</p><p>I think that the authors are overly optimistic about the impact of WGS reporting in this study in the discussion:</p><p>Line 295: &quot;Our study provides a substantial body of evidence regarding the introduction of viral WGS into hospital functioning, routine IPC practice, its potential impact on outbreak management and the challenges that need to be overcome to achieve implementation across the UK.&quot; I don't understand what is meant with &quot;that the study provides evidence for its potential impact&quot;, as statistically significant impact is not demonstrated for any of the study outcomes.</p><p>Line 346: &quot;Our study provides the first evidence that with faster turnaround times, viral sequences can inform ongoing IPC actions in managing nosocomial infections; results returned within {less than or equal to}5 days from sampling to result changed the actions of IPC teams in around 20% of cases.&quot; On an intention-to-treat basis there was no significant effect on the occurrence of HOCI, and it doesn't become clear from Tables S2 and S3 that IPC practices were changed importantly. In fact, according to these tables it looks as if hardly any IPC actions were changed. It is not clear from these tables if – in instances where measures were taken – more measures were taken simultaneously. That could be made more clear. For instance in Table S3 for Rapid and support: were measures taken in 5 of 70 outbreaks or in 30 of 70 (if you sum up all individual measures).</p><p>The research question remains whether even shorter turnaround times for more patients with HOCI could have an impact on transmissions and – ultimately – patient outcome. I would think that WGS could only have such an impact if IPC measures would be different for different genotypes or would be different if transmission was demonstrated. The authors could better explain why and under what circumstances they expect that WGS reporting could impact patient care.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The study appears to have excluded cases where linkage between cases was established on epidemiological grounds before sequencing occurred. This both makes it more difficult to see an effect of sequencing and begs the question about the intensity and comparability of IPC programs across the study hospitals. Hospitals with aggressive and capable IPC teams may have very good insight into nosocomial case sources and factors by virtue of their epidemiologic evaluations and thus have less room to benefit from sequencing.</p><p>2. The investigators report that nosocomial infection was not suspected in ~7% of HOCI cases. Please contextualize by stating what % of HOCI cases were suspected to be nosocomial.</p><p>3. It would be helpful to describe in the main body of the manuscript the kinds of actions that were expected of IPC programs and how they might decrease hospital-acquired infections.</p><p>4. Please clarify the criteria for higher performer sites. On the face of it, SRT in ~40% of cases and median time from diagnostic sample to SRT of up to 8 days doesn't seem like high performance relative to the study goals. Were there other aspects to these sites that differentiated them besides sequencing speed? Did they have larger or more experienced or more aggressive infection control teams just as they appear to have more effective sequencing teams?</p><p>5. Was there a standardized protocol for how IPC teams were to respond to sequencing data? Without this it's possible that opportunities existed to reduce transmission based on sequencing reports that were not taken.</p><p>6. Did study sequencing and SRTs incorporate healthcare worker test results? If so, please describe testing requirements for healthcare workers. Did they get serial testing or only in response to symptoms or exposures? If cluster detection did not include healthcare worker test results then this could lead to substantial underdetection of nosocomial events as well as obscure to IPCs the source of nosocomial cases and thus how best to contain them.</p><p>7. Please comment on the median incubation period for hospital-onset cases. With α and subsequent variants, incubation periods have become quite short thus progressively increasing the importance of speed in sequencing to have a potential impact on infections.</p><p>8. In our hospital experience, the highest value from sequencing has not been control of live outbreaks but rather insights gained regarding the robustness of global infection control policies (is a surgical mask protective, do AGPs increase risk, what is the risk of transmission between people in shared rooms, etc.). Hospitals that choose to act on these insights will make structural changes to their IPC programs (e.g. switch from surgical mask to respirators, change testing practices around AGPs, decrease use of shared rooms, increase ventilation within rooms, etc.) that ideally will not just be cluster-specific but lasting changes. This means that the incremental value of sequencing may decrease over time to the extent that one puts these successive changes into place. But sequencing itself was invaluable in providing the insights that led to these changes. In addition, these insights and policy changes are arguably less sensitive to turnaround time – the insights themselves are key but the responses transcend any one cluster and thus are less time sensitive.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The potential effect of the intervention depends on infection prevention measures that would have been taken in the absence of sequencing, and how hospitals' infection prevention and control teams respond to the sequencing results. There is therefore considerable potential for variability in the effect of the intervention between hospitals. From the methods it is not clear how analyses accounted for the effect of differences between hospitals. More generally, there is a lack of transparency as to precisely what the modelling assumptions were. It is important to either specify the models used unambiguosly using appropriate notation (including details on link functions and all random effects) in the methods or to provide the full STATA code used for the analysis (ideally, of course, both of these things should be done). It also important to specify which analyses were pre-specified in a statistical analysis plan and which were unplanned.</p><p>2. What the authors refer to as the &quot;per protocol&quot; sensitivity analysis in fact seems to be an unplanned sub-group analysis. Given that none of the trusts completely adhered to the protocol referring to this as a &quot;per protocol&quot; analysis seems misleading.</p><p>3. It is also important to see the difference between hospitals displayed in the results. Taking Figure 2 as an example, as the results are currently presented it is impossible to tell whether trends with increased time to result represent trends within each hospital, or a difference between those hospitals that tend to produce rapid results compared to those that tend to produce less rapid results. It should be a simple matter to produce a graph showing unaggregated results from each hospital together with the fitted model (and prediction intervals).</p><p>4. As the authors discuss, this trial took place during a period of significant variation in covid-19 prevalence, both in the community and among hospital patients. They report having adjusted their results for this. It would be useful to see both unadjusted and adjusted results to show the impact of this adjustment.</p><p>5. One hospital did not participate in the longer turnaround arm as this was considered inferior to their standard practice. Please describe current levels of whole genome use in these hospitals so that it is explicit how the intervention differs from the baseline conditions.</p><p>6. Please re-check the odds ratio on line 222. The rapid sequencing has a greater proportion of finding it helpful so the odds ratio should be greater than 1. If this is correct due to adjustment, please report this as adjusted OR and add details of adjustment.</p><p>7. It is important that the discussion starts with a clear statement that for the two primary outcomes no benefit of either intervention was shown and that this was true both in the main analysis and in the sensitivity analysis.</p><p>8. Line 274 &quot;Among sites with the most effective implementation of the sequencing intervention we showed that feedback within 5 days of diagnosis allowed for maximal impact on IPC actions&quot;. This appears to be an unplanned subgroup analysis of a secondary outcome, and as such needs to come with suitable caveats.</p><p>9. Line 317 &quot; may reflect a shorter incubation time for the Α variant compared to earlier variants&quot; While there has been speculation about shorter incubation times for the Α variant, we are not aware of strong evidence that supports this, and recent analysis suggests similar generation time for the Α variant and earlier variants (see, for example, https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.08.21267454 which has now been accepted for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>).</p><p>10. Line 345. &quot;Our study provides the first evidence that with faster turnaround</p><p>times, viral sequences can inform ongoing IPC actions in managing nosocomial infections; &quot; While generally the paper strikes an appropriate note of cautious optimism for the approach despite the negative results in this trial, and it is understandable that the authors might want to emphasize the more positive aspects of the results when considering implications for sequencing to inform IPC measures, there is a danger that this statement (and the whole paragraph) is interpreted as attempting to put a positive spin on an essentially negative result. Thus, while it is reasonable to mention that in a minority of cases IPC actions were informed by viral sequencing data, it is equally important to emphasize that there was no evidence those measures had a positive impact on patient outcomes (it is surely equally possible that IPC actions informed by sequencing had a negative impact). Furthermore, it needs to be emphasized that in the main (planned) analysis there was no difference in the number of IPC actions informed by the sequencing results in rapid and longer-turnaround arms. It would be helpful to add here an explicit acknowledgement of the uncertain benefits and resource implications in this paragraph along with a discussion of how we might robustly evaluate the effectiveness (and cost-effectiveness) of WGS methods for IPC in the future, and in particular, emphasising what we learn from this trial.</p><p>11. Lines 596-602 Two planned secondary outcomes are not reported because they were either not thought to be useful or were insufficiently complete. While it seems reasonable to not conduct formal analysis for these reasons, surely these outcomes should still be reported somewhere given they were specified in the protocol and data does seem to have been obtained for them. Clearly, if researchers are permitted to selectively choose which of the planned outcomes to report there is large potential for bias.</p><p>Additional comments</p><p>1. line 528-9 &quot;Site A observed 0 HOCI cases &quot; – presumably this is just for longer-turnaround phase, as A appears on the graph in the rapid phase.</p><p>2. Figures S3 and S4: solid and dashed lines are not defined. Also, shading might be clearer than the dashed lines.</p><p>3. In Table 3, a number of outcomes are reported as 0.0 per 100 patients. It would be more helpful to display these in a unit that allows easy display of at least one significant figure, e.g. per 10 000.</p><p>4. Some figures use the colours red and green as the only way to distinguish between baseline and rapid periods. The additional distinction might help readers who are unable to distinguish between these colours.</p><p>5. The results have a subsection titled health economics. This is limited to laboratory costs, and has no reference to changes in outcomes or costs or savings associated with changing practice on the wards. We suggest changing the title to costs of tests.</p><p>6. Lab 9 appears to have had larger batch sizes and a significant cost saving associated with rapid testing. Is this due to the difference in prevalence at the different times they were following each protocol, or is there a difference in practice that could be applied more widely?</p><p>7. It is interesting to note how much more frequently teams reported finding the report useful compared to how often they reported using it to change practice. Was any information collected on this? Were they reporting reassurance from the results or were they useful in some other way?</p><p>8. Please define IRR on first use in the text and abstract.</p><p>9. Abstract and line 200 &quot;We did not detect a statistically significant change&quot;.</p><p>Recommendations in the statistical literature (e.g. consensus statement from the ASA or https://www.bmj.com/content/322/7280/226.1) advise against dichotomising results based on arbitrary p-values. While clearly many researchers do continue to use the language of &quot;statistical significance&quot; despite such recommendations, we would at least suggest the authors consider avoiding what many consider to be outmoded practice.</p><p>10.

Your revised article has been evaluated by Jos van der Meer (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>In an ideal world, it would be nice if there was more framing of the work in the abstract, intro, and discussion to highlight that the study took place during an earlier phase of the pandemic when there was less insight into viral transmission, gaps in public health teaching about how best to prevent nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and dire shortages of PPE, personnel, beds, and lab capacity. These are all important caveats that luckily are less acute now but strongly impact the interpretation of the study. I wish these caveats were pronounced more prominently in the paper in order to defend against the overly simplistic conclusion that WGS does not aid infection control of SARS-CoV-2.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78427.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Interpretational questions, comments</p><p>The turnaround times achieved are, definitely for the &quot;rapid&quot; part, much longer than was targeted, with overall 9,3% reported in time.

These criteria were used to select the sites in the bottom right corner of the ‘Rapid phase’ plot in Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Were there other aspects to these sites that differentiated them besides sequencing speed? Did they have larger or more experienced or more aggressive infection control teams just as they appear to have more effective sequencing teams?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, there were differences between the sites in their staffing and organisation of IPC teams, but these were not formally investigated. Some discussion regarding how this impacted on implementation of the HOCI intervention will be included in the full qualitative process evaluation, for example: routinisation of discussion of sequencing reports, dynamic leadership, effective and rapid sharing of sequencing reports. We have now switched to analysis of a fully anonymised data without site names for data governance reasons and are unable to link the study data back to individual sites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Was there a standardized protocol for how IPC teams were to respond to sequencing data? Without this it's possible that opportunities existed to reduce transmission based on sequencing reports that were not taken.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see response to comment #3 above. We agree that opportunities to reduce transmission will have been missed due to imperfect understanding of the virus and optimal strategies, limited staff and PPE and constraints associated with aging buildings and chronic underinvestment in the health service.</p><p>In the planning of the study, there was considerable debate about guidance for IPC teams. Given the heterogeneity of the sites and their resources it was felt that it was best left for sites to generate local solutions. The sites were not in a position to routinely follow systematic guidance for IPC reactions to sequencing data in winter 2020/2021.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Did study sequencing and SRTs incorporate healthcare worker test results? If so, please describe testing requirements for healthcare workers. Did they get serial testing or only in response to symptoms or exposures? If cluster detection did not include healthcare worker test results then this could lead to substantial underdetection of nosocomial events as well as obscure to IPCs the source of nosocomial cases and thus how best to contain them.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the following text to the Methods:</p><p>‘Sequencing data from healthcare workers (HCW) could be utilised in the SRT system, and this was implemented by 8/14 sites. Whether this was done depended on availability of HCW samples for each lab as staff testing was generally managed separately to patient testing. HCW testing protocols followed national guidelines’.</p><p>We have also added the following to the Discussion:</p><p>‘HCW sequencing data could not be incorporated at all sites dues to logistical and data management and access constraints’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Please comment on the median incubation period for hospital-onset cases. With α and subsequent variants, incubation periods have become quite short thus progressively increasing the importance of speed in sequencing to have a potential impact on infections.</p></disp-quote><p>We had mentioned the potentially lower incubation time of the Α variant in the Discussion, but we have now also added the following:</p><p>‘Variants with shorter incubation times would lead to a greater importance for the rapidity of feedback in informing adjustments to IPC actions’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. In our hospital experience, the highest value from sequencing has not been control of live outbreaks but rather insights gained regarding the robustness of global infection control policies (is a surgical mask protective, do AGPs increase risk, what is the risk of transmission between people in shared rooms, etc.). Hospitals that choose to act on these insights will make structural changes to their IPC programs (e.g. switch from surgical mask to respirators, change testing practices around AGPs, decrease use of shared rooms, increase ventilation within rooms, etc.) that ideally will not just be cluster-specific but lasting changes. This means that the incremental value of sequencing may decrease over time to the extent that one puts these successive changes into place. But sequencing itself was invaluable in providing the insights that led to these changes. In addition, these insights and policy changes are arguably less sensitive to turnaround time – the insights themselves are key but the responses transcend any one cluster and thus are less time sensitive.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for flagging this. We agree with the points raised, and have added the following to the Discussion:</p><p>‘As well as acute changes to IPC actions, there is the potential for routine pathogen sequencing to allow prospective IPC practice and policies to be refined. This could enable a longer-term reduction in the incidence of nosocomial infection at any given site, and such effects would be less dependent on turnaround time of sequencing in any given case. However, the capacity of sites to make such informed adjustments to IPC practice were limited during peaks in incidence of SARS-CoV-2 over the timescale of the present study’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. The potential effect of the intervention depends on infection prevention measures that would have been taken in the absence of sequencing, and how hospitals' infection prevention and control teams respond to the sequencing results.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added to the Methods ‘Guidance regarding IPC actions was not specified as part of this study. Sites were expected to follow current national guidelines, which evolved throughout the course of the pandemic’, and also relevant text to the Results:</p><p>“Planning this study … during the early stages of a novel viral pandemic was challenging… In the planning of an equivalent study now.. It would also be possible to be more prescriptive and standardised regarding the recommended changes to IPC practice in response to sequencing findings”.</p><p>We do not feel that it would have been possible to be prescriptive regarding IPC actions in the summer of 2020, particularly given differences between sites in IPC organisation and available resources.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is therefore considerable potential for variability in the effect of the intervention between hospitals. From the methods it is not clear how analyses accounted for the effect of differences between hospitals.</p></disp-quote><p>The analysis models included site-phase random effect terms, which allow for variability in the effect of the intervention. However, we were aiming to find evidence of an overall reduction in the incidence of nosocomial infections across the sites. Analyses did not directly adjust for differences between hospitals in IPC actions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More generally, there is a lack of transparency as to precisely what the modelling assumptions were. It is important to either specify the models used nambiguously using appropriate notation (including details on link functions and all random effects) in the methods or to provide the full STATA code used for the analysis (ideally, of course, both of these things should be done).</p></disp-quote><p>We feel that the original text of the manuscript does give an appropriate degree of detail regarding the models used for statistical analysis. However, we have added further clarification to the Appendices as requested within a new subsection</p><p>‘Further details for incidence model specification’ which includes indicative Stata code. We have also added to the Statistical Analysis subsection of the main text that such models ‘..in this context correspond to Poisson regression with an additional overdispersion parameter’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It also important to specify which analyses were pre-specified in a statistical analysis plan and which were unplanned.</p></disp-quote><p>For the most part the analyses presented were prespecified in the SAP. However, we have clarified in the text that the results in Figure 2 go beyond the evaluation specified in the SAP, and we have ensured that the ‘Changes with respect to the statistical analysis plan (SAP)’ subsection in the Appendix is fully comprehensive.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. What the authors refer to as the &quot;per protocol&quot; sensitivity analysis in fact seems to be an unplanned sub-group analysis. Given that none of the trusts completely adhered to the protocol referring to this as a &quot;per protocol&quot; analysis seems misleading.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the following clarification in the ‘Changes with respect to the statistical analysis plan’ section of the Appendix:</p><p>“It was stated in the SAP that “We will conduct sensitivity analyses excluding study sites and/or periods with suboptimal implementation of the trial intervention, both in terms of overall population sequencing coverage for HOCIs and the turnaround time for sequence reports being returned to IPC teams. The exact criteria for this will be decided amongst the study team before any analysis has been conducted”. This forms the basis for the ‘per protocol’ analyses presented. It was not possible to prespecify the exact criteria. After data collection for the study had been completed it became clear that none of the sites had met target turnaround times for sequence reporting in the intervention phases, and so it was decided to set criteria to select the 50% ‘higher performing’ sites.”</p><p>We feel that ‘per protocol’ is a useful concise term to describe this sensitivity analysis, but have added inverted commas throughout and have now noted in the Results that:</p><p>“The criteria for this analysis were decided after data collection but prior to data analysis, as per the statistical analysis plan (SAP). However, we acknowledge that the ‘higher performing sites’ did not meet the target turnaround time for reporting in the rapid phase; criteria were therefore set to split the sites into upper and lower 50% based on level of implementation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. It is also important to see the difference between hospitals displayed in the results. Taking Figure 2 as an example, as the results are currently presented it is impossible to tell whether trends with increased time to result represent trends within each hospital, or a difference between those hospitals that tend to produce rapid results compared to those that tend to produce less rapid results. It should be a simple matter to produce a graph showing unaggregated results from each hospital together with the fitted model (and prediction intervals).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added these plots as requested and added a comment in the Results:</p><p>‘However, we note that many of the HOCI cases with SRT returned within 5 days were from a single study site, and some sites did not seem to have clearly differentiated ‘useful’ SRT reports when completing data collection (Figures S2 and S3)’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. As the authors discuss, this trial took place during a period of significant variation in covid-19 prevalence, both in the community and among hospital patients. They report having adjusted their results for this. It would be useful to see both unadjusted and adjusted results to show the impact of this adjustment.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not feel that unadjusted IRR estimates are meaningful given the lack of randomisation, and the clear dependence of the outcomes on the adjustment variables. However, we have now added these values for completeness in Appendix 1—table 5 and noted this additional deviation from the SAP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. One hospital did not participate in the longer turnaround arm as this was considered inferior to their standard practice. Please describe current levels of whole genome use in these hospitals so that it is explicit how the intervention differs from the baseline conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a clarification to the Methods: ‘, comprising outbreak sequencing with weekly meetings to discuss phylogenetic analyses; they nonetheless completed the baseline phase of the study without use of the SRT or automated feedback to IPC teams on all HOCI cases’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Please re-check the odds ratio on line 222. The rapid sequencing has a greater proportion of finding it helpful so the odds ratio should be greater than 1. If this is correct due to adjustment, please report this as adjusted OR and add details of adjustment.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for flagging this, we have added a clarification: ‘although this association was reversed on analysis within the multi-level mode specified,’ and have also now specified in the Methods that mixed effect logistic regression models were also used for ‘…the ‘usefulness’ of SRT reports’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. It is important that the discussion starts with a clear statement that for the two primary outcomes no benefit of either intervention was shown and that this was true both in the main analysis and in the sensitivity analysis</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a more direct statement at the opening of the Discussion as requested:</p><p>‘We did not demonstrate a direct impact of sequencing on the primary outcome of the incidence of HAIs, either on full analysis or when restricted to the higher performing sites, and the overall proportion of cases with nosocomial transmission linkage identified using sequencing that had been missed by IPC investigation was &lt;10% in the intervention phases’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Line 274 &quot;Among sites with the most effective implementation of the sequencing intervention we showed that feedback within 5 days of diagnosis allowed for maximal impact on IPC actions&quot;. This appears to be an unplanned subgroup analysis of a secondary outcome, and as such needs to come with suitable caveats.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, this exploratory investigation was not entirely unplanned. However, we appreciate this point and have added ‘…post hoc exploratory investigation…’ here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Line 317 &quot; may reflect a shorter incubation time for the Α variant compared to earlier variants&quot; While there has been speculation about shorter incubation times for the Α variant, we are not aware of strong evidence that supports this, and recent analysis suggests similar generation time for the Α variant and earlier variants (see, for example, https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.08.21267454 which has now been accepted for publication in eLife).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for flagging this work, we have added this as a reference at the relevant point in the Discussion: ‘(although this remains uncertain<sup>[31]</sup>)’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Line 345. &quot;Our study provides the first evidence that with faster turnaround</p><p>times, viral sequences can inform ongoing IPC actions in managing nosocomial infections; &quot; While generally the paper strikes an appropriate note of cautious optimism for the approach despite the negative results in this trial, and it is understandable that the authors might want to emphasize the more positive aspects of the results when considering implications for sequencing to inform IPC measures, there is a danger that this statement (and the whole paragraph) is interpreted as attempting to put a positive spin on an essentially negative result. Thus, while it is reasonable to mention that in a minority of cases IPC actions were informed by viral sequencing data, it is equally important to emphasize that there was no evidence those measures had a positive impact on patient outcomes (it is surely equally possible that IPC actions informed by sequencing had a negative impact). Furthermore, it needs to be emphasized that in the main (planned) analysis there was no difference in the number of IPC actions informed by the sequencing results in rapid and longer-turnaround arms. It would be helpful to add here an explicit acknowledgement of the uncertain benefits and resource implications in this paragraph along with a discussion of how we might robustly evaluate the effectiveness (and cost-effectiveness) of WGS methods for IPC in the future, and in particular, emphasising what we learn from this trial.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added some caveats here to the text as requested:</p><p>‘We did not demonstrate an effect of our sequencing intervention on our primary outcome of the incidence of HAIs, and there were challenges in the implementation of the intervention. However, our study provides the first prospective evidence that with faster turnaround times, viral sequences can inform ongoing IPC actions in managing nosocomial infections; on post hoc exploratory analysis, results returned within ≤5 days from sampling to result changed the actions of IPC teams in around 20% of cases’.</p><p>Given these reminders of the limitations of our results, we feel that this ‘positive’ paragraph is reasonable in the context of the Discussion as a whole, particularly with the changes to the first and last paragraphs in this revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. Lines 596-602 Two planned secondary outcomes are not reported because they were either not thought to be useful or were insufficiently complete. While it seems reasonable to not conduct formal analysis for these reasons, surely these outcomes should still be reported somewhere given they were specified in the protocol and data does seem to have been obtained for them. Clearly, if researchers are permitted to selectively choose which of the planned outcomes to report there is large potential for bias.</p></disp-quote><p>The available descriptive data for these outcomes are summarised in Tables 2 and 3. We have also clarified at the relevant point in the Appendices that the decision to drop formal analysis was made prior to any statistical analysis being conducted, and that data collection for HCW absence ceased during the conduct of the study, reducing the potential for bias through selective reporting. We feel that dropping these outcomes is reasonable given the complexity and pandemic context of the study, and that we have been transparent in our reporting.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional comments</p><p>1. line 528-9 &quot;Site A observed 0 HOCI cases &quot; – presumably this is just for longer-turnaround phase, as A appears on the graph in the rapid phase.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, this sentence is regarding the longer-turnaround phase ‘Site N did not have a longer-turnaround phase, Site A observed 0 HOCI cases …in this phase’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

The use of dashed or dotted lines is conventional for plotting 95%CIs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In Table 3, a number of outcomes are reported as 0.0 per 100 patients. It would be more helpful to display these in a unit that allows easy display of at least one significant figure, e.g. per 10 000.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the units for outbreak events to ‘weekly incidence per 1000 inpatients’ to improve the display.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Some figures use the colours red and green as the only way to distinguish between baseline and rapid periods.

The results have a subsection titled health economics. This is limited to laboratory costs, and has no reference to changes in outcomes or costs or savings associated with changing practice on the wards. We suggest changing the title to costs of tests.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. The scope of the economic evaluation was to evaluate the economic effects of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing in supporting infection control teams and not the health benefits of the intervention. Therefore, the outcome of the intervention would be rather the benefit of rapid/slow return of the sequencing report expressed as potential reduction in resource utilisation and costs. A paper presenting the methodology and findings is under preparation. Here, we presented only the cost of the intervention. We will remove the “Health economic findings” heading and re-name it “Cost of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Lab 9 appears to have had larger batch sizes and a significant cost saving associated with rapid testing. Is this due to the difference in prevalence at the different times they were following each protocol, or is there a difference in practice that could be applied more widely?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. The costing analysis was based entirely on information provided by laboratories. Through the various phases of the study, the situation changed drastically, for example depending upon sample numbers and the required turnaround the pathway adopted was adapted by each laboratory. Generally, costs can vary significantly depending on run size, kits/reagents, staff, with small batches working out more expensive per sample. Lab 9 did use different sequencing platforms in intervention phases: Illumina MiSeq sequencing with 96 samples per run in rapid phase when there was a higher throughput; for lower throughput, as the sample numbers declined, they switched to Nanopore ONP in slower turnaround phase.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. It is interesting to note how much more frequently teams reported finding the report useful compared to how often they reported using it to change practice. Was any information collected on this? Were they reporting reassurance from the results or were they useful in some other way?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we feel that reassurance regarding previous conclusions and actions is likely to main explanation here. This is consistent with SRT reports being reported to be consistent with prior IPC actions in &gt;90% of HOCI cases (Appendix 1—table 2). ‘Reassurance’ is also mentioned in our brief summary of the qualitative analysis in the Results, with the full process evaluation yet to be published.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8.

These are all important caveats that luckily are less acute now but strongly impact the interpretation of the study. I wish these caveats were pronounced more prominently in the paper in order to defend against the overly simplistic conclusion that WGS does not aid infection control of SARS-CoV-2.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these further comments. We have made some adjustments throughout the manuscript in response to the concerns raised.</p><p>We have added the following to the Abstract of the manuscript, in order to flag the context of the study as requested:</p><p>“A total of 2170 HOCI cases were recorded from October 2020-April 2021, corresponding to a period of extreme strain on the health service, with sequence reports returned for…”</p><p>And:</p><p>“Capacity to respond effectively to insights from sequencing was breached in most sites by the volume of cases and limited resources.”</p><p>These additions mean that the Abstract is now a little over the standard 250 word count limit recommended by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Sites reported that they lacked the additional resources, in terms of staff and bed space, needed to respond effectively to insights generated by sequencing. Furthermore, if the study were repeated now then IPC teams would have more evidence-backed tools at their disposal, such as increasing respirator usage.
