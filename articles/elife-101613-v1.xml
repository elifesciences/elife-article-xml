In this study, we experimentally demonstrated that membrane depolarization promotes mitosis and that this process depends on the voltage-dependent activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in human cells. Notably, ERK activity showed a clear dependence on the membrane potential, independent of growth factor stimulation. This voltage dependence was observed even near the resting membrane potential, indicating that small shifts in the resting potential can influence proliferative activity. Voltage-dependent ERK activity is derived from the altered dynamics of phosphatidylserine and is not mediated by calcium influx from the extracellular space. These findings suggest that fundamental biological processes such as cell proliferation are regulated by the physicochemical properties of membrane lipids. This study highlights the broader physiological roles of membrane potentials beyond action potentials, which are well-established in neural systems.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>membrane potential</kwd><kwd>ERK</kwd><kwd>imaging</kwd><kwd>human cells</kwd><kwd>proliferation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>KAKENHI</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20K07268</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sasaki</surname><given-names>Mari</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02s016q17</institution-id><institution>Naito Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sasaki</surname><given-names>Mari</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02y123g31</institution-id><institution>Takeda Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sasaki</surname><given-names>Mari</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Membrane depolarization promotes extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation and cell proliferation via phosphatidylserine dynamics.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plasma membrane potential refers to the voltage difference across a cell’s lipid bilayer, which is established by the asymmetric distribution and conductance of intracellular and extracellular ions. These ion gradients are maintained by the combined action of passive and active transport mechanisms involving various ion channels and transporters embedded in the membrane. Although each cell type exhibits a characteristic resting membrane potential, its physiological role has primarily been studied in excitable cells, such as muscle and nerve cells, whereas non-excitable cells have received comparatively little attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hodgkin and Huxley, 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Neher and Sakmann, 1976</xref>).</p><p>However, accumulating evidence suggests that the physiological relevance of membrane potentials extends beyond action potentials in excitable cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). Membrane potential has been implicated in diverse biological processes including embryonic patterning, tissue regeneration, and cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Levin, 2021</xref>). It plays a critical role in establishing left–right asymmetry during early embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Levin et al., 2002</xref>). Furthermore, the resting membrane potential has been linked to a cell’s proliferative capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sundelacruz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blackiston et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cone and Tongier, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cone, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Binggeli and Weinstein, 1986</xref>), with depolarized cells consistently showing increased mitotic activity. In support of this view, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Voorhess et al., 1976</xref> demonstrated that sustained depolarization promotes DNA synthesis in chick spinal cord neurons. These findings align with the observation that oncogenically transformed cells tend to be more depolarized than their normal counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tokuoka and Morioka, 1957</xref>). Despite numerous reports associating the membrane potential with cell proliferation, the molecular mechanisms underlying this relationship remain unclear.</p><p>Cell proliferation is tightly regulated by extracellular growth factors and their downstream intracellular signaling cascades, among which the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is central. A key component of this pathway, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), plays a crucial role in controlling cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pagès, 1993</xref>). ERK signaling is frequently upregulated in tumors but downregulated under contact inhibition or in growth-arrested cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wayne et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>A recent study has shown that phosphatidylserine and K-Ras undergo changes in their nanoscale organization upon plasma membrane depolarization. Voltage-dependent ERK activation occurs when constitutively active K-RasG12V mutant is overexpressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). However, the proliferative capacity was not the primary focus of this study, leaving the question of whether voltage-dependent ERK could explain membrane potential-dependent cell proliferation.</p><p>In this study, we provide experimental evidence that membrane depolarization enhances mitotic activity and that this effect is associated with voltage-dependent activation of ERK.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mitotic activity is enhanced by membrane depolarization via the MAPK cascade</title><p>Cell proliferation has long been associated with membrane voltage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cone, 1971</xref>). We first examined whether a causal relationship existed between membrane potential and mitotic activity in our experimental system. To specifically monitor the mitotic phase of the cell cycle, U2OS cells were synchronized in the G1 phase by treatment with 2 mM thymidine for 20 h, followed by 8–9 h of normal incubation (G1 release). The cells were subjected to time-lapse imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Cytokinesis, which was easily identified in bright-field images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), was quantified in each frame. Cells were maintained in serum-containing medium, except during the phase in which K<sup>+</sup> concentration was altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mitotic activity is upregulated by membrane depolarization.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental diagram.

Approximately 100–900 mitotic cells were observed within 6 h in each experiment (<bold>C, D</bold>).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-101613-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The number of mitotic cells increased 14–15 h after G1 release, corresponding to approximately 6 h after the onset of time-lapse imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Because only a limited number of conditions could be tested per experiment, the control condition (5K) was included for normalization. Mitotic activity, defined as the number of cells undergoing division, was significantly enhanced in cells exposed to 15 mM K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). These results indicated that membrane depolarization promotes mitotic activity, supporting a causal relationship between membrane potential and proliferation. Notably, mitotic activity under 15K<sup>+</sup> conditions was comparable to that observed under FBS-supplemented conditions (5K+FBS and 15K+FBS). The effects of depolarization and FBS were not additive, suggesting that the proliferative activity plateaued under both conditions.</p><p>Next, we investigated the potential involvement of ERK in depolarization-induced mitotic activity. Treatment with the MEK inhibitor U0126 abolished the proliferative effect of 15 mM K<sup>+</sup>, indicating that MEK activation plays a pivotal role in depolarization-induced proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>).</p><p>Together, these findings suggest that MEK–ERK signaling mediates depolarization-induced mitotic activation. However, our results differ from those of a previous report showing that ERK activation occurs only when extracellular potassium exceeds 50 mM in cells expressing wild-type K-Ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, it remains unclear whether depolarization-induced proliferation is mediated by voltage-dependent ERK activation. To address this, we examined whether ERK could be activated within the physiological range of membrane depolarization.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>ERK activity has voltage dependency within the physiological range of the membrane potential</title><p>Although western blotting is a powerful tool for detecting all-or-nothing phenomena, it is not suitable for quantitatively capturing subtle changes or events with high cell-to-cell variability. Moreover, it is inadequate for analyzing detailed kinetics. To overcome these limitations, we used live-cell imaging. ERK activity was monitored by Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging using the ERK biosensor EKAREV, while the plasma membrane potential was manipulated by altering the extracellular potassium concentration. EKAREV is an intramolecular FRET biosensor that undergoes conformational changes depending on ERK activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Komatsu et al., 2011</xref>).

Since the raw YFP/CFP value varied among dishes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), presumably due to the difference in the expression level of the EKAREV probe and the background noise, the YFP/CFP value before application of the high K<sup>+</sup> solution was averaged and used as a reference. The ratio of the raw YFP/CFP value to the reference value was defined as the normalized YFP/CFP value. To normalize variation among cells, cells were stimulated with EGF (10 ng/mL) at the end of the experiment, which presumably yielded a near-saturated YFP/CFP value (ERK activity). This value was used to determine the maximum ERK activity in each cell. We defined % ERK activity as the high K<sup>+</sup>-induced ERK activity (relative to the reference) divided by the maximum activity with EGF stimulation. Quantitative analyses were performed on imaged single cells.</p><p>Perfusion with 145 mM K<sup>+</sup> strongly activated ERK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>), and similar results were observed in HEK293T, HeLa, and A431 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The mean ERK activity with 145 mM high K<sup>+</sup> perfusion was unexpectedly close to 100% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), indicating that depolarization induced by 145 mM K<sup>+</sup> had a similar impact on cells as EGF stimulation. Because 145 mM extracellular K<sup>+</sup> is far beyond the physiological range, we next tested more moderate depolarizations. Contrary to a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>), our imaging-based system detected ERK activation with 30 mM K<sup>+</sup>, and even with 15 mM K<sup>+</sup>—the condition under which mitotic activity was enhanced. Thus, even mild depolarization near the physiological range is sufficient to activate ERK, which may promote cell division. Importantly, as U2OS cells express wild-type K-Ras rather than an oncogenic mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Libert et al., 2024</xref>), our results raise the possibility that voltage-dependent ERK activation may also occur in non-transformed cells. The average ERK activity with 30 mM K<sup>+</sup> perfusion was approximately half of the maximum. The average ERK activity was further reduced when perfused with 15 mM K<sup>+</sup> solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These results indicate that ERK has voltage-dependent activity not only at extreme depolarization, but also within near-physiological membrane potentials.</p><p>An additional advantage of our imaging system is its ability to analyze ERK activity at the single-cell level. When individual cells were examined for the responses, the overall distribution was not Gaussian, and a large proportion of cells perfused with 145 mM K<sup>+</sup> solution showed %ERK activity of 90% or higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). On the other hand, % ERK activity of cells perfused with 30 mM K<sup>+</sup> solution was concentrated around 50–60%, and the average response was lower. The variance in response was larger in cells perfused with the 15 mM K<sup>+</sup> solution, with a significant proportion of cells showing no response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The correlation coefficient between the % ERK activity and the logarithm of extracellular K<sup>+</sup> concentration was 0.54 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Since membrane potential is proportional to the logarithm of extracellular K<sup>+</sup> (Nernst equation), these data confirm that ERK activity is voltage-dependent across both supraphysiological and physiological ranges.</p><p>ERK can be activated by multiple growth factors, as well as by stimuli such as neural excitation and mechanosensory input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harvey et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crozet and Levayer, 2023</xref>), where extracellular Ca²<sup>+</sup> entry is sometimes implicated. For instance, ERK activation in neurons is abolished under Ca²<sup>+</sup>-free conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Corvol et al., 2005</xref>), and mechanosensory stimulation via Piezo1-mediated Ca²<sup>+</sup> influx activates ERK. Therefore, we examined whether extracellular Ca²<sup>+</sup> entry was required for voltage-dependent ERK activation. Perfusion with Ca²<sup>+</sup>-free 145 mM K<sup>+</sup> solution activated ERK to the same extent as EGF stimulation, indicating that extracellular Ca²<sup>+</sup> influx is not required (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have reported that ERK is activated in response to hypotonic cell swelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Schliess et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sadoshima et al., 1996</xref>). However, under our experimental conditions, no ERK activation was observed at 70% or 50% osmolarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Ras activity was monitored using the FRET-based biosensor Raichu-Ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mochizuki et al., 2001</xref>). Raichu-Ras is an intramolecular biosensor that undergoes a conformational change upon Ras activation, resulting in increased FRET efficiency. When FRET occurs, the lifetime of the donor fluorophore decreases. To monitor Ras activity in the plasma membrane, we employed fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy combined with FRET (FLIM-FRET) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yeung et al., 2008</xref>) and confocal microscopy.

However, as few studies have addressed the molecular mechanisms involved, the relationship between membrane potential and proliferative capacity remains unclear. Regarding the molecular mechanisms involved, a study conducted in 2015 demonstrated a correlation between MAP activity and membrane potential. However, ERK voltage dependence within the physiological membrane potential range has not yet been demonstrated. Therefore, it remains unclear whether voltage-dependent MAP activation can explain the link between membrane potential and cell proliferation. In this study, we experimentally demonstrated a causal relationship between the membrane potential and mitotic activity (cytokinesis) within the physiological membrane potential range. This effect is associated with depolarization-induced ERK activation via phosphatidylserine dynamics. Thus, we were able to clarify the molecular mechanism of a phenomenon that has long been suggested to be a correlation between membrane potential and proliferative capacity.</p><p>We showed that membrane depolarization induces mitotic activity through ERK activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), indicating that membrane potential is not merely correlated with, but can directly regulate mitotic activity. Some reports have indicated that ERK plays an important role in S phase entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albeck et al., 2013</xref>), whereas others have proposed a role in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shapiro et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Willard and Crouch, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Iwamoto et al., 2016</xref>). Further studies are needed to elucidate which step(s) of the cell cycle are regulated by the membrane potential.</p><p>A potential limitation of extracellular K<sup>+</sup>-based approaches is their reliance on the Nernst equation to estimate membrane potential, which oversimplifies the actual situation by neglecting voltage-gated ion channel activity and compensatory mechanisms. To directly address this concern, we measured membrane potential using the perforated patch-clamp technique and confirmed that the potential was stable during perfusion with 145 mM K<sup>+</sup> (only a 1–5 mV drift within 20 min). Moreover, we used a voltage clamp to precisely control the membrane potential and demonstrated that ERK activity was directly regulated by the voltage itself, excluding the influence of other secondary factors. An additional strength of electrophysiology is its ability to examine the effects of repolarization, which is difficult to assess with conventional perfusion-based methods owing to slow solution exchange.</p><p>A key feature of the ERK response to voltage, compared to EGF stimulation, was the graded relationship between the stimulus and the response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Notably, ERK activity is downregulated upon membrane repolarization, but remains active for at least 5 min after growth factor binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kiyatkin et al., 2020</xref>). This suggests that the membrane potential acts as a fine tuner of ERK, in contrast to growth factor stimulation, which functions more like an on/off switch.</p><p>Using FRET-based imaging, we analyzed the kinetics of each step in the signaling pathway. Nanoclustering of phosphatidylserine and subsequent Ras activation occurred within 2 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and F</xref>), whereas ERK activation required more than 5 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This delay is reasonable given that several upstream molecules must be activated before ERK.</p><p>Another advantage of imaging-based analysis is the ability to quantitatively measure ERK activity in individual cells. Surprisingly, we found large cell-to-cell variability in depolarization-induced ERK activation. Importantly, such variability is averaged out and is thus invisible in western blot analysis, which is commonly used to study ERK signaling. Surprisingly, depolarization to 0 mV activated ERK to the same extent as EGF stimulation.</p><p>Coupled with electrophysiology, imaging also allows us to monitor ERK activity with a temporal resolution that perfusion or biochemical assays cannot achieve. ERK was activated within 1 min of depolarization and remained elevated for at least 5 min. Deactivation kinetics upon repolarization were similar to those upon activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>We also demonstrated that ERK activity exhibits a clear voltage dependence, spanning from the resting membrane potential to states of strong depolarization. This observation is consistent with the idea that voltage-dependent ERK activation arises from changes in phosphatidylserine dynamics in the plasma membrane, which are governed by the fundamental physicochemical properties of the lipid bilayer. Taken together, our findings indicate that plasma membrane potential should be regarded as a previously unrecognized but important regulator of ERK signaling.</p><p>In this study, we primarily used U2OS cells because their flat morphology makes them suitable for live-cell FRET imaging. Although cancer cell lines, including U2OS, may display bioelectric properties that differ from those of noncancerous cells, our findings raise the possibility that voltage-dependent ERK activation is a fundamental and broadly applicable phenomenon rather than a feature specific to osteosarcoma cells. This conclusion is supported by the fact that essential components of this pathway, namely phosphatidylserine, Ras, and MAPK (including ERK), are ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells. Consistent with this finding, we observed voltage-dependent ERK activation across multiple cell lines: U2OS, HeLa, HEK293T, and A431 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). These observations indicate that the mechanism we describe is not cell-type-restricted, but rather a universal property of mammalian cells.</p><p>Zhou et al. reported that phosphatidylserine and PIP<sub>2</sub> undergo nanoscale reorganization upon plasma membrane depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). K-Ras also changes its nanoscale organization through electrostatic interactions between its basic residues and anionic phosphatidylserine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhou and Hancock, 2015</xref>). Such interactions may also occur between clusters of basic amino acids in other proteins and anionic phospholipids such as phosphatidylserine or PIP<sub>2</sub>. For example, a cluster of basic residues in EGFR interacts with PIP<sub>2</sub>, and clustering of EGFR leads to its activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abd Halim et al., 2015</xref>). This suggests that EGFR activity may also be regulated by the membrane potential. Several other proteins interact with PIP<sub>2</sub> and contain clusters of basic residues, suggesting that the membrane potential regulates a broad range of proteins and, thereby, many physiological processes.</p><p>We showed that the membrane potential modulated phosphatidylserine dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>). The relationship between electrostatic potential and membrane organization has been discussed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Malinsky et al., 2016</xref>). Transmembrane potential affects the lateral sorting of membrane components, as well as the positioning of polar lipid headgroups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Malinsky et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, membrane lipid viscosity, which depends on lipid/protein composition and organization, can be altered by voltage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">O’Shea et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Herman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grossmann et al., 2007</xref>). However, the precise mechanism through which transmembrane potentials modulate lipid and protein organization remains unclear.</p><p>Overall, our results link three elements—plasma membrane voltage, ERK activity, and cell proliferation—and propose a new signaling cascade that regulates cell division. These findings suggest that ion channels and transporters that regulate membrane potential are potential therapeutic targets for cancer. Moreover, because ERK is involved in differentiation, migration, senescence, and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sun et al., 2015</xref>), the membrane potential may also regulate these processes, representing additional opportunities for drug development.</p><p>What is the biological significance of membrane potential regulation in cell proliferation? The stochastic ERK activation reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aoki et al., 2013</xref> may result from fluctuations in membrane potential. Furthermore, intercellular propagation of membrane potential via gap junctions can increase ERK activity and synchronize proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aoki et al., 2013</xref>). Such synchronized proliferation could be advantageous in tissues such as the epithelium. Our finding that membrane potential acts as an analog modulator of ERK activity is consistent with this hypothesis and may enable the nuanced regulation of cell proliferation.</p><p>It is now evident that the physiological significance of membrane potential extends beyond ion channel function. Given that the membrane potential is a physical property that influences all cellular components, including proteins and lipids, many additional biological phenomena regulated by voltage remain to be explored.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid and reagents</title><p>The expression vectors for the EKAREV and Raichu-Ras plasmids were kindly provided by Dr. Michiyuki Matsuda (Kyoto University). mRFP-Lact-C2 was a gift from Sergio Grinstein (Addgene plasmid # 74061; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.addgene.org/74061/">https://www.addgene.org/74061/</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/RRID:Addgene_74061">Addgene_74061</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yeung et al., 2008</xref>).

We agree that the Nernst equation is a simplification and does not account for the activity of other ions, voltage-gated channels, or homeostatic compensation mechanisms. To address this concern, we conducted electrophysiological experiments in which the membrane potential was directly controlled using the perforated patch-clamp technique (Fig. 3). Under these conditions, we also monitored the membrane potential and confirmed that there was negligible drift within 20 minutes of perfusion with 145 mM K<sup>⁺</sup> (only a 1–5 mV change). These results suggest that the influence of voltage-gated channels and homeostatic compensation is minimal in our experimental setup. We revised the manuscript to clarify these limitations and to present our conclusions more cautiously in light of this point.</p><p>“A potential limitation of extracellular K<sup>⁺</sup>-based approaches is their reliance on the Nernst equation to estimate membrane potential, which oversimplifies the actual situation by neglecting voltage-gated ion channel activity and compensatory mechanisms. To directly address this concern, we measured membrane potential using the perforated patch-clamp technique and confirmed that the potential was stable during perfusion with 145 mM K<sup>⁺</sup> (only a 1–5 mV drift within 20 min). Moreover, we used a voltage clamp to precisely control the membrane potential and demonstrated that ERK activity was directly regulated by the voltage itself, excluding the influence of other secondary factors. An additional strength of electrophysiology is its ability to examine the effects of repolarization, which is difficult to assess with conventional perfusion-based methods owing to slow solution exchange.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are grammatical tense errors are made throughout the paper (ex line 99 &quot;This kinetics should be these kinetics&quot;)</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the grammatical errors.

Could that explain the differences in bioelectric properties that they describe? In general, there should be more discussion of the choice of cell line. Why were U2OS cells chosen? What are the implications of the fact that these are cancer cells, and bone cancer cells in particular? Does this paper provide specific insights for bone cancers? And crucially, how applicable are findings from these cells to other contexts?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this valuable comment regarding the choice of cell line. We selected U2OS cells primarily because they are well suited for live-cell FRET imaging. We did not use BHK, N2A, or PSA-3 cells, and therefore it is difficult for us to provide a clear comparison with the specific bioelectric properties reported in Zhou et al. Nevertheless, we agree that cancer cell lines, including U2OS, may exhibit bioelectric properties that differ from those of non-cancerous cells. While this could be a potential limitation, we are inclined to consider voltage-dependent ERK activation to be a fundamental and generalizable phenomenon, not restricted to osteosarcoma cells. The key components of this pathway—phosphatidylserine, Ras, MAPK (including ERK)—are expressed in essentially all mammalian cells. In support of our view, we observed voltage-dependent ERK activation not only in U2OS cells but also in HeLa, HEK293, and A431 cells. These results strongly suggest that the mechanism we describe is not cell-type specific but rather a universal feature of mammalian cells. In the revised Discussion, we expanded our rationale to choose U2OS cells, while addressing the potential implications of using a cancer-derived cell line.</p><p>“In this study, we primarily used U2OS cells because their flat morphology makes them suitable for live-cell FRET imaging. Although cancer cell lines, including U2OS, may display bioelectric properties that differ from those of noncancerous cells, our findings raise the possibility that voltage-dependent ERK activation is a fundamental and broadly applicable phenomenon rather than a feature specific to osteosarcoma cells. This conclusion is supported by the fact that essential components of this pathway, namely phosphatidylserine, Ras, and MAPK (including ERK), are ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells. Consistent with this finding, we observed voltage-dependent ERK activation across multiple cell lines: U2OS, HeLa, HEK293, and A431 cells (Fig.S2). These observations indicate that the mechanism we describe is not cell-type-restricted, but rather a universal property of mammalian cells.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 115: The authors use EGF to calibrate 'maximal' ERK stimulation. Is this level near saturation? Either way is fine, but it would be useful to clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point. The YFP/CFP ratio obtained after EGF stimulation is generally considered to represent saturation levels detectable by EKAREV imaging. However, we acknowledge that it remains uncertain whether 10 ng/mL EGF induces the absolute maximal ERK activity in all contexts. To clarify this point, we revised the manuscript (result) text as follows:</p><p>“To normalize variation among cells, cells were stimulated with EGF (10 ng/mL) at the end of the experiment, which presumably yielded a near-saturated YFP/CFP value (ERK activity). This value was used to determine the maximum ERK activity in each cell”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 121: Starting line 121 the authors say &quot;Of note, U2OS cells expressed wild-type K-Ras but not an active mutant of K-Ras, which means voltage dependent ERK activation occurs not only in tumor cells but also in normal cells&quot;. Given that U2OS cells are bone sarcoma cells, is it appropriate to refer to these as 'normal' cells in contrast to 'tumor' cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We agree that it is not appropriate to contrast U2OS cells with “normal” cells, since they are sarcoma-derived. To address this point, we revised the sentence to weaken the claim and avoid the misleading terminology.</p><p>“Importantly, as U2OS cells express wild-type K-Ras rather than an oncogenic mutant (16), our results raise the possibility that voltage-dependent ERK activation may also occur in non-transformed cells.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 101: These normalizations seem reasonable, the conclusions sufficiently supported and the requisite assumptions clearly presented.

The time-resolved measurements here are a nice contribution to this question, and the perforated patch clamp experiments with an ERK biosensor are fantastic - they come closer to addressing the above difficulty of perturbing voltage than any prior work. It would have been difficult to obtain these observations with any other combination of tools.</p><p>However, there are still some concerns as detailed in specific comments below:</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>(1) All the observations of ERK activation, by both high extracellular K+ and voltage clamp, could be explained by cell volume increase (more discussion in subsequent comments). There is a substantial literature on ERK activation by hypotonic cell swelling (e.g. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1042/bj3090013">https://doi.org/10.1042/bj3090013</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1460-2075.1996.tb00938.x">https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1460-2075.1996.tb00938.x</ext-link>, among others). Here are some possible observations that could demonstrate that ERK activation by volume change is distinct from the effects reported here:</p><p>(i) Does hypotonic shock activate ERK in U2OS cells?</p><p>(ii) Can hypotonic shock activate ERK even after PS depletion, whereas extracellular K+ cannot?</p><p>(iii) Does high extracellular K+ change cell volume in U2OS cells, measured via an accurate method such as fluorescence exclusion microscopy?</p><p>(iv) It would be helpful to check the osmolality of all the extracellular solutions, even though they were nominally targeted to be iso-osmotic.</p><p>(2) Some more details about the experimental design and the results are needed from Figure 1:</p><p>(i) For how long are the cells serum-starved? From the Methods section, it seems like the G1 release in different K+ concentration is done without serum, is this correct? Is the prior thymidine treatment also performed in the absence of serum?</p><p>(ii) There is a question of whether depolarization constitutes a physiologically relevant mechanism to regulate proliferation, and how depolarization interacts with other extracellular signals that might be present in an in vivo context. Does depolarization only promote proliferation after extended serum starvation (in what is presumably a stressed cell state)? What fraction of total cells are observed to be mitotic (without normalization), and how does this compare to the proliferation of these cells growing in serum-supplemented media? Can K+ concentration tune proliferation rate even in serum-supplemented media?</p><p>(3) In Figure 2, there are some possible concerns with the perfusion experiment:</p><p>(i) Is the buffer static in the period before perfusion with high K+, or is it perfused? This is not clear from the Methods. If it is static, how does the ERK activity change when perfused with 5 mM K+? In other words, how much of the response is due to flow/media exchange versus change in K+ concentration?</p><p>(ii) Why do there appear to be population-average decreases in ERK activity in the period before perfusion with high K+ (especially in contrast to Fig. 3)? The imaging period does not seem frequent enough for photobleaching to be significant.</p><p>(4) Figure 3 contains important results on couplings between membrane potential and MAPK signaling. However, there are a few concerns:</p><p>(i) Does cell volume change upon voltage clamping? Previous authors have shown that depolarizing voltage clamp can cause cells to swell, at least in the whole-cell configuration: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cell.com/biophysj/fulltext/S0006-3495(18)30441-7">https://www.cell.com/biophysj/fulltext/S0006-3495(18)30441-7</ext-link> . Could it be possible that the clamping protocol induces changes in ERK signaling due to changes in cell volume, and not by an independent mechanism?</p><p>(ii) Does the -80 mV clamp begin at time 0 minutes? If so, one might expect a transient decrease in sensor FRET ratio, depending on the original resting potential of the cells. Typical estimates for resting potential in HEK293 cells range from -40 mV to -15 mV, which would reach the range that induces an ERK response by depolarizing clamp in Fig. 3B. What are the resting potentials of the cells before they are clamped to -80 mV, and why do we not see this downward transient?</p><p>(5) The activation of ERK by perforated voltage clamp and by high extracellular K+ are each convincing, but it is unclear whether they need to act purely through the same mechanism - while additional extracellular K+ does depolarize the cell, it could also be affecting function of voltage-independent transporters and cell volume regulatory mechanisms on the timescales studied. To more strongly show this, the following should be done with the HEK cells where there is already voltage clamp data:</p><p>(i) Measure resting potential using the perforated patch in zero-current configuration in the high K+ medium. Ideally this should be done in the time window after high K+ addition where ERK activation is observed (10-20 minutes) to minimize the possibility of drift due to changes in transporter and channel activity due to post-translational regulation.</p><p>(ii) Measure YFP/CFP ratio of the HEK cells in the high K+ medium (in contrast to the U2OS cells from Fig. 2 where there is no patch data).</p><p>(iii) The assertion that high K+ is equivalent to changes in Vmem for ERK signaling would be supported if the YFP/CFP change from K+ addition is comparable to that induced by voltage clamp to the same potential. This would be particularly convincing if the experiment could be done with each of the 15 mM, 30 mM, and 145 mM conditions.</p><p>(6) Line 170: &quot;ERK activity was reduced with a fast time course (within 1 minute) after repolarization to -80 mV.&quot; I don't see this in the data: in Fig. 3C, it looks like ERK remains elevated for &gt; 10 min after the electrical stimulus has returned to -80 mV</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>The authors have done a good job addressing the comments on the previous submission.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper demonstrates that membrane depolarization induces a small increase in cell entry into mitosis. Based on previous work from another lab, the authors propose that ERK activation might be involved. They show convincingly using a combination of assays that ERK is activated by membrane depolarization. They show this is Ca2+ independent and is a result of activation of the whole K-Ras/ERK cascade which results from changed dynamics of phosphatidylserine in the plasma membrane that activates K-Ras. Although the activation of the Ras/ERK pathway by membrane depolarization is not new, linking it to an increase in cell proliferation is novel.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>A major strength of the study is the use of different techniques - live imaging with ERK reporters, as well as Western blotting to demonstrate ERK activation as well as different methods for inducing membrane depolarization. They also use a number of different cell lines. Via Western blotting the authors are also able to show that the whole MAPK cascade is activated.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>A weakness of the study is the data in Figure 1 showing that membrane depolarization results in an increase of cells entering mitosis. There are very few cells entering mitosis in their sample in any condition. This should be done with many more cells to increase the confidence in the results. The study also lacks a mechanistic link between ERK activation by membrane depolarization and increased cell proliferation.</p><p>The authors did achieve their aims with the caveat that the cell proliferation results could be strengthened. The results, for the most par,t support the conclusions.</p><p>This work suggests that alterations in membrane potential may have more physiological functions than action potential in the neural system as it has an effect on intracellular signalling and potentially cell proliferation.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, the authors have now addressed the issues with Figure 1, and the data presented are much clearer. They did also attempt to pinpoint when in the cell cycle ERK is having its activity, but unfortunately, this was not conclusive.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Small issues:</p><p>Fig. 1A. Please add a mark on the timeline showing when the K+ concentration is changed. Also, please add a time axis that matches the time axis in (C), so readers can know when in C the medium was changed.</p><p>1B caption: unclear what &quot;the images were 20 min before and after cytokinesis&quot; means, given that the images go from -30 min to +20 min.
