This high fidelity results from the action of hundreds of genes involved in replication, proofreading, and damage repair. Evolutionary theory suggests that in such a system, selection has limited ability to remove genetic variants that change mutation rates by small amounts or in specific sequence contexts. Consistent with this, using SNV variation as a proxy for mutational input, we report here that mutational spectra differ substantially among species, human continental groups and even some closely related populations.

This information is stored as a code made up of four chemicals: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). Every time a cell divides and copies its DNA, it accidentally introduces ‘typos’ into the code, known as mutations. Most mutations are harmless, but some can cause damage. All cells have ways to proofread DNA, and the more resources are devoted to proofreading, the less mutations occur. Simple organisms such as bacteria use less energy to reduce mutations, because their genomes may tolerate more damage. More complex organisms, from yeast to humans, instead need to proofread their genomes more thoroughly.</p><p>Recent research has shown that humans have a lower mutation rate than chimpanzees and gorillas, their closest living relatives. Humans and other apes copy and proofread their DNA with basically the same biological machinery as yeast, which is about a billion years old. Yet, humans and apes have only existed for a small fraction of this time, a few million years. Why then do humans need to replicate and proofread their DNA differently from apes, and could it be that the way mutations arise is still evolving?</p><p>Previous research revealed that European people experience more mutations within certain DNA motifs (specifically, the DNA sequences ‘TCC’, ‘TCT’, ‘CCC’ and ‘ACC’) than Africans or East Asians do.</p><p>Now, Harris (who conducted the previous research) and Pritchard have compared how various human ethnic groups accumulate mutations and how these processes differ in different groups.</p><p>Statistical analysis of the genomes of thousands of people from all over the world did indeed show that the mutation rates of many different three-letter DNA motifs have changed during the past 20,000 years of human evolution. Harris and Pritchard report that when groups of humans left Africa and settled in isolated populations across different continents, each population quickly became better at avoiding mutations in some genomic contexts, but worse in others. This suggests that the risk of passing on harmful mutations to future generations is changing and evolving at an even faster rate than was originally suspected.</p><p>The results suggest that every human ethnic group carries specific variants of the genes which ensure that DNA replication and repair are accurate. These differences appear to influence which types of mutations are frequently passed down to future generations. An important next step will be to identify the genetic variants that could be controlling mutational patterns and how they affect human health.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24284.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24284.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>population genetics</kwd><kwd>mutagenesis</kwd><kwd>great ape evolution</kwd><kwd>DNA replication and repair</kwd><kwd>mutational signatures</kwd><kwd>Human population structure</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRSA-F32 Grant GM116381</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harris</surname><given-names>Kelley</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pritchard</surname><given-names>Jonathan K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 Grant HG008140</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pritchard</surname><given-names>Jonathan K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Heritable mutations tend to occur within different DNA sequence contexts in different human populations, suggesting that DNA replication and repair often change in efficacy over only a few hundred generations of evolution.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Germline mutations not only provide the raw material for evolution but also generate genetic load and inherited disease. Indeed, the vast majority of mutations that affect fitness are deleterious, and hence biological systems have evolved elaborate mechanisms for accurate DNA replication and repair of diverse types of spontaneous damage. Due to the combined action of hundreds of genes, mutation rates are extremely low–in humans, about one point mutation per 100 MB or about 60 genome-wide per generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ségurel et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>While the precise roles of most of the relevant genes have not been fully elucidated, research on somatic mutations in cancer has shown that defects in particular genes can lead to increased mutation rates within very specific sequence contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexandrov et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Helleday et al., 2014</xref>). For example, mutations in the proofreading exonuclease domain of DNA polymerase <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mi>ϵ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> cause TCT<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mo>→</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>TAT and TCG<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mo>→</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>TTG mutations on the leading DNA strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shinbrot et al., 2014</xref>). Mutational shifts of this kind have been referred to as ‘mutational signatures’. Specific signatures may also be caused by nongenetic factors such as chemical mutagens, UV damage, or guanine oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ohno et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Together, these observations imply a high degree of specialization of individual genes involved in DNA proofreading and repair. While the repair system has evolved to be extremely accurate overall, theory suggests that in such a system, natural selection may have limited ability to fine-tune the efficacy of individual genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lynch, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sung et al., 2012</xref>). If a variant in a repair gene increases or decreases the overall mutation rate by a small amount–for example, only in a very specific sequence context–then the net effect on fitness may fall below the threshold at which natural selection is effective. (Drift tends to dominate selection when the change in fitness is less than the inverse of effective population size). The limits of selection on mutation rate modifiers are especially acute in recombining organisms such as humans because a variant that increases the mutation rate can recombine away from deleterious mutations it generates elsewhere in the genome.</p><p>Given these theoretical predictions, we hypothesized that there may be substantial scope for modifiers of mutation rates to segregate within human populations, or between closely related species. Most triplet sequence contexts have mutation rates that vary across the evolutionary tree of mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hwang and Green, 2004</xref>), but evolution of the mutation spectrum over short time scales has been less well described. Weak natural mutators have recently been observed in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bui et al., 2017</xref>) and inferred from human haplotype data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Seoighe and Scally, 2017</xref>); if such mutators affect specific pathways of proofreading or repair, then we may expect shifts in the abundance of mutations within particular sequence contexts. Indeed, one of us has recently identified a candidate signal of this type, namely an increase in TCC<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mo>→</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>TTC transitions in Europeans, relative to other populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harris, 2015</xref>); this was recently replicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mathieson and Reich, 2016</xref>). Here, we show that mutation spectrum change is much more widespread than these initial studies suggested: although the TCC<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:mo>→</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>TTC rate increase in Europeans was unusually dramatic, smaller scale changes are so commonplace that almost every great ape species and human continental group has its own distinctive mutational spectrum.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To investigate the mutational processes in different human populations, we classified each single nucleotide variants (SNV) in the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Auton et al., 2015</xref>) in terms of its ancestral allele, derived allele, and 5’ and 3’ flanking nucleotides. We collapsed strand complements together to obtain 96 SNV categories. Since the detection of singletons may vary across samples, and because some singletons may result from cell-line or somatic mutations, we only considered variants seen in more than one copy. We further excluded variants in annotated repeats (since read mapping error rates may be higher in such regions) and in PhyloP conserved regions (to avoid selectively constrained regions) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pollard et al., 2010</xref>). From the remaining sites, we calculated the distribution of derived SNVs carried by each Phase 3 individual. We used this as a proxy for the mutational input spectrum in the ancestors of each individual.</p><p>To explore global patterns of the mutation spectrum, we performed principal component analysis (PCA) in which each individual was characterized simply by the fraction of their derived alleles in each of the 96 SNV categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). PCA is commonly applied to individual-level genotypes, in which case the PCs are usually highly correlated with geography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Novembre et al., 2008</xref>). Although the triplet mutation spectrum is an extremely compressed summary statistic compared to typical genotype arrays, we found that it contains sufficient information to reliably classify individuals by continent of origin. The first principal component separated Africans from non-Africans, and the second separated Europeans from East Asians, with South Asians and admixed native Americans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) appearing intermediate between the two.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24284.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Global patterns of variation in SNV spectra.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Principal component analysis of individuals according to the fraction of derived alleles that each individual carries in each of 96 mutational types.

If this effect were sufficiently strong, it would inflate the apparent mutation fractions of weak-to-strong mutations, especially in populations with large effective sizes where natural selection is particularly efficient. Within humans, Africans have the largest long-term effective population size, while East Asians and Native Americans have the lowest. Therefore, if BGC has created differences in mutation spectra between populations, the fraction of weak-to-strong SNVs should be highest in Africans, intermediate in Europeans and South Asians, and lowest in East Asians and Native Americans. This violin plot reveals no such pattern, suggesting that BGC is not a strong driver of mutation spectrum differences between human populations.

We calculated allele frequencies both in 1000 Genomes and in the larger UK10K genome panel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Walter et al., 2015</xref>). As expected for a signal that is primarily European, we found particular enrichment of these mutations at low frequencies. But surprisingly, the enrichment peaks around 0.6% frequency in UK10K, and there is practically no enrichment among the very lowest frequency variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

First, biased gene conversion (BGC) tends to favor C/G alleles over A/T, and BGC is potentially more efficient in populations of large effective size compared to populations of smaller effective size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Galtier et al., 2001</xref>). However, despite the bottlenecks that are known to have affected Eurasian diversity, there is no clear trend of an increased fraction of C/G<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf83"><mml:mo>→</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>A/T relative to A/T<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf84"><mml:mo>→</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>C/G in non-Africans vs Africans, or with distance from Africa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>), and previous studies have also found little evidence for a strong genome-wide effect of BGC on the mutational spectrum in humans and great apes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Do et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Moorjani et al., 2016a</xref>). For these reasons, we think that evolution of the mutational process is a better explanation than BGC or selection for differences that have been observed between the spectra of ultra-rare singleton variants and older human genetic variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carlson et al., 2017</xref>);</p><p>It is also known that shifts in generation time or other life-history traits may affect mutational spectra, particularly for CpG transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Martin and Palumbi, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amster and Sella, 2016</xref>). Most CpG transitions result from spontaneous methyl-cytosine deamination as opposed to errors in DNA replication. Hence the rate of CpG transitions is less affected by generation time than other mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hwang and Green, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Moorjani et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gao et al., 2016</xref>).

However, given the sheer diversity of the effects reported here, it seems parsimonious to us to propose that most of this variation is driven by the appearance and drift of genetic modifiers of mutation rate. This situation is perhaps reminiscent of the earlier observation that genome-wide recombination patterns are variable among individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coop et al., 2008</xref>), and ultimate discovery of PRDM9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baudat et al., 2010</xref>); although in this case it is unlikely that a single gene is responsible for all signals seen here.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Aylwyn Scally (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>There are often discrepancies in mutation rates and spectra inferred from short term observations and long term comparisons. One potential explanation is that these rates and spectra are not fixed, but vary in the course of evolution. This paper makes an important contribution, by documenting changes in the mutation spectrum during human evolution. It presents an analysis of population differences in the spectrum of context-dependent single nucleotide polymorphism, focused on humans and great apes. A previous observation about differences in mutation spectrum between human populations is replicated here and a hypothesis about a historical burst of mutation is presented. Many additional, weaker differences are also seen but replicated across data sets, which argues for biological, rather than experimental explanations. Very substantial differences among great apes are described.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The original reviews are below. In terms of revision, the only major issue that we wish to see addressed concerns the analysis of the burst hypothesis. Specifically, there is a potential concern about whether certain artefacts could explain the apparent lack of evidence for the population-specific bias among the most recent mutations and questions about differences among populations in the relationship between allele frequency and age. There are also suggestions about how to look at patterns along the genome to hunt for clues as to possible causes.</p><p>We have left the full reviews in as we think there are other ideas here that you may wish to pick up on, but pursuing them is not essential for the revision. We look forward to seeing the revision.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This paper presents an analysis of population differences in the spectrum of context-dependent single nucleotide polymorphism, primarily focused on humans, but also analysing data from great apes. One of the authors previously reported a substantial difference in one particular type. This is replicated here and augmented with a large number of other, much weaker findings. These are replicated across data sets, which argues for biological, rather than experimental explanations. Very substantial differences among great apes are described. One specific hypothesis, about an apobec mutation is assessed and some – moderately weak – evidence for association is seen.</p><p>The analyses presented are basically well done and reasonably compelling that there are repeatable differences in mutational spectra. The obvious – and I think rather important – criticism is that this works moves us no further along in terms of identifying causal factors. The authors argue for a contribution of transient mutator phenotypes. However, it is not clear how plausible this model is – most models of mutator suggest that they tend not to persist in sexually reproducing populations. This could potentially be explored by simulation. The authors argue that non-genetic factors – e.g. environmental exposure – are unlikely to explain the phenomena – though no hard evidence is given, although I agree that the great ape differences are compatible with a substantial genetic component.</p><p>The only other substantial comment I have is around the analysis that fits the burst of TCC-to-TTC mutations. My concern is that sequencing data sets will have higher error rates at low frequencies and likely differential discovery based on sequence context due to systematic fluctuation in sequencing depth (true for both UK10k and 1000G). Hence, I have a concern that the most recent TCC-&gt;TTC mutations could be being lost/swamped in such a way that leads to an apparent burst, when the process is still active.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This is a nice paper on a topic of current interest and relevance in human genetics and genomics. It points to important evidence for recent variability over time in at least some aspects of the human mutation rate, something which until now we have only been able to speculate about, and which has potentially broad implications for human evolutionary genetics.</p><p>I have listed below a few thoughts and comments, including some things I think the authors should address. However, I found the paper well written and well presented, and have no major issues to raise.</p><p>It would be good to get a sense of the raw numbers involved. What do the relative differences between populations mean in terms of actual numbers of variants? For example, what actual density of additional derived T alleles are there in Europe compared to Africa for the TCC-&gt;TTC signal?</p><p>Is there an issue with ascertainment bias due to demography, in that the allele frequency spectrum varies between populations due to their differing demographic histories, and this might differentially affect the ascertainment of variants in different spectral classes, depending on their relative abundance?</p><p>It would be interesting to know how the structure presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> varies with the age of the variants used to construct it (or, as a proxy, their allele frequency). Presumably one would expect the differences between populations to disappear as one excludes more recent variants, as older ones are more likely to be shared. Is this the case?</p><p>I think the procedure used to estimate statistical significance, referred to as 'a forward variable selection procedure' needs a better description and motivation. It's not wholly clear to me how the procedure adopted achieves its goal of minimising the interdependence of the tests for each mutation type. It looks to me like some form of partitioned chi-squared test for comparing multiple proportions, but I don't know this statistical literature well – can you cite a useful reference or else explain how you arrived at it? I'd be happy with just testing for a significant overall difference in spectrum between two populations – is testing for significance of individual components of the spectrum really necessary?</p><p>For the differences within the great ape tree, did you also compare with an outgroup such as macaque or gibbon? It wasn't clear how you polarise the C-T rate difference as an increase on the Pongine branch, and the CpG rate difference as an increase in Hominines.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This article extends previous knowledge on heterogeneity of mutational spectra between populations. It detailed differences in frequencies of specific mutation types between diverse population groups. Moreover, authors date TCC-&gt;TTC mutational pulse for the European population. The arguments supporting the main conclusion of the study seem convincing, although the discussion of possible importance of evolutionary forces other than mutation would be helpful (e.g. interaction between BGC and demographic history). There is a noticeable overlap with the earlier work, and the manuscript would strongly benefit from additional analyses of the observed mutational patterns.</p><p>For example, are the relative increases of mutation types uniformly distributed along the genome or enriched in specific genomic locations? Are they associated with epigenomic features or display asymmetry with respect to transcription or replication? Are they dependent on local recombination rate? Any analysis suggesting of a mechanistic hypothesis underlying the observation would strengthen the paper.</p><p>In contrast to the main result of the manuscript, I am skeptical about the conjecture related to the APOBEC-induced mutagenesis. It is not statistically sound and based on arbitrary thresholds. Is it possible to compare replication asymmetry of APOBEC-like mutations (TC[A/T]-&gt; [C/G]) between populations with different frequencies of variants associated with breast or bladder cancer?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24284.044</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>The original reviews are below.

To address this essential revision point, we welcome the chance to present additional evidence that the burst of TCC→TTC mutations at intermediate frequencies is not well explained by bioinformatic artifacts. We have added a new analysis of the Exome Aggregation Consortium Data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), a dataset even larger than UK10K that supports the mutation burst hypothesis as well as the datasets we previously analyzed. This evidence is summarized in the following new paragraph of the paper):</p><p>“Although low frequency allele calls often contain a higher proportion of base calling errors than higher frequency allele calls do, it is not plausible that base-calling errors could be responsible for the pulse we have described. […] When independently generated datasets of different sizes are projected down to the same sample size, the TCC→TTC pulse spans the same range of allele frequencies in both datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>).”</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> illustrate how well supported the pulse pattern is in all cases.</p><p>The point about differences between populations in the relationship between allele frequency and age is addressed in direct response to reviewer 2.</p><p><italic>We have left the full reviews in as we think there are other ideas here that you may wish to pick up on, but pursuing them is not essential for the revision. We look forward to seeing the revision.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate this encouraging response, and have incorporated many ideas from these reviews into additional supplementary analyses. As described in more detail below, we have added new supplementary heat map figures that describe the variation of the human mutation spectrum with allele frequency, replication timing, chromatin state, and transcription. We have also attempted to clarify the description of our significance-testing procedure in the Methods section. Finally, we decided to remove the APOBEC analysis given that it is less conclusive than the other sections of the paper and appears to have detracted, in the eyes of the reviewers, from the impact of the paper’s main conclusions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>This paper presents an analysis of population differences in the spectrum of context-dependent single nucleotide polymorphism, primarily focused on humans, but also analysing data from great apes.

One specific hypothesis, about an apobec mutation is assessed and some – moderately weak – evidence for association is seen.</italic> </p><p><italic>The analyses presented are basically well done and reasonably compelling that there are repeatable differences in mutational spectra. The obvious – and I think rather important – criticism is that this works moves us no further along in terms of identifying causal factors. The authors argue for a contribution of transient mutator phenotypes. However, it is not clear how plausible this model is – most models of mutator suggest that they tend not to persist in sexually reproducing populations. This could potentially be explored by simulation. The authors argue that non-genetic factors – e.g. environmental exposure – are unlikely to explain the phenomena – though no hard evidence is given, although I agree that the great ape differences are compatible with a substantial genetic component.</italic> </p><p>It is a fair point that we have not yet nailed down concrete mechanisms that are causing mutation spectrum evolution. However, it is our hope that describing the temporal structure of mutation spectrum change will bring us and others closer achieving this goal in the future. Thanks to the work done in this paper, we now know that the TCC<italic>→</italic>TTC pulse appears to be presently inactive, meaning that it is probably not caused by currently segregating genetic variation that could be mapped via genome-wide association approaches. This implies that the TCC<italic>→</italic>TTC pulse might not be the best signal to chase in search of causal factors, which is an important thing to keep in mind for anyone who wants to tackle the challenging problem of mapping mutators in the future. This paper also shows that there are other mutation spectrum differences between populations that are weaker in magnitude than the TCC<italic>→</italic>TTC pulse, but are nevertheless reproducible and might be better leads to go after in search of the molecular underpinnings of mutation rate variation.</p><p>In terms of the plausibility of mutator phenotypes existing in sexual populations, a natural mutator phenotype was recently identified in yeast (see “Mis- match repair incompatibilities in diverse yeast populations” by Bui, et al. Genetics 2017).</p><p><italic>The only other substantial comment I have is around the analysis that fits the burst of TCC-to-TTC mutations. My concern is that sequencing data sets will have higher error rates at low frequencies and likely differential discovery based on sequence context due to systematic fluctuation in sequencing depth (true for both UK10k and 1000G). Hence, I have a concern that the most recent TCC-&gt;TTC mutations could be being lost/swamped in such a way that leads to an apparent burst, when the process is still active.</italic> </p><p>We believe that the new analyses presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">6</xref> provide good evidence that sequencing errors are not artificially deflating estimates of the TCC→TTC mutation fraction at low frequencies.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>This is a nice paper on a topic of current interest and relevance in human genetics and genomics. It points to important evidence for recent variability over time in at least some aspects of the human mutation rate, something which until now we have only been able to speculate about, and which has potentially broad implications for human evolutionary genetics.</italic> </p><p><italic>I have listed below a few thoughts and comments, including some things I think the authors should address. However, I found the paper well written and well presented, and have no major issues to raise.</italic> </p><p><italic>It would be good to get a sense of the raw numbers involved. What do the relative differences between populations mean in terms of actual numbers of variants? For example, what actual density of additional derived T alleles are there in Europe compared to Africa for the TCC-&gt;TTC signal?</italic> </p><p>The raw numbers of TCC→TTC mutations (as well as mutations in other contexts) are available in the supplementary file total_continent_mut_counts.txt. In particular, there are 270,538 TCC→TTC variants in Africa compared to 187,174 in Europe (where there are many fewer total SNPs).</p><p><italic>Is there an issue with ascertainment bias due to demography, in that the allele frequency spectrum varies between populations due to their differing demographic histories, and this might differentially affect the ascertainment of variants in different spectral classes, depending on their relative abundance?</italic> </p><p>With regard to the relationship between allele age and allele frequency, it is a fair point that different populations have different relationships between allele frequency and allele age due to contrasting demographic histories. However, differences in the relationship between allele frequency and allele age cannot produce differences between the mutation spectra of two populations in the scenario where each population has experienced an identical rate and spectrum of mutations throughout recent history. The exception to this would be if selective forces like biased gene conversion caused different populations to retain certain classes of mutations at different rates, which is plausible in principle since selective forces act more weakly in populations of smaller effective size. The observed patterns are not consistent with classical biased gene conversion though – if biased gene conversion were the only force creating differences between population mutation spectra, all C/G⇌A/T mutations would be affected in much the same way regardless of sequence context and neither C⇌G nor A⇌T mutations should have differences in abundance between populations.</p><p><italic>It would be interesting to know how the structure presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> varies with the age of the variants used to construct it (or, as a proxy, their allele frequency). Presumably one would expect the differences between populations to disappear as one excludes more recent variants, as older ones are more likely to be shared. Is this the case?</italic> </p><p>This is a nice suggestion for bridging the visualizations presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. We now include this analysis as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>, and it indeed shows that differences disappear as we restrict to higher frequency variants.</p><p><italic>I think the procedure used to estimate statistical significance, referred to as 'a forward variable selection procedure' needs a better description and motivation. It's not wholly clear to me how the procedure adopted achieves its goal of minimising the interdependence of the tests for each mutation type. It looks to me like some form of partitioned chi-squared test for comparing multiple proportions, but I don't know this statistical literature well – can you cite a useful reference or else explain how you arrived at it? I'd be happy with just testing for a significant overall difference in spectrum between two populations – is testing for significance of individual components of the spectrum really necessary?</italic> </p><p>Since this procedure is not described in the literature to our knowledge, we have expanded its description in the supporting information to include better motivation for what is done (see Methods section). These p-values are used to annotate <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> with the dots that denote significance. We think that conservatively estimating the number of mutation types that vary in rate between populations is important to this paper because Harris 2015 focused on the rate distribution of a single mutation type and we want to emphasize here that mutation spectrum evolution is much more pervasive than that.</p><p><italic>For the differences within the great ape tree, did you also compare with an outgroup such as macaque or gibbon? It wasn't clear how you polarise the C-T rate difference as an increase on the Pongine branch, and the CpG rate difference as an increase in Hominines.</italic> </p><p>We have rephrased the statement about CpGs to say, “one major trend is a higher proportion of CpG mutations among the species closest to human” to be more agnostic about the question of whether the rate decreased in one part of the tree versus increased in another part of the tree. For statements about A→T and A→C mutations in the great apes, we have left in language that hypothesizes increases and decreases in rate because these are supported by parsimony (i.e., the rate differential is more parsimoniously explained by a rate increase along one branch of the tree than by rate decreases along two separate branches).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>This article extends previous knowledge on heterogeneity of mutational spectra between populations. It detailed differences in frequencies of specific mutation types between diverse population groups. Moreover, authors date TCC-&gt;TTC mutational pulse for the European population. The arguments supporting the main conclusion of the study seem convincing, although the discussion of possible importance of evolutionary forces other than mutation would be helpful (e.g. interaction between BGC and demographic history). There is a noticeable overlap with the earlier work, and the manuscript would strongly benefit from additional analyses of the observed mutational patterns.</italic> </p><p><italic>For example, are the relative increases of mutation types uniformly distributed along the genome or enriched in specific genomic locations? Are they associated with epigenomic features or display asymmetry with respect to transcription or replication? Are they dependent on local recombination rate? Any analysis suggesting of a mechanistic hypothesis underlying the observation would strengthen the paper.</italic> </p><p>We agree and, we have included new supplementary figures showing how these patterns vary with replication timing, chromatin state, and transcriptional state. Our main inference from these figures is that the discernible features of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> appear to vary only modestly across the genome.</p><p><italic>In contrast to the main result of the manuscript, I am skeptical about the conjecture related to the APOBEC-induced mutagenesis. It is not statistically sound and based on arbitrary thresholds. Is it possible to compare replication asymmetry of APOBEC-like mutations (TC[A/T]-&gt; [C/G]) between populations with different frequencies of variants associated with breast or bladder cancer?</italic> </p><p>We agree that these conclusions about APOBEC-induced mutagenesis are not as decisive as the main conclusions in the paper. We intended this analysis to work as a useful illustration of how linkage disequilibrium can be used to test hypotheses about mutator activity, but in revising the paper, we have decided to remove this section to avoid detracting from the impact of the more key points we are making.</p></body></sub-article></article>
