DNAH12 is a special dynein featured by the absence of a microtubule-binding domain, however, its functions in spermatogenesis remain largely unknown. Through comprehensive genetic analyses involving whole-exome sequencing and subsequent Sanger sequencing on infertile patients and fertile controls from six distinct families, we unveiled six biallelic mutations in <italic>DNAH12</italic> that co-segregate recessively with male infertility in the studied families. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed pronounced axonemal abnormalities, including inner dynein arms (IDAs) impairment and central pair (CP) loss in sperm flagella of the patients. Mouse models (<italic>Dnah12</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>Dnah12<sup>mut/mut</sup></italic>) were generated and recapitulated the reproductive defects in the patients. Noteworthy, DNAH12 deficiency did not show effects on cilium organization and function. Mechanistically, DNAH12 was confirmed to interact with two other IDA components DNALI1 and DNAH1, while disruption of DNAH12 leads to failed recruitment of DNALI1 and DNAH1 to IDAs and compromised sperm development. Furthermore, DNAH12 also interacts with radial spoke head proteins RSPH1, RSPH9, and DNAJB13 to regulate CP stability. Moreover, the infertility of <italic>Dnah12</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice could be overcome by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment. Collectively, DNAH12 plays a crucial role in the proper organization of axoneme in sperm flagella, but not cilia, by recruiting DNAH1 and DNALI1 in both humans and mice. These findings expand our comprehension of dynein component assembly in flagella and cilia and provide a valuable marker for genetic counseling and diagnosis of asthenoteratozoospermia in clinical practice.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>male infertility</kwd><kwd>human genetics</kwd><kwd>dynein</kwd><kwd>sperm flagella</kwd><kwd>inner dynein

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Infertility has emerged as a global health concern, impacting around 8â12% of couples during their reproductive years, approximately 50% of infertility cases are attributed to male factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwal et al., 2021</xref>). Among these, asthenoteratozoospermia, characterized by poor sperm motility and notable morphological abnormalities, stands out as a prevalent contributor to male infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Krausz and Riera-Escamilla, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shang et al., 2018</xref>). Recent investigations have unveiled a multitude of gene mutations associated with asthenoteratozoospermia and male infertility, including Dynein Axonemal Heavy Chain (DNAH) inner dynein arm (IDA) genes like <italic>DNAH1, DNAH2, DNAH6, DNAH7,</italic> and <italic>DNAH10</italic>, as well as outer dynein arm (ODA) genes such as <italic>DNAH8</italic> and <italic>DNAH17</italic>, all implicated in primary male infertility with asthenoteratozoospermia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Khan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gao et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Whitfield et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, genes encoding cilia and flagella-associated proteins (CFAP), including <italic>CFAP43</italic>, <italic>CFAP44</italic>, <italic>CFAP57</italic>, and <italic>CFAP61</italic>, have been identified as linked to asthenoteratozoospermia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coutton et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ma et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hu et al., 2023a</xref>). Despite these advances, the intricate and heterogeneous features of asthenoteratozoospermia leave a significant number of cases unexplained. It is anticipated that additional genetic factors play a role in sperm anomalies and dysfunction.</p><p>The axoneme, a fundamental structure of cilia and flagella, exhibits a well-organized pattern with nine peripheral doublet microtubules (DMTs) and a central pair of microtubules (CP), constituting the classical â9+2â microtubular arrangement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">TourÃ© et al., 2021</xref>). In motile cilia or flagella, the radial spoke (RS) head contacts the CP accessory structures, transmitting mechanical and chemical signals from the central microtubules to the axonemal dynein arms, thus coordinating the flagellar or ciliary movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Walton et al., 2023</xref>). Within mammalian species, the DNAH family plays a crucial role in the axonemal structure, encompassing eight IDA members (DNAH1-3, DNAH6, DNAH7, DNAH10, DNAH12, DNAH14) and five ODA members (DNAH5, DNAH8, DNAH9, DNAH11, DNAH17). Despite the collaborative effort of IDAs and ODAs in generating the force necessary for flagellar and ciliary motion, they serve distinct functions. Chlamydomonas ODAs, composed of Î±, Î², and Î³ chains, primarily regulate beat frequency, while IDAs, with seven major subspecies (a-g), contribute to bending formation and beating form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Viswanadha et al., 2017</xref>). Mutations in genes encoding ODA or IDA components have been linked to asthenoteratozoospermia, with or without symptoms of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a genetic disorder characterized by chronic airway infections or situs inversus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kleinboelting et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, deficiency in certain IDAs and ODAs coding genes, such as <italic>DNAH7</italic> or <italic>DNAH11</italic>, may lead to PCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shoemark et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sironen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wei et al., 2021</xref>). Patients carrying mutations in <italic>DNAH1</italic> and <italic>DNAH2</italic> typically lack PCD symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Khan et al., 2021</xref>), although a study suggested the potential contribution of the DNAH1 p.Lys1154Gln mutation to PCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Imtiaz et al., 2015</xref>). The extensive genetic heterogeneity and clinical variabilities underscore the intricacy and uniqueness of dynein arms in flagella and cilia. However, the susceptibility of uncharacterized dynein factors that are related to asthenoteratozoospermia and/or PCD remains unclear, given the absence of human genetic evidence or corresponding animal models.</p><p>Dynein axonemal heavy chain 12, DNAH12 (MIM: 603340, GenBank: NM_001366028.2), also known as DHC3, is a unique dynein arm component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vaisberg et al., 1996</xref>). Notably, it is the shortest member and lacks a typical microtubule-binding domain (MTBD) in the DNAH family. Mutations of <italic>DNAH12</italic> have been predicted to be associated with male patients' infertility, however, limited pathogenic evidence was provided, and the underlying pathogenesis remained unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oud et al., 2021</xref>). Besides, although DNAH12 has been identified as a possible axonemal dynein and its mRNA is predominantly detected in two tissues containing axonemal structures: trachea and testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vaisberg et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chapelin et al., 1997</xref>), its physiological functions remain largely elusive.</p><p>In this study, we enrolled 796 infertile patients from unrelated Pakistani and Chinese families diagnosed with asthenozoospermia. Utilizing whole-exome sequencing (WES) followed by Sanger sequencing, we identified six novel bi-allelic mutations in <italic>DNAH12</italic> in infertile males from six unrelated families. All these mutations resulted in the loss of DNAH12 protein in the sperm of patients. Two mouse models, <italic>Dnah12<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Dnah12<sup>mut/mut</sup></italic>, were generated and exhibited asthenoteratozoospermia and male infertility, mimicking our patientsâ phenotypes. Deficiency in DNAH12 led to axoneme defects characterized by impaired IDAs and CP loss in sperm flagella, while no such defects were observed in cilia. DNAH12 interacts with other IDA components like DNALI1 and DNAH1 in mouse testes, and disruption of DNAH12 impaired the recruitment of dynein components into sperm flagella. Our findings unveil, for the first time, that DNAH12 plays a pivotal role in facilitating the recruitment of IDA components specifically in flagella, but not in cilia. Furthermore, we demonstrate that bi-allelic mutations in <italic>DNAH12</italic> are identified as causative factors for asthenoteratozoospermia and male infertility in both humans and mice. These results enhance our understanding of the development of axonemal structures in flagella versus cilia and provide valuable clues for genetic counseling and future individualized treatment for infertile males carrying <italic>DNAH12</italic> mutations in clinical practice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of biallelic <italic>DNAH12</italic> variants in men with asthenoteratozoospermia</title><p>To identify the genetic factors contributing to male infertility, we recruited patients with primary infertility and their family members from Pakistan and China. WES was performed on these individuals, followed by comprehensive analyses of the WES data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1Aâ1C</xref>). Seven mutations in <italic>DNAH12</italic> were identified as potential pathogenic factors for male infertility in patients P1-3 of family 1, P4-5 of family 2, P8 of family 3, and P9, P10, and P11, all of whom suffered from asthenoteratozoospermia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Experimentally, our RT-PCR, qPCR, and immunoblotting detection of DNAH12 expression in different tissues indicated that both DNAH12 mRNA and protein showed high expression in testes and relatively lower expression in lungs and tracheas of male mice and oviducts of female mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2AâC</xref>). Itâs worth noting that in epididymides, DNAH12 protein, but not mRNA, was detected, indicating the DNAH12 protein detected in epididymides is from testes, most probably from sperm. Furthermore, DNAH12 protein was initially detected in testes around 21 d postpartum (dpp) and thereafter maintained a high level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2D</xref>).

The predicted DNAH12 protein size was detected in the sperm lysate from a fertile control but not in P9 with the homozygous stop-gain mutation M4, P10 with a homozygous missense mutation M5, and P11 with compound heterozygous mutations M6 and M7, indicating these mutations possibly lead to the disruption of the DNAH12 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>To further explore the effects of the identified <italic>DNAH12</italic> variants on the DNAH12 protein, we performed immunofluorescence assays on sperm from patients.

Given the significantly decreased protein levels of DNALI1 and DNAH1 observed in the sperm of <italic>Dnah12<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), we proposed that the interactions involving DNAH12 (possibly restricted to the Stem domain of DNAH12), DNALI1, and DNAH1 are crucial for flagella development.

These findings suggested that the recruitment of DNAH12 to flagella is independent of DNAH1, and DNAH12 is the first protein to be recruited to flagella among the three proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2-11"><title>DNAH12 deficiency causes the decrease of RS head-associated proteins</title><p>In addition to the enrichment of dynein proteins, we noticed that clusters of RS head-related proteins such as RSPH1, RSPH9, or DNAJB13 were enriched in the testicular interactome of DNAH12.

Moreover, our results indicate that the assembly of IDA components occurs intricately, possibly not synchronously in time and space.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we identified six novel bi-allelic mutations in <italic>DNAH12</italic> that cause the loss of DNAH12 proteins in asthenoteratozoospermia patients. Spermatozoa from these patients exhibited abnormal morphology and compromised axonemal defects, including a high percentage of impaired IDAs and loss of CP. Two mouse models (<italic>Dnah12<sup>-/-</sup> and Dnah12<sup>mut/mut</sup></italic>) were generated, recapitulating the abnormal flagellum morphology and structure observed in patients, thereby confirming the pathogenic role of <italic>DNAH12</italic> mutations in asthenoteratozoospermia. Through testicular Co-IP and mass spectrometry proteomics, we screened and validated that DNAH12 interacts with IDA components like DNALI1 and DNAH1 and is indispensable for recruiting DNALI1 and DNAH1 to sperm flagella, highlighting the crucial role of DNAH12 in sperm flagellar development. Notably, deficiency of DNAH12 does not manifest PCD symptoms in humans and mice, underscoring the unique role of DNAH12 in flagellar development. Collectively, our study not only unveils the functional significance of the previously unexplored gene <italic>DNAH12</italic> but also elucidates the pathogenic link between <italic>DNAH12</italic> mutations and asthenoteratozoospermia.</p><p>DNAH12 and other dynein arm proteins share the N-terminal Stem domain, which is crucial for structure and accessory subunit binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kollmar, 2016</xref>), and the motor domain which encompasses ~6 AAA + ATPase modules forming the ring-shaped oligomeric complexes responsible for force production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Canty et al., 2021</xref>). Five of the identified <italic>DNAH12</italic> mutations, primarily in the Stem domain (critical for DNALI1 interaction), result in loss-of-function effects, indicating a weak tolerance property of the Stem domain. Similar weak tolerance features were observed in mutations of other dynein arm components like <italic>DNAH1</italic> and <italic>DNAH2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sha et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hwang et al., 2021</xref>). The profound impact of these variants, particularly missense mutations, underscores delicate features of the Stem domain and DNAH family members. Notably, DNAH12 stands out as the shortest in sequence length and the only one lacking the essential MTBD region within the DNAH family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lacey et al., 2019</xref>). MTBD, a 15-nanometer coiled-coil stalk structure, crucially supports ATP-sensitive microtubule binding properties and determines dynein motility direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carter et al., 2008</xref>). Our investigation revealed that DNAH12 interacts with other IDA components, specifically DNALI1 and DNAH1. Despite the mutual dependence between DNAH1 and DNALI1 for their flagellar localization, DNAH12 is prerequisite for the proper assembly of DNALI1 and DNAH1 onto sperm flagella in both humans and mice. Notably, <italic>Dnah12<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice exhibit more severe phenotypes than <italic>Dnali1</italic> and <italic>Dnah1</italic> knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Khan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yap et al., 2023</xref>), including a more severe reduced sperm count (~2% of normal values), this observation further supports our perspective.</p><p>Deficiency in DNAH12 presented sperm ultrastructural defects like CP loss and impaired IDAs indicating essential roles of DNAH12 in the maintenance of axonemal integrity and arrangement. These results indicate essential roles of DNAH12 in the maintenance of axonemal integrity and arrangement. Noteworthy, deficiency of DNAH12 potential partner DNAH1, a well-known asthenoteratozoospermia-related gene, presents quite similar defects with DNAH12, indicating DNAH12 and DNAH1 possibly exhibit synergic functions in axonemal proper arrangement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ben Khelifa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wambergue et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). In addition to DNAH12 and DNAH1, deficiency in DNAH2 or DNAH6 also leads to high proportions of CP loss and disorganized axonemal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hwang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gao et al., 2021</xref>). However, DNALI1, DNAH7, or DNAH10 deficiency results in no obvious CP loss but impaired IDA integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gao et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wei et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wu et al., 2023</xref>). These studies indicate that specific IDA components, like DNAH12 and DNAH1, are required for the maintenance of CP integrity. Moreover, discrepancies observed in the phenotypes resulting from deficiencies in specific IDAs suggest that multiple dynein proteins are produced to support the intricate organization of sperm flagella. Additionally, these proteins may exhibit distinct characteristics and perform unique functions to some extent. Noteworthy, deficiency in RS head proteins RSPH1, RSPH9, or DNAJB13 were related to axonemal CP loss phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zou et al., 2020</xref>), indicating that DNAH12, and other IDAs, possibly regulate the stability of CP through the cooperation with RS head proteins. Notably, while the adoption of AlphaFold3 and HDOCK contributes to a clearer model of protein structures and their interactions, further techniques like cryo-EM may facilitate a deeper understanding of these proteins at higher resolution. Elucidating the dependencies among the assembly of sperm components could enhance our understanding of the structural basis of sperm motility and human fertility. Additionally, while an enrichment of IDA and RS proteins, but not nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC) proteins, was observed in the DNAH12 interactome, further exploration is needed to determine whether DNAH12 may indirectly affect the stability and functionality of the N-DRC structure.</p><p>The localization of DNAH12 presents dynamic changes during spermiogenesis. DNAH12 is initially expressed in the cytoplasm of the round spermatid, while itâs enriched in the manchette structure of the elongating spermatid and the tail of the elongated spermatid. The manchette and the sperm tail axoneme are two microtubular platforms that transport proteins to the developing head and tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lehti and Sironen, 2016</xref>). Manchette is a transient skirt-like structure and functions as a scaffold for morphological remodeling, contributing to the formation of the sperm head, neck, and tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hu et al., 2023b</xref>). Here, we found that DNAH12 deficiency results in abnormal manchette structure and compromised sperm head and tail morphology. Additionally, in sperm of <italic>Dnah12</italic><sup>-/-</sup> males, several CP complex proteins like SPAG6, and SPEF2 are not properly assembled and the axoneme structure of the tail was severely disorganized, indicating dynein components are responsible for proper axonemal components organization. Noteworthy, DNALI1, a potential DNAH12 interacting partner showed similar localization patterns to DNAH12, a study presented that DNALI1 recruits and stabilizes manchette component PACRG, and DNALI1 deficiency causes impaired sperm flagellar assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yap et al., 2023</xref>). These data hint that dynein proteins like DNAH12 and DNALI, possibly work together in the manchette organization as well as sperm flagellar components assembly during sperm development.</p><p>DNAH12 was also detected in the lungs, tracheas, and female oviducts while no cilia morphology defects in these tissues or PCD symptoms were observed in both two mice models. Besides, none of the patients carrying bi-allelic <italic>DNAH12</italic> mutations claimed symptoms of PCD via visits except for the reproductive problems. <italic>Dnah12<sup>-/</sup></italic><sup>-</sup> female mice showed normal development and fertility and the mother (III:2) of patients from family 2, carrying homozygous <italic>DNAH12</italic> mutation M2 had 6 offspring. Intriguingly, we found that the localization and abundance of DNALI1 and DNAH1 in oviductal or tracheal cilia were not affected after <italic>Dnah12</italic> deletion, indicating that DNAH12 works differently in flagella and cilia. Deficiency of specific DNAH members like DNAH6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2016</xref>), or DNAH7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wei et al., 2021</xref>), but not DNAH2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hwang et al., 2021</xref>), results in PCD symptoms. Hence, DNAH family members possibly present disparate processing of axonemal biogenesis and organization through evolution in flagella and cilia, further explorations could contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the differences between flagella and cilia, and personalized clinical diagnosis of related diseases like male/female infertility and/or PCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Previously, two genetic screening studies mentioned unverified compound heterozygous mutations and a homozygous missense mutation in <italic>DNAH12</italic>, predicting their association with patientsâ infertility. However, limited genetic evidence was provided, and the pathogenesis remained unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oud et al., 2021</xref>). Through investigations involving patients with <italic>DNAH12</italic> variants and mutant mouse models, we provide direct genetic and molecular evidence that variants in <italic>DNAH12</italic> are genetic causes of asthenoteratozoospermia, and DNAH12 along with DNAH1, DNALI1 is indispensable for sperm flagellar biogenesis. These data strongly support DNAH12 as a valuable marker in genetic counseling and diagnosis of male infertility.</p><p>ICSI is a widely used assisted reproductive technology in treating infertile men with asthenoteratozoospermia. Deficiency in most dynein proteins leads to asthenoteratozoospermia with severely compromised sperm motility and morphology. Previous studies have shown that patients carrying mutations in <italic>DNAH17</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Whitfield et al., 2019</xref> have poor ICSI outcomes while patients with <italic>DNAH1</italic>(59), <italic>DNAH2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gao et al., 2021</xref>), <italic>DNAH3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Meng et al., 2024</xref>), <italic>DNAH7</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wei et al., 2021</xref>), or <italic>DNAH8</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Weng et al., 2021</xref>) mutations have achieved favorable clinical pregnancy. Thus, the comparative study of asthenoteratozoospermia-related genes on their ICSI outcomes will be beneficial to developing individualized treatment recommendations in clinical practice. In our study, the successful ICSI outcomes of <italic>Dnah12</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice suggest that ICSI could be used as a potential treatment for infertile men carrying <italic>Dnah12</italic> mutations. Itâs meaningful to evaluate the prognosis for ICSI treatments in patients carrying <italic>DNAH12</italic> variants in a large population.</p><p>In conclusion, our study functionally and mechanistically sheds light on a special and poorly characterized protein DNAH12, during the intricate process of sperm flagellar biogenesis.

In order to study in-depth, we have analyzed the protein sequence features of DNAH12 protein, 1-200 amino acids of DNAH12 were selected as the ideal antigen considering its good performance (1. high immunogenicity; 2. High hydrophilicity; 3. Good Surface Leakage Groups; 4. Sequence homology analysis to avoid unspecific recognition to other proteins;). The two different anti-DNAH12 antibodies were developed with the help Dia-An Biotech company in 2022, we have tried to acquire the polypeptide fragments of target proteins to do peptide blocking but the material were discard after the service. Luckily, we have got the target band of DNAH12 protein in western blotting experiment while the band was not detected in knockout mice group; the immunofluorescence signals of DNAH12 were strong but not present in knockout mice group. Besides, we have tested that the inhouse raised rabbit antibody were suitable for IP experiment. The IP experiment also showed the raised rabbit antibody were able to immunoprecipitated the DNAH12 band in the <italic>Dnah12</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice but not in <italic>Dnah12</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. Collectively, these data could support the specificity of the raised DNAH12 antibodies. In IP assay, we have added the IgG group in the IP-mass spectrometry to exclude non-specific binding. And the experimental design was described in Figure 6B. The raw data were deposited in iProX partner repository (accession number: PXD051681), and we have coordinated with the repository manager to make the data publicly accessible (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.iprox.cn/page/subproject.html?id=IPX0008674001">https://www.iprox.cn/page/subproject.html?id=IPX0008674001</ext-link>).</p><p>Besides, we have conducted replicates of western blotting of sperm and testis extracts at least 3 times and added the objective quantifications of immunofluorescence signals and WB images.

We are delighted that you found our study to be a strong substantiation of DNAH12's essential role in spermiogenesis, particularly in axonemal assembly.

Actually, it seems that although humans and mice share the male infertility phenotypes with deficiency in dynein proteins essential for sperm flagellar development, they are different in some ways. For instance, it has been reported that deficiency in DNAH17 (Clin Genet. 2021. PMID: 33070343) or DNAH8 (Am J Hum Genet. 2020. PMID: 32619401; PMCID: PMC7413861), two other members of Dynein Axonemal Heavy Chain family, also cause more severe phenotype in mice, comparing with that of human patients carrying bi-allelic DNAH17 or DNAH8 loss-of-function mutations. In knockout mice, sperm counts are lower, and the proportion of abnormal sperm morphology is higher, whereas the phenotypes in human patients tend to be milder. These observations suggest that orthologs may influence spermatogenesis to slightly different extents in humans and mice. We plan to investigate the mechanisms underlying these discrepancies in future studies, which will provide deeper insights into axonemal assembly and the evolutionary aspects of spermatogenesis. Thank you again for bringing up this important issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>This reviewer is impressed by the study's depth and the extent of the methodology used in the study. The study is well-designed, and the results are very interesting. The reviewer's enthusiasm was reduced by the lack of some controls (provided that the reviewer did not miss them). Further are point-to-point suggestions that this reviewer believes will increase the merit of the present study.</p><p>Title:</p><p>(1) Why a &quot;special&quot; dynein? What makes it special when compared to other dyneins? I suggest removing the word special.</p></disp-quote><p>Through phylogenetic and protein domain analyses of the DNAH family, we found that DNAH12 is the shortest member and the only one that lacks a typical microtubule-binding domain (MTBD) in the DNAH family, thus we want to describe it as a âspecialâ dynein. We have fully considered your valuable suggestion and decided to remove it from the title.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Abstract:</p><p>(2) L23: same as above, why special?</p></disp-quote><p>We identified DNAH12 as the shortest member of the DNAH family and uniquely lacking the typical microtubule-binding domain (MTBD).

Figure S11 only shows the presence of cilia in DNAH12-/- mouse. A TEM image of cilia is required to confirm or reject the claim that DNAH12 does not play a crucial role in proper microtubule organization in cilia.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added TEM images of cilia in wild-type and <italic>Dnah12</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. The ultra-structures of cilia axonemes were comparable in wild-type and <italic>Dnah12</italic><sup>-/-</sup> groups, suggesting that DNAH12 may not play crucial role in proper microtubule organization. The results have now been added to Supplemental Figure 11F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) L122-6: Did the authors also confirm these structures by cryo-EM? If not, this needs to be pointed out as a shortcoming in the discussion, that the structures and interactions are predicted in silico only.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. Due to resource limit, we do not perform cryo-EM to confirm these structures. We will pursue the structures details at an atomic resolution structure in further study. We understand this point and now we have addressed this as a shortcoming in the discussion part.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) L134: Be more specific about what characteristics of DNAH12 were analyzed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. We have now updated these in the method part. The characteristics of the DNAH12 including its region immunogenicity, hydrophilicity, surface leakage groups, and sequence homology were analyzed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) L137: Be more specific about how the antibodies validated were. Were the antibodies validated for both immunofluorescence and western blotting?

We validated the antibodies for both immunofluorescence and western blotting to ensure their effectiveness in our experiments. The two different anti-DNAH12 antibodies were developed with the help Dia-An Biotech company in 2022, we have attempted to acquire the polypeptide fragments of target proteins to do peptide blocking but the material were disposed after the service. Luckily, we have got the target band of DNAH12 protein which showed strong signal in western blotting experiment and the band was not detected in knockout mice group; the immunofluorescence signals of DNAH12 were strong but not present in knockout mice group. Besides, the IP experiment also showed the raised rabbit antibody were able to immunoprecipitated the DNAH12 band in the <italic>Dnah12</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice but not in <italic>Dnah12</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. Collectively, these data could support the specificity of the raised DNAH12 antibodies. We sincerely admire your suggestion and will require for the peptide material if we develop new antibodies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) L142: This reviewer is unfamiliar with using TRIzol for sperm protein extraction. Is there a specific reason for not using PAGE loading buffer for human sperm protein extraction?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestions. TRIzol reagent can be used for small amounts of samples (5Ã10<sup>6</sup> cells) as well as large amounts of samples (&gt;10<sup>7</sup> cells). It is suitable for extraction of RNA and proteins at the same time. Our lab has adopted these methods in our previous work (Hum Reprod Open. 2023; PMID: 37325547; PMCID: PMC10266965.). This method is very useful to process valuable small amounts of samples for scientific work. The human sperm protein extraction was added with SDS-sample buffer [PAGE loading buffer] before SDS-PAGE separation. We have added this detail in the method part. We are sorry for making this misunderstanding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) L144: Were these the final concentrations of the SDS loading buffer? 1 Ã Laemmli buffer contains 62.5 mM TRIS, 2% (w/w) SDS, 10 % (w/v) glycerol, and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol. Please, amend accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestions. We apologized for incorrect labelling of concentrations (The previous one is 3Ã SDS loading buffer).

Please, include references to the studies where the generation and validation of these antibodies is described.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestions. We have developed a DNAH1 antibody for use in Western blot assays, with its generation and validation detailed in Frontiers in Endocrinology (Lausanne), 2021 (PMID: 34867808; PMCID: PMC8635859). Additionally, we have produced a DNAH17 antibody for both immunofluorescence (IF) and Western blot, as described in Journal of Experimental Medicine, 2020 (PMID: 31658987; PMCID: PMC7041708). These references have now been included.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) L167: Please, spell out ICR at its first appearance.</p></disp-quote><p>Done as suggested, Thank you. The full name of ICR is Institute of Cancer Research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11)L169: This reviewer is confused. It seems that the mouse encodes DNAH12 on exons 5 and 18 simultaneously. Each mouse model has only one exon targeted for a knockout. Would not this mean that the expression of DNAH12 in both models is not completely knocked down? Please, give more background in this paragraph for those less familiar with CRISPR/Cas9.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your insightful comment. We appreciate your attention to detail. To clarify, while the mouse model does indeed encode DNAH12 on exons 5 and 18 simultaneously, we specifically targeted the key exon 5 or exon 18 in each model to achieve different knockout strategies. This approach allows us to assess the functional implications of the remaining DNAH12 expression in both models. We have checked the DNAH12 expression in both models, and the result showed both models present with undetected DNAH12 proteins, indicating both models were completely knocked out of DNAH12 proteins. Additionally, we will revise the manuscript to include further details on the CRISPR/Cas9 methodology, ensuring accessibility for readers less familiar with this technique. Thank you again for your valuable feedback, which we believe will greatly enhance our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) L201: 50 % PBS? As in 0.5 x concentrated PBS?

We have checked the ciliary motility using an inverted microscope, and no significant difference of ciliary motility were observed between the knockout group and the control group.

What would be the mechanism that locates DNAH12 which lacks MTBD to the flagella?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your insightful question. We are currently investigating the mechanisms that facilitate the loading of DNAH12 to the flagella. Based on existing data, we hypothesize that CCDC39 and/or CCDC40 may play a critical role in the recruitment of DNAH12 to sperm flagella during spermiogenesis (Nat Genet. 2011, PMID: 21131972; PMCID: PMC3509786; Nat Genet. 2011, PMID: 21131974; PMCID: PMC3132183). Furthermore, a structural study by Walton et al. showed that DNAH12 associates with CCDC39/CCDC40 proteins (Nature. 2023, PMID: 37258679; PMCID: PMC10266980). These findings suggest that CCDC39 and/or CCDC40 may play a role in facilitating the localization of DNAH12 to the flagella. Additional studies are needed to identify other potential factors involved in this process and to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying this complex biological phenomenon.</p></body></sub-article></article>
