During peak epidermal stratification, the distribution of division angles among basal keratinocyte progenitors is bimodal, with planar and perpendicular divisions driving symmetric and asymmetric daughter cell fates, respectively. An apically restricted, evolutionarily conserved spindle orientation complex that includes the scaffolding protein LGN/Pins/Gpsm2 plays a central role in promoting perpendicular divisions and stratification, but why only a subset of cell polarize LGN is not known. Here, we demonstrate that the LGN paralog, AGS3/Gpsm1, is a novel negative regulator of LGN and inhibits perpendicular divisions. Static and ex vivo live imaging reveal that AGS3 overexpression displaces LGN from the apical cortex and increases planar orientations, while AGS3 loss prolongs cortical LGN localization and leads to a perpendicular orientation bias. Genetic epistasis experiments in double mutants confirm that AGS3 operates through LGN. Finally, clonal lineage tracing shows that LGN and AGS3 promote asymmetric and symmetric fates, respectively, while also influencing differentiation through delamination. Collectively, these studies shed new light on how spindle orientation influences epidermal stratification.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>oriented cell divisions</kwd><kwd>spindle orientation</kwd><kwd>epithelial cells</kwd><kwd>epidermis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AR077591</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>Scott E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006221</institution-id><institution>United States - Israel Binational Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019230</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>Scott E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011034</institution-id><institution>Sidney Kimmel Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SKF-15-065</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>Scott E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014989</institution-id><institution>Chan Zuckerberg Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2020- 225716</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kedziora</surname><given-names>Katarzyna M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A proper balance of planar and perpendicular balances is critical to establishing proper epidermal architecture and is mediated by the opposing activities of LGN and its enigmatic paralog AGS3.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Asymmetric cell divisions (ACDs), whereby progenitor cells divide to give rise to daughter cells that adopt different fates, are an important mechanism to promote cellular diversity. Many ACDs rely on proper orientation of the mitotic spindle, which can be influenced by intrinsic and extrinsic cues as well as mechanical forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Finegan and Bergstralh, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lechler and Mapelli, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sunchu and Cabernard, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">van Leen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Venkei and Yamashita, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Williams and Fuchs, 2013</xref>). Spindle orientation is regulated intrinsically by an evolutionarily conserved ternary complex, which includes the core scaffolding protein LGN (Gpsm2), microtubule-binding protein NuMA/Mud, and small G proteins of the Gαi/o family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Colombo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Du and Macara, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Du et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schaefer et al., 2000</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the LGN ortholog Pins plays a key role in neuroblast stem cells, where it orients the mitotic spindle to promote the unequal inheritance of fate determinants that results in asymmetric daughter cell fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bellaïche et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schaefer et al., 2000</xref>). The Par3/aPKC/Par6 polarity complex and Insc—among other proteins—facilitate membrane association of the LGN–NuMA–Gαi ternary complex, while downstream, the motor protein dynein mediates pulling forces on astral microtubules to reorient the spindle (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bergstralh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">di Pietro et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Morin and Bellaïche, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tadenev and Tarchini, 2017</xref>).</p><p>In developing stratified epithelia, we and others have shown that, in a subset of basal progenitors, LGN localizes asymmetrically to the apical cortex and promotes perpendicular divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lechler and Fuchs, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Luxenburg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Williams et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Williams et al., 2014</xref>). Epidermal loss of LGN, or deletion of NuMA’s microtubule-binding domain, leads to reduced perpendicular divisions, decreased differentiation, and impaired barrier function, resulting in neonatal lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Seldin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Williams et al., 2011</xref>). These studies highlight the critical importance of perpendicular divisions in establishing proper epidermal architecture. However, only half of mitoses result in perpendicular divisions in wild-type (WT) embryos, with the other half occurring at an orthogonal, planar orientation. LGN is absent from the cortex in planar divisions, and planar divisions occur independently of known spindle orienting proteins, including LGN, NuMA, Insc, Par3, and Gai3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Williams et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Williams et al., 2014</xref>). This raises the related questions of whether planar divisions are simply a default process, and if the ability of only some cells to polarize apical LGN is actively regulated.</p><p>LGN/Gpsm2 is a member of the AGS (activator of G-protein signaling) family of proteins, named because they promote G-protein signaling in a receptor-independent manner. In vertebrates, LGN has a closely related paralog, AGS3 (Gpsm1), and the two proteins share high protein homology and a conserved domain structure, consisting of seven to eight N-terminal tetra-tricopeptide repeats (TPRs) and four C-terminal GoLoco motifs—also known as the G-protein regulatory (GPR) region—separated by a flexible linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blumer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schiller and Bergstralh, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wavreil and Yajima, 2020</xref>). Biochemical and structural studies predict that AGS3 retains the ability to interact with many of the same binding partners as LGN, including Insc and NuMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adhikari and Sprang, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Culurgioni et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Izaki et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Saadaoui et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yuzawa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zhu et al., 2011b</xref>).</p><p>However, there remains sparse evidence that AGS3/Gpsm1 possesses spindle orienting activity. An early study showed that AGS3 loss in murine ventricular zone neuronal progenitors increased the proportion of planar divisions, a phenotype that could be mimicked by overexpressing Gαi3 or blocking Gβɣ signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sanada and Tsai, 2005</xref>). On the other hand, another study found that LGN, but not AGS3, was expressed in ventricular zone progenitors and suggested that RNAi targeting of AGS3 had no spindle orientation phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Konno et al., 2008</xref>). Most recently, the Morin lab showed that <italic>Gpsm1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> knockout brains have normal spindle orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Saadaoui et al., 2017</xref>). Overall, while AGS3 does not appear to regulate division orientation in the developing brain, LGN has a well-documented role in promoting planar divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Fujita et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Konno et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lacomme et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mora-Bermúdez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Morin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Saadaoui et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The canonical spindle orientation machinery, including LGN, has long been assumed to operate exclusively during metaphase to orient division prior to chromosome segregation. However, we recently described a novel late-stage spindle orientation process that shares similarity to the post-mitotic reintegration described in <italic>Drosophila</italic> egg chamber follicular epithelium and murine intestinal crypts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergstralh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cammarota et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">McKinley et al., 2018</xref>). We found that a high percentage of epidermal basal cells enters anaphase at oblique angles, which later correct to either planar or perpendicular over the next hour, with the majority of correction occurring in the first 10–15 min after anaphase onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lough et al., 2019</xref>). We have termed this process ‘telophase correction’ because it initiates during telophase. While this mechanism is dependent on cell–cell adhesions and their actin scaffolds, it remains unclear whether LGN or other spindle effectors participate in telophase correction or are truly exclusive to early spindle positioning.</p><p>Here, we further investigate the role of AGS3 and LGN in regulating oriented cell divisions during epidermal stratification. We find that AGS3 favors planar divisions by antagonizing the ability of LGN to promote and maintain perpendicular divisions. Both knockdown and global knockout of AGS3/Gpsm1 lead to a higher proportion of perpendicular divisions during peak stratification, while overexpression increases planar divisions. AGS3 loss enhances apical LGN localization throughout mitosis, while AGS3 overexpression decreases the efficiency of LGN polarization. Using ex vivo live imaging of epidermal explants, we show that LGN not only regulates initial perpendicular spindle orientations during early stages of mitosis but also plays a maintenance role during telophase, promoting perpendicular reorientation. In support of a model where AGS3 opposes—and acts through—LGN throughout mitosis, we find that AGS3 promotes planar divisions yet has no effect when LGN is absent. Finally, using mitotic clone genetic lineage tracing in AGS3 and LGN-deficient mice, we show that impairing perpendicular and planar divisions, respectively, has direct effects on asymmetric and symmetric cell fates, while also indirectly impacting the other major route of differentiation in the epidermis, delamination. Together, these data suggest that the two vertebrate Pins orthologs LGN and AGS3 play opposing roles in regulating spindle orientation and differentiation in the developing epidermis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>LGN/Gpsm2 and AGS3/Gpsm1 have opposing functions in oriented cell divisions</title><p>Proper orientation of the mitotic spindle relies on the evolutionarily conserved ternary protein complex LGN–NuMA–Gɑi (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bergstralh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lechler and Mapelli, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Morin and Bellaïche, 2011</xref>).

These data strongly suggest that apical LGN not only directs initial spindle positioning during early mitosis, but also promotes perpendicular reorientation during late mitosis.</p><p>Next, we performed the same experiments on an AGS3 KO background to determine whether AGS3 regulates initial spindle positioning, reorientation, or both. Once again, WT littermate controls refined from an evenly distributed to a bimodal pattern during the anaphase–telophase transition period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>, black lines). At the population level, the distribution of division angles in AGS3 KOs displayed a downward shift—indicating a perpendicular bias compared to WT littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). At the individual cell level, WT obliques were once again similarly likely to correct to planar or perpendicular. However, among AGS3 KO obliques, the vast majority (72%, 13/18) corrected to perpendicular (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I, J</xref>; example shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). These data demonstrate that while LGN influences both initial spindle positioning and reorientation, the effect of AGS3 is more pronounced in telophase correction.

To test this, we took advantage of the fact that epidermal stratification occurs in both LGN-independent and -dependent phases. In the single-layered epithelium (E12.5 and earlier), divisions are initially planar, become ‘randomized’ by E13.5–E14.5 when stratification commences, and finally adopt their mature ‘bimodal’ distribution by ~E15.5–E16.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Damen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lechler and Fuchs, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Williams et al., 2014</xref>). LGN first shows apical polarization at ~E15.5, and LGN loss has no effect on spindle orientation prior to this age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Williams et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, the initial phases of stratification occur independently of LGN. Interestingly, like LGN, loss of AGS3 in early (E14.5) epithelia caused no significant effect on spindle orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).

Thus, it is possible that daughter cells could either differentiate following divisions or alternatively, reintegrate into the basal layer following mitosis.

Due to technical challenges of following daughter cell fates via long-term ex vivo imaging of embryonic explants, we instead relied on clonal analyses in fixed tissues to determine the effect of AGS3 and LGN loss on cell fate choices.</p><p>Genetic lineage tracing is a powerful tool to identify clonally related cells, and relies on induction of a permanent genetic mark—usually a fluorescent protein—by a tissue-specific, inducible Cre recombinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Previously, we and others have used short-term ‘mitotic’ genetic lineage tracing to characterize self-renewing and differentiating behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Byrd et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Poulson and Lechler, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Williams et al., 2014</xref>). These include the following clone types: (1) symmetric cell divisions (SCDs), which contain two basal cells; (2) ACDs, which contain one basal and one suprabasal cells; and (3) delamination events, which contain a single suprabasal (spinous) cell. Across these studies, there has been a good correlation between the proportions of SCD and ACD clones with frequencies of planar and perpendicular divisions in fixed tissue. However, whether loss of essential spindle orientation genes affects cell fate choices has never been directly tested.</p><p>Recently, we used mitotic genetic lineage tracing to show that loss of the adherens junction protein afadin (<italic>Afdn</italic>), which interferes with telophase reorientation fidelity, leads to an increase in asymmetric fate clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lough et al., 2019</xref>).

Although the <italic>Krt14</italic> promoter is less active in suprabasal cells, in order to minimize inclusion of clones that may have been induced while already differentiated, only single-cell clones in the first spinous layer were counted as delamination events.</p><p>We compared the proportion of SCD and ACD clones in AGS3 KOs (<italic>Gpsm1<sup>−/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup>) and heterozygote/WT (<italic>Gpsm1<sup>+/</sup></italic>) littermate controls, and observed a significant shift toward ACDs in KOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). On the other hand, loss of LGN led to a sharp increase in SCD clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>).

These data confirm that LGN and AGS3 play opposing roles in regulating oriented cell divisions, which result in altered cell fate choices at the clonal level.</p><p>It is worth noting that in both AGS3 and LGN mutants, there was agreement between cell fate choices determined by genetic lineage tracing and division orientation at the ‘anaphase +1 hr’ timepoint of our ex vivo live-imaging studies. For example, 74% of AGS3 KO cells showed perpendicular/oblique orientations at +1 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>), and 79% of divisions resulted in ACD clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). Similarly, in LGN KOs, 86% of imaged mitoses adopted planar orientations at +1 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), and 88% of mitotic clones were SCDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). This suggests that ex vivo live imaging captures the behaviors that occur in vivo, and that measures of telophase orientations accurately reflect fate outcomes.</p><p>During epidermal development, differentiation can be accomplished through either ACD or delamination. Delamination is a process by which basal cells initiate differentiation within the basal layer (e.g., via upregulation of spinous keratins such as K10), followed by detachment from the underlying basement membrane and upward migration into the spinous layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cockburn et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ellis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">May et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Watt and Green, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wickström and Niessen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Williams et al., 2014</xref>). We and others have documented that delamination is the predominant mode of differentiation during early stratification (E12.5–E15.5), while ACDs become more common during peak to late stratification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Damen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Williams et al., 2014</xref>). In both embryonic and adult epidermis, the processes of proliferation and differentiation are spatially correlated and can locally influence each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mesa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wickström and Niessen, 2018</xref>). However, it remains an open question whether mutations that alter the balance between SCDs and ACDs could impact delamination. To test this, we examined whether the proportions of the two types of ‘differentiative’ clones—ACD and delamination—were affected by LGN or AGS3 loss. While no significant change in differentiation behavior was observed in AGS3 KOs, delamination events were significantly increased in both LGN KOs and AGS3/LGN double KOs, where ACDs are infrequent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>). These data demonstrate that elevated delamination can partially compensate for the impaired differentiation by ACD observed upon LGN loss, and may explain why the epidermal thinning is less severe than expected in the absence of LGN.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Collectively, these studies show that LGN/Gpsm2 and AGS3/Gpsm1 play opposing roles in regulating oriented cell divisions and fate choices in the developing epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Static and live analyses of division orientation, genetic lineage tracing, and quantification of differentiation markers confirm that AGS3 promotes self-renewal through SCDs while LGN promotes differentiation via ACDs. LGN knockdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Williams et al., 2011</xref>) or knockout (these studies) leads to a planar bias in division orientation, which we also observe when AGS3 is overexpressed. Conversely, AGS3 loss has the reverse effect, increasing perpendicular divisions. LGN, Pins, and its homologs have evolutionarily conserved roles in determining the axis of the mitotic spindle. Beyond this canonical function, we now provide evidence that LGN is also required during late stages of mitosis to correct ‘errant’ oblique divisions toward perpendicular. Finally, in the absence of AGS3, we observe enhanced cortical LGN localization throughout mitosis and demonstrate that AGS3 promotes planar divisions during telophase correction.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model of two-step process for oriented cell divisions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Basal progenitors can undergo either self-renewing planar symmetric divisions (red cell) or differentiative perpendicular asymmetric divisions (blue cell).

First, free GPSM proteins exist in a closed confirmation, where the N-terminal TPR region is bound to the C-terminal GPR repeats. The only protein known to be capable of binding LGN in its closed conformation is Gαi—preferentially in its GDP-loaded form—which is able to access the first GoLoco motif that is not involved in intramolecular interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Du and Macara, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Nipper et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Takayanagi et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, Gαi-GDP binding is thought to be an early event in complex formation, promoting cortical association of GPSM proteins due to Gαi myristoylation, and catalyzing additional Gαi binding that promotes the open conformation. An important corollary of the Gαi-GDP preference of GPR domains is that GPSM proteins act as guanine dissociation inhibitors that reduce the exchange of GDP for GTP on Gαi subunits, which in some contexts can be opposed by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Ric-8A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">David et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hampoelz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Woodard et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Second, structural studies have shown that LGN TPR domains cannot simultaneously bind multiple proteins, for example NuMA and Insc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Culurgioni et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yuzawa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zhu et al., 2011b</xref>). While an early model posited that Insc recruits LGN to the apical cortex and then hands it off to NuMA, the very high affinity of Insc for LGN suggests that LGN–Insc and LGN–NuMA are more likely to exist in separate pools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Culurgioni and Mapelli, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Culurgioni et al., 2018</xref>). Nonetheless, it remains possible that post-translational modifications could weaken this interaction and facilitate the dissociation of LGN from Insc.</p><p>Third, NuMA can bind both microtubules and dynein directly and is thought to be anchored by the LGN–NuMA–Gαi ternary complex at the plasma membrane to ensure correct spindle positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kotak et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Seldin et al., 2016</xref>). Recent structural studies have shown that LGN and NuMA can exist in a heterohexameric ring structure, which forms higher order networks that facilitate microtubule capture and orient spindles in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pirovano et al., 2019</xref>). It is not presently known whether AGS3 and NuMA can also form these higher order oligomers, but as discussed further below, key residues of LGN that mediate this interaction are missing in AGS3.</p><p>At a molecular level, we favor a model in which AGS3 competes with LGN for NuMA binding, preventing LGN from forming productive ternary complexes that capture astral microtubules at the apical cortex. This hypothesis is based on several lines of evidence. First, there is direct biochemical evidence that AGS3 can bind to NuMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Saadaoui et al., 2017</xref>), and the specific residues within the TPR5/6 domains of LGN that mediate binding to NuMA—N203, R221, and R236 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Culurgioni et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zhu et al., 2011b</xref>)—are conserved in AGS3. Second, a construct consisting of the AGS3-TPR domains localizes to spindle poles—where NuMA is present—while the TPR domains of LGN localize to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Saadaoui et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, an LGN chimera containing the AGS3 TPR domain can displace WT LGN from the cell cortex but can only partially rescue a <italic>Gpsm2</italic> spindle orientation defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Saadaoui et al., 2017</xref>). This suggests that the TPR domains of AGS3 might have a higher affinity for NuMA than LGN, but cannot orient spindles efficiently, perhaps because AGS3-NuMA cannot form a functional apical complex. Third, mutations in LGN, or NuMA, that render them oligomerization deficient—for example, unable to form hexameric ring structures—lack spindle orienting ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pirovano et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, the ability of GPSM protein TPR domains to form higher-order complexes with NuMA appears to be critical for their function.</p><p>These studies also showed that the curvature of the NuMA–LGN hexamer is accomplished by the unusually long fourth TPR domain of LGN—which contains 54 amino acids instead of 34 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pirovano et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, murine AGS3 shows the poorest conservation with LGN in this particular domain (63% similar compared to &gt;86% similarity for all other TPRs), with the highest dissimilarity is in the region between the two alpha-helical regions (data not shown). While the crystal structure of the AGS3 TPR has not been solved, the divergence of this particular TPR that is critical for ring formation suggests that AGS3 may not be capable of forming heterohexamers with NuMA. Moreover, another region of LGN that is critical for its oligomerization capacity is the short N-terminus that precedes the first TPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pirovano et al., 2019</xref>). This N-terminal region is highly conserved among vertebrate <italic>Gpsm2</italic> orthologs, but entirely divergent among <italic>Gpsm1</italic> orthologs (data not shown), providing a second line of evidence that NuMA bound to AGS3 is unlikely to form ring structures.</p><p>A caveat of this reductionist model in which LGN and AGS3 play opposing roles in promoting or inhibiting NuMA’s cortical recruitment and spindle orienting activity is that while LGN and Pins are required for NuMA and Mud (the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog of NuMA) to localize to the cell cortex, they are not always sufficient. For example, the existence of an LGN-independent mechanism to recruit NuMA to the apical and/or basal cortex could explain the small proportion of cells that are still able to execute perpendicular divisions in LGN KOs. Studies of HeLa and keratinocyte cells in culture have shown that LGN is required for NuMA’s cortical recruitment through metaphase, but dispensable at anaphase, where instead, 4.1 G/R serves to anchor NuMA to the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kiyomitsu and Cheeseman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Seldin et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, a recent study in <italic>Drosophila</italic> follicular epithelium showed that Pins is recruited apically and laterally during mitosis, while Mud is lateral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Neville et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>This same study also showed that it is not the localization of Pins, but its upstream binding partner Insc, which is the best predictor of spindle orientation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> follicular epithelium, and raised the intriguing idea that there is a threshold level of Insc expression, above which it localizes apically—causing spindle misorientation—and below which it localizes laterally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Neville et al., 2023</xref>). Since AGS3 can also bind Insc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Izaki et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yuzawa et al., 2011</xref>), we also consider the possibility that cytoplasmic AGS3 may sequester Insc from the apical cortex in epidermal basal cells. A prediction of this model is that reduction of AGS3 would elevate Insc levels, while overexpression of AGS3 would reduce Insc levels. Following the Bergstralh threshold model, high levels of Insc could lead to its apical polarization while lower levels may lead to lateral or unpolarized Insc, with LGN presumably following Insc’s lead. While we are unable to observe endogenous Insc due to a lack of suitable antibodies, the observation that some AGS3-overexpressing cells show unpolarized rather than apical LGN, is consistent with this Insc threshold model.</p><p>While we favor that LGN and AGS3 compete for binding to a common interacting partner such as NuMA or Insc, it is also possible that AGS3 could bind to, and inhibit, LGN directly. For example, it has been shown that the AGS3 GPR region can pull-down the TPR domain of LGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Saadaoui et al., 2017</xref>). Unfortunately, crossreactivity between our LGN and AGS3 antibodies makes it difficult to test for colocalization in mitotic basal cells, as even our reasonably specific guinea pig anti-LGN antibody appears to label some AGS3 in LGN KOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Nonetheless, because AGS3 is primarily cytoplasmic, it could sequester a pool of LGN away from the cell cortex, preventing engagement with NuMA. One caveat to this model is that in order for AGS3 to bind to LGN, they would both need to be in their open conformations, a process believed to require Gαi-GDP binding. Because Gαi proteins are myristoylated and membrane associated, this event would be more likely to occur at the cell cortex.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Binding partners and subcellular localization of LGN and AGS3</title><p>The spindle orienting function of <italic>Gpsm2</italic> and its homologs is highly conserved throughout evolution, and may have evolved as early as the time when bilateria and cnidaria diverged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schiller and Bergstralh, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wavreil and Yajima, 2020</xref>). While LGN and its orthologs have an evolutionarily conserved role in oriented cell divisions, the manner and pattern in which LGN localizes to the cell cortex varies among epithelial tissues. For example, in the retina and developing oral epithelia, LGN localizes apically and serves a similar function in promoting perpendicular divisions as in epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Byrd et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lacomme et al., 2016</xref>). On the other hand, in the tactile filiform papilla of the dorsal tongue, radial glia of the subventricular zone, and neural tube, LGN localizes laterally and promotes planar divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Byrd et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Konno et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lacomme et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Morin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Peyre et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, while the spindle orienting capacity of LGN is conserved, its variable subcellular localization influences division directionality differently across tissues.</p><p>In addition to Insc and Gαi family proteins, a growing list of proteins—including Dlg, E-cadherin, Frmpd1/4, and afadin—have been found to promote the cortical localization of LGN in different contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Carminati et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gloerich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schiller and Bergstralh, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yuzawa et al., 2011</xref>). Although autoinhibition and phosphorylation are mechanisms known to regulate LGN’s ability to interact with proteins that promote its membrane association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bergstralh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Johnston et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pan et al., 2013</xref>), comparatively less is known about negative regulators. One example is SAPCD2, which inhibits the cortical localization of LGN in the retina, possibly by competing for NuMA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chiu et al., 2016</xref>). We believe that AGS3 is another, though clearly its function is context dependent, given its inability to orient spindles or influence LGN localization in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Saadaoui et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>While unbiased proteomic approaches might best ascertain how complexes containing AGS3 and LGN differ, we speculate that differences in their subcellular localization and function could also be attributable to post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation. The flexible linker domain of LGN/Pins has been shown to be phosphorylated by both aPKC and Aurora kinase, which mediate interactions with 14-3-3 and discs large (Dlg), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Johnston et al., 2009</xref>). While it is not known whether aPKC phosphorylation of LGN impacts its spindle orienting capacity, loss of <italic>Prkci</italic> in the epidermis does result in a spindle orientation phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Niessen et al., 2013</xref>). On the other hand, the Dlg–LGN interaction is highly conserved throughout evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schiller and Bergstralh, 2021</xref>), and a non-phosphorylatable <italic>Drosophila pins</italic><sup>S436A</sup> mutant is non-functional in an in vitro S2-induced polarity assay and in vivo in follicular epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Neville et al., 2023</xref>). Moreover, the equivalent mutation in vertebrate LGN (S401A) induces spindle misorientation in MDCK cells and the chick neural tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Saadaoui et al., 2014</xref>). This serine residue is conserved in the AGS3 linker, but there are some differences in the flanking residues, and it has been reported that the AGS3 linker binds Dlg with ~500-fold lower efficiency than LGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zhu et al., 2011a</xref>). While substitution of the LGN linker into AGS3 is not sufficient to relocalize AGS3 from the cytoplasm to the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Saadaoui et al., 2017</xref>), the converse experiment has not been attempted. Other potential phosphorylation sites for LGN include T450, which promotes growth in breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Fukukawa et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Another way in which AGS3 and LGN might differ is through their interactions with G proteins. Although LGN and AGS3 bind Gαi proteins with similar affinity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Willard et al., 2008</xref>), some of the best insights into how Gαi interactions influence their localization and function in vivo come from domain swap experiments between the GPR regions of LGN and AGS3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Saadaoui et al., 2017</xref>). The Morin lab found that while the AGS3 GPR domain cannot substitute for the LGN GPR domain, replacing the inter-GPR regions of AGS3 with those of LGN confers cortical localization. The converse is also true, in that replacing the inter-GPR regions of LGN with AGS3’s results in cytoplasmic localization. Moreover, for AGS3 it has been shown that addition of inter-GPR regions significantly enhances Gαi1 binding compared to isolated GPR domains alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adhikari and Sprang, 2003</xref>). Collectively, these findings suggest that the inter-domain regions contain important information that might regulate the ability of LGN/AGS3 to interact with specific Gαi proteins.</p><p>Saadaoui et al. speculated that variability in the interdomain regions might differentially affect intramolecular interactions between the TPR and GPR domains of LGN and AGS3, but conceivably, this could also impact their ability to bind specific Gαi proteins, particularly if post-translational modifications occur within these interdomains. There are three Gαi proteins in mammals and all are expressed in the epidermis, but it is Gαi3 which colocalizes with LGN, and <italic>Gnai3</italic> loss leads to a planar bias like loss of LGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Williams et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>Gnai2</italic> loss has no obvious phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Williams et al., 2014</xref>), and <italic>Gnai1</italic> loss has yet to be explored, so it remains possible that AGS3 may preferentially associate with a different cohort of Gαi proteins than LGN in the developing epidermis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Are planar divisions an active or ‘default’ process?</title><p>While much remains to be explored at the molecular level of how AGS3 interacts with the spindle orientation machinery, our studies shed new light on both the negative and positive regulation of perpendicular, asymmetric divisions. Importantly, we view AGS3 as a negative regulator of perpendicular divisions, rather than a promoter of planar divisions. We speculate that relative levels of AGS3 and LGN within individual cells determine the likelihood that they will both establish and maintain a perpendicular orientation throughout mitosis. However, this cannot explain why a significant fraction of basal cells ‘choose’ planar orientations independent of AGS3. The fact that LGN loss—and also combined AGS3/LGN loss—results in a strong planar bias rather than randomization of division angles suggests that either (1) there is an as-yet undiscovered active mechanism to promote planar divisions, or (2) planar may be the default process.</p><p>We favor the latter hypothesis for the following reasons. First, LGN is necessary for NuMA’s cortical localization, and NuMA—or dynactin— loss leads to a similar phenotype as LGN loss in the epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Seldin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Seldin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Williams et al., 2011</xref>). While there are numerous examples in the literature where NuMA can direct spindle orientation in an LGN/Pins-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergstralh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bosveld et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kiyomitsu and Cheeseman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kotak et al., 2014</xref>), there are few examples where spindles can be actively reoriented independently of NuMA and dynein. Second, planar divisions predominate in the early epidermis, prior to and during early stratification, and we are not familiar with any genetic alteration that induces <italic>precocious</italic> perpendicular divisions.</p><p>More likely, we believe that planar divisions are a default state, attributable to high tension across the basal layer, possibly as a result of stronger adhesive forces on lateral vs. apical cell membranes, or intra-tissue tension provided by differentiated layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ning et al., 2021</xref>). Of interest, Devenport et al. recently described increased perpendicular divisions and hyperthickened epidermis in <italic>Vangl2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Box et al., 2019</xref>). Unexpectedly, this phenotype was not due to defective planar cell polarity, but rather to tissue-wide changes in cell shape and packing caused by their neural tube defect. In addition to this effect of interphase cell shape on division orientation, hypoproliferation, and elevated apoptosis can lead to non-cell autonomous increases in planar divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Morrow et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Soffer et al., 2022</xref>).

Interestingly, in the embryo, the opposite relationship exists, such that proliferation seems to drive neighboring cells to delaminate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Miroshnikova et al., 2018</xref>). In other tissues, local crowding drives live-cell extrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Eisenhoffer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Marinari et al., 2012</xref>), and ‘winners’ (stem cells) and ‘losers’ (differentiating cells) have also been described during epidermal stratification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ellis et al., 2019</xref>). Yet, whether the two differentiation processes of ACD and delamination are linked has not been explored. Here, using genetic lineage tracing, we find that delamination increases when ACDs decrease in LGN KOs.

While this method does not require ground truth or low noise equivalent images to train a DL model, we nevertheless validated our N2V models by error mapping and quality metrics estimation of ground truth images (SSIM and RSE maps).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Spindle and division orientation</title><p>Spindle orientation measurements was performed as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Byrd et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lough et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Williams et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Williams et al., 2014</xref>, using Survivin as a marker of late-stage mitotic cells, with angles between daughter nuclei relative to the basement membrane measured using ImageJ. Rare anaphase cells were characterized by broadly distributed Survivin staining between daughter cells, while telophase cells showed dual-punctate Survivin staining. Division orientation measurements were calculated as the angle between a vector parallel to the basement membrane and a vector connecting the estimated center of each daughter nuclei. Cells where two daughter nuclei surrounding punctate Survivin staining could not be unambiguously identified were not counted. In cases where the division angle was oblique in the z-plane, image stacks were acquired to facilitate measurement of the division angle. Manual annotation tools in the LAS X software were used to draw arrows indicating daughter cells at the time of imaging to ensure that the correct angle was measured later in ImageJ.</p><p>Similarly, division orientation was measured in live-imaging experiments, where the position of the daughter nuclei was inferred based on cell volume/shape changes and/or the presence of the H2B-mRFP1 nuclear reporter (in AGS3 KD experiments). All divisions orientation measurements are provided in the source data file.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>LGN/AGS3 localization/intensity</title><p>Imaging of CD1 lentiviral H2B-RFP animals was performed with control littermates and experimental samples on the same slide to avoid variation in antibody staining. Similarly, with experimental genotypes, imaging was performed with control littermates on the same slide. Scoring of LGN localization patterns (e.g., apical, unpolarized, absent) was determined for cells labeled with pHH3 or Survivin (telophase marker), irrespective of the lentiviral H2B-RFP reporter to avoid bias. For linescan measurements of LGN cortical intensity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–E</xref>), similar methodology was utilized as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lough et al., 2019</xref>, using E-cadherin to define the boundary of the cell cortex in mitotic cells from E16.5 mosaically transduced <italic>Gpsm1<sup>1147</sup></italic> H2B-mRFP1 epidermis. To support comparisons across cells with variable circumferences, linescan data were compressed into 100 data points relative to the proportion of total line length. All mitotic cells in which a detectable LGN signal could be observed were quantified, and were later binned into AGS3 KD (RFP+) or WT (RFP−) based on the presence of absence of the nuclear H2B-mRFP1 reporter, which labels transduced cells. Measurements of non-cortical (cytoplasmic) fluorescence intensity were used for background subtraction. Mean (± standard deviation) cytoplasmic background values were equivalent in RFP− (11.6 ± 4.9 AU) and RFP+ (12.4 ± 4.6 AU) populations. For determination of the threshold to be used for calculating crescent width and integrated F.I., 10, 20, and 30 AU were each empirically tested, and yielded p-values of 0.302, 0.023, and 0.041, respectively, by Mann–Whitney test in comparing RFP− and RFP+ populations. Data from the 20 AU threshold were chosen for display in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> because this was the minimum value that eliminated most isolated (minor) peaks in fluorescence, which we considered to be noise. Cortical Coverage was determined as the percentage of the contiguous portion of the LGN F.I. plot that exceeded the 20 AU threshold. Integrated F.I. (referred to as AUC) was calculated as the aggregate area of trapezoids ((<italic>a</italic> + <italic>b</italic>)/2) for each unit of the area defined by Cortical Coverage, where <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic> are defined as threshold-subtracted individual measurements of LGN F.I.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Stratification</title><p>Epidermal thickness was measure in E14.5–E17.5 embryos by staining for H2B-RFP, K14, and K10.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Yukiko M Yamashita as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Dan Bergstralh (Reviewer #2); Kenneth E Prehoda (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As you can see in the individual reviewers' comments, they are positive overall. However, they commonly identified some critical issues. Among those, the most important issue is about the localization of LGN: its arbitrary calling (polarized, not-polarized, absent) is not convincing. A better quantification must be used to determine the localization of LGN upon manipulation of AGS3. Details are explained in individual comments. Reviewers also made other important suggestions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Throughout the manuscript, it is a bit hard to keep straight between LGN, AGS3, Gpsm1, and Gpsm2. It might be easier for readers to follow if you always put the names together, as in Figure 1 title ('LGN/Gpsm2').</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Recommendations/Concerns:</p><p>Division angles in Gpsm2-/- tissue are obviously (and statistically) different from those observed in wild-type tissue. However, since 16% of the divisions (about 20) are perpendicular, the claim that LGN is &quot;necessary&quot; for perpendicular divisions (line 134) seems incorrect. I suggest this word could be replaced with &quot;important.&quot; The finding that perpendicular divisions are decreased but not eliminated should be discussed in the text since it suggests that either the measurements are imperfect (this seems plausible) or that the LGN-dependent mechanism promotes – but is not required for – perpendicular division.</p><p>Experiments presented in Figure 2 are exceptionally thorough and careful.</p><p>Figure 3B is critical to the paper. At present, it is under-described and not entirely convincing.</p><p>I struggled to understand what the color scheme in Figure 3B is meant to convey. There are three colors associated with &quot;apical,&quot; but the distinction between these three is not explained in the legend. Once I did understand it, I couldn't see why it was useful. This issue persists in the remaining figures.</p><p>How is &quot;absent&quot; distinguished from &quot;unpolarized&quot; in 3B? I didn't find a description in the text or figure, though my interpretation of the relevant Methods section is that the determination was made manually. Could &quot;absent&quot; simply reflect low signal intensity or detection? Presumably, it is easiest to observe LGN when it is concentrated (apically), whereas an unpolarized (broadly cortical) signal is more difficult to detect. If the signal is low, might unpolarized and absent be the same thing? If not, then what does absent vs. unpolarized mean? Is AGS3 preventing cortical localization of LGN, polarized enrichment of LGN, or both? One important reason to clarify this is that AGS3 overexpression appears to markedly decrease the number of cells in the &quot;absent&quot; category. Gpsm1 knockdown doesn't have the opposite effect. Another important reason is that significance is determined using chi-square, meaning presumably that the proportion of cells in the absent and unpolarized categories (as opposed to just &quot;apical&quot; vs &quot;not apical&quot;) is taken into account when determining significance.</p><p>If possible, quantification of pixel intensity (A) around the cell perimeter and (B) in comparison to the cytoplasm could be a helpful strategy for making the distinction.</p><p>The discussion is scholarly and thorough. It was a pleasure to read.</p><p>The authors suggest that AGS3 could work by displacing LGN from a binding partner. Firstly, the finding that overexpressed AGS3 impacts LGN only after metaphase suggests that such an interaction must be temporally regulated, perhaps through post-translational modification. (A trivial suggestion is that the authors could raise this and/or other possibilities in the discussion.) Secondly, and more importantly, the authors suggest that the relevant binding partner is NuMA (line 501). In making this claim it seems that the authors are ascribing a new function to NuMA, namely the regulation of Telophase Correction. I am unaware of any data linking NuMA to this process and I am a bit confused as to why it would be, since cortical localization of NuMA at anaphase is reported to be LGN-independent.</p><p>As described in the Discussion, Culurgioni and Mapelli (2013) indeed suggested that Insc recruits LGN to the apical cortex, then hands it off to NuMA. In a subsequent paper not cited in this manuscript, Culurgioni et al. (2018) propose instead that LGN and Insc exist in a separate stable pool to LGN and NuMA, and that hand-off does not occur.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I found the abstract and introduction a bit confusing because of statements like, &quot;Little is known about the molecular regulation of planar divisions&quot;. My understanding is the planar divisions are known to be molecularly regulated by the lack of cortical LGN, so the real question is what makes only some cells have cortical LGN. This confused me because at times I thought the paper was going to be about the specific mechanisms that make planar divisions planar, which the discussion speculates on, but are not the main topic of the paper.</p><p>I had difficulty seeing the reorientation in Figure 4 supplement 1 (for that matter, the ones in Figures 4B, and C are difficult to see, even with the angles drawn on them). Perhaps fewer frames or some markings in the supplement could be beneficial to readers.</p><p>Figure 1D suggests statistical test is between AGS3 OE and KD -must be between AGS3 OE and WT.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80403.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Throughout the manuscript, it is a bit hard to keep straight between LGN, AGS3, Gpsm1, and Gpsm2.

However we understand how the multiple labeling of bar graphs could be confusing, so we stuck with the simple black/white/gray color scheme for this type of graph. Instead, different genotypes were color-coded in the label text when multiple genotypes are displayed in the same bar graphs (e.g. Figure 7G-I).
