Immunohistological and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses of retinogenesis processes reveal that retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) and Müller glial cells are the two cell types primarily affected by <italic>Mettl3</italic> deficiency. Integrative analyses of scRNA-seq and MeRIP-seq data suggest that m<sup>6</sup>A fine-tunes the transcriptomic transition from RPCs to Müller cells by promoting the degradation of RPC transcripts, the disruption of which leads to abnormalities in late retinogenesis and likely compromises the glial functions of Müller cells. Overexpression of m<sup>6</sup>A-regulated RPC transcripts in late RPCs partially recapitulates the <italic>Mettl3</italic>-deficient retinal phenotype. Collectively, our study reveals an epitranscriptomic mechanism governing progenitor-to-glial cell transition during late retinogenesis, which is essential for the homeostasis of the mature retina.

As a lateral derivative of the neural tube, the retina shares basic developmental, structural, and physiological principles with other neural tissues and has become an excellent model for studying neural biology. The retina is composed of six types of neurons, including rod and cone photoreceptors, bipolar cells, horizontal cells, amacrine cells, and retinal ganglion cells, that form complex neural circuits to detect and process visual signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Masland, 2001</xref>). In addition to neurons, the retina contains one type of glial cell, Müller cells. As the sole glial cell inside the retina, Müller cells play pivotal roles in maintaining structural, physiological, and functional homeostasis in the neural retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Newman and Reichenbach, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vecino et al., 2016</xref>). During development, all retinal neurons and Müller cells are derived from multipotent retinal progenitor cells (RPCs), which go through a series of competent states to give rise to various types of retinal cells in a sequential while overlapping manner. For example, in mice, retinal ganglion cells, cone photoreceptors, and GABAergic amacrine cells are born early before birth, while glycinergic amacrine cells, rod photoreceptors, and bipolar cells are born late during the postnatal period before RPCs finally become Müller glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agathocleous and Harris, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bassett and Wallace, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cepko, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heavner and Pevny, 2012</xref>). Similar to glial cells in other neural tissues, Müller cells maintain significant levels of gene expression signatures of progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blackshaw et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nelson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roesch et al., 2008</xref>), which has encouraged people to explore the in vivo reprogramming potentials of Müller cells for treating retinal degeneration disease purposes in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jorstad et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). However, to function as glial cells, Müller cells must develop and maintain their unique transcriptome distinct from that of RPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nelson et al., 2011</xref>). How the transcriptome of Müller cells is established and maintained is currently not well understood.</p><p>RNA modifications constitute an important layer of post-transcriptional regulation that orchestrates the metabolism, location, and function of transcripts, which are collectively referred to as the epitranscriptome. Among the various modes of mRNA modification, <italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) is the most prevalent internal modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Meyer and Jaffrey, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Meyer and Jaffrey, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roundtree et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zaccara et al., 2019</xref>). m<sup>6</sup>A is cotranscriptionally installed on RNAs in the nucleus by a multisubunit methyltransferase ‘writer’ complex, in which METTL3 and METTL14 form the catalytic core; but only METTL3 has methyltransferase catalytic activity, while METTL14 functions as an allosteric activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bokar et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bokar et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sledź and Jinek, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2016b</xref>). Two enzymes, FTO and ALKBH5, have been demonstrated to have m<sup>6</sup>A demethylase ‘eraser’ activity, emphasizing the reversible nature of the modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zheng et al., 2013</xref>). The effects of m<sup>6</sup>A on RNAs are mediated by various m<sup>6</sup>A readers, such as YTH family and HNRNP family proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zaccara et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>). Gene knockdown and genetic knockout studies on m<sup>6</sup>A writers, erasers, and readers have shown that m<sup>6</sup>A plays important roles in regulating various aspects of organism development, physiology, and disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Frye and Blanco, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Livneh et al., 2020</xref>). However, the functions of the m<sup>6</sup>A epitranscriptome in the visual system remain unclear.</p><p>To test whether m<sup>6</sup>A plays roles during vertebrate retinal development, we used morpholinos to knock down the m<sup>6</sup>A-writer complex in zebrafish. Analysis of the retinal phenotype of these morphant zebrafish indicated that m<sup>6</sup>A promotes the timely differentiation and survival of RPCs in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huang et al., 2021</xref>). In this study, using a mouse model of retina-specific conditional knockout of <italic>Mettl3</italic> and combining scRNA-seq, MeRIP-seq, and gene expression manipulation, we reveal that the m<sup>6</sup>A epitranscriptome plays critical roles during late retinogenesis by fine-tuning the transcriptomic transition from RPCs to Müller cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Mettl3</italic> deficiency leads to structural and physiological abnormalities in the retina</title><p>To investigate the function of the m<sup>6</sup>A epitranscriptome in the retina, we conditionally knocked out <italic>Mettl3</italic>, the core component of the m<sup>6</sup>A-writer complex, in RPCs using <italic>Six3-Cre</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Furuta et al., 2000</xref>) and <italic>Mettl3<sup>floxed</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lin et al., 2017</xref>) mice. METTL3 is abundantly and ubiquitously expressed in the retina from early embryonic age to adult stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). Immunofluorescence staining (IF) demonstrated that <italic>Mettl3</italic> was efficiently knocked out in the central retinas of <italic>Six3-Cre<sup>+</sup>; Mettl3<sup>floxed/floxed</sup></italic> mice (hereafter referred to as <italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and A’</xref>), and MeRIP-qPCR examination of several candidate genes showed that m<sup>6</sup>A levels were efficiently downregulated in <italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Even though <italic>Mettl3</italic> was efficiently deleted from RPCs, the retinas of <italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO mice at p0 appeared grossly normal, exhibiting an already separated retinal ganglion cell layer (RGL) and a still-developing retinoblast layer (RBL), comparable to littermate control retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and B’</xref>). However, at p14, the time point when retinogenesis should have completed and mature retinal organization should have been established, histological examination showed that the <italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO retinas exhibited severe structural disorganization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and C’</xref>). At this age, the control retinas were well laminated into three cellular layers and two synaptic layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In the mutant retinas, although all the cellular and synaptic layers were distinguishable, the outer nuclear layer (ONL) presented many rosettes, and some inner nuclear layer (INL) cells were drawn into the ONL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C’</xref>, the asterisks indicate the rosette structures). We then examined the visual function of the retina using multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG). The results showed that the visual responses from most regions of <italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO retinas exhibited abnormal wave forms and much reduced P1 peak amplitudes compared with control retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), demonstrating disrupted visual function of the mutant retinas. To examine whether retinal neurons and glial cells were generated in structurally distorted <italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO retinas, we performed IF analyses of characteristic markers of various types of retinal cells on p15 retinal sections. The IF results showed that all types of retinal cells, including RECOVERIN<sup>+</sup> photoreceptors, VSX2<sup>+</sup> bipolar cells, SOX9<sup>+</sup> Müller glia, CALBINDIN<sup>+</sup> horizontal cells, HPC-1<sup>+</sup> amacrine cells, and BRN3A<sup>+</sup> retinal ganglion cells, were generated in <italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO retinas, although some cells in the INL, especially bipolar cells, Müller glia, and horizontal cells, were displaced into the ONL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Mettl3</italic> deficiency leads to structural and physiological abnormalities in the retina.</title><p>(<bold>A, A’</bold>) Confocal images of METTL3 expression in p0 control (Ctrl) and <italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO retinas showing that <italic>Mettl3</italic> was efficiently deleted in the mutant retinas.

By examining the retinas of pups at different postnatal ages, we found that occasional breaks along the OLM started to appear as early as p6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G’</xref>, the white arrowheads indicate breaks in the OLM), coinciding with the time when morphological maturation of Müller glia starts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these results demonstrate that <italic>Mettl3</italic> deficiency leads to structural and functional abnormalities in the mature retina and indicate that dysfunction of Müller glial cells might be the cause of these abnormalities.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>Mettl3</italic> deficiency distorts late-stage retinogenesis</title><p>We next performed BrdU labeling assays to examine the proliferative activity of RPCs. At E15.5, there were similar numbers of BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells in <italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO retinas and control retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that <italic>Mettl3</italic> deficiency does not affect the proliferation of early RPCs. However, at p1, fewer BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells were observed in <italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO retinas than in control retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, A’ , and B</xref>), indicating that there were fewer proliferating RPCs in <italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO retinas. To examine whether the cell cycle progression of late RPCs was affected by <italic>Mettl3</italic> deletion, we harvested p1 retinas at 6 hr after BrdU injection and subjected them to costaining with BrdU and pH3. We calculated the percentage of BrdU<sup>+</sup>; pH3<sup>+</sup> RPCs vs. BrdU<sup>+</sup> RPCs, which showed that the percentage was significantly lower in <italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO retinas than in control retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, C’ , and D</xref>), suggesting that S-to-M phase progression was prolonged in <italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO late RPCs. The postnatal period occurs at the end of retinogenesis, when an increasing number of RPCs withdraw from the cell cycle and undergo terminal differentiation. We examined the rate of cell cycle withdrawal of RPCs by injecting BrdU at p1 and monitored their KI67 expression 48 hr later at p3. The results showed that there were significantly fewer BrdU<sup>+</sup>; KI67<sup>-</sup> RPCs in <italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO retinas at p3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E, E’ , and F</xref>), meaning that <italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO late RPCs withdrew from the cell cycle slower than control cells. Consistent with this slower withdrawal rate, at p5, when proliferating retinogenesis events were mostly terminated in control central retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref>), a significant number of proliferating cells were still observable in <italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO central retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G’ and H</xref>). To test the role of <italic>Mettl3</italic> in late RPCs directly, we performed in vivo electroporation on retinas of p1 pups to specifically introduce shRNAs targeting <italic>Mettl3</italic> into late RPCs. We harvested the retinas at p5 after 2 hr of BrdU labeling. Because our in vivo electroporation procedure often targets peripheral region of the retina where retinogenesis continues at this time point, we still observed many BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells in the region, but most of these BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells were GFP<sup>-</sup> in the retinas electroporated with control plasmids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). However, a significantly higher percentage of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells were co-labeled with BrdU in the retinas electroporated with plasmids expressing shRNAs targeting <italic>Mettl3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A’ and B</xref>), suggesting that cell cycle withdrawal was delayed in the experimental group. Taken together, these experiments demonstrated that <italic>Mettl3</italic> is required in late RPCs for their proper progression through the cell cycle and timely withdrawal from retinogenesis. This end stage of retinogenesis is the peak time point at which rods, bipolar cells, and Müller glia are generated. To examine whether <italic>Mettl3</italic> deficiency affects retinal differentiation, we counted the numbers of rods, Müller glia, and bipolar cells in the retina at p7, when the major retinogenesis phase has passed in the central retinas, even in <italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO mice. The results showed that the number of SOX9<sup>+</sup> Müller glia was increased in <italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I, I’ , and J</xref>, SOX9<sup>+</sup> cells in the ganglion cell layer and inner plexiform layer were excluded to avoid miscounting astrocytes). On the other hand, the number of VSX2<sup>+</sup> bipolar cells remained relatively unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K, K’ , and L</xref>), while the number of RHODOPSIN<sup>+</sup> photoreceptors was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M, M’ , and N</xref>).

Our manual counting showed that more Müller glial cells were generated in <italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO retinas; however, the scRNA-seq results showed that the proportions of Müller cells in control and <italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO retinas were comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). These seemingly conflicting results were due to the different sampling strategies adopted in the two experiments. For manual counting, we selected the central region of the retina, while for scRNA-seq, we collected the whole retina. At p7, the remaining KI67<sup>+</sup> retinogenesis region was larger in <italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO retinas than in control retinas, thus, the region of the retina that had finished Müller gliogenesis was smaller in <italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO retinas than in control retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). As the consequence, the elevated Müller gliogenesis phenotype was masked by the smaller region that had finished the process in the scRNA-seq data analysis. To observe the progression of this end-stage retinogenesis, we selected RPCs and Müller glia for pseudotime analysis. The results demonstrated a continuous cell status transition from RPCs to Müller glia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), consistent with the gliogenic status of RPCs at this time point. Analysis of the pseudotime distributions of control and <italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO cells revealed that the gliogenesis progression of <italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO RPCs lagged behind that of control RPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), suggesting delayed Müller gliogenesis in <italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO retinas, which is consistent with the extended retinogenesis in <italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO retinas revealed by BrdU labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

We suspected that subtle transcriptomic changes in some types of retinal cells were masked in the whole dataset. We thus performed reclustering of individual clusters of cells. The reclustering revealed distinct mutant clusters in the Müller, RPC, bipolar, and rod populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>), especially for the Müller glia population, in which the mutant cell cluster was distantly separated from the control cell cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>). Cell cycle phase analysis of RPCs showed that G2/M and S phase cells were distinctively distributed along two sides of UMAP, but the cell cycle phases were not responsible for the formation of the mutant cell cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B</xref>). Since phenotypic analyses indicated that RPCs and Müller glia were the two cell types most significantly affected by <italic>Mettl3</italic> deletion and that the mutant cell clusters were more pronounced in the RPC and Müller populations, we next focused on RPCs and Müller glia. DEG analysis of the mutant RPC cell cluster and the remaining RPC cells showed that 286 genes were upregulated and 212 genes were downregulated in mutant RPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>). The upregulated genes were enriched for biological processes related to gene expression regulation, while downregulated genes were enriched for biological processes related to organelle, metabolism, and cell cycle regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I and J</xref>). Importantly, key cell cycle machinery components, such as <italic>Ki67</italic> and <italic>Brca2</italic>, were upregulated, but many cell cycle regulators, such as <italic>Ccna2</italic> and <italic>Cdca8</italic>, were downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H–J</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>), which might be a part of the molecular mechanism underlying the extended cell cycle progression observed in <italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO RPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). DEG analysis of the mutant Müller cell cluster and the remaining Müller cells showed that 239 genes were upregulated and 181 genes were downregulated in mutant Müller cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata2">Source data 2</xref>).

By constitutively expressing a set of progenitor genes, Müller cells maintain a certain level of retinal regeneration potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blackshaw et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goldman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jadhav et al., 2009</xref>). However, to function as a glial cell, Müller cells need to establish a unique transcriptome different from that of progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nelson et al., 2011</xref>). How this transcriptomic transition from progenitors to glial cells is achieved remains unexplored. Taking advantage of our scRNA-seq data that likely contain transcriptomes of the cells in the transition states between late RPCs and Müller glial cells, we tested whether further analyses could identify such cell clusters. For this purpose, we pulled out late RPCs and Müller glial cells and reclustered them. Reclustering analyses generated nine clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Cells originally annotated as RPCs and Müller cells were clearly separated on the two sides of the UMAP graph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and cells in the inner circle of the graph were composed purely of cells from <italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), consistent with original clustering analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, G and K</xref>). In previous work, we compared the transcriptomes of Müller glia and early RPCs, and identified 3717 and 2450 genes that are significantly more abundant in early RPCs and Müller glia, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin et al., 2019</xref>). Using these two groups of genes as the RPC signature gene set and Müller glia signature gene set, we used AUCell to score RPC and Müller glia features in each cell. Putting the two pure <italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO cell cluster (clusters 1 and 6) aside, area under the curve (AUC) scoring showed that RPC clusters 2 and 7 exhibited significantly lower levels of the RPC feature but higher levels of the Müller feature than other RPC clusters, while Müller cluster 4 exhibited significantly lower level of the Müller feature but higher level of the RPC feature than other Müller clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), indicating that these three clusters reside in intermediate states between late RPCs and Müller glial cells. We thus classified cells in clusters 2 and 7 as late RPCs committed to Müller glial fate (named RPC<sub>Müller</sub>), and cells in cluster 4 as Müller cells that had just exited the cell cycle and become Müller cells (named Müller<sub>Early</sub>). The reclustering did not identify distinct mutant clusters corresponding to clusters 2, 4, and 7. Based on the expression patterns of markers for clusters 4, and 7, we classified subsets of cells of clusters 1 and 6 as the corresponding mutant clusters for clusters 4 and 7 (named Müller<sub>Early</sub>_mut and RPC<sub>Müller</sub>_mut, respectively); based on the pure <italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO sample origin, we classified a subset of cells at one edge of cluster 2 as the corresponding mutant cluster for cluster 2 (also named RPC<sub>Müller</sub>_mut). Thus, our reclusting and RPC/Müller feature analyses identified cell clusters in RPC-to-Müller transition states, as well as their corresponding mutant clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). We then scored the RPC and Müller features in this set of cell clusters. AUC scores showed that the RPC feature gradually decreased, and the Müller feature gradually increased from RPC clusters to Müller clusters in the control groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>). When examining the mutant groups, although the general trend was for the RPC feature to be elevated and for the Müller feature to be repressed compared with the corresponding control clusters, the differences were moderate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>). We then determined the activities of subsets of RPC and Müller signature genes that carry m<sup>6</sup>A modification. Among the 3717 RPC signature genes, 1642 were subjected to m<sup>6</sup>A modification, and among the 2450 Müller signature genes, 894 were subjected to m<sup>6</sup>A modification. AUCell soring showed that, for the m<sup>6</sup>A subset of RPC signature genes, the activity in mutant clusters was significantly elevated to a level close to that in the control cluster of an earlier state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>), while for the m<sup>6</sup>A subset of Müller signature genes, the activity in the mutant clusters remained relatively unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G</xref>).

All eight genes carry multiple m<sup>6</sup>A tags around the stop codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and are involved in various biological processes, such as transcription, cytoskeleton function, and nuclear export. Using MeRIP-qPCR, we confirmed that the m<sup>6</sup>A modification levels of the transcripts of these genes were reduced in <italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We next measured the half-lives of the transcripts of these genes in the control and <italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO retinas at p1.

To test how upregulation of m<sup>6</sup>A-regulated genes would affect late-stage retinogenesis, we performed in vivo electroporation to overexpress four genes that showed extended transcript half-lives in <italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO retinas in p1 RPCs. At p3, 2 days after electroporation, we examined the cell cycle status of GFP-marked electroporated RPCs through KI67 or PCNA staining. The results showed that there were significantly fewer KI67<sup>-</sup> or PCNA<sup>-</sup>; GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in the retinas electroporated with <italic>Zfp292</italic>-, <italic>Ckap4</italic>-, <italic>Traf4</italic>-, and <italic>Bcl7a</italic>- overexpression plasmids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>), suggesting that overexpression of these four genes prohibited RPCs from exiting the cell cycle. After exiting the cell cycle, many differentiating retinal cells migrate away from the central region of the retinoblast layer to their designated position in the mature retina. In the control retinas, we observed many GFP<sup>+</sup> cells located near the vitreous edge of the retinoblast layer, away from KI67-positive zones, indicating that they were differentiating/maturing amacrine cells (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, Ctrl).

Overexpression of <italic>Rap2b</italic> increased the population of bipolar cells and decreased the population of amacrine cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>). We then coelectroporated <italic>Zfp292</italic>, <italic>Ckap4</italic>, <italic>Traf4,</italic> and <italic>Bcl7a</italic> in the retina. Co-overexpressing of all four genes did not exhibit an additive effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>), suggesting that co-overexpressing all four genes might elicit different gene-regulatory network changes that are different from those when expressed alone. Phalloidin staining of the electroporated retinas at p14 showed that while the OLMs of these retinas were grossly intact, occasionally at a few regions (three out of six retinas), the OLMs are broken, and a few rods escaped to the subretinal space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2D</xref>, arrows in the inset image indicate the escaped rods).

Mechanistically, we showed that m<sup>6</sup>A promotes the degradation of RPC transcripts, thereby promoting the termination of retinogenesis and fine-tuning the transcriptomic transition from RPCs to Müller glial cells, the disruption of which leads to abnormalities in late-stage retinogenesis and compromises the glial functions of Müller cells and thus the structural and physiological homeostasis of the mature retina.</p><p>One interesting finding of our study is that the regulatory function of <italic>Mettl3</italic> during retinal development is restricted to the late-stage retinogenesis period. <italic>Six3-Cre</italic> mice express CRE recombinase in RPCs beginning from embryonic day 9.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Furuta et al., 2000</xref>); however, the retinas of <italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO mice remained normal until the postnatal period. Our in vivo electroporation experiments to directly knock down <italic>Mettl3</italic> in late RPCs also demonstrated that <italic>Mettl3</italic> is required in late RPCs for the proper progression of late retinogenesis. Even though all are referred to as RPCs, RPCs continue to adjust their behavior during retinogenesis. For example, RPCs gradually go through a series of competent states to produce different types of retinal cells at different retinogenesis periods so that early RPCs produce retinal ganglion, cone, horizontal, and some amacrine cells, while late RPCs produce rod, some amacrine, and bipolar cells before finally becoming Müller glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agathocleous and Harris, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cepko, 2014</xref>). Accompanying the gradual changes in the retinogenic behaviors, RPCs likely continue to adjust the gene-regulatory networks to accommodate retinogenic tasks at different developmental stages. Indeed, scRNA-seq analyses of retinal development showed that the transcriptomes of early and late RPCs are distinct from each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clark et al., 2019</xref>). The postnatal retinogenesis period is the critical time when late RPCs quickly slow the cell cycle and finally exit the cell cycle to terminate retinogenesis in a timely fashion. Our study suggests that the m<sup>6</sup>A epitranscriptome delicately coordinates the transcriptomic adjustment needed for the timely termination of retinogenesis. In <italic>Mettl3</italic>-mutant RPCs, key cell cycle machinery components, such as <italic>Ki67</italic>, were upregulated, but many other cell cycle regulators were downregulated, which is likely the molecular basis for the distorted cell cycle. Furthermore, many m<sup>6</sup>A-tagged RPC transcripts were abnormally upregulated in <italic>Mettl3</italic>-mutant RPCs, which likely disrupts the balance of the gene-regulatory networks in late RPCs. Indeed, overexpression of m<sup>6</sup>A-tagged genes in late RPCs distorts the retinogenesis behavior of the cells. Thus, our study suggests that m<sup>6</sup>A delicately modulates the transcriptome of late RPCs to prepare them for the timely termination of retinogenesis.</p><p>Numerous studies have demonstrated the essential roles of Müller glial cells in maintaining the structural and physiological homeostasis of the mature retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Byrne et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">MacDonald et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wohl et al., 2017</xref>). A couple of lines of evidence indicate that dysfunction of mutant Müller glial cells is the cellular basis for the retinal structural abnormality of <italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO retinas. First, the structural abnormality of <italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO retinas did not appear until p6, coinciding with the time point when maturing Müller glial cells are transitioning from the simple bipolar radial shape inherited from RPCs to a much more sophisticated morphology to form a glial network to intimately interact with every cell in the mature retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Second, our scRNA-seq analyses demonstrated that Müller glia are one of the two cell types whose transcriptomes were most severely affected by <italic>Mettl3</italic> knockout, and many genes involved in cell–cell interaction and the cytoskeleton were downregulated in <italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO Müller glial cells, suggesting that the structural supporting function of Müller glial cells was compromised. On the other hand, late RPCs might indirectly contribute to the structural defect by failing to downregulate m<sup>6</sup>A-tagged transcripts, leaving a distorted transcriptome to their Müller progenies and compromised the glial supporting function of Müller cells, leading to the structural abnormality of the retina.</p><p>As the last cell type generated by RPCs at the end of retinogenesis and as the major glial cell type in the retina, the close relationship between Müller glia and RPCs has long been noted. Many factors that play important roles in RPC proliferation and differentiation are also highly expressed in Müller glia, and several transcriptomic comparison studies have revealed similarities between Müller glia and RPCs at the transcriptome level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blackshaw et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nelson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roesch et al., 2008</xref>). Encouraged by these cues, the regenerative potential of Müller glia has been intensively explored in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goldman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jorstad et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lahne et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). However, to function as glial cells, Müller cells must develop a unique transcriptome that differs from that of RPCs to accommodate their structural and physiological supporting roles in the adult neural retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nelson et al., 2011</xref>), but how this delicate transcriptome transition is achieved is unclear. By carefully analyzing the single-cell transcriptomes of late RPCs and Müller glial cells of the p7 retina, we were able to capture cell clusters in RPC-to-Müller transition states. The RPC feature gradually decreases, and the Müller feature gradually increases, from RPCs to Müller glial cells through these clusters. However, in <italic>Mettl3</italic>-mutant cell clusters, the activities of m<sup>6</sup>A-tagged RPC genes were significantly elevated to a level close to those in the cluster of an earlier state. These analyses demonstrated that m<sup>6</sup>A promotes the transcriptomic transition from RPCs to Müller glial cells by promoting the degradation of modified RPC transcripts.</p><p>In our effort to test the roles of m<sup>6</sup>A-regulated genes in late retinogenesis, we used in vivo electroporation on retinas of newborn pups to either overexpress or knock down candidate genes. Knocking down candidate genes mostly did not affect late retinogenesis, while overexpressing some candidate genes disrupted the cell cycle progression of late RPCs and promoted Müller gliogenesis at the expense of rod or amacrine cell generation, suggesting that the expression levels of these genes in late RPCs should normally be kept at a relatively low level and carefully controlled. Overexpression of m<sup>6</sup>A-regulated genes did not faithfully recapitulate the cell population change phenotype observed in <italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO retinas. For example, in <italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO retinas, the population of rods decreased, while in retinas overexpressing <italic>Zfp292</italic> or <italic>Ckap4</italic>, the population of amacrine cells decreased. Two reasons might contribute to these discrepancies. First, in <italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO RPCs, over 200 m<sup>6</sup>A-tagged genes were upregulated. The retinal cell-type composition change in <italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO retinas is likely a collective result of the expression changes of many of these m<sup>6</sup>A-tagged genes; thus, overexpressing one (or a few) of them may not give rise to exactly the same phenotype as <italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO retinas. Second, forced overexpression of <italic>Zfp292</italic>/<italic>Ckap4</italic>/<italic>Traf4</italic>/<italic>Bcl7a</italic> from plasmids electroporated into RPCs probably increases the expression levels of these genes by several to tens of times, while in <italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO RPCs, their expression levels were only moderately elevated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1 sdata2">Source data 1 and 2</xref>). Different levels of overexpression may elicit different gene-regulatory network changes, and thus different end results.</p><p>While this article was under revision, a manuscript was published showing that retinas deficient for all three m<sup>6</sup>A-readers, <italic>Ythdf1</italic>, <italic>Ythdf2</italic>, and <italic>Ythdf3</italic>, exhibit a phenotype similar to that of <italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO retinas, suggesting that the three m<sup>6</sup>A readers work redundantly to ‘read’ m<sup>6</sup>A in the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Niu et al., 2022</xref>). As a derivative of the neural tube, the neural retina shares similar regulatory principles with other central neural tissues. Two groups independently studied the functions of m<sup>6</sup>A during cortical development using very similar strategies. Although the two studies presented controversial claims regarding the maintenance of neural stem cell (NSC) pools and the differentiation activities of NSCs, both studies showed that the cell cycle of NSCs deficient in <italic>Mettl14</italic> (another essential component of the m<sup>6</sup>A writer complex) was prolonged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yoon et al., 2017</xref>), a phenotype shared by <italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO RPCs, suggesting that some regulatory mechanisms of m<sup>6</sup>A are conserved between NSCs and RPCs. Similar to the case with Müller cells in the retina, the supporting functions and regeneration potentials of glial cells in the central nervous system are hotly debated neural biological questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen and Lyons, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Qian et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zuchero and Barres, 2015</xref>). Yoon et al. showed that there are fewer astrocytes in p5 <italic>Mettl14</italic>-deficient cortices than in control cortices; however, since neurogenesis is still progressing in <italic>Mettl14</italic>-deficient cortices at this time point, it is not clear whether the final population of astrocytes is reduced or increased in the adult <italic>Mettl14</italic>-CKO cortex. Furthermore, it is also not clear whether the generated <italic>Mettl14</italic>-deficient astrocytes are transcriptomically and functionally normal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yoon et al., 2017</xref>). Our study hints at an interesting possibility: that m<sup>6</sup>A may regulate the transcriptomic transition from NSCs to glial cells in other nervous systems, which warrants further investigation. Future studies are also needed to determine whether m<sup>6</sup>A is involved in cell fate reprogramming between glial cells and neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

For paraffin sectioning, eyes were fixed with Davidson’s Fixative overnight, processed, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned using a microtome (Leica RM2235). Before subsequent histological staining, paraffin sections underwent a standard procedure for deparaffinization, and cryosections were air-dried for 5 min and then soaked in PBS for 5 min to wash off OCT. H&amp;E staining was performed using a standard procedure. For fluorescent immunostaining, section slides were first heated in citrate buffer at 95°C for 30 min for antigen retrieval. After cooling to room temperature, slides were incubated with primary antibodies prepared in PBST with 5% fetal bovine serum at 4°C overnight, washed with PBST, incubated with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies, washed, counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), and finally mounted with cover glasses using VECTASHIELD mounting medium (Vector Labs). The following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-METTL3 (Abcam), rabbit anti-RECOVERIN (Millipore), sheep anti-VSX2 (Millipore), rabbit anti-SOX9 (Millipore), rabbit anti-CALBINDIN (Swant), HPC-1 (mouse anti-SYNTAXIN) (Sigma), mouse anti-BRN3A (Millipore), chicken anti-GFP (Abcam), rabbit anti-N-CADHERIN (Santa Cruz), mouse anti-GS (BD Transduction Laboratories), mouse anti-GFAP (Sigma), mouse anti-BrdU (Amersham), rabbit anti-KI67 (Abcam), mouse anti-pH3 (Ser10) (Cell Signaling Technology), Alexa Fluor 488 (568) donkey anti-mouse (Thermo Fisher), Alexa Fluor 488 (568) donkey anti-rabbit (Thermo Fisher), Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-chicken (Jackson ImmunoResearch), and Alexa Fluor 488 (568) donkey anti-sheep (Thermo Fisher). Bright-field H&amp;E-stained images were taken under an inverted microscope (Zeiss Axio Observer). Immunofluorescence images were taken under a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 880 or LSM 980).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>BrdU labeling</title><p>Pups were injected subcutaneously with BrdU (0.32 μmol/g body weight). Then 2 hr, or 6 hr, or 48 hr later, pups were sacrificed, and eyes were collected, fixed with 4% formaldehyde overnight, and subjected to cryosectioning and immunofluorescent staining as described above. After confocal images were taken, the number of BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells was counted for each selected 200 μm retinal region.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>TUNEL assay</title><p>Eye sections were prepared as described above for immunostaining. TUNEL assays were performed using an In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche) following the manufacturer’s instructions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>mfERG</title><p>The experiments were performed on p14 control (n = 4) and <italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO (n = 2) mice. The mice were anesthetized using sodium pentobarbital and positioned on a warming table to maintain body temperature. For each animal, only the right eye was examined. Before recordings started, the eyes were dilated with 0.5% tropicamide (Santen Pharmaceutical, Japan) and local narcotized with 0.5% proparacaine hydrochloride (Ruinian Best, China). The eyes were positioned 1–2 mm in front of the device (Roland RETImap SLO, Roland, Germany). The animal Goldring recording electrode was placed at the corneal limbus. Subcutaneous silver needle electrodes served as reference and ground electrodes. An optical correction lens was positioned in front of the recording electrode. Viscous 2% methocel gel was applied between the cornea and contact lens. The stimuli were generated by a projector with a refresh rate of 60 Hz. The number of recording hexagons was set at 19, and the optic nerve head (ONH) was adjusted near the edge of the recording area. The stimulation parameter of light was set at mfERG Max. Twelve cycles were averaged for a final result.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>RNA-seq</title><p>RNA-seq was performed on four control and four CKO retinal samples. The retinas of p6 control and CKO pups were collected directly into TRIzol (Thermo Fisher), and total RNA was extracted following the manufacturer’s instructions. Sequencing libraries were generated using the NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq platform, and 150 bp paired-end reads were generated. Raw data were filtered to remove low-quality reads, and the clean reads were mapped to the mouse genome (GRCm38, mm10) using Hisat2 v2.0.5. featureCounts v1.5.0-p3 was used to count the read numbers mapped to each gene, and then the FPKM of each gene was calculated. Differential expression analysis was performed using the DESeq2 R package. The resulting p-values were adjusted using Benjamini and Hochberg’s approach. Genes with an adjusted p-value&lt;0.05 were considered differentially expressed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>scRNA-seq</title><p>Two retinas from two control pups and two retinas from two <italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO pups of the same litter were used for the scRNA-seq experiment. Retinas were digested with Papain (Worthington) to single cells and resuspended in PBS containing 0.04% BSA, and two retinal samples for each experimental group were mixed together as one sample for subsequent scRNA-seq. The scRNA-seq was performed by NovelBio Co., Ltd. Libraries were generated using the 10X Genomics Chromium Controller Instrument and Chromium Single Cell 3′ V3.1 Reagent Kits (10X Genomics). Libraries were sequenced using an Illumina sequencer (Illumina) on a 150 bp paired-end run.</p><p>We applied fastp with default parameter filtering of the adaptor sequence and removed the low-quality reads to obtain clean data. Then, the feature-barcode matrices were obtained by aligning reads to the mouse genome (GRCm38, mm10) using CellRanger v3.1.0. Cells containing over 200 expressed genes and a mitochondrial UMI rate below 20% passed the quality filtering, and mitochondrial genes were removed from the expression table. The Seurat package v3.1 was used for cell normalization and regression to obtain the scaled data. PCA was constructed based on the scaled data with the top 2000 highly variable genes, and the top 10 principal components were used for UMAP construction. Utilizing the graph-based cluster method, we acquired unsupervised cell clusters. Judged by the key markers expressed by each cluster, we merged some clusters and annotated the final clusters.</p><p>For pseudotime analysis, we applied single-cell trajectory analysis using Monocle2 using DDR-Tree and default parameters. To identify DEGs among samples, the function FindMarkers with the Wilcox rank-sum test algorithm was used under the following criteria: lnFC &gt; 0.25, p-value&lt;0.05, min.pct &gt; 0.1. To characterize the relative activity of gene sets with different m<sup>6</sup>A features, we performed QuSAGE (2.16.1) analysis. To characterize the activities of RPC or Müller glial feature gene sets, R package AUCell was used. Fisher’s exact test was applied to identify the significant GO terms and FDR was used to correct the p-values.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>MeRIP-seq</title><p>The retinas of C57BL/6J mice were collected directly into TRIzol (Thermo Fisher). Total RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and RNAs from 14 retinas were pooled together for each MeRIP-seq. MeRIP-seq was performed according to a published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dominissini et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, PolyA-mRNA was purified using a Dynabeads mRNA DIRECT Purification kit (Thermo Fisher). mRNA was fragmented in fragmentation buffer heated at 94℃ for 5 min. Fragmented mRNA was immunoprecipitated against an m<sup>6</sup>A antibody (Synaptic Systems) bound to Protein G Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher) at 4°C for 2 hr, washed, and eluted by competition with free m<sup>6</sup>A (Sigma). After recovery of precipitated m<sup>6</sup>A-mRNA, sequencing libraries were constructed using the VAHTS Universal V6 RNA-seq Library Prep Kit (Vazyme). The libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq platform on a 150 bp paired-end run. Raw data were filtered to remove low-quality reads to obtain clean reads. Clean reads were mapped to the mouse genome (GRCm38, mm10) using BWA mem v0.7.12. m<sup>6</sup>A peaks were determined using MACS2 v2.1.0 with the q-value threshold of enrichment set at 0.05. Motif analysis was done using MEME. GO term analysis was performed using clusterProfiler package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yu et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>MeRIP-qPCR</title><p>Total RNA from retinas (5–6 retinas per sample) was extracted using TRIzol. MeRIP for qPCR was performed as described above for MeRIP-seq except that the mRNA fragmentation step was skipped. m<sup>6</sup>A pull-down and 1% reserved input RNAs were reversed transcribed into cDNAs using the SuperScript II First-strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Thermo Fisher). qPCR was performed using the SYBR green-based method on a LightCycler 480 (Roche). The primers are listed in the key resources table. Enrichment of genes in m<sup>6</sup>A-tagged genes in pull-down samples was calculated based on ΔCt between the pull-down sample and the input sample, and was normalized to an internal negative control, <italic>Rsp14</italic>, which does not carry m<sup>6</sup>A modification.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Molecular cloning</title><p>Full-length <italic>Zfp292</italic>, <italic>Ckap4</italic>, <italic>Traf4</italic>, <italic>Bcl7a</italic>, <italic>Rap2b</italic>, <italic>Nxt1</italic>, <italic>Apex</italic>, and <italic>Sulf2</italic> cDNAs were PCR amplified from a cDNA pool derived from embryonic mouse retina total RNA and cloned into the pCAGIG vector (gift from Dr. Connie Cepko and obtained through Addgene). shRNAs targeting <italic>Zfp292</italic>, <italic>Ckap4</italic>, <italic>Traf4</italic>, <italic>Bcl7a</italic>, and <italic>Mettl3</italic> were cloned into pSicoR vector (gift from Dr. Tyler Jacks and obtained through Addgene).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Mouse retina in vivo electroporation</title><p>Newborn mouse pups were anesthetized by chilling on ice. A small incision was made in the eyelid and sclera near the edge of the cornea with a 30-gauge needle (Hamilton). Purified plasmid solutions (2–5 μg/μl) in PBS were injected into the subretinal space through the previous incision using a Hamilton syringe with a 32-gauge blunt-ended needle under a dissecting microscope. After DNA injection, a tweezer-type electrode was placed to softly hold the pup heads, and five 80 V pulses of 50 ms duration and 950 ms intervals were applied using a Gemini X2 pulse generator (BTX). After electroporation, pups were allowed to recover on a warming pad until they regained consciousness and were returned to their mother. The pups were sacrificed at p14, and the retinas were collected and subjected to cryosection as described above. Eye sections were immunostained for GFP (to recognize transduced cells and their progenies) and SOX9 (to recognize Müller cells). For cell composition analysis of the electroporated cells, GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in the ONL were judged as rods, GFP<sup>+</sup>; SOX9<sup>+</sup> cells were judged as Müller cells, the GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in the INL above the SOX9<sup>+</sup> Müller cells (close to the OPL layer) were judged as bipolar cells, while the GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in the INL below the SOX9<sup>+</sup> Müller cells (close to the IPL layer) were judged as amacrine cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>RNA half-life measurement</title><p><italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO and control mice were sacrificed at p1, and the retinas were collected and soaked in DMEM supplemented with actinomycin D (5 μm, Sigma) to inhibit transcription and cultured in a CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 37℃. The retinas were collected directly into TRIzoL at 0 hr, 4 hr, 8 hr, and 16 hr after drug treatment. Total RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Two micrograms of total RNA from each sample was reverse transcribed into cDNA using SuperScript II (Thermo Fisher) and subjected to qPCR measurements using SYBR Green mix (Roche) and LightCycler LC480 (Roche). The primers are listed in the key resources table. The relative mRNA concentrations at each time point against time point 0 were calculated, the ln<sup>mRNA concentration</sup> at time points 0, 4, 8, and 16 hr were plotted to perform a linear regression analysis as a function of time, and the slope of the line was identified as the decay rate (k).

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors showed disrupted retina structure in Mettl3cko and claimed that dysfunction of Muller glial cells was the underlying cause. However, based on the data presented in the manuscript, it is not clear whether retinal structure abnormalities are direct effects of Muller glial defects or secondary effects induced by defects in RPCs or other cell types.</p><p>2) The authors claimed that m6A is important for RPC to Muller glial transition but didn't clearly state whether m6A regulates gliogenesis, which can be easily assessed by quantifying the number of Muller glial cells. The authors showed that the number of Muller glial cells was increased in mettl3cko at P7 based on <italic>Sox9</italic> staining, but the number of Muller glial cells in single cell RNA-seq data stayed unchanged between Mettl3cko and controls. In addition, the number of Muller glial cells in adult retinas (for example, at P14) was not examined. Based on images in Figure 1E, the number of Muller glial cells seemed to be slightly decreased compared to controls. Moreover, in line 130, the authors mentioned that Mettl3cko retinas resembled those with loss of Muller glia in the literature. These discrepancies need to be addressed.</p><p>3) The authors showed that there was an increased number of RPCs in Mettl3cko at late stages of retinal development compared to controls. However, some of the data do not seem to be consistent with published literature and their own supplementary data. Specifically, at P7, based on their single cell RNA-seq data, 6% of retinal cells were RPCs in control retinas, and 11% of retinal cells were RPCs in Mettl3cko (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). However, the number seems to be very high for control P7 retinas. In published single cell datasets (Clark et al. 2019), the percentage of retinal cells identified as RPCs was close to 0 at around P7. In addition, in Figure 3—figure supplement 3, the authors stained P7 Mettl3cko and control retinas with Ki67. There was a very limited number of Ki67+ cells in Mettl3cko, which doesn't quite match the 11% found in single cell RNA-seq data.</p><p>4) The stage of the retina was not consistent across experiments. The single cell RNA-seq experiment was performed using P7 retinas, whereas MeRIP-seq used P6 retinas. Twenty-four hours could make a big difference in terms of transcription at this stage.</p><p>5) Many claims in the manuscript are not fully supported by the data. For example, the authors over-expressed candidate m6A-regulated genes in RPCs and showed that they prevented the RPCs from exiting the cell cycle. However, the data presented in Figure 6 cannot fully support this conclusion. PCNA is not a pan cell cycle marker. Reduction of GFP+PCNA- cells in Mettl3cko doesn't necessarily mean that mutant cells failed to exit the cell cycle.</p><p>6) Individual data points and N numbers were not shown in the bar graphs.</p><p>7) The authors used six3:cre (expressed from E9.5) to knock out Mettl3 throughout the entire course of retinal development. It would be better if the authors could test the role of m6A in late RPCs directly.</p><p>8) In Figure 2, the authors identified müller glia in Mettl3CKO mice using the <italic>Sox9</italic> antibody. Due to severe structural abnormality of the retina in Mettl3CKO mice, the identification of cell fate needs additional caution. It is better to verify müller glia using other antibodies (such as glutamine synthetase, GS; GFAP) independently.</p><p>9) Some results seem inconsistent. First, in Mettl3CKO mice, the author found an increased number of Müller glia, a reduced number of rods, and no change in other cell types (Figure 2I-N). However, in the retinae with the overexpression of Zfp292, Ckap4, Traf4, or Bcl7a, they found an increase in the percentage of Müller cells at the expense of amacrine cells or rod photoreceptors (Figure 6C-D). Second, in scRNAseq data analysis, only the proportion of RPCs increased, but not Müller glial cells (Figure 3D). This result is not consistent with the IF phenotype (Figure 2I-J). The authors need to discuss these results at least to clarify the inconsistency.</p><p>10) Overall, the working model that the authors proposed lacks direct support. The authors may want to identify late RPC clusters that were committed to Müller glia fate as well as were subject to Mttl3CKO, and further verify the expression specificity of m6A-modified transcripts, such as Zfp292, Ckap4, Traf4, or Bcl7a, in such RPC clusters. Also, the authors should experimentally examine the essential roles of the loss of these m6A-modified transcripts in Müller glia development. These analyses will much strengthen the main conclusions of the study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I encourage the authors to include the following info and additional explanations in the manuscript.</p><p>1. Line 120, the stage of IF staining should be included.</p><p>2. Line 146, please provide references showing that P6 is the peak time point for MG generation.</p><p>3. Line 162, the number of BrdU<sup>+</sup>;Ph3+ RPCs over BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells should be quantified. The data presented by the authors cannot support the conclusion.</p><p>4. Line 180, please provide evidence showing that the major retinogenesis phase was completed in the central retinas in Mettl3CKO mice.</p><p>7. Line 183, how did the authors quantify Rho+ rods based on rhodopsin staining?</p><p>8. Line 226, &quot;Considering that RPCs at this age are near the end of retinogenesis, most would become Müller glia. As a consequence, the final proportion of Müller glia in Mettl3CKO retinas should be higher than that in control retinas&quot;.</p><p>Muller glial proportion was not increased based on single cell RNA-seq data. This claim is confusing.</p><p>9. Line 258, &quot;The upregulated genes were enriched for biological processes related to gene expression regulation, while downregulated genes were enriched for biological processes such as 'organelle organization' and 'precursor metabolites and energy'&quot;.</p><p>These GO terms do not seem to be the top terms based on the figures. Why did the author highlight them?</p><p>10. Line 259, &quot;Importantly, key cell cycle machinery components, such as Ki67 and Brca2, was upregulated, but many cell cycle regulators, such as Ccna2 and Cdca8, were downregulated (Figure 3H-3J and Supplementary 261 Table 1), which explained why the cell cycle progression of Mettl3CKO RPCs was distorted&quot;.</p><p>This claim is very confusing. Does downregulation of Ccna2 and Cdca8 delay cell cycle?</p><p>11. Line 386, &quot;p14 showed that while the OLMs of these retinas were grossly intact, at a few regions, the OLMs are broken, and a few rods escaped to the subretinal space&quot;.</p><p>This may be due to damage from retina sectioning. Please state whether this is a significant phenomenon. In addition, the authors did not quantify the number of Muller glial cells when the four plasmid mix was electroporated into P1 RPCs.</p><p>12. Figure 4 and Figure 5 may be combined.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The authors used six3:cre (expressed from E9.5) to knock out Mettl3 throughout the entire course of retinal development. It would be better if the authors could test the role of m6A in late RPCs directly.</p><p>2. In Figure 2, the authors identified müller glia in Mettl3CKO mice using the <italic>Sox9</italic> antibody.

Second, in scRNAseq data analysis, only the proportion of RPCs increased, but not Müller glial cells (Figure 3D). This result is not consistent with the IF phenotype (Figure 2I-J). The authors need to discuss these results at least to clarify the inconsistency.</p><p>4. Overall, the working model that the authors proposed lacks direct support. The authors may want to identify late RPC clusters that were committed to Müller glia fate as well as were subject to Mttl3CKO, and further verify the expression specificity of m6A-modified transcripts, such as Zfp292, Ckap4, Traf4, or Bcl7a, in such RPC clusters.

Your revised article has been evaluated by Marianne Bronner (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>While the reviewers appreciate the efforts that have been invested in this revised manuscript, they feel that an additional revision is needed to put the study into the context of previous report, and clarify the novelty of the findings.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors improved their manuscript. However, to make the study convincing, additional investigation and explanation still need to be conducted.</p><p>1. It is still not clear whether m6A depletion specifically affects RPC to muller glia (MG) transition, or just elongates the RPC cell cycle as shown in previously published papers, which investigated the role of m6A in brain development. Elongation of RPC cell cycle can also lead to increased production of MG.</p><p>2. The authors showed that there are significant cell death in the cko retinas at P0, P6 and P14, and this may be responsible for the not so significant increase of MG in cko. But they didn't show which types of cells are dying. Many TUNEL positive cells are in ONL (Figure 2-supplement 4, A'-C'). This cell death was also not carefully integrated into their conclusions when they explained the phenotypes or results.</p><p>3. The authors claimed that cko RPCs withdrew from the cell cycle shower than control RPCs (Figure 2E and F). If this is the case, there should be more proliferating RPCs in cko. However, the author showed that there are significantly less BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells at P1 (2 hours after BrdU injection) in cko (Figure 2B). These results do not seem to support each other.</p><p>4. The authors didn't show that Mettl3 is depleted and m6A levels are lowered at embryonic stages.</p><p>5. For all the shRNA-based experiments, there aren't any control experiments to show their efficiency and specificity.</p><p>6. Lin 254-258, the argument is weak and hard to understand. The Ki67+ region is only at the very tip of the retina in cko. The authors need to provide stronger evidence to clarify whether the number of muller glial cells is increased or unchanged in the cko at different stages.</p><p>7. The authors claim that Mettl3cko &quot;…compromises the function of Muller cells&quot; (abstract line 32). There is no direct evidence to support this point.</p><p>8. The role of m6A on neural development has been extensively studied in the brain. The authors did not discuss these published papers and did not explain how their work improved the field.</p><p>Other concerns:</p><p>1. In Figure 1A and 1A', the background color looked very different. It looks like different exposure duration were used. A western blot may be better to show the deletion efficiency.</p><p>2. Penetrance (50%) of the OLM break phenotype was not included in the manuscript.</p><p>3. Line 161, 2 hour Brdu pulse chase experiment cannot support that the cells proliferate slower. It only suggests that there are less proliferating cells.</p><p>4. Figure 2D, label on Y axis was not corrected.</p><p>5. Line 201-206, the number of cells cannot be quantified based on markers expressed in the cytosol. These markers may be upregulated in individual cells.</p><p>6. The m6A IP was not shown for cko retinas in Figure 6-Supplement 1.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have enlisted new experiments and analyses that substantially strengthen the paper in this revised manuscript. All these efforts should be applauded. In particular, the new data of shRNA targeting Mettl3 expressed in late RPCs directly addressed the cell-type specificity of Mettl3's role. Also, the detailed analysis of scRNA data of late RPCs further clarified the transition from late RPCs to the muller glial cells. Furthermore, the authors examined the influences of m6A-associated transcripts on muller glia development by electroporating shRNAs targeting these transcripts into P1 retinae. Besides, additional discussions in the revised manuscript help to clarify the concerns the reviewers raised. In all, all these improvements are satisfying. However, I am surprised that the authors did not provide the background of previous studies of m6A in retinal development. Adding these research backgrounds will further improve the clarity of this study by putting it into context.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79994.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors showed disrupted retina structure in Mettl3cko and claimed that dysfunction of Muller glial cells was the underlying cause. However, based on the data presented in the manuscript, it is not clear whether retinal structure abnormalities are direct effects of Muller glial defects or secondary effects induced by defects in RPCs or other cell types.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that our study did not directly investigate what happens to the retina if <italic>Mettl3</italic> is specifically knocked out from Müller glial cells and their RPC precursors; we lack the necessary tools. However, several lines of evidence indicate that dysfunctional Müller glial cells are the key cells responsible for the structural abnormality of <italic>Mettl3<sup>CKO</sup></italic> retinas:</p><p>1. As the sole neural glial cells inside the retina, Müller cells play key roles in maintaining the structural and physiological homeostasis of the mature retina, as demonstrated in numerous studies (MacDonald R et al., Curr Opin Neurobiol. 2017, 47:31-37; Shen W, et al., J Neurosci. 2012, 32(45):15715-27; Byrne L et al., PLoS One. 2013, 8(9):e76075; Wohl S et al., Nat Commun. 2017, 8(1): 1603).</p><p>2. The structural abnormality in <italic>Mettl3<sup>CKO</sup></italic> retinas did not appear until p6, coinciding with the time point at which maturing Müller glial cells are transitioning from the simple bipolar radial shape inherited from RPCs to a much more sophisticated morphology; this morphology allows them to form a glial network and intimately interact with every cell in the mature retina (Wang J et al., J Comp Neurol. 2017, 525(8):1759-1777).</p><p>3. Our scRNA-seq analyses demonstrated that Müller glia were one of the two cell types whose transcriptomes were most severely affected by <italic>Mettl3</italic> knockout (the other being RPCs), and that many genes involved in cell-cell interactions and the cytoskeleton were downregulated in <italic>Mettl3<sup>CKO</sup></italic> Müller glial cells, suggesting that the structural supporting function of Müller glial cells was compromised.</p><p>On the other hand, we did not exclude the involvement of other cell types, especially RPCs, in the structural defects. Indeed, we think that RPCs indirectly contributed to the structural abnormality: the transcriptome abnormality of <italic>Mettl3<sup>CKO</sup></italic> Müller cells was rooted in the failure of RPC transcripts, especially m<sup>6</sup>A-tagged RPC transcripts, to be promptly downregulated in <italic>Mettl3<sup>CKO</sup></italic> RPCs during RPC-to-Müller transition. The failure likely disrupted the balance of the gene-regulatory-network of the developing Müller glia and compromised the glial supporting function of Müller cells, leading to the structural abnormality of the retina.</p><p>We have included a discussion of the above in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors claimed that m6A is important for RPC to Muller glial transition but didn't clearly state whether m6A regulates gliogenesis, which can be easily assessed by quantifying the number of Muller glial cells. The authors showed that the number of Muller glial cells was increased in mettl3cko at P7 based on Sox9 staining, but the number of Muller glial cells in single cell RNA-seq data stayed unchanged between Mettl3cko and controls. In addition, the number of Muller glial cells in adult retinas (for example, at P14) was not examined. Based on images in Figure 1E, the number of Muller glial cells seemed to be slightly decreased compared to controls. Moreover, in line 130, the authors mentioned that Mettl3cko retinas resembled those with loss of Muller glia in the literature. These discrepancies need to be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the number of Müller glial cells, at p7, more Müller glial cells were generated in the central retinas of <italic>Mettl3<sup>CKO</sup></italic> mice than in those of control mice based on our manual counting of <italic>SOX9</italic>-stained retinal sections (We recounted these images, but the conclusion remains the same. Please see our response to comment #8). Then, why did the scRNA-seq analysis show that the percentage of Müller glial cells in <italic>Mettl3<sup>CKO</sup></italic> retinas was comparable to that in control retinas at p7? This result is due to the different sampling strategies adopted in the manual image counting and scRNA-seq experiments: for manual counting, we selected the central region of the retina, while for scRNA-seq, we collected the whole retina. At p7, the remaining KI67<sup>+</sup> retinogenesis region was larger in <italic>Mettl3<sup>CKO</sup></italic> retinas than in control retinas (revised Figure 3—figure supplement 3). In other words, the region of the retina that had finished Müller gliogenesis was smaller in <italic>Mettl3<sup>CKO</sup></italic> retinas than in control retinas. Thus, the elevated Müller gliogenesis phenotype was masked by the smaller region that had finished the process in the scRNA-seq data.</p><p>Regarding the population of Müller glial cells at p14, the reviewer is correct; the increased population of Müller cells in <italic>Mettl3<sup>CKO</sup></italic> retinas observed at p7 was no longer obvious at p14. The reason for the declining population of Müller glial cells is the elevated cell death in <italic>Mettl3<sup>CKO</sup></italic> retinas. Cell death was significantly elevated in <italic>Mettl3<sup>CKO</sup></italic> retinas, including Müller glial cells (revised Figure 2—figure supplement 4), which led to the degeneration of all cell types in the retina, including Müller glial cells.</p><p>Regarding the term ‘gliogenesis’, our data clearly showed that more Müller glial cells were generated by <italic>Mettl3<sup>CKO</sup></italic> RPCs than by control RPCs. However, we did not use the term ‘gliogenesis’ for two reasons: first, even though more Müller glial cells were generated by <italic>Mettl3<sup>CKO</sup></italic> RPCs, the onset of Müller gliogenesis was delayed for <italic>Mettl3<sup>CKO</sup></italic> RPCs; second, even though more Müller glial cells were generated by <italic>Mettl3<sup>CKO</sup></italic> RPCs, the transcriptome of these cells was distorted with a certain level of RPC feature (revised Figure 5H), which likely compromised their glial function. For these reasons, we hesitate to say ‘m<sup>6</sup>A promotes gliogenesis’.</p><p>Regarding line 130, we have referenced the literature to emphasize that Müller glial cells play key roles in maintaining the structural homeostasis of the retina. In <italic>Mettl3<sup>CKO</sup></italic> retinas, even though more Müller glial cells were generated than the number observed in control retinas, these cells are dysfunctional; thus, the retinas exhibited a phenotype similar to that of retinas in which Müller glial cells are depleted. We have revised the sentence for clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors showed that there was an increased number of RPCs in Mettl3cko at late stages of retinal development compared to controls. However, some of the data do not seem to be consistent with published literature and their own supplementary data. Specifically, at P7, based on their single cell RNA-seq data, 6% of retinal cells were RPCs in control retinas, and 11% of retinal cells were RPCs in Mettl3cko (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). However, the number seems to be very high for control P7 retinas. In published single cell datasets (Clark et al. 2019), the percentage of retinal cells identified as RPCs was close to 0 at around P7. In addition, in Figure 3—figure supplement 3, the authors stained P7 Mettl3cko and control retinas with Ki67. There was a very limited number of Ki67+ cells in Mettl3cko, which doesn't quite match the 11% found in single cell RNA-seq data.</p></disp-quote><p>To address the reviewer’s concern, we applied the annotation criteria of Clark et al.’s 2019 Neuron paper to annotate our cells to determine how many cells would be annotated as late RPC. We used the R package SingleR and used p5 and p8 cells from the Neuron paper as reference cells to annotate our cells from control retinas. Please see the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>: 2.74% of our control cells were annotated as late RPCs.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-79994-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We then pulled out data from Supplementary Table S5 of the Neuron paper and calculated the retinal cell type compositions in their p5 and p8 retinas.

However, after carefully inspecting the data, we feel that, at least for our p7 retinal cells, our annotation more closely reflects the real situation:1. For the other types of cells in p5, p8 and p14 retinas described in the Neuron paper, a few obviously abnormal numbers are evident (please see the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>): At p5, 20.04% of cells were annotated as Müller glial cells; the percentage fell to 0.48% at p8 but then increased to 17.86% at p14; the percentage of amacrine cells was 11.37% at p5, 0.26% at p8, and 0.14% at p14; and the percentage of bipolar cells was 1.18% at p5, 19.55% at p8, and 20.34% at p14. None of these numbers accurately reflect the real populations of cell types at the various time points, suggesting that caution should be taken when using these numbers.</p><p>2. We checked the cell cycle status of the cells annotated as “Müller Glia” in Clark et al.’s p5 retinas. Of 1087 cells, 68 were in G2/M phase, and 138 were in S phase; thus, approximately 19% of these cells were actually cycling RPCs, making the RPC percentage 15.9%.</p><p>3. Similarly, we checked the cell cycle status of our p7 retinal cells annotated as “Photoreceptor Precursor” by SingleR; 24% of them were in S phase, indicating that they were actually cycling RPCs.</p><p>4. The cell cycle status of the cells annotated as RPCs in our paper is either S phase or G2/M phase, demonstrating that these cells are proliferating RPCs, while most cells annotated as Müller cells were in G1 phase (Figure 5—figure supplement 1B).</p><p>5. Regarding the Mki67<sup>+</sup> cells, as shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 1B-1D, only portion of proliferating RPC cells (mostly G1/M-phase cells) are Mki67<sup>+</sup> cells. We calculated the percentages of Mki67<sup>+</sup> cells in our scRNA-Seq data, which were 3.99% in control retinas and 7.93% in <italic>Mettl3<sup>CKO</sup></italic> retinas.</p><p>6. To further address the reviewer’s concern about the discrepancy between the scRNA-seq data and the KI67 staining in our original Supplementary Figure 3, we performed KI67 staining on a few more p7 retinal samples and replaced the original images with images showing the whole retina. The abundances of KI67<sup>+</sup> cells in these images roughly match the percentages calculated from the scRNA-seq data mentioned above.</p><p>Based on the above evidence, we feel that, at least for our p7 retinal cells, our annotation is close to the real situation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The stage of the retina was not consistent across experiments. The single cell RNA-seq experiment was performed using P7 retinas, whereas MeRIP-seq used P6 retinas. Twenty-four hours could make a big difference in terms of transcription at this stage.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed p6 retina MeRIP-seq before scRNA-seq. Because the m<sup>6</sup>A epitranscriptome of the mouse retina is relatively stable during postnatal development (Figure 4A, and Figure 4—figure supplementary file 1 and file 2), we used p6 retina MeRIP-seq data in the scRNA-seq and MeRIP-seq integrative analyses in original manuscript. To address the reviewer’s concern, in the course of revising this manuscript, we collected p7 retinas and performed MeRIP-seq on them. Comparing the p7 MeRIP-seq results and p6 MeRIP-seq results showed that the two data sets were quite similar to each other (please see Supplementary Table 3 in the original manuscript and Figure 4—figure supplementary file 1 in the revised manuscript). We have replaced the p6 MeRIP-seq data with the p7 MeRIP-seq data in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Many claims in the manuscript are not fully supported by the data. For example, the authors over-expressed candidate m6A-regulated genes in RPCs and showed that they prevented the RPCs from exiting the cell cycle. However, the data presented in Figure 6 cannot fully support this conclusion. PCNA is not a pan cell cycle marker. Reduction of GFP+PCNA- cells in Mettl3cko doesn't necessarily mean that mutant cells failed to exit the cell cycle.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that PCNA is not a pan cell cycle marker. To address the reviewer’s concern, we repeated these experiments with KI67. The results showed that, similar to the PCNA results, there were fewer GFP<sup>+</sup>; KI67<sup>-</sup> cells among RPCs overexpressing <italic>Zfp292</italic>/<italic>Ckap4</italic>/<italic>Traf4</italic>/<italic>Bcl7a</italic> than in control RPCs. Although KI67 is not a pan cell cycle marker either (please see our response to comment #3), since both the PCNA- (S phase) and Ki67- (G2/M phase) cell populations were reduced in RPCs overexpressing <italic>Zfp292</italic>/<italic>Ckap4</italic>/<italic>Traf4</italic>/<italic>Bcl7a</italic>, the data strongly suggest that overexpressing <italic>Zfp292</italic>/<italic>Ckap4</italic>/<italic>Traf4</italic>/<italic>Bcl7a</italic> prevented RPCs from exiting the cell cycle.</p><p>Furthermore, another phenomenon indicates that fewer RPCs overexpressing <italic>Zfp292</italic>/<italic>Ckap4</italic>/<italic>Traf4</italic>/<italic>Bcl7a</italic> exited the cell cycle: after exiting the cell cycle, many differentiating retinal cells migrate away from the central region of the retinoblast layer to their designated position in the mature retina. For example, differentiating/maturing amacrine cells move toward the vitreous side of the retinoblast layer. In the control samples, we observed many GFP<sup>+</sup> cells located near the vitreous edge of the retinoblast layer, away from Ki67- or PCNA- positive zones, indicating that they were differentiating/maturing amacrine cells (arrows in revised Figure 6C-Ctrl). In contrast, much fewer such cells were observed in retinas overexpressing <italic>Zfp292</italic>/<italic>Ckap4</italic>/<italic>Traf4</italic>/<italic>Bcl7a</italic>, suggesting that withdrawal from the cell cycle was delayed in these retina.</p><p>We have replaced the PCNA data in Figure 6 with the KI67 data and presented the PCNA data in Figure 6—figure supplement 2.

The results showed that, in the retinas electroporated with plasmids expressing shRNAs targeting <italic>Mettl3</italic>, significantly more GFP marked electroporated cells were labeled with 2-hour BrdU treatment than the retinas electroporated with the empty control vector (Figure 2—figure supplement 2), suggesting that cell cycle exit of the late RPCs in the experimental group was delayed. In addition, in the retinas electroporated with plasmids expressing shRNAs targeting <italic>Mettl3</italic>, fewer GFP marked electroporated cells had moved to the vitreous side of the retinoblast layer compared with the control retinas, indicating that the differentiation of <italic>Mettl3</italic> deficient late RPCs was delayed. Thus, these experiments demonstrated that <italic>Mettl3</italic> is required in late RPCs for their proper retinogenesis activities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) In Figure 2, the authors identified müller glia in Mettl3CKO mice using the Sox9 antibody. Due to severe structural abnormality of the retina in Mettl3CKO mice, the identification of cell fate needs additional caution. It is better to verify müller glia using other antibodies (such as glutamine synthetase, GS; GFAP) independently.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that <italic>SOX9</italic> is not an ideal marker for Müller glial cells, especially for structurally distorted <italic>Mettl3<sup>CKO</sup></italic> retinas. However, other Müller glial cell markers, such as GS and GFAP, have their own problems. GFAP is normally expressed in astrocyte but not Müller glial cells unless they are stimulated by injuries to the retina. GS is a cytoplasmic protein and presents challenges for counting Müller cells, which have complex cellular processes; moreover, at p7, GS is just starting to be expressed in Müller glial cells; the weak expression of GS in Müller glial cells (especially in <italic>Mettl3<sup>CKO</sup></italic> retinas) at this time makes it unsuitable as a counting marker for Müller glial cells. To address the reviewer’s concern, we recounted <italic>SOX9</italic><sup>+</sup> cells in p7 retinas but only considered those located in the INL+OPL+ONL region (i.e., excluding those in the IPL+GCL region, which might be astrocytes) as Müller glial cells. The results showed that there were still more <italic>SOX9</italic><sup>+</sup> Müller glial cells in <italic>Mettl3<sup>CKO</sup></italic> retinas than in control retinas (Revised Figure 2J). Thus, our original conclusion that more Müller glial cells were generated by <italic>Mettl3<sup>CKO</sup></italic> RPCs than by control RPCs still stands.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Some results seem inconsistent. First, in Mettl3CKO mice, the author found an increased number of Müller glia, a reduced number of rods, and no change in other cell types (Figure 2I-N). However, in the retinae with the overexpression of Zfp292, Ckap4, Traf4, or Bcl7a, they found an increase in the percentage of Müller cells at the expense of amacrine cells or rod photoreceptors (Figure 6C-D). Second, in scRNAseq data analysis, only the proportion of RPCs increased, but not Müller glial cells (Figure 3D). This result is not consistent with the IF phenotype (Figure 2I-J). The authors need to discuss these results at least to clarify the inconsistency.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the reviewer’s concern about the discrepancy in Müller percentage numbers obtained from scRNA-seq analysis and IF image counting, please see our response to comment #2.</p><p>The following points address the reviewer’s concern that retinas overexpressing <italic>Zfp292</italic>/<italic>Ckap4</italic>/<italic>Traf4</italic>/<italic>Bcl7a</italic> did not exhibit exact the same cell composition changes observed for <italic>Mettl3<sup>CKO</sup></italic> retinas: First, in <italic>Mettl3<sup>CKO</sup></italic> RPCs, over 200 m<sup>6</sup>A-tagged genes were upregulated. It is likely that the change in retinal cell type composition in <italic>Mettl3<sup>CKO</sup></italic> retinas was the collective result of expression changes of many of these m<sup>6</sup>A-tagged genes, and the overexpression of one (or a few) of them may not have given rise to the exact same phenotype as that of <italic>Mettl3<sup>CKO</sup></italic> retinas. Second, forced overexpression of <italic>Zfp292</italic>/<italic>Ckap4</italic>/<italic>Traf4</italic>/<italic>Bcl7a</italic> from plasmids electroporated into RPCs (with CAG used as the promoter) probably increased the expression levels of these genes by several to tens of times, while in <italic>Mettl3<sup>CKO</sup></italic> RPCs, the expression levels of these genes were only moderately elevated compared with those of control RPCs (Figure 3—figure supplementary file 1). Different levels of overexpression may elicit different changes in gene-regulatory-networks and thus yield different end results.</p><p>We have added the above information to the Discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Overall, the working model that the authors proposed lacks direct support. The authors may want to identify late RPC clusters that were committed to Müller glia fate as well as were subject to Mttl3CKO, and further verify the expression specificity of m6A-modified transcripts, such as Zfp292, Ckap4, Traf4, or Bcl7a, in such RPC clusters. Also, the authors should experimentally examine the essential roles of the loss of these m6A-modified transcripts in Müller glia development. These analyses will much strengthen the main conclusions of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the valuable suggestion.</p><p>To identify a putative RPC cluster that was committed to the Müller glia fate, we pulled out the data on RPC cells and Müller glial cells from the scRNA-Seq data (green and blue cells in Figure 3A) and reperformed clustering analyses, which separated the cells into 9 clusters. Clusters 0, 1, 3, and 4 were composed of cells originally annotated as Müller glial cells, while clusters 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 were composed of cells originally annotated as RPCs (revised Figure 5D and Figure 5—figure supplement 1A). We then used AUCell and early RPC and Müller cell signature genes (Lin et al. Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2019, 60 (13): 4436-4450) to score the RPC and Müller features in each cell. Both the RPC feature scoring and the Müller feature scoring showed that RPC clusters 2 and 7 and Müller cell cluster 4 laid at the junction between RPCs and Müller cells (revised Figure 5F). We thus considered RPC clusters 2 and 7 as putative RPC clusters committed to the Müller glia fate and called them ‘RPC<sub>Müller</sub>’, and we considered Müller cell cluster 4 as the cluster that had just exited the cell cycle and become Müller cells and called them ‘Müller<sub>Early</sub>’. Our reclustering did not identify distinct mutant clusters corresponding to clusters 2, 4, and 7. Based on the expression patterns of markers for clusters 4 and 7, we classified subsets of cells of clusters 1 and 6 as corresponding mutant clusters for clusters 4 and 7 (‘Müller<sub>Early</sub>-mut’ and ‘RPC<sub>Müller</sub>-mut’), respectively. Based on the pure CKO sample origin, a subset of cluster 2 was considered the corresponding mutant cluster for cluster 2 (‘RPC<sub>Müller</sub>-mut’) (revised Figure 5G). Thus, by further analyses of RPCs and Müller cells, we identified an RPC cluster committed to the Müller glial fate and a Müller cluster at an early stage of differentiation, as well as their corresponding mutant clusters. We then used AUCell to score the expression levels of m<sup>6</sup>A-tagged RPC genes in the newly annotated cell clusters. The results showed that the expression levels of m<sup>6</sup>A-tagged RPC genes in mutant clusters were significantly elevated to a level close to that in the control cluster of an earlier state (Figure 5H). Thus, these analyses are consistent with our previous analyses (original Figure 5E), and strengthen our hypothesis that m<sup>6</sup>A promotes the transcriptomic transition from RPCs to Müller glial cells by promoting the degradation of modified RPC transcripts. We have added the above new analyses to the revised manuscript.</p><p>To examine the effects of the loss of these m<sup>6</sup>A-modified transcripts on Müller glia development, we designed and synthesized plasmids expressing shRNAs targeting <italic>Zfp292</italic>/<italic>Ckap4</italic>/<italic>Traf4</italic>/<italic>Bcl7a</italic> and electroporated these plasmids into p1 retinas. Late RPCs deficient for <italic>Bcl7a</italic> generated fewer Müller glial cells (rods and amacrine cells were slightly increased but did not show statistical significance), suggesting that <italic>Bcl7a</italic> promotes Müller glial cell development; while knocking down the other three genes did not significantly affect retinogenesis. Taken together, the gene knockdown and overexpression experiments suggest that the expression of these genes in late RPCs should normally be kept at low levels and carefully controlled. We have added the above new data to the revised manuscript.</p><p>Regarding the expression specificity of <italic>Zfp292</italic>, <italic>Ckap4</italic>, <italic>Traf4</italic>, and <italic>Bcl7a</italic>, AUC scoring of the expression levels of these genes in the above set of cell clusters showed that the expression levels of these genes were significantly elevated in all mutant clusters compared with the corresponding control clusters; however, within the control clusters, most of these genes did not show obvious RPC-specific expression (Figure 6—figure supplement 1A). We selected these m<sup>6</sup>A-regulated genes as RPC-specific genes based on our RNA-Seq comparison of sorted mature Müller glial cells and E12.5 retinas (Lin et al. Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2019, 60 (13): 4436-4450). Consistent with our RNA-seq comparison, analyzing Early RPC, Late RPC and Müller glia cells of Clark’s Neuron paper showed that these genes were more abundantly expressed in early RPCs, and often also so in late RPCs (please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>). The lack of specificity of these genes in late RPCs at p7 might be due to the fact that, at this time point, the expression levels of these genes in this end-stage late RPCs were reduced to levels close to those in Müller glial cells. Because of the above new information, we feel that it is not accurate to call these genes late RPC-specific genes, but the results of overexpression and knockdown experiments targeting these genes were still in line with the conclusion that ‘m<sup>6</sup>A plays essential roles during late retinogenesis by promoting the degradation of m<sup>6</sup>A-regulated RPC transcripts’.

These results do not seem to support each other.</p></disp-quote><p>Elevations in cell death activity (Figure 2—figure supplementary 4A’, 4D, and 4E) might reduce the population of RPCs in CKO retinas.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors didn't show that Mettl3 is depleted and m6A levels are lowered at embryonic stages.</p></disp-quote><p>We stained E15.5 retinas with a METTL3 antibody, which showed that <italic>Mettl3</italic> was efficiently deleted from the central retina (revised Figure2—figure supplement 1). Since no obvious phenotype was observed at this stage, we did not measure m<sup>6</sup>A level changes (which would require large amounts of tissues, meaning that large amounts of CKO and control embryos would need to be collected).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. For all the shRNA-based experiments, there aren't any control experiments to show their efficiency and specificity.</p></disp-quote><p>We assessed the gene knockdown efficiencies of the shRNAs in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs): we generated shRNA-expressing lentiviruses (the cloning vector pSicoR is a lentivirus vector); used these viruses to infect MEFs; harvested MEFs two days after infection; and performed RT-qPCR (empty vector virus was used as control). We have added this information to the revised version of the manuscript (Figure6—figure supplement 2E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Lin 254-258, the argument is weak and hard to understand. The Ki67+ region is only at the very tip of the retina in cko. The authors need to provide stronger evidence to clarify whether the number of muller glial cells is increased or unchanged in the cko at different stages.</p></disp-quote><p>Our manual counting of p7 retinas clearly demonstrated that more Müller cells were generated by CKO-RPCs. We have explained in detail why we chose p7 central retinas (see response to comment #2 above), how we counted (see response to comment #8 in the previous round of revision), why the increase in the population of Müller cells was not obvious at p14 (see response to comment #2 in the previous round of revision), and why the manual counting and scRNA-Seq results were seemingly inconsistent (see line 254-258, and the response to comment #2 in the previous round of revision). As we demonstrated in our response to comment #3 in our previous round of revision, bioinformatic analysis of scRNA-Seq data has its caveats and may not faithfully annotate every cell, but the general trends are usually consistent with the real situation in the tissue, which is the case here. We feel we have clearly demonstrated the point that more Müller cells were generated by CKO-RPCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The authors claim that Mettl3cko &quot;…compromises the function of Muller cells&quot; (abstract line 32). There is no direct evidence to support this point.</p></disp-quote><p>As we explained in our response to comment #1 in our previous round of revision, we acknowledge that our study did not directly test the role of <italic>Mettl3</italic> specifically in Müller cells, but several lines of our data indicate that CKO-Müller cells were dysfunctional. We have revised the sentence to “…likely compromises the glial functions of Müller cells.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The role of m6A on neural development has been extensively studied in the brain. The authors did not discuss these published papers and did not explain how their work improved the field.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion.</p><p>In the Discussion section of the revised manuscript, we compare our study with two published studies investigating the roles of m<sup>6</sup>A during cortical development. Please see the last paragraph of the Discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other concerns:</p><p>1. In Figure 1A and 1A', the background color looked very different. It looks like different exposure duration were used. A western blot may be better to show the deletion efficiency.</p></disp-quote><p>We feel that our METTL3 immunostaining results clearly demonstrated that <italic>Mettl3</italic> was efficiently knocked out in the central region of the CKO retina at spatial and single-cell resolution (Figure 1A’), which is a better and more meaningful way than western blotting to demonstrate the deletion effect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Penetrance (50%) of the OLM break phenotype was not included in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>The information has been added to the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Line 161, 2 hour Brdu pulse chase experiment cannot support that the cells proliferate slower. It only suggests that there are less proliferating cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the sentence to “…indicating that there were fewer proliferating RPCs in <italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO retinas.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 2D, label on Y axis was not corrected.</p></disp-quote><p>The error has been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Line 201-206, the number of cells cannot be quantified based on markers expressed in the cytosol. These markers may be upregulated in individual cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that nuclear markers are better than cytosolic markers in terms of cell counting, but we think both can be used to count cells. We currently do not have suitable nuclear markers on hand for these experiments. The results may not be absolutely precise, but we believe they very closely approximate the real situation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The m6A IP was not shown for cko retinas in Figure 6-Supplement 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We are not sure which panel this comment is referring to. If the reviewer is referring to panel B, we have the following response: Because MeRIP-Seq is not a good way to quantify differential methylation levels between samples (Mclntyre A, et al., Scientific Reports (2020), 10:590), we did not perform MeRIP-Seq for CKO retinas.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors have enlisted new experiments and analyses that substantially strengthen the paper in this revised manuscript. All these efforts should be applauded. In particular, the new data of shRNA targeting Mettl3 expressed in late RPCs directly addressed the cell-type specificity of Mettl3's role. Also, the detailed analysis of scRNA data of late RPCs further clarified the transition from late RPCs to the muller glial cells. Furthermore, the authors examined the influences of m6A-associated transcripts on muller glia development by electroporating shRNAs targeting these transcripts into P1 retinae. Besides, additional discussions in the revised manuscript help to clarify the concerns the reviewers raised. In all, all these improvements are satisfying. However, I am surprised that the authors did not provide the background of previous studies of m6A in retinal development. Adding these research backgrounds will further improve the clarity of this study by putting it into context.</p></disp-quote><p>We are glad that the reviewer is satisfied with our revision efforts and thank you for the suggestion.</p><p>Before we started our <italic>Mettl3</italic>-CKO mouse project, we tested the function of m<sup>6</sup>A during vertebrate retinal development by knocking down m<sup>6</sup>A-writer components in zebrafish using morpholinos. The study was published last year in BBRC. In addition, during the time when this manuscript was under revision, A paper studying the role of m<sup>6</sup>A-readers during retinal development was published. We have discussed these works in the introduction or the Discussion sections in the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
