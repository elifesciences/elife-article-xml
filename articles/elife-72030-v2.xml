C<sub>1</sub> domain, a Ca<sup>2+</sup>/PIP<sub>2</sub>-binding C<sub>2</sub>B domain, a MUN domain and a C<sub>2</sub>C domain. Munc13-1 was proposed to bridge synaptic vesicles to the plasma membrane through distinct interactions of the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>B region with the plasma membrane: (i) one involving a polybasic face that is expected to yield a perpendicular orientation of Munc13-1 and hinder release; and (ii) another involving the DAG-Ca<sup>2+</sup>-PIP<sub>2</sub>-binding face that is predicted to result in a slanted orientation and facilitate release. Here, we have tested this model and investigated the role of the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>B region in neurotransmitter release. We find that K603E or R769E point mutations in the polybasic face severely impair Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent liposome bridging and fusion in in vitro reconstitution assays, and synaptic vesicle priming in primary murine hippocampal cultures. A K720E mutation in the polybasic face and a K706E mutation in the C<sub>2</sub>B domain Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops have milder effects in reconstitution assays and do not affect vesicle priming, but enhance or impair Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked release, respectively. The phenotypes caused by combining these mutations are dominated by the K603E and R769E mutations. Our results show that the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B region of Munc13-1 plays a central role in vesicle priming and support the notion that two distinct faces of this region control neurotransmitter release and short-term presynaptic plasticity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Munc13</kwd><kwd>neurotransmitter release</kwd><kwd>synaptic vesicle fusion</kwd><kwd>presynaptic plasticity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 NS097333</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rizo</surname><given-names>Josep</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-1304</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rizo</surname><given-names>Josep</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>German Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>958</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosenmund</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosenmund</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Two different binding modes of the Munc13-1 C­<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>B region govern synaptic vesicle priming and neurotransmitter release probability.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The release of neurotransmitters by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked synaptic vesicle exocytosis is a central event in neuronal communication. This process involves a series of steps that include tethering of synaptic vesicles (SVs) to specialized areas of the plasma membrane called active zones, priming of the vesicles to a release-ready state and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion of the vesicle and plasma membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Südhof, 2013</xref>). Neurotransmitter release does not merely constitute a means to transmit signals between neurons. The efficiency of release is regulated by a wide variety of mechanisms during presynaptic plasticity processes that shape the properties of neural networks and underlie multiple forms of information processing in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Regehr, 2012</xref>). Hence, presynaptic terminals can be viewed as minimal computational units of the brain, and understanding the mechanisms that modulate neurotransmitter release is crucial to understand brain function.</p><p>The sophisticated protein machinery that controls neurotransmitter release has been extensively characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brunger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rizo, 2018</xref>), yielding defined models for the functions of the central components of this machinery and allowing reconstitution of fundamental features of synaptic exocytosis in liposome fusion assays that reproduce the critical functional importance of each one of these components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ma et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stepien and Rizo, 2021</xref>). The SNAP receptor (SNARE) proteins syntaxin-1, SNAP-25 and synaptobrevin play a key role in membrane fusion by forming a tight SNARE complex that consists of a four-helix bundle and brings the vesicle and plasma membranes together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hanson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Poirier et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Söllner et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sutton et al., 1998</xref>). N-ethyl maleimide sensitive factor (NSF) and soluble NSF attachment proteins (SNAPs) disassemble the cis-SNARE complexes that result after fusion, recycling the SNAREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mayer et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Söllner et al., 1993</xref>). NSF and SNAPs also dissociate trans-SNARE complexes and other four-helix bundles formed by the SNAREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ma et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Prinslow et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yavuz et al., 2018</xref>), thus hindering fusion mediated by the SNAREs alone but at the same time ensuring that release occurs through a highly regulated fusion pathway that requires Munc18-1 and Munc13s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Park et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stepien et al., 2019</xref>), and that ensures proper parallel assembly of the SNARE four-helix bundle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lai et al., 2017</xref>). Munc18-1 and Munc13s are essential for neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Augustin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Richmond et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Varoqueaux et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Verhage et al., 2000</xref>) and organize trans-SNARE complex assembly via an NSF-SNAP-resistant pathway that starts with Munc18-1 bound to a self-inhibited ‘closed’ conformation of syntaxin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dulubova et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Misura et al., 2000</xref>). Munc18-1 also binds to synaptobrevin, forming a template to assemble the SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jiao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Parisotto et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sitarska et al., 2017</xref>) while Munc13-1 bridges the vesicle and plasma membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Quade et al., 2019</xref>) and helps to open syntaxin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ma et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). Synaptic vesicle fusion upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is triggered by the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor synaptotagmin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fernández-Chacón et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Munc13s act as master regulators of release through their multidomain architecture. Munc13-1, the major brain isoform, includes a variable N-terminal region and a C-terminal region that is conserved in all Munc13 isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The N-terminal region contains a calmodulin-binding region involved in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent short-term plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Junge et al., 2004</xref>) and a C<sub>2</sub>A domain that forms a homodimer as well as a heterodimer with αRIMs, coupling RIM-dependent forms of plasticity to the priming machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Betz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Camacho et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dulubova et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lu et al., 2006</xref>). The conserved C-terminal region of Munc13-1 includes: (i) the C<sub>1</sub> domain, which mediates diacylglycerol (DAG)/phorbol ester-dependent potentiation of release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rhee et al., 2002</xref>); (ii) the C<sub>2</sub>B domain, which binds Ca<sup>2+</sup> and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) and is involved in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent short-term plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shin et al., 2010</xref>); (iii) the MUN domain, which facilitates syntaxin-1 opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ma et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Magdziarek et al., 2020</xref>); and (iv) the C<sub>2</sub>C domain, which binds weakly to membranes in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Quade et al., 2019</xref>). The crystal structure of a Munc13-1 fragment containing the C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>B and MUN domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xu et al., 2017</xref>) revealed that the C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>B domains pack at one end of the highly elongated MUN domain, with their DAG- and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/PIP<sub>2</sub>-binding sites pointing to the same direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The C<sub>2</sub>C domain [illustrated by a homology model of the C<sub>2</sub>C domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Quade et al., 2019</xref>) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>] is expected to emerge on the opposite end of the MUN domain. This architecture enables the membrane bridging activity of Munc13-1, which led to a model whereby the C<sub>2</sub>C domain binds to the vesicle membrane while the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B region binds to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Quade et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xu et al., 2017</xref>). This model was supported by the finding that mutations in predicted membrane-binding residues of the C<sub>2</sub>C domain dramatically impaired the liposome clustering ability of a fragment spanning the Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>B, MUN and C<sub>2</sub>C domains (C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C) in vitro, as well as vesicle docking and neurotransmitter release in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Quade et al., 2019</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Model of Munc13-1 function with two different orientations bridging the membranes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Domain diagram of Munc13-1 (CaMb, calmodulin binding domain) and ribbon diagrams illustrating a model of the structure of the Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C fragment.

A model of how increases in DAG and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels during repetitive stimulation facilitate vesicle priming and neurotransmitter release emerged from the crystal structure of a Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN fragment and the realization that the C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>B domains could bind to the plasma membrane through their DAG- and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/PIP<sub>2</sub>-binding sites in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner, and through a polybasic region that partially overlaps with these sites in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (referred to below as the polybasic face; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xu et al., 2017</xref>). These observations, together with liposome clustering and liposome fusion data, suggested that Munc13-1 can bridge a vesicle to the plasma membrane in two orientations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Quade et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xu et al., 2017</xref>): a close to perpendicular orientation that involves the polybasic face of the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B region is favored in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and facilitates partial assembly of SNARE complexes but hinders progress toward membrane fusion; and a more slanted orientation that also involves the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B region is favored by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and DAG, and stimulates further SNARE complex assembly and fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). Interestingly, a large amount of experimental data on short-term presynaptic plasticity accumulated over the years can be explained by a related model whereby there is a dynamic equilibrium between two primed states that involve different orientations of Munc13-1 and different extents of SNARE complex assembly, and the equilibrium can be shifted by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and DAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Neher and Brose, 2018</xref>). The proposed dual inhibitory and stimulatory roles of the membrane bridging activity of Munc13-1 are also consistent with the effects of point mutations that disrupt interactions between the various Munc13-1 domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xu et al., 2017</xref>), with the finding that a H567K mutation that unfolds the C<sub>1</sub> domain of Munc13-1 impairs vesicle priming but increases the vesicular release probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rhee et al., 2002</xref>), and with the observation that deletion of the C<sub>1</sub> or C<sub>2</sub>B domain of unc-13 enhances neurotransmitter release in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, yet deletion of both domains strongly hinders release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Michelassi et al., 2017</xref>).

We find that K603E or R769E single point mutations in the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>B polybasic face of Munc13-1 disrupt Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent liposome binding and bridging, as well as stimulation of liposome fusion in reconstitution assays, and severely impair synaptic vesicle priming in mice autaptic cultures. Conversely, a K720E mutation in the polybasic face and a K706E mutation in the C<sub>2</sub>B domain Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops, which have milder effects on liposome binding, bridging and fusion, do not affect vesicle priming; however, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked release and the release probability are enhanced by the K720E mutation and impaired by K706E. The phenotypes caused by combining these mutations are dominated by the K603E and R769E mutations. These results strongly support the notion that binding of the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B region of Munc13-1 to the plasma membrane is critical for synaptic vesicle priming and that two distinct membrane-binding faces of this region control neurotransmitter release.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Models of Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B-membrane interactions in the absence and presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup></title><p>The notion that the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B region of Munc13-1 can bind to membranes via different surfaces in the absence and presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> emerged from analysis of the distribution of charged residues in these surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). To derive models of these putative membrane-binding modes, we performed MD simulations using a model of a fragment spanning the C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>B and MUN domains of Munc13-1 (C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN) based on its crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xu et al., 2017</xref>), and a square membrane with a lipid composition that mimics that of the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan et al., 2012</xref>). In one simulation, we placed the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN model above the cytoplasmic leaflet in an approximately perpendicular orientation with the polybasic face close to the membrane, and ran a simulation of 100 ns. The orientation of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN became even more perpendicular in the first 10 ns and during the remaining 90 ns oscillated around an almost completely perpendicular orientation such as that observed at the end of the simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). The C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B region quickly established extensive interactions with the membrane, including multiple salt bridges between basic residues and the phospholipid head groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p><p>We carried a second simulation in which we included two Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions bound to the corresponding binding sites of the C<sub>2</sub>B domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shin et al., 2010</xref>) and C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN was placed in a more slanted orientation such that the DAG- and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/PIP<sub>2</sub>-binding sites of the C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>B domains, respectively, were close to the membrane. A range of slanted orientations of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN were visited during the 86 ns simulation, oscillating during the last 70 ns around the orientation observed in the last pose, which was even more slanted than the initial orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). During the simulation, the expected DAG and PIP<sub>2</sub> binding regions of the C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>B domains became intimately bound to the membrane through numerous interactions involving hydrophobic and basic residues of both domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Interestingly, the unique amphipathic α-helix present in one of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops of the C<sub>2</sub>B domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shin et al., 2010</xref>) inserted partially into the membrane through its hydrophobic side chains while its basic residues interacted with the phospholipid head groups. It is noteworthy that this helix also interacts with the membrane in the perpendicular orientation adopted in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free simulation, which allows a more extensive membrane-interacting surface involving the sides of the C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>B domains, as well as the linker between them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2A</xref>). In the slanted, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound orientation, the interaction surface is smaller because it involves only the tips of the C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>B domain, but hydrophobic groups of the C<sub>2</sub>B domain helix and the C<sub>1</sub> domain insert into the membrane, and a PIP<sub>2</sub> head group located between the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops is close to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2B</xref>). Since phospholipid head groups are known to complete the coordination spheres of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions bound to C<sub>2</sub> domains, dramatically increasing their Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Verdaguer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 1998</xref>), it seems likely that phospholipid-Ca<sup>2+</sup> coordination and the insertion of hydrophobic groups into the membrane provide the driving force for this binding mode and a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced change in orientation of Munc13-1 with respect to the membrane.</p><p>We would like to emphasize that these simulations were biased by the initial orientations and a much more thorough analysis will be required to explore the possible binding modes of the Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B region with the plasma membrane. However, these short simulations were dynamically stable around the two distinct basins, with and without Ca<sup>2+</sup>, supporting the notion that Munc13-1 can adopt two dramatically different orientations with respect to the plasma membrane. The simulations yielded chemically reasonable binding modes and help to visualize how changes in the orientation of Munc13-1 can drastically alter the distance between a vesicle and the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). Note also that, although we postulate that Ca<sup>2+</sup> favors the switch from the perpendicular to the slanted orientation, both binding modes are likely possible in the absence and presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and other factors such as a more complete assembly of the SNARE complex may induce the switch to the slanted orientation even in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The observed binding modes provide useful frameworks for the design of mutations to disrupt Munc13-1-membrane interactions involving the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>B region. Using these models, we designed the following mutations to investigate the functional importance of the distinct faces of the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B region and test the hypothesis that this region mediates binding of Munc13-1 to membranes in two different orientations that underlie in part its role in regulating neurotransmitter release: (i) K603E and K720E mutations in the C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>B domain, respectively, probed residues in the polybasic face that are far from the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites of the C<sub>2</sub>B domain and are predicted to interact with the lipids in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent binding mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>); (ii) an R769E mutation probed the importance of a basic residue from one of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops of the C<sub>2</sub>B domain that is involved in interactions with the lipids in both the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent binding modes yielded by the simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>); and (iii) a K706E mutation in a residue from another Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loop of the C<sub>2</sub>B domain (loop 1) that is involved in lipid interactions in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent membrane binding mode but is far from the membrane in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>).

To address this question and test the relevance of the binding modes observed in our MD simulations, we used a combination of assays that measure liposome binding, clustering or fusion, and analyzed the effects of single K603E, K706E, K720E, and R769E mutations in these assays. In addition, we studied the effects caused by double mutations that combined the two point mutations in residues that are far from the C<sub>2</sub>B domain Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites (K603E/K720E) or the two mutations in the C<sub>2</sub>B domain Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops (K706E/R769E), as well as a quadruple mutant where the four basic residues were replaced (K603E/K720E/K706E/R769E).</p><p>We first tested the effects of these mutations on binding to protein-free liposomes with the lipid composition that we normally used for T-liposomes, which mimics that of the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ma et al., 2013</xref>), using liposome co-sedimentation assays.

The K603E and R769E mutations decreased Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked release but did not alter the Pvr significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>). In contrast, the K706E mutation decreased both the EPSC amplitude and the Pvr, while the K720E mutation increased both evoked release and the Pvr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>). These effects on the efficiency of release observed for the K706E and K720E mutants were further confirmed by recordings with a pair pulse protocol consisting of two consecutive AP-induced EPSCs with an inter-stimulus interval of 25 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Thus, the K603E and R769E mutations did not alter the paired-pulsed ratio (PPR), but the K706E mutant exhibited an increased PPR, which is typical of synapses with low Pvr, whereas we observed a decreased PPR for the K720E mutant, as expected from its increased Pvr. We also assessed the impact of these mutations on spontaneous release by analyzing the frequency of miniature postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs). We observed a decrease in mEPSC frequency for K603E and R769E, the two mutants that exhibited impaired priming, whereas the K706E mutation did not affect spontaneous release and K720E, the mutant with enhanced Pvr, had increased mEPSC frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6s2sdata1">Figure 6—figure supplement 2—source data 1</xref>). These results show that, while SV priming depends critically on two basic residues in the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>B region of Munc13-1, K603 and R769, two other basic residues in this region, K706 and K720, modulate the vesicular release probability and have opposite effects.</p><p>To gain further insights into the roles of these residues, we analyzed neurotransmitter release in rescue experiments with the Munc13-1 double mutants (K603E/K720E and K706E/R769E), as well as with the quadruple mutant (K603E/K720E/K706E/R769E). The K603E/K720E mutant exhibited impaired sucrose-induced, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked and spontaneous release, without significant changes in Pvr or PPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>), similar to the effects observed for the single K603E mutant. Hence, the K603E mutation dominates the phenotypes exhibited by this double mutant and cancels the gain-of-function caused by the single K720E mutation. The double point mutant K706E/R769E within the C<sub>2</sub>B domain Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops displayed stronger defects in the size of the RRP, the EPSC amplitude and the spontaneous release frequency than the K603E/K720E mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>), and appeared to have a tendency to lower Pvr than wild type (WT), but the difference did not reach statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Correspondingly, the PPR observed for the K706E/R769E mutant showed a tendency to facilitation that was not statistically significant. Finally, we observed that the K603E/K720E/K706E/R769E quadruple mutant exhibited the lowest number of responsive cells and that these were strongly deficient in priming, spontaneous release and, particularly, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked release, while the Pvr and RRP observed for this mutant had similar non-statistically significant tendencies as the K706E/R769E mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>).

These findings support the notion that the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>B region is involved in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent interactions through the polybasic face that are critical for priming and in additional interactions involving the C<sub>2</sub>B domain Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops that affect the probability of evoked release, consistent with the two-state model of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>. The finding that mutations in two basic residues that are near each other (K603 and K720) lead to opposite effects (loss- or gain-of-function) suggests that release is modulated by a delicate balance between inhibitory and stimulatory interactions involving the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>B region, which is also a key aspect of the model. Note that, while the K603E mutation strongly impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent liposome binding and bridging, the K720E mutation impaired liposome binding to a lesser extent and still allowed liposome clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3B and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Thus, whereas the strong impairment of membrane binding caused by the K603E mutation likely underlies the disruption of vesicle priming, the moderate impairment of binding caused by the K720E mutation may not be sufficient to impair priming but may facilitate the switch to the slanted orientation, thus enhancing evoked release (see discussion). Among the basic residues near the C<sub>2</sub>B domain Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites, R769 appears to have a similar importance for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent membrane binding and priming as K603, whereas, as expected, K706 is not involved in priming but plays an important function in controlling release probability. The physiological effects of the mutations are recapitulated at least to some extent in our liposome fusion assays, as the K603E and R769E mutations that impair priming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) lead to the strongest disruption of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent fusion among the single mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, D and F</xref>), and the K706E/R769E double mutation but not the K603E/K720E mutation impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B and E</xref>), in correlation with the stronger disruption of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked release caused by K706E/R769E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Distinct effects of mutations in the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>B region of Munc13-1 on short-term plasticity</title><p>We next investigated how the mutations in basic residues of the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>B region affect synaptic responses during repetitive stimulation by applying 10 Hz stimulus trains on autaptic cultures of Munc13-1 DKO neurons rescued with WT and comparing them side-by-side with rescues by the Munc13-1 mutants.

The R769E single mutant exhibited stronger depression than WT Munc13-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8L</xref>), which likely arises from impairment in the kinetics of RRP replenishment, as this mutant had a strong defect in priming but no deficit in Pvr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). However, the K603E mutant also had impaired priming and yet it exhibited similar depression to WT Munc13-1 in the beginning of the train, with a tendency to have higher EPSC amplitudes than WT as the train progressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). These findings suggest that the fusogenicity of primed vesicles is altered during the stimulus train and is consistent with the notion that, as intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulates during repetitive stimulation, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding to the Munc13-1 C<sub>2</sub>B domain facilitates release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shin et al., 2010</xref>) because it favors more slanted orientations of Munc13-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) that mediate release more efficiently than perpendicular orientations. Thus, based on this model, K603 contributes to binding of the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>B region to the plasma membrane in the orientations present in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> that mediate initial priming, but not in the slanted orientations favored upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the C<sub>2</sub>B domain that are increasingly populated and lead to enhanced fusogenicity of the primed vesicles during the stimulus train (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Thus, the stronger depression observed initially for the K720E mutant is likely due to the initially higher release probability exhibited by this mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) but, based on the two-state model of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>, the K720E mutation does not affect release later during the stimulus training because K720 does not participate in binding in the slanted orientations favored by Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation. In contrast, the K706E mutation led to depression that was similar to that observed for WT Munc13-1 in normalized EPSC plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>), and absolute EPSC amplitudes show that the EPSCs observed for the K706E mutation were smaller than those of WT throughout the stimulus train (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>).

The two-state model predicts that this potentiation arises because DAG/phorbol esters favor the slanted orientations of Munc13-1 that facilitate SNARE complex formation and fusion. To test this notion, we analyzed the effects of the mutations in basic residues of the Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>B region on potentiation by a phorbol ester [phorbol 13,14-dibutyrate (PDBu)]. PDBu caused a robust potentiation of EPSCs in DKO autaptic cultures rescued with WT Munc13-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig10sdata1">Figure 10—source data 1</xref>), as expected, and the K603E and R769E mutants exhibited even higher potentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). These results suggest that PDBu partially compensates for the priming defects caused by the K603E and R769E mutations. In contrast, the K720E mutant displayed less potentiation than WT Munc13-1, which, based on the two-state model, may arise because the K720E mutation already facilitates the transition from the perpendicular to the slanted orientation and thus has an intrinsically higher release probability. Surprisingly, the potentiation observed for the K706E mutant was similar to that observed for WT Munc13-1. Although this observation might suggest that this mutation does not affect the transition between the LS and TS states, it is also plausible that the mutation does alter the transition but in addition affects downstream events that lead to synaptic vesicle fusion (see discussion). The K603E/K720E and K706E/R769E double mutants exhibited similar enhancements of PDBu-induced potentiation as the K603E and R769E single mutants, respectively, showing again that these mutations dominate the phenotypes of the double mutants. The results obtained for the rescue with the K603E/K720E/K706E/R769 quadruple mutant need to be interpreted with caution because this mutant exhibited a high-number of non-responsive neurons and the EPSCs for the responsive neurons were very weak.

This large multiple domain protein plays fundamental roles in this process by accelerating opening of the syntaxin-1 closed conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ma et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yang et al., 2015</xref>) and bridging the vesicle and plasma membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Quade et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, it seems likely that Munc13-1-dependent regulation of neurotransmitter release involves at least in part alteration of these activities. Indeed, the finding that the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>B region has two putative faces that can bind to membranes led to an intriguing model postulating that membrane bridging by Munc13-1 in two orientations modulates neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xu et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we have tested this model and examined the role of the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>B region in neurotransmitter release. We find that basic residues in this region play key roles in SV priming and in dictating the vesicular release probability, and also modulate short-term plasticity. The finding that two faces of the Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>B region play important roles in neurotransmitter release support the model of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>, but other interpretations are possible.</p><p>The notion that the highly conserved C-terminal region of Munc13-1 containing the C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>B, MUN and C<sub>2</sub>C domains bridges the vesicles and plasma membranes arose naturally from the discovery of its rod-like architecture, with membrane binding domains on opposite ends of the highly elongated MUN domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xu et al., 2017</xref>). At the same time, the structural studies revealed that the Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>B region contains a large polybasic face adjacent to the region containing the DAG/phorbol ester-binding site of the C<sub>1</sub> domain and the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/PIP<sub>2</sub>-binding region of the C<sub>2</sub>B domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>), suggesting that Munc13-1 can bind to the plasma membrane through two different faces that yield different orientations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xu et al., 2017</xref>). Although our MD simulations need to be interpreted with caution because of the limited simulation times, they yield binding modes that make sense from a biophysical point of view and indicate that membrane interactions mediated by the polybasic face involve multiple ionic interactions in an extensive surface, leading to an almost perpendicular orientation of the Munc13-1 rod with respect to the membrane. In contrast, the simulations suggest that interactions mediated by the DAG/Ca<sup>2+</sup>/PIP<sub>2</sub>-binding face involve a smaller area and are favored by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-phospholipid coordination and insertion of hydrophobic residues into the membrane in addition to ionic interactions, leading to a very slanted orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>). The relevance of the two binding modes observed in the simulations is supported by the biochemical and physiological effects of the mutations described here and those caused by mutations that disrupt DAG/phorbol ester binding to the C<sub>1</sub> domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rhee et al., 2002</xref>) or Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the C<sub>2</sub>B domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shin et al., 2010</xref>). We also note that the structure of the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUN fragment appears to be rather rigid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xu et al., 2017</xref>) and there is no apparent reason why Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the C<sub>2</sub>B domain should alter the overall structure of the Munc13-1 C-terminal region. Hence, although our data do not demonstrate that two orientations of Munc13-1 with respect to the plasma membrane are physiologically relevant, this notion is supported by the functional importance of the two binding faces, as they are expected to lead to two drastically different orientations.</p><p>It is important to realize that the orientation of Munc13-1 is likely dynamic, particularly in the presence of other forces. For instance, the perpendicular orientation of Munc13-1 may facilitate initiation of SNARE core complex assembly but prevent full assembly, resulting in a tug-of-war between Munc13-1 and the SNAREs in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> that is dramatically tilted toward full SNARE complex assembly and fusion when Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the C<sub>2</sub>B domain favors slanted orientations. However, the balance can also be tilted towards slanted orientations in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> by the energy associated with further assembly of the SNARE complex and by proteins that bind to the SNARE complex such as Syt1 and complexins (see below). Indeed, a large amount of physiological data can be explained with a model postulating that primed vesicles exist in a dynamic equilibrium between a loosely primed state (LS), in which SNARE complexes are partially assembled and Munc13-1 bridges the vesicle and plasma membrane in a perpendicular orientation, and a tightly primed state (TS) where the SNARE complex is more fully assembled and Munc13-1 bridges the membranes in a slanted orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Neher and Brose, 2018</xref>). In this scenario, vesicles in the TS state are much more likely to be released by an action potential than those in the LS state, and accumulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> during repetitive stimulation increases the vesicular release probability because it shifts the equilibrium toward the TS state. Note, however, that methods used to measure the RRP, such as application of sucrose, likely release vesicles in both the LS and TS states. This two-state model and the proposed nature of the two membrane-binding modes of the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B region underlying the two states are supported by our data in combination with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rhee et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shin et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The strong impairments of liposome binding and clustering in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> caused by the K603E and R769E mutations in Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>) show that the polybasic face is indeed critical for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent membrane binding and membrane bridging. These mutations also caused the strongest impairments of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent liposome fusion among the single mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, D and F</xref>). The finding that the K720E mutation in the polybasic face has smaller effects on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent liposome binding, clustering and fusion suggests that K720 has a smaller energetic contribution to membrane binding than those of K603 and R769. The K706E mutation exhibited the smallest inhibitory effects on liposome binding and fusion in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which correlates with the fact that K706 is not in the polybasic face.</p><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> enhanced the affinity of all the mutants for liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and increased the clustering activity of the mutants that had the weakest clustering ability (K603E, R769E, and the two double mutants), except the quadruple mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Hence, although we did not observe Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced increases in liposome binding and clustering for WT C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C because its liposome affinity and clustering activity are very high, Ca<sup>2+</sup> did increase binding and clustering when these activities were impaired by mutation. These increases may arise in part because Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the C<sub>2</sub>B domain enhances the overall positive electrostatic potential and in part because the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent binding mode with slanted orientations occurs with a higher affinity than the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent binding mode involving the polybasic face. The four single mutants and the K603E/K720E double mutant supported Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent fusion with comparable efficiency as WT C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B and E</xref>) even though the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent clustering activity of all these mutants was somewhat lower than that of WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), suggesting that fusion efficiency can remain very high as long as the clustering activity is above a certain threshold. Interestingly, the double K706E/R769E mutation in the C<sub>2</sub>B domain Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites disrupted Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent liposome fusion severely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B and E</xref>) even though its clustering activity is comparable to that of C1C2BMUNC2C with the K603E/K720E double mutation in the polybasic face (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This finding strongly supports the notion that a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced switch to a slanted orientation is critical for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced enhancement of liposome fusion.</p><p>Our electrophysiological studies support the biological relevance of at least some of the results obtained in our in vitro assays and reveal additional effects of the mutations that could not be discerned with the liposome fusion assays, providing critical evidence supporting the functional relevance of the two faces of the Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>B region. The observation that only the K603E and R769E mutants among the single Munc13-1 mutants exhibited severely impaired SV priming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) clearly correlates with the much stronger disruption of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent liposome binding, clustering and fusion caused by these mutations, compared to the K706E and K720E single mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C, D and F</xref>). These results provide compelling evidence that the polybasic face of the Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>B region plays a critical function in synaptic vesicle priming. Together with the key importance of the C<sub>2</sub>C domain for membrane bridging and SV priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Quade et al., 2019</xref>), these data strongly support the notion that this critical function involves bridging of the vesicle and plasma membranes by respective interactions involving the C<sub>2</sub>C domain and the C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>B region of Munc13-1. The K603E and R769E mutants also exhibited similar impairments in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked release that arose because of the defects in priming, as the Pvr remained analogous to that of WT Munc13-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–C</xref>), and the potentiation of release by PDBu was somewhat larger for both mutants than for WT Munc13-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). These observations suggest that binding of PDBu to the C<sub>1</sub> domain can partially compensate for the defects in priming caused by these two mutations by favoring the binding mode involving the slanted orientation, which increases vesicle fusogenicity. Interestingly, we observed a considerably stronger depression during a 10 Hz stimulus train for the R769E mutant than for the K603E mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This finding supports the notion that accumulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> during repetitive stimulation facilitates the transition to slanted orientations, which are expected to be destabilized by the R769E mutation but not by the K603E mutation.</p><p>It was surprising that the K720E mutation in the polybasic interface did not impair SV priming and enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked release as well as the Pvr, in contrast to the effects of the K603E in a nearby basic residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>). However, as mentioned above, there is likely a delicate balance between inhibitory and stimulatory interactions within the release machinery, and some of the interactions involving the polybasic region that are important for priming initiated by a perpendicular orientation of Munc13-1 need to be released to transit to slanted orientations that support full zippering of the SNARE complex and membrane fusion. Since the K720E mutation has only a modest effect on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent liposome binding and clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3D</xref>), a likely explanation of our results is that the mutant retains sufficient membrane affinity to fully support priming and facilitates the transition to the more active slanted orientations, yielding a higher release probability. This model is consistent with the finding that, in contrast to the K603E mutant, the K720E mutant exhibited less potentiation of release by PDBu than WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>), likely because this mutation already promotes the slanted orientations that are favored by PDBu binding to the C<sub>1</sub> domain. In 10 Hz stimulus trains, the K720E mutant depressed initially more than WT Munc13-1, but later exhibited analogous EPSC amplitudes as WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D–F</xref>), likely because accumulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> during repetitive stimulation already induces slanted orientations that do not involve interactions of K720 with the membrane. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out the possibility that the effects of the K720E mutation arise from a different mechanism, for instance if the mutation alters an as yet unidentified interaction of Munc13-1.</p><p>The K706E mutation did not affect SV priming, in agreement with the notion that K706 does not participate in the interactions of the polybasic interface that mediate priming, but this mutant did decrease Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked release and hence the probability of release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>). These effects are opposite to those caused by mutation of the corresponding lysine residue of ubMunc13-2 to Trp (the KW mutant) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shin et al., 2010</xref>), which caused a gain-of-function, and could arise in principle because the K706E mutation hinders the transition to slanted orientations. This interpretation is consistent with the observation that EPSCs remained lower than WT for the K706E mutant during 10 Hz repetitive stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G–I</xref>). However, the observation that PDBu potentiation was similar for this mutant and WT Munc13-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>) suggests that the effects of the K706E mutation might not be related to the transition to slanted orientations but rather to another mechanism that directly influences fusion. For instance, the Munc13-1 C<sub>2</sub>B domain might cause membrane perturbations analogous to those that are believed to underlie the function of the Syt1 C<sub>2</sub> domains in triggering release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fernández-Chacón et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rhee et al., 2005</xref>). It is also possible that the phenotypes caused by the K706E mutation and other mutations studied here reflect effects of Munc13-1 in more than one step leading to release, which complicates the interpretation of the data.</p><p>Despite these uncertainties in the interpretation of our results, the overall data strongly support the notions that the Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>B region plays a critical role in SV priming and that this region underlies two types of interactions with the plasma membrane that yield different orientations of Munc13-1. This model is also consistent with the previous observation that a mutation that is expected to unfold the Munc13-1 C<sub>1</sub> domain leads to decreased priming but increased release probability in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rhee et al., 2002</xref>), as the absence of the C<sub>1</sub> domain is expected to impair the initial binding to the plasma membrane that is important for priming but likely helps to adopt slanted orientations that facilitate release. Similarly, the finding that deletion of the C<sub>1</sub> domain or the C<sub>2</sub>B domain of <italic>C. elegans</italic> unc-13 enhances release but deletion of both domains strongly impairs release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Michelassi et al., 2017</xref>) suggest that both the C<sub>1</sub> domain and the C<sub>2</sub>B domain are important to stabilize the perpendicular orientations that mediate priming but hinder transition to the active, slanted orientations; however, at least one of the two domains needs to be present to mediate the interaction with the plasma membrane.</p><p>Further research will be necessary to better understand the nature of the LS and TS states and the factors that influence the postulated equilibrium between them. Thus, the equilibrium is expected to be affected by Syt1 and complexins, which are believed to maintain trans-SNARE complexes in a state that is ready for fast release but is inhibited to prevent premature fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Voleti et al., 2020</xref>), and that most likely corresponds to the TS state. Note that the release probability and the RRP are reduced in Syt1 KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2018</xref>) while, in the absence of complexins, the release probability is also decreased but not the RRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reim et al., 2001</xref>). Since Syt1 promotes trans-SNARE complex assembly and complexins protect trans-SNARE complexes against disassembly by NSF/αSNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Prinslow et al., 2019</xref>), stabilizing the C-terminus of the SNARE four-helix bundle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2002</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that Syt1 facilitates initial formation of LS and complexins shift the equilibrium toward TS. Other proteins such as CAPS, which has functions related to those of Munc13s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jockusch et al., 2007</xref>), may also affect the equilibrium between the two primed states.

T-liposomes contained 38 % POPC, 18 % DOPS, 20 % POPE, 2 % PIP2, 2 % DAG, and 20 % Cholesterol, and V-liposomes contained 39 % POPC, 19 % DOPS, 19 % POPE, 20 % Cholesterol, 1.5 % NBD PE, and 1.5 % Marina Blue DHPE. The dried lipids were left overnight in a vacuum chamber to remove the organic solvent. The next day, the lipid films were hydrated with 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mM KCl, 1 mM TCEP, 2 % n-Octyl-β-D- glucoside (β-OG) and 10 % glycerol (v/v) by vortexing for 5 minutes. For the experiments of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, rehydrated lipids for T- liposomes were mixed with protein and dye to get a final concentration of 4 mM lipid, 5 μM full- length syntaxin-1, 25 μM full-length SNAP-25 with its four cysteines mutated to serine, and 4 μM R-phycoerythrin biotin-XX conjugate (Invitrogen). Rehydrated lipids for V-liposomes were mixed with protein and dye to get a final concentration of 4 mM lipid, 8 μM full-length synaptobrevin, and 8 μM Cy5-streptavidin conjugate (Seracare Life Sciences Inc). Lipid mixtures were dialyzed 1 hr, 2 hr and overnight at 4 °C in 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mM KCl, 1 mM TCEP, 10 % glycerol (v/v) in the presence of Amberlyte XAD-2 beads (Sigma) to remove the detergent and promote the formation of proteoliposomes. The next day, the proteoliposomes were harvested and mixed with Histodenz (Sigma) to a final concentration of 35 %. Proteoliposome mixtures were added to a centrifuge tube with 25 % Histodenz and 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mM KCl, 1 mM TCEP, 10 % glycerol layered on top. The proteoliposomes were spun at 4 °C for 1.5 hr at 55,000 RPM in an SW-60 TI rotor and the top layer was collected. Concentrations of the final T-proteoliposomes were measured by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stewart, 1980</xref> method. V-proteoliposome concentrations were estimated from the UV-vis absorption using a standard curve made using known quantities of liposomes containing 1.5 % NBD-PE. For the experiments of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, we used the same protocol except for the following modifications. We used WT SNAP-25 that was dodecylated as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stepien and Rizo, 2021</xref>) and incorporated into the T-liposomes with P:L ratio 1:800 instead of SNAP-25 with its four cysteines mutated to serine, and syntaxin-1 was incorporated into the T-liposomes with P:L ratio 1:5,000. Instead of V-liposomes, we used VSyt1-liposomes containing 40 % POPC, 6.8 % DOPS, 30.2 % POPE, 20 % Cholesterol, 1.5 % NBD PE, and 1.5 % Marina Blue DHPE, synaptobrevin (1:10,000 P:L ratio) and synaptotagmin-1 (57–421) C74S/C75A/C77S/C79I/C82L/C277S (P:L ratio 1,1,000), as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stepien and Rizo, 2021</xref>).</p><p>To perform the fusion assays, T-liposomes (250 μM total lipid) were first incubated with 1 μM Munc18-1 (WT or D326K as indicated), 0.8 μM NSF, 2 μM αSNAP, 2 mM ATP, 2.5 mM Mg2+, 5 μM streptavidin, and 100 μM EGTA for 15–25 min at 37 °C, and then were mixed with V- liposomes or VSyt1-liposomes (125 μM total lipid), 1 μM SNAP-25 (only for the experiments of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> but not for those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), and WT or mutant C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C (0.1 μM for the experiments of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>, or 0.5 μM for the experiments of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). After 5 min 0.6 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> was added to stimulate fusion, and 1 % β- OG was added after 25 min to solubilize the liposomes. The fluorescence signals from Marina Blue (excitation at 370 nm, emission at 465 nm) and Cy5 (excitation at 565 nm, emission at 670 nm) were recorded to monitor lipid and content mixing, respectively. The lipid mixing data were normalized to the maximum fluorescence signal observed upon detergent addition. The content mixing data were normalized to the maximum Cy5 fluorescence observed after detergent addition in control experiments without external streptavidin.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Measuring Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations during liposome fusion assays</title><p>Liposome lipid mixing assays were performed basically as described above for the experiments with V- and T-liposomes, except that we used different fluorescent lipids. To prepare the phospholipid vesicles, POPC, DOPS, POPE, PIP2, DAG, and cholesterol in chloroform and 1,1’-dioctadecyl-3,3,3’,3’- tetramethylindodicarbocyanine, 4-chlorobenzenesulfonate salt (DiD, Invitrogen) in DMSO were mixed at the desired ratio and dried under a stream of nitrogen gas. T-liposomes contained 38 % POPC, 18 % DOPS, 20 % POPE, 2 % PIP2, 2 % DAG, and 20 % Cholesterol, and V-liposomes contained 38.5 % POPC, 19 % DOPS, 19 % POPE, 20 % Cholesterol, and 3.5 % DiD. The dried lipids were left overnight in a vacuum chamber to remove the organic solvent. The next day the lipid films were hydrated with 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mM KCl, 1 mM TCEP, 2 % n-Octyl-β-D- glucoside (β-OG) and 10 % glycerol (v/v) by vortexing for 5 minutes.

To initiate the reaction preincubated T- liposomes were mixed with V-liposomes (125 μM total lipid), 1 μM SNAP-25, and 0.1 μM C1C2BMUNC2C. After 5 min Ca<sup>2+</sup> was added to stimulate fusion, and 1 % β-OG was added after 25 min to solubilize the liposomes. Throughout the reaction lipid mixing was monitored using DiD de-quenching with excitation at 560 nm and emission measured at 670 nm. After solubilization of samples, the Fluo-4 emission intensity was measured from 505 to 540 nm with excitation at 465 nm. To measure the maximum fluorescence of Fluo-4 in each sample, 10 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> was added to each sample and the fluorescence spectrum was acquired again. Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations were calculated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grynkiewicz et al., 1985</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Supervision, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal Welfare Committee of Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin and the Berlin state government agency for Health and Social Services approved all protocols for animal maintenance and experiments (license no.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Reinhard Jahn as the Reviewing Editor and Olga Boudker as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All reviewers agree that this is an interesting and thorough study, conducted by two leading laboratories with complementary expertise, that deserves publication after appropriate revision. Moreover, the reviewers do not see the need for additional experiments in order to make the manuscript acceptable for publication. However, the reviewers feel that the interpretation of the findings should be more cautious and that some of the conclusions are overstated. Please check in particular the points raised by Ref. 1, most importantly the remarks concening the mechanistic interpretation (switch in orientation) of the mutant phenotypes. Mutations which reverse charges may, in addition to local effects, also have more global, electrostatic and thus less specific effects. Moreover, note that the MD simulation can only refine the proposed individual orientations but do not differentiate between alternative models. We also ask you to consider changing the order of the data presentation as suggested by Reviewer 1.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I strongly urge the authors to reverse the order of the manuscript so that the biochemical analysis of the mutants precedes the in vivo analysis. Make the mutants, characterize membrane binding, liposome tethering, and membrane fusion in vitro, then move on the much trickier business of trying to understand their consequences in vivo.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In Figure 7, the authors show that the calcium-independent phospholipid binding of the Munc13 mutants is significantly altered (Fig. 7A, upper panel). It is unclear why they examine calcium-dependent lipid binding at exceptionally high calcium concentrations (0.5 mM free calcium) (Fig. 7A middle panel), although calcium-dependent Munc13-mediated liposome fusion is already saturated at micromolar concentrations (Fig. 9B). Would it therefore not make more sense to delineate possible changes in calcium-dependent phospholipid binding of the Munc13 protein and its mutants at submicromolar concentrations?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>It would be useful to have a methodological strategy to quantitate the ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependence of the transition from the TL to the TS state of the SNARE to further validate the model proposed by the authors. I understand, however, that this is technical challenge in the field and it is, of course, not required for this study. In any case, according to the model proposed by the authors, which changes in RRP size (specially in the amount of SNARE complexes in the TS state) would be expected from a mutant with a low release probability (e.g. a synaptotagmin mutant)? Perhaps this is a prediction that could be included in the discussion.</p><p>Page 25.

We also ask you to consider changing the order of the data presentation as suggested by Reviewer 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We very much appreciate the overall positive evaluation of the manuscript. We have followed the recommendations, toning down some conclusions, emphasizing the presence of two functional binding surfaces rather than two orientations, and switching the order of the data presentation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In addition to addressing/discussing the points within Public Review, I strongly urge the authors to reverse the order of the manuscript so that the biochemical analysis of the mutants precedes the in vivo analysis. Make the mutants, characterize membrane binding, liposome tethering, and membrane fusion in vitro, then move on the much trickier business of trying to understand their consequences in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this suggestion and have switched the order accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In Figure 7, the authors show that the calcium-independent phospholipid binding of the Munc13 mutants is significantly altered (Fig. 7A, upper panel). It is unclear why they examine calcium-dependent lipid binding at exceptionally high calcium concentrations (0.5 mM free calcium) (Fig. 7A middle panel), although calcium-dependent Munc13-mediated liposome fusion is already saturated at micromolar concentrations (Fig. 9B). Would it therefore not make more sense to delineate possible changes in calcium-dependent phospholipid binding of the Munc13 protein and its mutants at submicromolar concentrations?</p></disp-quote><p>We used 0.5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> to ensure saturation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites, as we do usually for our liposome fusion assays. We realize that millimolar concentrations of Ca2+ can induce lipsome clustering without the assistance of proteins, but these effects do not occur below 1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> under our experimental conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>It would be useful to have a methodological strategy to quantitate the ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependence of the transition from the TL to the TS state of the SNARE to further validate the model proposed by the authors. I understand, however, that this is technical challenge in the field and it is, of course, not required for this study. In any case, according to the model proposed by the authors, which changes in RRP size (specially in the amount of SNARE complexes in the TS state) would be expected from a mutant with a low release probability (e.g. a synaptotagmin mutant)? Perhaps this is a prediction that could be included in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises a good point that is indeed difficult to address experimentally. Following the suggestion of the reviewer, we have slightly expanded the final paragraph of the discussion to briefly discuss potential roles of synaptagmin-1 and complexins, proteins that increase the release probability, on the RRP and the LS-TS equilibrium (pg. 27).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 25.
