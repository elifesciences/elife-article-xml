therapeutic agents remains unknown. Using a genetic screen in haploid human cells, we discovered that the enantiospecific cytotoxicity of numerous terminal alkynylcarbinols, including the highly cytotoxic dialkynylcarbinols, involves a bioactivation by HSD17B11, a short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) known to oxidize the C-17 carbinol center of androstan-3-alpha,17-beta-diol to the corresponding ketone. A similar oxidation of dialkynylcarbinols generates dialkynylketones, that we characterize as highly protein-reactive electrophiles. We established that, once bioactivated in cells, the dialkynylcarbinols covalently modify several proteins involved in protein-quality control mechanisms, resulting in their lipoxidation on cysteines and lysines through <italic>Michael</italic> addition. For some proteins, this triggers their association to cellular membranes and results in endoplasmic reticulum stress, unfolded protein response activation, ubiquitin-proteasome system inhibition and cell death by apoptosis. Finally, as a proof-of-concept, we show that generic lipidic alkynylcarbinols can be devised to be bioactivated by other SDRs, including human RDH11 and HPGD/15-PGDH. Given that the SDR superfamily is one of the largest and most ubiquitous, this unique cytotoxic mechanism-of-action could be widely exploited to treat diseases, in particular cancer, through the design of tailored prodrugs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>prodrugs</kwd><kwd>short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase</kwd><kwd>chiral cytototoxic

Marine sponges have attracted pharmaceutical interest since the discovery in the 1950s of C-nucleosides in <italic>Cryptotethia crypta</italic> that led to the development of cytosine arabinoside (ara-C or cytarabine) and analogues as anticancer treatments for acute myelogenous leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bergmann, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ellison et al., 1968</xref>). In a different structural series, several cytotoxic acetylenic lipids bearing a terminal alkenylalkynylcarbinol (AAC) pharmacophore have since been isolated from marine sponges, such as petrocortyne A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), isolated from <italic>Petrosia sp</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Seo et al., 1998</xref>) and fulvinol isolated from <italic>Haliclona fulva</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ortega et al., 1996</xref>). The simplest cytotoxic AAC representative, (<italic>S</italic>)-eicos-(<italic>4E</italic>)-en-1-yn-3-ol ((<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>1</bold>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), was isolated from the marine sponge <italic>Cribrochalina vasculum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gunasekera and Faircloth, 1990</xref>). It demonstrated high cytotoxic activity selectively towards non-small cell lung carcinoma cells as compared to normal lung fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zovko et al., 2014</xref>). Starting from (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>1</bold>, an extensive structure-activity relationship study in human cancer cell lines established that (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>): (i) the non-natural enantiomer (<italic>R</italic>)–<bold>1</bold> has higher cytotoxic activity, (ii) homologues with shorter lipidic tails are more cytotoxic, with an optimum total aliphatic backbone of 17 carbon atoms (e.g. (<italic>R</italic>)–<bold>2</bold>), and (iii) replacement of the internal C=C bond by a C≡C bond, giving rise to a terminal dialkynylcarbinol (DAC) pharmacophore, further increases cytotoxicity, to reach an IC<sub>50</sub> down to 90 nM for the DAC (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">El Arfaoui et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Listunov et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Listunov et al., 2018b</xref>).

Given that (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold> had the greatest cytotoxic activity of all the DACs previously tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">El Arfaoui et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Listunov et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Listunov et al., 2018b</xref>), we screened for mutations that could render HAP-1 cells resistant to (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold>. We first confirmed in HAP-1 that (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold>, but not (<italic>R</italic>)–<bold>3</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), exhibits nanomolar cytotoxic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, IC<sub>50</sub> 62.4 nM), in agreement with previous results on HCT116 colon cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">El Arfaoui et al., 2013</xref>). We used Ethyl-Methane Sulfonate (EMS) to generate a mutagenized HAP-1 population and selected resistant clones using a lethal 250 nM (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold> concentration. Ten individual (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold>-resistant clones (DACR) were isolated, displaying a 38- to 62-fold resistance to (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) but similar sensitivity as parental cells to two unrelated compounds, bortezomib and doxorubicin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). Based on previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wacker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bossaert et al., 2021</xref>), and considering that EMS induces mainly point mutations under these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Forment et al., 2017</xref>), we selected four DACR clones for RNA-seq analysis, to identify mis- or non-sense mutations accounting for the resistance. Around nine mutated genes were identified per clone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>), with <italic>KCTD5</italic> and <italic>HSD17B11</italic> being the only mutated genes shared by more than two clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). <italic>KCTD5</italic> encodes for an E3-ubiquitin ligase substrate adaptor identified in a genetic screen as a negative regulator of the Akt pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brockmann et al., 2017</xref>).

HSD17B11, also called SDR16C2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Persson et al., 2009</xref>], PAN1B, DHRS8, or retSDR2, localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lipid droplets (LD) via a N-terminal targeting domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), where it uses NAD+ to catalyze oxidation of the C17 carbinol center of androstan-3-alpha,17-beta-diol to generate androsterone, a weak androgen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brereton et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Horiguchi et al., 2008a</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The HSD17B11 protein was barely detectable in all the DACR clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, lower band), suggesting that the mutations result in protein instability. Using the DACR#A5 clone, in which <italic>HSD17B11</italic> RNA was strongly down-regulated (~200 fold, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>), we performed complementation experiments with plasmids coding for GFP alone, or wild-type (WT) or S172L HSD17B11-GFP. This mutation was selected because the S172 residue is critical for catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Filling et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gao et al., 2021</xref>), and the DACR#A4 clone, which carried S172L mutations, was the only one in which traces of full-length HSD17B11 could be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Complemented DACR#A5 cells stably expressing WT and S172L HSD17B11-GFP at similar levels were successfully isolated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), and (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold> was ~50 times more active against cells expressing WT HSD17B11 compared to control GFP-complemented cells or cells expressing S172L HSD17B11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). This supports that HSD17B11 catalytic activity is critical for (<italic>S</italic>)-DAC cytotoxicity. Notably, the DACR#A4 clone (S172L mutation) was also resistant to six other cytotoxic AACs: the naturally occurring AAC (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>1</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>), its synthetic enantiomer (<italic>R</italic>)–<bold>1</bold>, its shorter homologue (<italic>R</italic>)–<bold>2</bold>, the synthetic AAC (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>4</bold> with an internal C≡C bond and an external C=C bond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>), the allenylalkynylcarbinol (AllAC) (<italic>R</italic>,<italic>S</italic><sub>a</sub>)–<bold>5</bold> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Listunov et al., 2018a</xref>) and the more cytotoxic butadiynylalkynylcarbinol (BAC) (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>6</bold> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bourkhis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>).

Accordingly, HSD17B11 protein was undetectable in T47D, while U2OS displayed the highest levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>), in agreement with reported mRNA levels (<italic>The Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia dataset</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barretina et al., 2012</xref>]). In addition, (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold> was particularly cytotoxic toward four other osteosarcoma cell lines as compared to normal cell lines or primary osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4C</xref>). CRISPR/Cas9-mediated inactivation of HSD17B11 also conferred significant (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold> resistance to U2OS cells, which was suppressed by wild-type HSD17B11-GFP but not by the S172L mutant or GFP alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A, B</xref>). In contrast, complementation with HSD17B11 carrying the L14P or V16D mutations, lying outside of the catalytic domain and identified in the DACR clones #B1 and #A1/#A2, respectively, restored (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold> cytotoxic activity, in agreement with these mutations affecting HSD17B11 protein stability and not its catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5C, D</xref>). These data also support that the C-terminal FLAG-GFP tag and/or the CMV promoter-based overexpression partly overcome the impact of these mutations on HSD17B11 expression level. The role of HSD17B11 in (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold> cytotoxic activity was further confirmed using two different small-interfering RNAs (siRNA) to down-regulate HSD17B11 in U2OS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5E, F</xref>) and in the non-small cell lung carcinoma cell line A549, in which CRISPR/Cas9-mediated HSD17B11 inactivation also conferred (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold> resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5G,H</xref>). Altogether, these data establish that HSD17B11 is critical in multiple cell lines for (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold> cytotoxic activity, and suggest that (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold> behaves as an HSD17B11-bioactivated prodrug. In addition, the acute toxicity of (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold> towards osteosarcoma cell lines suggests that DACs could be developed into a targeted anticancer therapy, but this would need to be further investigated, especially in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Dialkynylketones are protein-reactive species</title><p>We next investigated the downstream mechanism of cytotoxic action of the DAC (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3.</bold> The C17 carbinol center of androstan-3-alpha,17-beta-diol, which is naturally oxidized by HSD17B11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brereton et al., 2001</xref>), has the same spatial orientation as the (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold> carbinol when its lipidic chain is superimposed with the C13(C18) side of the steroid skeleton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This suggested that HSD17B11 enantiospecifically recognizes and oxidizes (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold> into a “dialkynylketone” <bold>7</bold> (DACone), a diynone that could be the cytotoxic species. However, when the DACone <bold>7</bold> was previously synthesized and tested, no cytotoxic activity was found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Listunov et al., 2015a</xref>). Given the high in vitro electrophilic reactivity of ynones as Michael acceptors of thiols and amines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Worch et al., 2021</xref>), we considered that medium components such as serum albumin may rapidly react with and inactivate DACones. To test this, we synthesized the DACone <bold>7</bold>, as well as a homologue with a shorter alkyl chain <bold>8,</bold> and treated U2OS cells in a protein-free medium (PBS containing CaCl<sub>2</sub> and MgCl<sub>2</sub> to maintain cellular adhesion). Both the DACones <bold>7</bold> and <bold>8</bold> were indeed cytotoxic in the absence of serum, with <bold>8</bold> (short chain) being even more active than (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). While the cytotoxicity of (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold> was strongly reduced by inactivation of HSD17B11, the cytotoxicity of the DACones <bold>7</bold> and <bold>8</bold> was not affected, supporting the notion that the DACones are the cytotoxic products generated from DACs by HSD17B11.</p><p>To further analyze the interaction between DACones and proteins, we synthesized ‘clickable’ analogues, that is bearing a terminal C≡CH tag, for each DAC enantiomer ((<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>9</bold> and (<italic>R</italic>)–<bold>9</bold>), and for long and short DACones (<bold>10</bold> and <bold>11</bold>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), and used them to monitor the formation of covalent bonds between DACones and serum proteins by copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC ‘click chemistry’, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tornøe et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rostovtsev et al., 2002</xref>]). The clickable DACone <bold>10</bold>, or clickable DAC (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>9</bold> as control, were incubated with fetal bovine serum (FBS) or purified bovine serum albumin (BSA), followed by CuAAC-mediated ligation of an AlexaFluor647-azido fluorophore to the free C≡CH tag. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and scanned for fluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Speers and Cravatt, 2004</xref>). Covalent adducts were formed on BSA with DACone <bold>10</bold> but not with (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>9</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Moreover, the DACone <bold>10</bold> also reacted with several other model proteins, including the bovine beta-lactoglobuline (BLG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Using BSA and BLG, we established that DACone adducts are produced only when using the clickable DACones <bold>10</bold> or <bold>11</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), suggesting that the terminal triple bond of the DACone pharmacophore is modified or masked after reaction. Finally, we could recapitulate the activation of (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>9</bold>, but not of (<italic>R</italic>)–<bold>9</bold>, into protein-reactive species by immunopurified WT HSD17B11, but not by the S172L mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), supporting an enantiospecific bioactivation of (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>9</bold> into the BLG-reactive DACone <bold>10</bold> by HSD17B11. Considering that HSD17B11 known activity is the NAD+-dependent oxidation of a secondary carbinol into a ketone and that the only hydroxyl group on (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold> is the one occurring in the dialkynylcarbinol pharmacophore, this experiment strongly supports the notion that HSD17B11 enantiospecifically oxidizes (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold> into the DACone <bold>7</bold>, which immediately reacts with nearby proteins, including HSD17B11-GFP itself as observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>. This high level of reactivity unfortunately precludes isolating the HSD17B11-produced DACones. To understand the basis for this enantiospecific bioactivation, we used AlphaFold2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Evans et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mirdita et al., 2021</xref>) to generate a structural model of HSD17B11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and performed molecular docking of (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold> and (<italic>R</italic>)–<bold>3</bold> into its catalytic core. Both (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold> and (<italic>R</italic>)–<bold>3</bold> docked into the catalytic cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>), but (<italic>R</italic>)–<bold>3</bold> had a lower computed affinity than (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold> (155 nM vs 15 nM) and only (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold> had its hydroxyl group properly positioned to engage hydrogen bonds with the S172 and Y185 catalytic amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D, E</xref>), which is critical for further carbinol oxidation via hydride transfer to NAD+ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Filling et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gao et al., 2021</xref>). Combining docking of (<italic>S</italic>)- and (<italic>R</italic>)–<bold>3</bold> on AlphaFold2 models of the 12 other human 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSDs) SDRs, with filtering to select the most stringent interactions, was used to identify other SDRs that might be able to bioactivate (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2F</xref>). This filtering revealed that, beyond HSD17B11, (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold> also docked onto the catalytic domains of only two 17β-HSDs, HSD17B13 and HSD17B3, while (<italic>R</italic>)–<bold>3</bold> docked onto two different 17β-HSDs, HSD17B9 and HSD17B6. HSD17B3 (aka EDH17B3 or SDR12C2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Persson et al., 2009</xref>]) is a reductive SDR involved in testosterone biosynthesisso it was not tested further. In contrast, since HSD17B13 (aka SCDR9 or SDR16C3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Persson et al., 2009</xref>]), whose expression is restricted to the liver, is an oxidative SDR, the closest homologue of HSD17B11 and is also localized at the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Horiguchi et al., 2008b</xref>), we tested whether it could complement U2OS KO for HSD17B11. This revealed that HSD17B13 is also able to bioactivate (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold> into cytotoxic compounds, albeit in a less efficient manner as compared to HSD17B11 (IC<sub>50</sub> of 30 nM <italic>vs</italic> 12 nM for HSD17B11 with similar complementation levels, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2G, H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Reaction of DACones with proteins</title><p>To further decipher the reaction of DACones with proteins, we used direct-infusion mass spectrometry to analyze BLG modified with the clickable DACone <bold>10</bold>. Purified BLG contains two isoforms (A and B, differing by 86.0 Da) and, when incubated with DACone, both BLG isoforms were completely modified with the formation of one or two adducts of ~+242 Da (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), which corresponds to the mass of the clickable DACone <bold>10</bold>. Monitoring the absorbance spectra of modified BLG revealed that BLG gains an absorption band at ~323 nm upon modification by DACone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Using this, we confirmed that both BLG and BSA are modified by the DACones <bold>7</bold> and <bold>8</bold> or their clickable analogues <bold>10</bold> and <bold>11</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>).

Next, we assessed the selectivity of DACones towards amino acid residues in the whole proteome in an unbiased fashion. For this purpose, we incubated the DACones <bold>10</bold> and <bold>11</bold> with U2OS total cell extracts in PBS. We then used residue-specific chemoproteomics with isotopically labeled desthiobiotin azide (isoDTB) tags (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Backus et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Weerapana et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zanon et al., 2020</xref>) coupled to a novel MSFragger-based FragPipe computational platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zanon et al., 2021</xref>) to detect the modified amino acids on the enriched peptides. This revealed that both DACones reacted with cysteine and lysine side chains, with the expected modification being detected ( + 729.4498/ + 723.4408 Da (Heavy/Light) for DACone <bold>10</bold>, + 631.3404/ + 625.3332 Da (Heavy/Light) for DACone <bold>11</bold>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref><bold>,</bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D, E, F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A, B</xref>). We also detected many unmodified peptides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1D, E</xref>), most of them with at least one missed lysine trypsin cleavage site (~92% of sequences), suggesting that these were still modified during digest and the modification lost during the subsequent workflow, potentially during the final trifluoroacetic acid elution (0.1%, pH~2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zanon et al., 2021</xref>]). We cannot fully exclude that other amino acids were also modified by the probe to some degree and that this modification was also lost during the workflow, but this data points to the fact that lysines and cysteines are the main modification sites. We next confirmed the reactivity of DACones with cysteine and lysine side chains by monitoring the appearance of the ~323 nm absorbance band after reaction of the DACone <bold>8</bold> with isolated amino acids, using <italic>N</italic>-acetylated versions to prevent reactions with the N-terminal amino group. At neutral pH, DACones only reacted with <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) but not with <italic>N<sub>α</sub></italic>-acetyl-L-lysine (NAK) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>, left spectrum), whereas at higher pH they reacted with both NAC and NAK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>, right spectrum), in agreement with the nucleophilic reactivity of the non-protonated <italic>ε−</italic>NH<sub>2</sub> group of the lysine chain. No reaction was observed with <italic>N</italic>-acetyl glycine (NAG), supporting that the reaction involves the side chain. By monitoring the adducts absorbance, we confirmed that the DACone <bold>8</bold>-NAK linkage is progressively lost when incubated in 0.1% TFA (38% reduction after 1 h incubation), while the DACone <bold>8</bold>-NAC linkage remains unaffected in these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H, I</xref>). These data suggest that the reactivity with lysine side chains is underestimated by our isoDTB-ABPP experiment due to preferential loss of the lysine-DACone species. The reaction with lysine side chains is compatible with the <italic>pK<sub>a</sub></italic> value for the lysine ε-amino group that can be as low as ~5 in hydrophobic domains in proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Isom et al., 2011</xref>). Accordingly, analysis of the sequence context of the amino acids identified as modified by the DACone <bold>10</bold> revealed an enrichment of hydrophobic amino acids around the modified lysines, which was not observed for the modified cysteines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), we characterized the products of the reaction of the short DACone <bold>8</bold> with NAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A, B</xref>) or NAK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C, D</xref>). This revealed that a covalent bond forms by addition of the thiol (NAC) or amino (NAK) group onto the terminal alkyne of the DACone head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4E</xref>). A similar reaction probably occurs with the cysteine and lysine residues of proteins, which is supported by their gain of a similar absorbance band upon treatment with DACone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). This additional absorption band can be accounted for by the donor-acceptor extension of π-electron delocalization in the enone adducts (S–CH=CH–C=O for NAC, N–CH=CH–C=O for NAK).

Forty-two proteins were significantly enriched more than 2-fold in the (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>9</bold> condition as compared to (<italic>R</italic>)–<bold>9</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>), with three proteins being enriched more than 60-fold: BRAT1, PLIN3, and PSMD2. In the MS/MS data, we could not detect peptides with the DACone-triazole-PEG-biotin modification, suggesting either that the biotin-carrying peptides remained associated with the beads or that the modification was lost during the LC-MS/MS workflow. We also attempted to adapt the isoDTB tag-based chemoproteomics workflow to identify the modified peptides directly from U2OS cells treated for 2 h with 2 µM (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>9</bold>. Under these conditions, we detected a few peptides modified on a cysteine by the expected adduct plus the mass of a dithiothreitol group (DTT, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4A</xref>), evocative of a DTT reaction with the internal alkyne functionality (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4B</xref> for the potential adduct structure, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lei et al., 2021</xref>), a type of adduct which was also detected in the isoDTB-based analysis presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, albeit in a smaller proportion (~30% of all quantified sites with DACone <bold>10</bold> &amp; <bold>11</bold>). This experiment supports that the reaction between DACones and N-acetyl-amino acids established in vitro also takes place in cells when DACones are produced by HSD17B11. The small number of modified sites identified in this experiment can be explained by the instability of the adduct on lysines during the isoDTB-ABPP workflow, the lower DAC concentration used for cell treatment (2 µM for (S)–<bold>9</bold>) as compared to the in vitro experiment (100 µM of <bold>10</bold> or <bold>11</bold>) and the need for bioactivation of (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>9</bold> in contrast to the constantly active <bold>10</bold> or <bold>11</bold>.</p><p>To validate that the three most highly enriched hits are modified in cells, we overexpressed BRAT1, PSMD2 and PLIN3 individually (in addition to TK1) as GFP fusions in U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>), and used GFP pull-down to determine whether they were modified by clickable DAC <bold>9</bold> in cells. These proteins were found robustly modified by (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>9</bold> but not by (<italic>R</italic>)–<bold>9</bold>, especially BRAT1 and PSMD2, while GFP alone was not modified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). The fact that only 42 proteins were found robustly and reproducibly enriched with (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>9</bold> over (<italic>R</italic>)–<bold>9</bold> in cells indicates a certain degree of selectivity for protein modification by DACones that could result from its production and reactivity being restricted to the vicinity of HSD17B11. In agreement, while the thiol group of reduced glutathione can be modified in vitro by DACones at pH7 with the formation of an adduct similar to the one with NAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A–C</xref>), suggesting that it could provide some protection against the reactivity of DACones in cells, the toxicity of (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold> was not significantly decreased by co-treatment with a cell-permeable glutathione or increased by a glutathione-S-transferase inhibitor (GSTi, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3D, E</xref>). These data suggest that DACones rapidly and selectively react with a specific set of proteins in the vicinity of HSD17B11 as shown for another in situ generated electrophile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Paxman et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Among the three main hits, PSMD2 drew our attention as an essential protein in HAP-1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blomen et al., 2015</xref>). PSMD2, also called Rpn1, is a critical non-catalytic subunit of the 19 S regulatory particle of the 26 S proteasome, a large complex responsible for the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of cellular proteins. PSMD2 is essential for 19 S assembly and for docking of ubiquitin, ubiquitin receptors and the deubiquitinase USP14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shi et al., 2016</xref>). Immunoprecipitation of endogenous PSMD2 from U2OS cells treated with clickable DAC confirmed that PSMD2 is covalently modified after treatment with the DAC (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>9</bold> but not with (R)–<bold>9</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Moreover, the clickable DACone <bold>10</bold> efficiently modified PSMD2 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Using the (S)-DAC-resistant HAP-1 clones A1 and A4 (expressing V16D and S172L HSD17B11 mutants, respectively), we also confirmed that the modification of cellular proteins by (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>9</bold>, including PSMD2, was dependent on HSD17B11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Our proteomics approach also revealed that, in addition to PSMD2, a cluster of proteins involved in protein quality control (PQC) was also modified by the DAC (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>9</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), including several protein disulfide isomerases (P4HB/PDIA1, PDIA6 and TMX1), thioredoxin reductases (TXNDC5 and TXNRD1) and protein chaperones (the ER-resident HSP70, HSPA5/GRP78/BiP; and HSP90AB1), the alteration of which likely also contributes to the DAC cytotoxic effect. Altogether, these data show that (<italic>S</italic>)-DACs are bioactivated by HSD7B11 into highly reactive DACones that covalently lipoxidize nearby proteins, including essential proteins involved in PQC such as PSMD2, a critical subunit of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS).</p><p>We then used click-based imaging to monitor the localization of DAC-modified proteins. (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>9</bold> gave a strong nuclear and cytoplasmic staining, the latter being evocative of ER and mitochondrial membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In agreement, we observed a co-occurrence of (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>9</bold>-click staining with markers of ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>) and mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B, C</xref>). The lack of staining in cells treated with the inactive (<italic>R</italic>)–<bold>9</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) supported that the staining corresponds to DAC-modified proteins. No staining was observed with (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold>, supporting that the -C≡CH group of the dialkynylcarbinol head is modified after bioactivation and subsequent reaction with proteins (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Since GFP-BRAT1 is the protein that was the most robustly modified by DACs in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>), we pre-extracted soluble proteins with mild nonionic detergent to assess GFP-BRAT1 association to subcellular compartments. Under these conditions, most GFP-BRAT1 was removed by the pre-extraction in untreated cells, as expected for a soluble protein, while it was retained to subcellular compartments evocative of ER and nucleus after treatment with (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). These data suggest that protein lipoxidation by bioactivated DACs results, at least for some of them, into their relocalization to cellular membranes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>(<italic>S</italic>)-DACs trigger ER-stress, inhibition of ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and apoptosis.</title><p>In agreement with (<italic>S</italic>)-DAC impairing PQC, we observed that treatment of cells by (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold> triggers ER swelling as shown by the appearance of a large cytoplasmic vacuole between 4 and 8 h of treatment that preceded cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The use of a GFP variant targeted and retained into the ER confirmed that these vacuoles derived from this compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), while a mCherry protein addressed to mitochondria in the same cells showed that (<italic>S</italic>)-DAC treatment concomitantly triggered mitochondrial fission, a hallmark of cell stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). ER swelling is a feature of ER-stress, which can result from the accumulation of unfolded proteins within the ER and can be triggered by various defects of PQC such as inhibition of the UPS, as seen with the UPS inhibitor MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In agreement with (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold> cytotoxicity being mediated by the accumulation of unfolded proteins, vacuolization and cell death induced by (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold> could be blocked by inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide (CHX, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold> also triggered a strong accumulation of the chaperone HSP70 and of the cell stress response protein p21, similarly to MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) or PSMD2 depletion using siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). It is noteworthy that ER-stress itself can trigger UPS inhibition, likely through consuming free ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Menéndez-Benito et al., 2005</xref>). In agreement with this hypothesis, we observed that (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold> induces the accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), a hallmark of UPS inhibition, and blocked the degradation of an artificial substrate of the UPS system in a manner similar to MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>). Similarly to MG132, (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold> also blocked the assembly of the protein 53BP1 into foci at sites of DNA double-strand breaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>), a process that depends on the local de novo DNA damage-induced ubiquitination of histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mailand et al., 2007</xref>), thereby confirming depletion of free ubiquitin by treatment with (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold>. It is noteworthy that (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold> treatment itself did not induce DNA damage nor blocked ATM activation, an important component of the DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER activates three ER-resident transmembrane signal transducers: the IRE1α kinase/endoribonuclease, the PERK kinase and the ATF6 transcription factor, which represent the three arms of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). The UPR aims at restoring ER protein homeostasis by reducing the influx of proteins into the ER and by increasing the activity of ER protein quality control mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Preissler and Ron, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Szegezdi et al., 2006</xref>). IRE1α activation is marked by its autophosphorylation on S724 and the processing of the XBP-1 mRNA resulting in the production of the XBP1-s transcription factor. PERK activation is marked by its autophosphorylation on T980 and the phosphorylation of eIF2α S51, which reduces translation initiation and triggers the accumulation of the ATF4 transcription factor. ATF6 activation relies on its cleavage which releases a short-lived transcriptionally active fragment. Persistent UPR activation can promote apoptosis in a JNK-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Szegezdi et al., 2006</xref>). In agreement with (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold> triggering unfolded proteins accumulation and UPR activation, we observed that treatment with (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold> induced the activation of the three UPR pathways with the rapid phosphorylation of IRE1α (S724), PERK (T980) and eIF2α (S51), a strong decrease of full-length ATF6, preceding the accumulation of cytoplasmic HSP70 and the transient accumulation of XBP-1s and ATF4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Of note, treatment with inhibitors of either IRE1α endoribonuclease, IRE1α kinase or PERK did not modify the toxicity of (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold>, suggesting that the ER stress induced by (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold> is too acute to be resolved in a timely manner by the UPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). In contrast, JNK inhibition provided a small degree of resistance to (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold> (IC<sub>50</sub> shift from 33 to 70 nM), suggesting a contribution of the JNK pathway to cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Ultimately, (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold> treatment resulted in apoptosis, as marked by PARP-1 cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), in a caspase inhibitor (z-VAD-fmk)-sensitive manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Caspase inhibition blocked cell death but not the vacuolization process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Altogether, these results show that (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold>, once bioactivated by HSD17B11, covalently modifies multiple proteins including critical components of the PQC, resulting in ER-stress, activation of the UPR and inhibition of the UPS, ultimately leading to apoptotic cell death.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title><bold>DAC</bold> (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold> triggers ER-stress, ubiquitin-proteasome system inhibition and apoptosis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) U2OS stably co-expressing a GFP variant addressed and retained in the endoplasmic reticulum were treated with 1 µM (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold> and monitored by live imaging.

This means that this mechanism of prodrug activation could be exploited to develop an extensive range of new drugs and compounds to kill cells or organisms expressing specific SDRs with high selectivity. SDRs use NAD(H) or NADP(H) cofactors to perform oxidoreductase, lyase or isomerase activities on a large variety of substrates including steroids, retinoic acids, lipids, polyols, sugars, nucleotides and xenobiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kavanagh et al., 2008</xref>). In vitro, SDR enzymes can frequently catalyze both oxidation and reduction, depending on the supplied co-factor. In cells, however, they show directionality, which depends on their sub-cellular localization and cofactor availability. We first determined whether other SDRs with the proper <italic>in cellulo</italic> directional polarity could activate other secondary alkynylcarbinol-containing compounds into cytotoxic species. We found that the AAC (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>4</bold> (with a terminal C=CH<sub>2</sub> group, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), despite its activity being strongly reduced in DAC-resistant clone A4 (~17-fold, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>), still retained some cytotoxicity (IC<sub>50</sub> ~2.6 µM) on these cells, possibly through bioactivation by a second dehydrogenase. To identify such a dehydrogenase, EMS was used to mutagenize the DACR clone #A4 once again. This mutagenized population was selected with a lethal concentration of 10 µM (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>4</bold> and over twenty resistant clones (AACR clones) were isolated. Among those, we selected seven, which all showed similar increased resistance to (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>4</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), and submitted them to RNA-seq analysis.

Introduction of a second secondary carbinol function in the AAC structure, generating the AlkenylAlkynylDiCarbinol <bold>12</bold> (AADC), reduced its bioactivation by HSD17B11, while leaving intact its RDH11-dependent activation and thereby generating a new prodrug equally bioactivated by HSD17B11 and RDH11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). As mixtures of diastereoisomers were used for this experiment, lower IC<sub>50</sub> can be expected with selected AADC enantiomers, especially with the external carbinol center in the RDH11-preferred (<italic>S</italic>) configuration.</p><p>Another SDR, HPGD, also called 15-PGDH, PGDH1 or SDR36C1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Persson et al., 2009</xref>), is responsible for the inactivation of prostaglandins through oxidation of the (<italic>S</italic>)-C-15 carbinol center in a NAD+-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tai et al., 2006</xref>). HPGD expression is tissue-restricted (prostate and bladder) and null in U2OS cells (<italic>Broad Institute Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia</italic> RNA-seq dataset). To determine whether this SDR could also bioactivate potential prodrugs, we used U2OS inactivated for HSD17B11 and overexpressing GFP alone or HPGD-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>), and screened a small collection of lipidic alkynylcarbinols.

Thus, this mechanism of action is likely a general property of SDRs that could be exploited to develop a wide range of tailored prodrugs to cause selective cytotoxicity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study highlights the strengths of the genomic approach implemented here, relying on chemical mutagenesis of human haploid cells, selection with a toxic concentration and the use of RNA-seq to identify simultaneously changes in expression levels and mutations that could confer resistance to cytotoxic drugs. RNA-seq analysis of only four DAC (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold>-resistant clones was sufficient to identify HSD17B11 as the DAC (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold>-activating enzyme. Three clones carried non-sense mutations, including one on a key catalytic residue (S172, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gao et al., 2021</xref>]), while the other ones showed lack of HSD17B11 expression. The strength of the approach is also reminiscent of the use of chemical mutagenesis. Indeed, while selection of drug-resistant clones based on the appearance of spontaneous mutations is frequently used in bacteria to identify the mechanism of action of small molecules, exploiting their high rate of mutations, human cells are less prone to spontaneous mutations. In human cells, screens based on spontaneous mutations most frequently use DNA repair (mismatch)-deficient cells, such as HCT-116, to increase the mutation rate (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Girdler et al., 2008</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wacker et al., 2012</xref>). However, spontaneous mutations can be diverse in nature and in that regard, the use of chemical mutagenesis with ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), in addition to increasing the rate of resistant clones formation, simplifies the identification of the mutations of interest. Indeed, EMS does not induce deletions or insertion, but principally single nucleotide changes, most frequently transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Forment et al., 2017</xref>) which can be selected during the analysis, restricting the number of false positives. Another strength of this approach is the possibility to readily perform multiple rounds of screening to decipher primary and secondary mechanisms of action for a drug. Here, the DAC (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>3</bold>-resistant clones could be mutagenized and selected a second time to identify a second SDR, RDH11, as the AAC (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>4</bold>-bioactivating enzyme. It is noteworthy that the AAC (<italic>S</italic>)–<bold>4</bold> still shows some remaining toxicity on the DAC + AAC-resistant clones (HSD17B11 mutation +RDH11 mutation), which indicates that a third round of mutagenesis, selection and RNA-seq would most likely lead to identify another dehydrogenase, probably in the SDR superfamily, as responsible for the remaining bioactivation. This also illustrates how alkynylcarbinols could constitute a rich reservoir of SDR-specific prodrugs, whose selectivity can be improved through parallel structure-activity relationship studies. Finally, this approach is remarkably easier and cheaper to implement than loss of function CRIPSR/Cas9 screens and can lead to directly identify essential genes as mediators of drug cytotoxic effect. We recently exemplified this by using this approach to directly identify the DNA topoisomerase II alpha (coded by the essential <italic>TOP2A</italic> gene) as the main driver of the cytotoxic effects of CX-5461, a G-quadruplex ligand and inhibitor of RNA polymerase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bossaert et al., 2021</xref>). The identified non-sense mutations on <italic>TOP2A</italic> dissociate its essential function from its function in generating DNA double-strand breaks upon G-quadruplex stabilization by CX-5461.</p><p>Through this powerful framework, our study reveals the original mode of action of a large family of natural and synthetic cytotoxic lipids characterized by a chiral terminal functional alkynylcarbinol pharmacophore. We show that these molecules are oxidized in an enantiospecific manner by a specific SDR, HSD17B11, converting them into an alkynylketone species (ynones). Oxidation of DACs produces dialkynylketones (DACones) that proved to be highly protein-reactive electrophiles, forming <italic>Michael</italic> adducts with cysteines and lysines. Consequently, bioactivated DACs modify several proteins in cells, resulting in their lipoxidation by a C17 lipidic chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Lipoxidation of a protein can modify its solubility, folding, interactions, activity and/or localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Viedma-Poyatos et al., 2021</xref>). In agreement, DAC treatment triggers the association of BRAT1, one of the most DAC-modified proteins, to ER and nuclear membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Covalent modification of BRAT1 by the natural diterpene curcusone D was recently reported and resulted in BRAT1 degradation and reduced DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cui et al., 2021</xref>). Regarding (<italic>S</italic>)-DAC, in addition to BRAT1, several proteins involved in mechanisms of PQC are also lipoxidized. Considering that lipoxidation of a single protein can inhibit the UPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shringarpure et al., 2000</xref>), the simultaneous modification of several critical actors of PQC is likely to result in an acute proteotoxic stress. In agreement with the general effects of protein lipoxidation, DAC treatment triggers ER-stress and inhibition of the UPS (each one fueling the other, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Menéndez-Benito et al., 2005</xref>]). This leads to the early activation of the three UPR pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). In addition to unfolded proteins accumulation, UPR activation could also be the result of HSPA5/GRP78/BiP lipoxidation and/or tethering of multiple proteins to ER membranes. Finally, (<italic>S</italic>)-DACs also quickly induce mitochondrial fission and caspase-dependent apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> for a graphical abstract). Hundreds of cytotoxic natural compounds have one or several alkynylcarbinol motifs, therefore the mechanism of action identified here could be shared in its principles by these molecules. This is supported by the fact that HSD17B11 was recently identified as mediating the toxicity of the natural compound dehydrofalcarindiol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grant et al., 2020</xref>), produced in several plants. It is also noteworthy that two other related lipidic natural products, falcarinol and callyspongynic acid, isolated respectively from several <italic>Apiaceae</italic> plant species and the marine sponge <italic>Callyspongia truncata</italic>, have been identified as covalently binding to cellular proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Heydenreuter et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nickel et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that they could also be bioactivated into protein-reactive species by a yet unidentified mechanism. Consequently, we propose that alkynylcarbinol-containing natural molecules provide a defense mechanism through bioactivation by specific SDRs in the body of predators, pathogens or parasites. In agreement, fulvindione, the AAC-oxidized form of the cytotoxic <italic>Haliclona fulva</italic>-produced fulvinol, was found in the body of the dorid nudibranch <italic>Peltodoris atromaculata</italic> feeding on <italic>Haliclona</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ciavatta et al., 2014</xref>). The presence of multiple alkynylcarbinol motifs in some of these natural compounds could provide modular pro-cytotoxic agents bioactivable by SDRs in different organisms. The fact that HSD17B11 mediates the toxicity of several natural compounds of unrelated origins questions the reasons for it being the common bioactivating enzyme of these prodrugs. The literature on HSD17B11 is currently limited. It was shown in vitro to promote androgen inactivation by converting the potent androstan-3-alpha,17-beta-diol into a weaker androgen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brereton et al., 2001</xref>). In human, the HSD17B11 variant (rs9991501; Arg283Gln) was found associated with lean body mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zillikens et al., 2017</xref>), supporting that its activity controls muscle physiology, a process regulated by androgens. However, which HSD17B11-generated metabolites are involved and how the Arg283Gln variant impacts on HSD17B11 activity is currently unknown. HSD17B11 is nearly ubiquitously expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brereton et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chai et al., 2003</xref>), but is also overexpressed in some human malignancies, including advanced prostate cancer and non-small cell lung cancer cell lines, as compared to normal tissues or cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grundner-Culemann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nakamura et al., 2009</xref>). However, the potential role for HSD17B11 in cancer progression remains to be established. The HSD17B11-bioactivated clickable prodrugs described here could represent valuable tools to investigate HSD17B11 enzymatic activity in tissues through imaging and to decipher its physiological and therapeutic relevance.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model depicting the stereospecific bioactivation of alkynylcarbinol-containing compounds by specific SDRs into cytotoxic protein-reactive species.</title><p>The protein reactive species generated upon bioactivation modify several proteins including the essential 26 S proteasome subunit PSMD2, thereby triggering Ub-proteasome system (UPS) inhibition, ER-stress, activation of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) and cell death mediated by apoptosis.

We also show here that multiple human cell lines derived from osteosarcoma, a rare pediatric cancer, were particularly sensitive to (<italic>S</italic>)-DACs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4C</xref>), suggesting that HSD17B11- and more generally SDR-bioactivable prodrugs could find anticancer applications, especially considering that 71 different SDRs are found in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bray et al., 2009</xref>).

Exploring these potential applications in vivo will be the focus of future studies.</p><p>Of note, another family of diyne molecules, the enediynes, are already used in anticancer treatments in particular its best known representative, calicheamicin-gamma1 (cali), extracted from the soil bacteria <italic>Micromonospora echinospora</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2002</xref>). Cali shows a cytotoxic activity in the picomolar range that is exploited by two anticancer treatments, gemtuzumab ozogamicine (Mylotarg) and inotuzumab ozogamicin (Besponsa), consisting respectively of a CD33-cali or CD22-cali antibody-drug conjugates used for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Williams et al., 2019</xref>). In the enediyne motif, the equivalent position of the DAC carbinol unit &gt;CHOH is replaced by an ethylene unit -CH=CH-. Cali is also a prodrug which is activated by the intracellular reducing environment triggering the reduction, mainly carried by cellular glutathione, of a trisulfide unit to a thiol group, initiating a cascade process by an intramolecular Michael addition leading to the DNA-damaging biradical species generated by Bergman cyclization. This, together with the binding of cali to the minor groove of DNA through its aryloligosaccharide moiety, allows the reaction of cali with both DNA strands by promoting hydrogen abstraction on the deoxyribose part of DNA, leading to cytotoxic DNA double-strand breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zein et al., 1988</xref>).</p><p>The SDR superfamily is one of the largest, with representatives in all known life forms, except viruses: 507 673 SDRs are currently identified in the Uniprot database (in 7546 species, Pfam ID: PF00106). A bioinformatic classification of SDRs has revealed that among the 314 SDR subfamilies identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kallberg et al., 2010</xref>), half are specific to bacteria. This offers the prospect of designing antibiotics with novel mechanisms of action. In addition, other oxidoreductases, especially among the Medium-Chain dehydrogenase/Reductase (MDR) superfamily, could in principle carry out similar oxidation of secondary alcohol-containing substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Persson et al., 2008</xref>), which could widen the field of application of our findings. Conversely, some carbonyl reductases, especially among the Aldo-Keto Reductase (AKR) superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Oppermann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Penning et al., 2021</xref>), could theoretically antagonize DACones cytotoxicity by reverting the reactive ketone into the corresponding alcohol, which could be further conjugated and eliminated. However, the fact that modulating glutathione levels or GST activity in cells only had a very small impact on (<italic>S</italic>)-DAC cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3D</xref><bold>,E</bold>) indicates that, once produced, DACones immediately react with nearby proteins which limits the activity of general detoxification mechanisms.</p><p>Finally, our findings extend the toolbox of protein-reactive warheads with the identification of the DACone motif as a potent reactive group toward the thiol and amino groups of the side chains of cysteine and lysine, respectively. This reaction is quantitative, without co-product and operating in aqueous buffer at room temperature, making it well suited for many applications. In our study, multiple proteins could be functionalized by a terminal alkyne motif using clickable DACone <bold>10</bold> or <bold>11</bold> and the resulting linkage was found to be highly stable at neutral pH, while a selective cleavage of the DACone-amine linkage was observed at acidic pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H</xref><bold>,I</bold>), a property that could be exploited.

The lysate was pre-cleared by incubation with 60 µL streptavidin-coupled magnetic beads (Dynabeads M-280, Thermo Fisher Scientific) 1 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. Then CuSO<sub>4</sub>, biotin-PEG-azido (PEG4 carboxamide-6-azidohexanyl biotin, B10184, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and sodium ascorbate were added to the pre-cleared lysate at 4 mM, 5 µM and 10 mM final concentration, respectively. The click-reaction was performed by incubation for 30 min at 20 °C in the dark with vigorous intermittent shaking and the free biotin was removed from the clicked extracts using PD MiniTrap G-25 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with IPD buffer. The extracts were then complemented to 600 µL with IPD buffer and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel with 60 µL of streptavidin-coupled magnetic beads (Dynabeads M-280, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The beads, corresponding to the proteins associated to (<italic>S</italic>)- or (<italic>R</italic>)–<bold>9</bold>, were then washed extensively with high-salt IPW buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 1 mM EDTA, 500 mM NaCl, 0.05% IGEPAL CA-630, HALT inhibitors cocktail), then with IPD buffer. For on-bead trypsic digestion, beads were washed twice with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer, and then suspended in 7 M urea and 25 mM DTT (Sigma-Aldrich). After 60 min under agitation (850 rpm) at room temperature, the samples were alkylated by incubation in 90 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich) during 30 min in the dark. Samples were then washed twice as described above and submitted to overnight proteolysis in ammonium bicarbonate buffer containing 1 μg of trypsin (Promega) per sample at 37 °C. The supernatants were collected, dried in speed-vac and resuspended with 2% acetonitrile and 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (Sigma-Aldrich), for mass spectrometry analysis. The resulting peptides were analyzed with a NanoLC (Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano system Thermo Scientific) coupled to a LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany). Raw MS files were processed with MaxQuant v1.5.2.8 software for database search with the Andromeda search engine and quantitative analysis. Data were searched against human entries in the Swissprot protein database. To perform relative quantification between proteins identified, we used the LFQ from the MaxQuant ‘protein group.txt’ output.

Your revised article has been evaluated by David Ron (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Summarizing the reviews and discussion, consensus was reached that your manuscript reported interesting findings that were, in large part, supported by the data. However, we feel that determining the chemical structure of the covalent adduct formed with nucleophilic amino acid side chains on representative protein targets is an important objective that should be experimentally addressed as part of the revision process. We also ask that you minimize the speculation on the therapeutic implications of the work, as this direction raises several additional questions for which data are lacking. This latter point can likely be addressed through appropriate changes to the text of the revised manuscript to better emphasize the intriguing fundamental research findings while toning down the speculation on drug development.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Demange et al., identify through a series of elegant experiments human oxidoreductase HSD17B11 as the major contributor to the bioactivation of dialkinylcarbinols (DACs) to a reactive carbonyl species. The identification of HSD17B11 as main target of the activation to the major reactive metabolite was achieved by using an EMS approach in the pseudo-haploid cell line HAP1 to mutate in a genome-wide manner and select clones that are resistant to treatment with the starting DAC. The wild-type line requires bioactivation to a cytotoxic carbonyl species and is sensitive to the cytotoxic agent. These bioactivated reactive, electronegative compounds modify lysine and cysteine side-chains of several proteins by a Michael addition reaction mechanism. This can induce an unfolded protein response (UPR), which in turn can lead to apoptotic cell death. HSD17B11 as well as the related enzymes hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase and retinol dehydrogenase 11, which also appear to be involved in this bioactivation step (although to a lesser degree), are members of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily, an evolutionarily conserved protein family found in all forms of life with about 80 members identified in the human genome. The study provides a plausible mechanism how a class of compounds containing dialkynylcarbinol motifs, most often found in natural products, exert their cytotoxic properties and accordingly this work provides significant information, of utility in the toxicology field.</p><p>Strengths: the undisputed strength (and beauty) of the manuscript is the chemical-genomic approach using a combination of biochemical and molecular resources, such as use of the pseudo-haploid cell line, the EMS mutational approach to identify the underlying oxidoreductase(s), the mass spectrometry work and chemical synthesis.</p><p>Weaknesses: Several open questions remain. Several parts of the paper appear overemphasized. In part, the underlying hypothesis (for example the explanation of 17beta HSDs as DAC dehydrogenase through the 17beta-hydroxy stereochemistry of the steroid D ring) appears farfetched: all secondary alcohol substrates should have a similar configuration and hence any oxidoreductase involved could be a candidate for the observed DAC oxidation. Moreover, HPGD and RDH11 do not have steroid DH activity. Conversely, other HSD17beta DHs could possibly carry out the reaction (which they apparently do not). Moreover, and this speaks in favour of the importance of the paper, other classes of oxidoreductases such as aldo-keto reductases (AKR) or especially medium-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (MDR) could in principle carry out the observed reaction, potentially widening significantly the target field for a series of related DAC activating enzymes.</p><p>More importantly, a part of the postulated importance in developing DACs as possible cancer therapeutics has been postulated based on osteosarcoma cell line data. HSD17B11 is certainly very widely expressed including liver and blood cells. For sure, the DAC activation would take place in these tissues by HSD17B11 (and HPGD, RDH11). It would be interesting to learn more about in vivo toxicology of the DACs, I would expect a high degree of hepatotoxicity and suppression of white blood cell formation. A major concern for me is the apparent lack of GSH conjugation or other defense mechanisms (such as MDR enzymes) against the reactive carbonyl species. The reactive alkynyl-ketones should have electronegative centers that would be prime targets for glutathione-S- conjugation or even non-enzymatic reactions with GSH. Has anything like that been observed for the reactive carbonyls? The authors show it for N-acetyl cycteine for example, so it could work with GSH as well. Is there a possibility for enzymatic reduction of the yne-triple bonds?</p><p>Finally, it would be of interest to dissect the UPR further (beyond IRE1a phosphorylation). It would be of high interest to do so and look for the other elements as well- such as XBP splicing, PERK activation, eiF2a phosphorylation, ATF expression etc. Excellent tool compounds are available to probe this important phenotypic response further, including PERK and IRE1a inhibitors (targeting the nucleotidase and the kinase domains).</p><p>The most significant open questions/points have been already highlighted in the Public review section. Some of the &quot;easy to do&quot; experiments such as GSH adducts or mining the proteomic data for additional adducts would be nice to see (or discuss properly). It would be good to include what is known regards HSD17B11 in humans, for example the genomic data in lean mass/obesity etc. In addition, I think it would also be appropriate to highlight and discuss some of the concepts identified in the reviews in the carbonyl reductase/dehydrogenase/toxicology field such as –</p><p>Oppermann U.

They first performed a genetic screen to isolate cell clones that are resistant to toxic alkynylcarbinols and found that resistant mutations frequently occur on a member of SDR named HSD17B11. They then demonstrated that the catalytic activity of HSD17B11 is critical in mediating the toxicity of alkynylcarbinols and cells that are lacking the expression of this SDR are more resistant. They further synthesized different bioorthogonal analogues of alkynylcarbinols and their corresponding control compounds to show the resulting ketone species could covalently label proteins on their nucleophilic cysteines both in vitro and in living cells. By performing chemical proteomics experiments, they identified a list of proteins that are modified by the activated alkynylcarbinols, one of which is involved in the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway. Another interesting aspect of this work is that they found the proteins that are modified by these lipidic alkynylcarbinols derivatives tend to show different subcellular localizations. They finally demonstrated in proof-of-concept that the alkynylcarbinols can serve as potential prodrugs which are activated by SDR members and kill cancer cells.</p><p>Strength:</p><p>The work is super rich in content and integrates an impressive list of different techniques to confirm each hypothesis that the authors made along the way. It mechanistically interprets the pathway how the alkynylcarbinols get activated in cells and how the resulting electrophilic species react covalently with proteins and changed their physical/chemical properties. The work proposes a new prodrug strategy to selectively kill cancers.</p><p>Weakness:</p><p>With clear indication of covalent modifications of proteins by these activated alkynylcarbinols, the authors did not identify the key targets that are responsible for the observed cytotoxicity. The site-specific chemical proteomics were only implemented to survey the amino acid preference of the activated alkynylcarbinols, however, they were not used to pinpoint specific residue anchors when the compounds were added into cells. Despite that they showed cells underwent apoptosis with sign of ER-stress and inhibition of UPS, the targets or pathways that mediate the cytotoxicity of the electrophilic species are still not clear from the current study.</p><p>1. With so many techniques implemented and so much data acquired, I would suggest authors to trim certain data to improve the overall readability of the manuscript. For example, the last part of RDH11 and HPGD seemed to not absolutely necessary to me and distracted the key finding of HSD17B11. In addition, too many technical details are put into the results session which make the manuscript a bit hard to read and follow.</p><p>2. Not very clear to me why the authors used the isotopically labeled isoDTB for evaluating the site-specific reaction preferences, but when it came to identify the cellular targets, they put the isoDTB aside and instead just used label-free quantification at the protein level. Ideally, isoDTB would work perfectly with their alkynyl probes to identify and quantify critical sites of modifications and provide a better picture of target landscape of these activated alkynylcarbinols.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In the manuscript &quot;SDR enzymes oxidize specific lipidic alkynylcarbinols into cytotoxic 2 protein-reactive species,&quot; the authors use functional genomics and chemoproteomics to elucidate mode of action of cytotoxic dialkynylcarbinol (DAC) containing lipids. They discovered that the DAC lipids are bioactivated in an enantiospecific manner by members of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family of enzymes. Using this information, the authors design new SDR-bioactivated DAC lipids as a more general prodrug strategy. The studies are interesting and an impressive array of supporting data are provided. However, direct evidence for the bioactivation mechanism in cells are lacking and this gap should be addressed.</p><p>A major critique is the lack of direct evidence for oxidation of alkynylcarbinols to the bioactivated alkynylketone lipids by HSD17B11 or other SDR enzymes in cells. This data is key for supporting the prodrug mode of action of the cytotoxic alkynylcarbinol lipids proposed by the authors. The chemoproteomic evaluation of (S)-9 DAC treated cells only provided protein-level identifications. The inclusion of site of binding chemoproteomic data from cellular studies, which should reveal peptide-lipid adducts matching structures proposed by authors in Figure 2i, is important for supporting SDR-mediated production of reactive acetylenic lipids in cells as proposed by the authors. The authors could also consider the use of metabolomics to identify the alkynylketone lipid products produced in (S)-9 DAC treated cells as direct evidence for the bioactivation.</p><p>Additional comments to consider:</p><p>1. The authors use the HSD17B11 WT and S172L mutant comparison as support for catalytic function of this enzyme in (S)-DAC cytotoxicity. While these results are clear, the author do not provide direct evidence for disruption of HSD17B11catalytic activity. For example, can the author demonstrate that HSD17B11 S172L lysates are catalytically deficient compared with WT counterparts? What are the effects of this mutation on androsterone levels in this overexpression system? Finally, the inclusion of an additional plasmid coding for a mutation outside of the catalytic domain in the complementation assay is a recommended control given the protein instability issues of from mutations.</p><p>2. To support the major critique above, the authors should show by LC-MS or NMR that purified HSD17B11 incubated with (S)-9 under the appropriate biochemical assay conditions produces the dialkynylketone (DACone) 10 product. The authors should compare with the (R)-9 substrate to demonstrate enantio-selectivity. These data should be included to support the claims associated with Figure 2F.</p><p>3. Authors should show western blots for HSD17B11 detection in Figure 2F since they report issues with production of the full length S172L protein due to protein instability.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73913.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summarizing the reviews and discussion, consensus was reached that your manuscript reported interesting findings that were, in large part, supported by the data. However, we feel that determining the chemical structure of the covalent adduct formed with nucleophilic amino acid side chains on representative protein targets is an important objective that should be experimentally addressed as part of the revision process. We also ask that you minimize the speculation on the therapeutic implications of the work, as this direction raises several additional questions for which data are lacking. This latter point can likely be addressed through appropriate changes to the text of the revised manuscript to better emphasize the intriguing fundamental research findings while toning down the speculation on drug development.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the therapeutic implications: In the revised version, we now restrict to the minimum the speculations about the therapeutic implications of our work. We have deleted and tuned down several sentences, for example:</p><p>“In addition, the acute toxicity of (S)-3 towards osteosarcoma cell lines indicates that DACs could be developed into a targeted anti-cancer therapy.” was rephrased to “In addition, the acute toxicity of (S)-3 towards osteosarcoma cell lines suggests that DACs could be developed into a targeted anti-cancer therapy, but this would need to be further investigated, especially in vivo.”</p><p>Regarding the identification of the sites of modification by DACs in cells: While we think that it is the modification of multiple proteins by DACs which is the cause of cell death, we were also very keen, much like the reviewers, to identify the site of modifications by DACs in cells, mainly to be able later to evolve DACs into more selective inhibitors bioactivated by HSD17B11.</p><p>To achieve this, once we had identified in vitro the mass of the adducts and the structure of the linkage by NMR (Figure 2G, Figure 2—figure supplement 4), we analyzed again our MS/MS data from our streptavidin-based pull-down of DAC-modified proteins. However, no modified peptides were identified through this approach, which could indicate (1) that they remained associated on the magnetic streptavidin beads during the on-beads digestion, or (2) that the modification was lost during the framework, including the final step in which the peptides are resuspended in an acidic solution containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) or (3) that the adduct is further modified in cells giving MWs different from the expected one.</p><p>Therefore, we applied the isoDTB-based workflow developed by Stephan Hacker’s lab to identify the adducts from DAC-treated cells. In this approach, the masses of the different adducts are determined in an unbiased manner by a Fragpipe MSFragger Open search and then quantified. For this experiment, we collected large amounts of extracts from U2OS cells treated for 2 h with 2 µM clickable DAC (<italic>S</italic>)-9 and performed the analysis.</p><p>Using this approach, some peptides were reproducibly identified as modified by (<italic>S</italic>)-DAC in cells (Supplementary File 4A). The observed adducts had a higher mass than expected (+154.0122), the excess in mass corresponding to the addition of a dithiothreitol (DTT) molecule (see Supplementary File 4B for the proposed adduct structure). Upon additional inspection, such adducts were also detected in the in vitro DACone treatment experiments (30% of the quantified sites with the DACones 10 and 11). The higher proportion of modification by DTT might result from the higher DTT:peptide ratio in this experiment resulting from the smaller number of peptides being retained in this experiment. The small number of quantified peptides likely results from the lower concentrations of DAC (S)-9 that could be used for the experiments on cells (2 µM of (S)-9) as compared to the in vitro experiments (100 µM of DACone 10 or 11) and from the final acidic elution (0.1% TFA pH~2.1) which promotes the cleavage of the linkage formed between DACone and amine groups (see Figure 2—figure supplement 1H,I). Nevertheless, we were in this way able to further corroborate that the activation of (<italic>S</italic>)-9 in cells leads to the expected reactivity caused by oxidation to the DACone.</p><p>Our revised manuscript now incorporates these novel data supporting that DACones are produced from (<italic>S</italic>)-DAC in cells, resulting in the lipoxidation of a set of proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Demange et al., identify through a series of elegant experiments human oxidoreductase HSD17B11 as the major contributor to the bioactivation of dialkinylcarbinols (DACs) to a reactive carbonyl species. The identification of HSD17B11 as main target of the activation to the major reactive metabolite was achieved by using an EMS approach in the pseudo-haploid cell line HAP1 to mutate in a genome-wide manner and select clones that are resistant to treatment with the starting DAC. The wild-type line requires bioactivation to a cytotoxic carbonyl species and is sensitive to the cytotoxic agent. These bioactivated reactive, electronegative compounds modify lysine and cysteine side-chains of several proteins by a Michael addition reaction mechanism. This can induce an unfolded protein response (UPR), which in turn can lead to apoptotic cell death. HSD17B11 as well as the related enzymes hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase and retinol dehydrogenase 11, which also appear to be involved in this bioactivation step (although to a lesser degree), are members of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily, an evolutionarily conserved protein family found in all forms of life with about 80 members identified in the human genome. The study provides a plausible mechanism how a class of compounds containing dialkynylcarbinol motifs, most often found in natural products, exert their cytotoxic properties and accordingly this work provides significant information, of utility in the toxicology field.</p><p>Strengths: the undisputed strength (and beauty) of the manuscript is the chemical-genomic approach using a combination of biochemical and molecular resources, such as use of the pseudo-haploid cell line, the EMS mutational approach to identify the underlying oxidoreductase(s), the mass spectrometry work and chemical synthesis.</p><p>Weaknesses: Several open questions remain. Several parts of the paper appear overemphasized. In part, the underlying hypothesis (for example the explanation of 17beta HSDs as DAC dehydrogenase through the 17beta-hydroxy stereochemistry of the steroid D ring) appears farfetched: all secondary alcohol substrates should have a similar configuration and hence any oxidoreductase involved could be a candidate for the observed DAC oxidation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer 1 for pointing this out. Like the Reviewer 1, we were also intrigued by the enantiospecific bioactivation, which we thought was the result of HSD17B11 being adapted to oxidize an hydroxyl group in a specific configuration on its natural substrate. We suspected that both DAC enantiomers could fit in the catalytic domain but that only the (<italic>S</italic>)-DAC would have its hydroxyl group properly oriented to interact with the key catalytic residues (S172 and Y185), necessary to promote the hydride transfer to NAD+. To support this view, we took advantage of AlphaFold2-generated HSD17B11 structural model (see the novel Figure 2—figure supplement 2A) to perform molecular docking with the DACs (<italic>S</italic>)-3 and (<italic>R</italic>)-3. Both (<italic>S</italic>)-3 and (<italic>R</italic>)-3 docked into the catalytic cavity (Figure 2—figure supplement 2B,C), but (<italic>R</italic>)-3 had a lower computed affinity (155 nM <italic>vs</italic> 15 nM for (<italic>S</italic>)-3) and only (<italic>S</italic>)-3 had its hydroxyl group properly positioned to engage into hydrogen bonds with the S172 and Y185 catalytic amino acids (Figure 2—figure supplement 2D,E), which is critical for further NAD+-dependent oxidation (Filling et al., J Biol Chem 2002; Gao et al., Crystals 2021).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, HPGD and RDH11 do not have steroid DH activity. Conversely, other HSD17beta DHs could possibly carry out the reaction (which they apparently do not).</p></disp-quote><p>There are 13 human 17βHSDs SDRs in human and we were also intrigued by the selective bioactivation of (<italic>S</italic>)-DACs by HSD17B11 over these enzymes or other SDRs. Possible explanations for this are provided by the facts that (1) most of the other 17betaHSD SDRs are not expressed in the cell lines we used in our study (U2OS and HAP1 for most experiments, see the table in Figure 2—figure supplement 2F), (2) that 4 of the other 17betaHSD SDRs have the reverse activity (reductive SDRs) and therefore could not promote the oxidative bioactivation, and (3) that HSD17B11 has some specificities such as its preference for the androgen 5α-androstane-3α,17βdiol over prototypical 17βHSD SDR substrates (dihydrotestosterone and testosterone ; Brereton et al., Mol Cell Endocrinol 2001). This could suggest that, among the 17betaHSD SDRs, HSD17B11 has a catalytic domain which is the most adapted to oxidize DACs and related molecules. To challenge this view, we took advantage of AlphaFold2-generated models for all the 17betaHSD SDRs (available on Uniprot) to perform molecular docking with the DAC (<italic>S</italic>)-3 and (<italic>R</italic>)-3 onto their catalytic domain. Filtering for the most stringent poses revealed that, in addition to HSD17B11, (<italic>S</italic>)-3 also docked into the catalytic domains of only 2 SDRs, HSD17B13 and HSD17B3, while (<italic>R</italic>)-3 docked into 2 different SDRs, HSD17B9 and HSD17B6. HSD17B3 (aka SDR12C2) is a reductive SDR involved in testosterone biosynthesis, so it was not tested further. In contrast, since HSD17B13 (aka SDR16C3), whose expression is restricted to the liver, is an oxidative SDR and the closest homolog of HSD17B11 (~63% sequence identity), we tested whether it could complement U2OS KO for HSD17B11. This revealed that HSD17B13 is also able to bioactivate (<italic>S</italic>)-3 into cytotoxic compounds, however in a less efficient manner as compared to HSD17B11 (IC<sub>50</sub> of 30 nM vs 12 nM for HSD17B11 with similar complementation levels, see the novel Figure 2—figure supplement 2G,H). Altogether these findings support that HSD17B11 has, among the other 17betaHSDs, the best affinity for DACs and DAC-like molecules. These data also suggest that (<italic>R</italic>)-DACs could be bioactivated selectively by other SDRs, such as HSD17B9 and HSD17B6, which opens new directions of research. Note that we have deposited all the expression plasmids of the tested SDRs on Addgene, which should greatly stimulate and benefit this field of research.</p><p>Altogether these data support that HSD1711 or other SDRs will display an enantiospecificity for bioactivating DACs and related molecules as the result of having evolved to recognize a natural substrate which is itself in a specific configuration. This also implies that, despite being simple in term of structures, (<italic>S</italic>)-DAC insert in a specific manner in the catalytic domain of HSD17B11, as supported by our molecular docking analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, and this speaks in favour of the importance of the paper, other classes of oxidoreductases such as aldo-keto reductases (AKR) or especially medium-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (MDR) could in principle carry out the observed reaction, potentially widening significantly the target field for a series of related DAC activating enzymes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with Reviewer 1 that other classes of enzymes able to oxidize secondary carbinol groups could in theory bioactivate specifically designed prodrugs carrying a DAC-based warhead. This is one of the key points we wanted to make through the data presented in Figure 5: it is possible to design novel substrates for bioactivation by a specific enzyme. Some selectivity can be achieved by modulating the pharmacophore (e.g. AllAC for HPGD or AAC for RDH11) and/or the lipidic backbone (e.g. addition of a second -OH group which blocks/reduces the activation by HSD17B11). We now further discuss this point taking advantage of some of the references suggested by Reviewer 1:</p><p>&quot;In addition, other oxidoreductases, especially among the Medium-Chain dehydrogenase/Reductase (MDR) superfamily, could in principle carry out similar oxidation of secondary alcohol-containing substrates (72), which could widen the field of application of our findings. Conversely, some carbonyl reductases, especially among the Aldo-Keto Reductase (AKR) superfamily (73,74), could theoretically antagonize DACones cytotoxicity by reverting the reactive ketone into the corresponding alcohol, which could be further conjugated and eliminated.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More importantly, a part of the postulated importance in developing DACs as possible cancer therapeutics has been postulated based on osteosarcoma cell line data. HSD17B11 is certainly very widely expressed including liver and blood cells. For sure, the DAC activation would take place in these tissues by HSD17B11 (and HPGD, RDH11). It would be interesting to learn more about in vivo toxicology of the DACs, I would expect a high degree of hepatotoxicity and suppression of white blood cell formation.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not intend to oversell our data with the osteosarcoma cell lines. They simply show that some osteosarcoma cancer cell lines have ~10 times higher sensitivity to DAC as compared to primary osteoblast cells. Multiple anticancer agents (e.g. etoposide) have similarly low selectivity indices, associated with known side effects, which did not prevent them from being used to treat and cure some cancers. We completely agree with Reviewer 1 that (1) our data obtained with cancer cell lines are not sufficient to validate DACs as anticancer agents and (2) that the anticancer efficacy should be evaluated in vivo to take into account potential toxicity effects and unfavorable pharmacokinetics properties. We just wanted to point out that (<italic>S</italic>)-DACs display differential cytotoxic activity against various cell lines despite HSD17B11 being almost ubiquitously expressed. This differential cytotoxicity might be exploited to develop DACs and analogues to target specific HSD17B11-overexpressing cancers such as some advanced human prostate cancers which overexpress HSD17B11 as compared to the normal tissue (Nakamura et al., 2009). In response to Reviewer 1 comments, we tuned down the potential clinical implication of our work (see above) and added the reference related to the overexpression of HSD17B11 in human prostate cancers to highlight some potential applications.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A major concern for me is the apparent lack of GSH conjugation or other defense mechanisms (such as MDR enzymes) against the reactive carbonyl species. The reactive alkynyl-ketones should have electronegative centers that would be prime targets for glutathione-S- conjugation or even non-enzymatic reactions with GSH. Has anything like that been observed for the reactive carbonyls? The authors show it for N-acetyl cycteine for example, so it could work with GSH as well.</p></disp-quote><p>Like Reviewer 1, and based on our in vitro data demonstrating that DACone are highly reactive with thiol groups at pH7, we anticipated that the toxicity of DAC would be modulated by glutathione (GSH) and glutathione S-transferases (GSTs). We thought that this could even explain why some cell lines, such as A549, are not as sensitive to DAC as U2OS are, despite almost similar HSD17B11 expression levels. To investigate this, we first tested in vitro the reaction of DACone 8 with reduced GSH at pH7. This revealed that DACone 8 is indeed able to react with GSH, with the appearance of an absorbance band at ~323 nm (Figure 3—figure supplement 3A,B). NMR analyses confirmed the formation of an adduct on the GSH thiol group with a structure similar to the one observed for DACone and NAC (Figure 3—figure supplement 3C). Then we tested in cells whether GSH supplementation (using the cell permeable GSH monoethyl ester = GSHe) could reduce (<italic>S</italic>)-DAC sensitivity in U2OS. However, we observed only a small and non-significant impact of GSHe on (<italic>S</italic>)-DAC cytotoxicity (Figure 3—figure supplement 3D). We also attempted to sensitize A549 cells to (<italic>S</italic>)-DAC by using the GSTs inhibitor ethacrynic acid (GSTi). However, again there was only a small dose-dependent effect of the GSTi on (<italic>S</italic>)-3 cytotoxicity (Figure 3—figure supplement 3E). Altogether, these data show that GST and GSH only play a minor role in modulating DAC cytotoxic activity. It is possible that the local generation of DACones protects them from a general detoxification mechanism. This is in line with our MS/MS data in which only a small set of proteins was found modified by DAC (<italic>S</italic>)-<bold>9</bold>. This set of proteins might correspond to the one in the direct proximity of HSD17B11, as shown for another <italic>in situ</italic> generated electrophile (Paxman et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2018). Thanks to Reviewer 1, these data are now added to the manuscript and discussed (novel Figure 3—figure supplement 3). They highlight that, while HSD17B11 expression is critical for (<italic>S</italic>)-DAC cytotoxicity, the degree of sensitivity to DACs has other determinants, such as, possibly, the level of the NAD+ co-factor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is there a possibility for enzymatic reduction of the yne-triple bonds?</p></disp-quote><p>CaeEnR1, the first enzyme being able to perform enzymatic reduction of alkyne triple bonds, was recently identified in the fungus <italic>Cyclocybe aegerita</italic> (Karrer et al., ChemCatChem 2021). Its closest relatives in human are prostaglandin reductases but these enzymes have not been shown to reduce alkyne groups and we feel that they are therefore unlikely to modulate DAC cytotoxicity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, it would be of interest to dissect the UPR further (beyond IRE1a phosphorylation). It would be of high interest to do so and look for the other elements as well- such as XBP splicing, PERK activation, eiF2a phosphorylation, ATF expression etc. Excellent tool compounds are available to probe this important phenotypic response further, including PERK and IRE1a inhibitors (targeting the nucleotidase and the kinase domains).</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by Reviewer 1, we tested multiple markers of UPR activation. In agreement with (<italic>S</italic>)-3 triggering unfolded proteins accumulation and UPR activation, we observed that treatment with (<italic>S</italic>)-3 induced the activation of the three UPR pathways with the rapid phosphorylation of IRE1α (S724), PERK (T980) and eIF2α (S51), a strong decrease of full-length ATF6, marking its cleavage into a short-lived transcriptionally active fragment and preceding the accumulation of cytoplasmic HSP70 and the transient accumulation of XBP-1s and ATF4 (see modified Figure 4G). These data support that (<italic>S</italic>)-DAC 3 induces a fast (&lt; 2 h) and strong activation of all three UPR sub-pathways.</p><p>As suggested by Reviewer 1, we also tested whether known UPR sub-pathway inhibitors could sensitize cells to (<italic>S</italic>)-DAC. The individual inhibition of IRE1α kinase, IRE1α endonuclease or PERK kinase activity did not show a significant impact on (<italic>S</italic>)-DAC cytotoxicity suggesting that the ER stress induced by (<italic>S</italic>)-<bold>3</bold> is too acute to be resolved in a timely manner by UPR activation (see novel Figure 4—figure supplement 1E) or that the combined inhibition of all three pathways may be needed to modulate cell sensitivity. In contrast, inhibition of <italic>JNK</italic>, which is known to contribute to the apoptosis induced by prolonged UPR activation (for review see Szegezdi et al., EMBO Reports 2006), provided a small degree of resistance to (<italic>S</italic>)-<bold>3</bold> (IC<sub>50</sub> shift from 33 to 70 nM), suggesting a contribution of the <italic>JNK</italic> pathway to cell death (see novel Figure 4—figure supplement 1F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The most significant open questions/points have been already highlighted in the Public review section.

It was shown in vitro to promote androgen inactivation by converting the potent androstan-3-α,17-β-diol into a weaker androgen (17). In human, the HSD17B11 variant (rs9991501 ; Arg283Gln) was found associated with lean body mass (60), supporting that its activity controls muscle physiology, a process regulated by androgens. However, which HSD17B11-generated metabolites are involved and how the Arg283Gln variant impacts on HSD17B11 activity is currently unknown. HSD17B11 is nearly ubiquitously expressed (17,61), but is also overexpressed in some human malignancies, including advanced prostate cancer and non-small cell lung cancer cell lines, as compared to normal tissues or cell lines (62,63). However, the potential role for HSD17B11 in cancer progression remains to be established.

They first performed a genetic screen to isolate cell clones that are resistant to toxic alkynylcarbinols and found that resistant mutations frequently occur on a member of SDR named HSD17B11. They then demonstrated that the catalytic activity of HSD17B11 is critical in mediating the toxicity of alkynylcarbinols and cells that are lacking the expression of this SDR are more resistant. They further synthesized different bioorthogonal analogues of alkynylcarbinols and their corresponding control compounds to show the resulting ketone species could covalently label proteins on their nucleophilic cysteines both in vitro and in living cells. By performing chemical proteomics experiments, they identified a list of proteins that are modified by the activated alkynylcarbinols, one of which is involved in the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway. Another interesting aspect of this work is that they found the proteins that are modified by these lipidic alkynylcarbinols derivatives tend to show different subcellular localizations. They finally demonstrated in proof-of-concept that the alkynylcarbinols can serve as potential prodrugs which are activated by SDR members and kill cancer cells.</p><p>Strength:</p><p>The work is super rich in content and integrates an impressive list of different techniques to confirm each hypothesis that the authors made along the way. It mechanistically interprets the pathway how the alkynylcarbinols get activated in cells and how the resulting electrophilic species react covalently with proteins and changed their physical/chemical properties. The work proposes a new prodrug strategy to selectively kill cancers.</p><p>Weakness:</p><p>With clear indication of covalent modifications of proteins by these activated alkynylcarbinols, the authors did not identify the key targets that are responsible for the observed cytotoxicity. The site-specific chemical proteomics were only implemented to survey the amino acid preference of the activated alkynylcarbinols, however, they were not used to pinpoint specific residue anchors when the compounds were added into cells. Despite that they showed cells underwent apoptosis with sign of ER-stress and inhibition of UPS, the targets or pathways that mediate the cytotoxicity of the electrophilic species are still not clear from the current study.</p><p>1. With so many techniques implemented and so much data acquired, I would suggest authors to trim certain data to improve the overall readability of the manuscript. For example, the last part of RDH11 and HPGD seemed to not absolutely necessary to me and distracted the key finding of HSD17B11. In addition, too many technical details are put into the results session which make the manuscript a bit hard to read and follow.</p></disp-quote><p>We have trimmed some of the technical details from the result section, but we decided to keep the part about RDH11- and HPGD-mediated oxidation since they provide a proof-of-concept that other prodrugs can be generated for bioactivation by other SDRs, different from HSD17B11, which is an important message of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Not very clear to me why the authors used the isotopically labeled isoDTB for evaluating the site-specific reaction preferences, but when it came to identify the cellular targets, they put the isoDTB aside and instead just used label-free quantification at the protein level. Ideally, isoDTB would work perfectly with their alkynyl probes to identify and quantify critical sites of modifications and provide a better picture of target landscape of these activated alkynylcarbinols.</p></disp-quote><p>The reason for not using in our initial submission the more complex isoDTB-based workflow is mainly historical: the chemoproteomics analyses depicted in Figure 3B were performed in 2016, while the isoDTB-based analyses of the DACone amino acids selectivity were performed later in 2021. Despite being simpler, we are confident with the data generated by the label free approach, since we could validate the main hits as being modified in cells through high stringency immunoprecipitations (Figure 3C and Figure 3—figure supplement 2C). However, like Reviewer 2, we were also interested by identifying the protein modification sites by the bioactivated (<italic>S</italic>)-DAC, mainly to be able later to evolve DACs into more specific inhibitors selectively bioactivated by HSD17B11. We therefore attempted, as suggested by the Reviewers, to apply the isoDTB-ABPP workflow to the identification of the proteins modified by (<italic>S</italic>)-DAC directly from cell extracts.</p><p>As presented in the general response, this led us to validate that upon (<italic>S</italic>)-DAC treatment some peptides are modified in cells by the expected DACone adducts (Supplementary File 4A). Of note the adducts themselves were found modified by DTT during the workflow, probably on the internal alkyne (see Supplementary File 4B). Such DTT-modified adducts were also previously detected in the in vitro DACone treatment (30% of the quantified sites for the DACone 10- and 11-protein adducts).</p><p>However, it is noteworthy that the isoDTB-based analysis only identified a small number of peptides, all modified on a cysteine. This led us to investigate whether the modifications on the amine group of lysines could be partly cleaved during the isoDTB-ABPP workflow, especially during the final elution, which consists in a 1 h incubation in 0.1% TFA. As now shown in the novel Figure 2—figure supplement 1H,I, this revealed that incubation in 0.1% TFA at room-temperature progressively and selectively promotes the cleavage of the DACone-amine bonds over the DACone-thiol ones. This, combined with the reduced concentration of (<italic>S</italic>)-DAC which could be used for cell treatments as compared to the in vitro analysis (2 µM in cells vs 100 µM in vitro), likely accounts for the reduced number of peptides identified through this approach. Therefore, our data support that the label-free and isoDTB-based approaches are complementary with the simpler label-free one being best suited for the identification of the proteins modified by (<italic>S</italic>)-DAC in cells, while the isoDTB-framework being most appropriated for the unbiased identification of the adducts mass in cells and for mapping the modification sites. Using different approaches to elute or cleave the isotopically labelled tags and the associated proteins represents an attractive avenue to improve the isoDTB-ABPP workflow and to avoid the biases induced by the acidic elution.</p><p>To conclude, we are grateful for Reviewer 2’s suggestion which led us to validate the formation of the adducts in cells, to identify some modification sites which could be further explored and to reveal the differential stability of the lysine- and cysteine-DACone linkages at acidic pH. These data are now integrated and discussed in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In the manuscript &quot;SDR enzymes oxidize specific lipidic alkynylcarbinols into cytotoxic 2 protein-reactive species,&quot; the authors use functional genomics and chemoproteomics to elucidate mode of action of cytotoxic dialkynylcarbinol (DAC) containing lipids. They discovered that the DAC lipids are bioactivated in an enantiospecific manner by members of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family of enzymes. Using this information, the authors design new SDR-bioactivated DAC lipids as a more general prodrug strategy. The studies are interesting and an impressive array of supporting data are provided. However, direct evidence for the bioactivation mechanism in cells are lacking and this gap should be addressed.</p><p>A major critique is the lack of direct evidence for oxidation of alkynylcarbinols to the bioactivated alkynylketone lipids by HSD17B11 or other SDR enzymes in cells. This data is key for supporting the prodrug mode of action of the cytotoxic alkynylcarbinol lipids proposed by the authors. The chemoproteomic evaluation of (S)-9 DAC treated cells only provided protein-level identifications. The inclusion of site of binding chemoproteomic data from cellular studies, which should reveal peptide-lipid adducts matching structures proposed by authors in Figure 2i, is important for supporting SDR-mediated production of reactive acetylenic lipids in cells as proposed by the authors. The authors could also consider the use of metabolomics to identify the alkynylketone lipid products produced in (S)-9 DAC treated cells as direct evidence for the bioactivation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with Reviewer 3 that we did not directly show that DACones are produced in cells and we were careful not to oversell our finding regarding this aspect. However, considering the high reactivity of DACones in vitro, our view is that the reactive intermediate cannot be trapped in a simple manner when enzymatically produced. This is demonstrated thanks to one of the additional experiment requested by Reviewer 3 (see point 3, below), namely a blot showing that, in our in vitro bioactivation experiment, we had similar amounts of WT and S172L HSD17B11 mutant. On that blot, we also checked the modification of HSD17B11-GFP by bioactivated clickable DAC and we observed that HSD17B11-GFP itself was covalently modified by the HSD17B11-generated reactive species. The modification of HSD7B11-GFP was decreased by adding betalactoglobuline (BLG) to the reaction, indicating that the BLG competed with HSD17B11 for being modified by the reactive species (see the novel Figure 2F). Altogether these data support that DACones will react with any proteins in their vicinity, which precludes the possibility of isolating enzymatically-produced DACones.</p><p>Even though we could not isolate these reactive intermediates, we think that, since HSD17B11, and the related 17beta-HSD oxidative SDRs, are only known to oxidize hydroxyl groups into ketones, and since there is only one hydroxyl group on DAC, the simplest and most likely bioactivation products are the DACones. Thanks to the Reviewer 3 suggestion we now properly discuss this point in the result section:</p><p>&quot;Finally, we could recapitulate the activation of (<italic>S</italic>)-<bold>9</bold>, but not of (<italic>R</italic>)-<bold>9</bold>, into protein-reactive species by immunopurified WT HSD17B11, but not by the S172L mutant (Figure 2F), supporting an enantiospecific bioactivation of (<italic>S</italic>)-<bold>9</bold> into the BLG-reactive DACone <bold>10</bold> by HSD17B11. Considering that HSD17B11 known activity is the NAD+-dependent oxidation of a secondary carbinol into a ketone and that the only hydroxyl group on (<italic>S</italic>)-<bold>3</bold> is the one occurring in the dialkynylcarbinol pharmacophore, this experiment strongly supports the notion that HSD17B11 enantiospecifically oxidizes (<italic>S</italic>)-<bold>3</bold> into the DACone <bold>7</bold>, which immediately reacts with nearby proteins, including HSD17B11-GFP itself as observed in Figure 2F. This high level of reactivity unfortunately precludes isolating the HSD17B11-produced DACones.&quot;</p><p>In addition, we also performed residue-specific experiments (see above) with the isoDTB-ABPP technology in cells and were able to identify some modified peptides that corroborate the production of the DACones in cells upon treatment with (<italic>S</italic>)-9.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional comments to consider:</p><p>1. The authors use the HSD17B11 WT and S172L mutant comparison as support for catalytic function of this enzyme in (S)-DAC cytotoxicity. While these results are clear, the author do not provide direct evidence for disruption of HSD17B11catalytic activity. For example, can the author demonstrate that HSD17B11 S172L lysates are catalytically deficient compared with WT counterparts? What are the effects of this mutation on androsterone levels in this overexpression system?</p></disp-quote><p>In the SDR superfamily, 2 amino acids are critical for catalysis: a serine and a tyrosine, which would be S172 and Y185 on HSD17B11 (a 3rd amino acid playing a key role is a lysine, which would be K189 on HSD17B11, allowing protonation/deprotonation of the catalytic tyrosine). The identification of a mutation of the key S172 residue in one of our DACR clones was therefore a very striking result and prompted us to use this mutation in the rest of our study. Initially, we were concerned by the fact that this mutation strongly impacted on HSD17B11 expression levels. However, expression in the form of a C-terminally FLAG-GFP tagged protein under the control of the CMV promoter rescued the expression levels of the mutant. Clones with similar expression of</p><p>HSD17B11 WT and S172L mutants were used for rescue experiments and for immunoprecipitations to perform in vitro assays. For these ones, to normalize for the amount of enzyme between the WT and S172L mutant, an excess of HSD17B11 compared to the beads’ capacity was used.</p><p>Thanks to Reviewer 1 and 3 comments, we now provide molecular docking experiment showing that the DAC (<italic>S</italic>)-<bold>3</bold> hydroxyl group is properly oriented in the HSD17B11 catalytic domain to form hydrogen bonds with S172 and Y185, while the DAC (<italic>R</italic>)-<bold>3</bold> cannot form such contacts. These additional data provide a rational for the enantiospecific bioactivation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the inclusion of an additional plasmid coding for a mutation outside of the catalytic domain in the complementation assay is a recommended control given the protein instability issues of from mutations.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks to Reviewer 3’s comment, we also tested other mutants outside of the catalytic domain in rescue experiments. Two mutations outside of the catalytic domain, <italic>id</italic> in the N-terminal ER/lipiddroplet localization sequence, were identified in the DACR clones: L14P and V16D. Thanks to the C-terminal FLAG-GFP tag and/or the CMV-based overexpression, we were able to complement U2OS inactivated for HSD17B11 with these two mutants to levels close to the S172L and WT HSD17B11-GFP (see the novel Figure 1—figure supplement 5C). Strikingly, both mutants successfully complemented U2OS (Figure 1—figure supplement 5D) supporting that these mutations conferred a resistance to DACs in HAP1 cells by reducing the level of HSD17B11 proteins rather than by affecting its catalytic activity. The fact that, under the same conditions, HSD17B11 S172L did not complement is a strong argument supporting that this mutation affects the catalytic activity of HSD17B11. Note that all the plasmids to express these mutants have been deposited on Addgene, which should benefit to this field of research.</p><p>In response to Reviewer 3 comments, these data are now included in the result section:</p><p>&quot;CRISPR/Cas9-mediated inactivation of HSD17B11 also conferred significant (<italic>S</italic>)-<bold>3</bold> resistance to U2OS cells, which was suppressed by wild-type HSD17B11-GFP but not by the S172L mutant or GFP alone (Figure 1—figure supplement 5A,B). In contrast, complementation with HSD17B11 carrying the L14P or V16D mutations, lying outside of the catalytic domain and identified in the DACR clones #B1 and #A1/#A2, respectively, restored (<italic>S</italic>)-<bold>3</bold> cytotoxic activity, in agreement with these mutations affecting HSD17B11 protein stability and not its catalytic activity (Figure 1—figure supplement 5C,D). These data also support that the C-terminal FLAG-GFP tag and/or the CMV promoter-based overexpression partly overcome the impact of these mutations on HSD17B11 expression level.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. To support the major critique above, the authors should show by LC-MS or NMR that purified HSD17B11 incubated with (S)-9 under the appropriate biochemical assay conditions produces the dialkynylketone (DACone) 10 product. The authors should compare with the (R)-9 substrate to demonstrate enantio-selectivity. These data should be included to support the claims associated with Figure 2F.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with Reviewer 3 that this would be a direct demonstration of the enantioselective bioactivation of (<italic>S</italic>)-DACs into DACones. However, as explained above, the enzymatically produced DACone reacts with the nearby proteins including HSD17B11 itself when no other protein is available. We think the experiments provided in Figure 2F is the best demonstration that we can currently perform of the HSD17B11-dependent production of a protein reactive species. This is now clarified in the text:</p><p>“Considering that HSD17B11 known activity is the NAD+-dependent oxidation of a secondary carbinol into a ketone and that the only hydroxyl group on (<italic>S</italic>)-<bold>3</bold> is the one occurring in the dialkynylcarbinol pharmacophore, this experiment strongly supports the notion that HSD17B11 enantiospecifically oxidizes (<italic>S</italic>)-<bold>3</bold> into the DACone <bold>7</bold>, which immediately reacts with nearby proteins, including HSD17B11-GFP itself as observed in Figure 2F. This high level of reactivity unfortunately precludes isolating the HSD17B11-produced DACones.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Authors should show western blots for HSD17B11 detection in Figure 2F since they report issues with production of the full length S172L protein due to protein instability.</p></disp-quote><p>The experiments comparing the rescue of DAC cytotoxicity by complementing HSD17B11 deficient cells with the WT, L14P, V16D and S172L HSD17B11 already provide some clarification regarding the different impact of the identified mutations on HSD17B11 catalytic activity.</p><p>In our in vitro experiments, we took great care to use similar amounts of HSD17B11 WT and S172L catalytic mutant by using excess of HSD17B11-GFP-containing extracts as compared to the bead’s binding capacity. As suggested by Reviewer 3, we also analyzed the amount of enzyme on the beads at the end of the reaction depicted in Figure 2F, altogether with the presence of DACmodified proteins using click-based detection with the AlexaFluor647-azido fluorophore. This confirmed that equivalent amounts of WT and S172L HSD17B11-GFP were used in the assay, but also revealed that HSD17B11-GFP itself is modified by DACs. This modification was decreased when betalactoglobuline was added to the assay, suggesting a competition between the two proteins for modification by the DACones. In addition, no modification was observed with the S172L mutant (or without NAD+, not shown here).</p><p>With the complementation experiments and the molecular docking, these data support that the S172L mutant blocked the production of protein-reactive DACones by directly affecting HSD17B11 catalytic activity. We thank the Reviewer 3 for requesting this analysis which strengthens our findings.</p></body></sub-article></article>
