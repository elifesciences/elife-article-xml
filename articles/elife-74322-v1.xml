Peptide neurotoxins are known to block nAChRs by binding to their target subunits, however, a better understanding of this mechanism is needed for effective insecticide design. To facilitate the analysis of nAChRs we used a CRISPR/Cas9 strategy to generate null alleles for all ten <italic>nAChR</italic> subunit genes in a common genetic background. We studied interactions of nAChR subunits with peptide neurotoxins by larval injections and styrene maleic acid lipid particles (SMALPs) pull-down assays. For the null alleles, we determined the effects of α-Bungarotoxin (α-Btx) and ω-Hexatoxin-Hv1a (Hv1a) administration, identifying potential receptor subunits implicated in the binding of these toxins. We employed pull-down assays to confirm α-Btx interactions with the <italic>Drosophila</italic> α5 (D<italic>α</italic>5), Dα6, D<italic>α</italic>7 subunits.

Insecticides are important tools in securing yields of all major crops but need to be continually replaced to overcome resistance in target species and reduce environmental impacts. In addition, new insecticides must have low toxicity to non-target species, particularly the major pollinators essential for agriculture. A large class of insecticide targets are neurotransmitter receptors such as the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) located in synaptic plasma membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ihara et al., 2020</xref>). These pentameric cys-loop ligand-gated ion channels consist of either only α-subunits or α- and β-subunits, with ligand-binding sites located between two α-subunits or between α- and β-subunits. Most insect genomes, including that of the highly tractable <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> model, harbour 10 highly conserved subunit genes that assemble in various combinations to form the active receptors.</p><p>An essential pre-requisite for effective design of new insecticides targeting these receptors is an understanding of their distinctive binding properties. For many reasons, including low expression in endogenous tissues or difficulties in expressing insect receptors in heterologous systems, the characterisation of functional insect receptors has been challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Perry et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zuo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Salgado, 2021</xref>). Even in the tractable <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> insect model, there has been no systematic isolation of mutations in <italic>nAChR</italic> subunit genes, until recently, when Perry and colleagues described the generation of a new set of null mutations in nine out of the ten <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> subunit genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Perry et al., 2021</xref>). These mutations, however, were generated in different genetic backgrounds necessitating additional work to assay background sensitive phenotypes such as neural or behavioural defects.</p><p>Several classes of insecticide, the most effective being those in the neonicotinoid and spinosad class, have been shown to bind insect nAChRs highly selectively to block their functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chambers et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Houchat et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Martelli et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lu et al., 2022</xref>). Recently, the binding affinity and the positive allosteric effects of ω-Hexatoxin-Hv1a (Hv1a) peptide on nAChRs has been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chambers et al., 2019</xref>) and this spider venom peptide is well known for its insecticidal effects. In addition, other peptide toxins, such as the snake venom constituent, α-Bungarotoxin (α-Btx), have been widely used to probe nAChR functions, however whether α-Btx harbours a selective insecticidal property is currently unknown. Alpha-Btx is a 74 amino acid peptide that binds irreversibly to nAChR α-subunits in different species, including <italic>D. melanogaster,</italic> although the exact binding targets of these receptors are not fully understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schmidt-Nielsen et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dellisanti et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">daCosta et al., 2015</xref>). Landsdell and co-workers have shown binding of α-Btx to <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> α5 (Dα5), Dα6, and Dα7 subunits in a heterologous S2 cell expression system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lansdell and Millar, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lansdell et al., 2012</xref>). The amino acid sequences of these subunits show strong similarity across their ligand<italic>-</italic>binding domains (LBD), suggesting that at least three subunits with sequence similarity are implicated in <italic>α</italic>-Btx binding in vivo.</p><p>The lipid bilayer surrounding nAChRs is known to be essential for structural integrity, stability, and ligand-binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">daCosta et al., 2013</xref>). However, this lipid requirement can make analysis of membrane protein complexes challenging. The development of methods for extracting membrane proteins from lipid bilayers using detergents and introducing them into artificial lipid nanodiscs has facilitated a much better characterisation of receptor-ligand interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Denisov and Sligar, 2016</xref>). The use of detergents generally employed to solubilise membrane proteins, however, leads to destabilisation, aggregation and misfolding and their use is therefore not compatible with this type of analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Loo et al., 1996</xref>). Styrene maleic acid lipid particles (SMALPs) allow detergent-free extraction of membrane proteins in their local lipid environment and provide a promising technique for investigating receptor-ligand interactions under native conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). This is particularly important since loss of lipids surrounding membrane proteins can lead to changes in measured binding affinities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Martens et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gault et al., 2020</xref>). The combination of detergent free SMALPs extraction coupled with mass spectrometry analysis provides a potential route for characterising native membrane receptor complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sobotzki et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kalxdorf et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report the results from a combined genetic and biochemical analysis of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> nAChRs in vivo. Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering, we generated new null mutations for all ten receptor subunit genes in a uniform genetic background as well as introducing a fluorescent protein tag into the <italic>nAChRα6</italic> locus. We show that the null mutants in all seven α-subunit genes and two of the three β-subunit genes are viable and fertile, although we find mild morphological defects and some neurological impairment. Mutation of the remaining subunit gene, <italic>nAChRβ1,</italic> is recessive lethal. All nine of the viable null mutants were used to demonstrate a novel selective insecticidal effect of α-Btx on the <italic>nAChRα5, nAChRα6 and nAChRα7</italic> subunits. We also applied the insecticidal Hv1a peptide to the viable null mutants, showing resistance with two subunit gene mutants: <italic>nAChRα4 and nAChRβ2</italic>. In our biochemical studies, we analysed receptor-ligand interactions in native conditions using SMALPs to verify the in vivo receptor subunit α-Btx binding targets in adult neural tissue from wild-type and receptor subunit mutants. Our analysis revealed binding of α-Btx to receptors containing Dα5, Dα6 and Dα7 subunits with the analysis of mutants in these subunit genes indicating heterogeneity in α-Btx binding nAChRs. Furthermore, we have identified specific glycosylation sites in D<italic>α</italic>5 and Dα7 subunits which are known from other studies to play a critical role in α-Btx-binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dellisanti et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rahman et al., 2020</xref>). Localisation studies with the Dα6 subunit tagged at the endogenous locus with a fluorescent reporter shows expression at different developmental stages in specific neuronal cells, including the Kenyon cells of the mushroom bodies, a known site of α-Btx-binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Su and O’Dowd, 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Construction of new <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit gene mutations</title><p>To investigate the role of individual nAChR subunits we used CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering to generate null mutations in each of the seven α-subunit and three <italic>β</italic>-subunit genes. All mutations were generated in virtually identical genetic backgrounds using <italic>nos</italic>-Cas9 sources on the second or third chromosome of otherwise genetically homogeneous fly lines. Two of the subunit genes, <italic>nAChRα3</italic> and <italic>nAChRα7</italic>, are <italic>X-</italic>linked and consequently these lines retain the X from the nos-Cas9 stocks used to generate the mutations whereas the other eight null mutations have a <italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup> chromosome. In brief, for each gene we targeted exons shared between all predicted isoforms, in most cases close to the N-terminus of the protein. To disrupt each coding sequence and facilitate screening we introduced a visible fluorescent marker, DsRED under control of the eye-specific 3xP3 promoter at the targeted locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>). Positive lines were confirmed by PCR and sequencing. The system was designed in such a way that the DsRED marker may be excised from the genome by Cre-LoxP recombination, leaving a 3 X FLAG tag and a single LoxP site with the reading frame predicted to be restored. We have not yet tested this facet of the design.</p><p>For nine out of 10 subunit genes, we established homozygous viable and fertile stocks, the exception was the <italic>nAChRβ1</italic> gene which proved to be recessive lethal. We crossed the <italic>nAChRβ1</italic> null strain with a <italic>Tubby<sup>1</sup></italic>-marked balancer but obtained no homozygous 3rd instar larvae, indicating lethality prior to this stage, which precluded subsequent analysis of homozygotes. Although all the other lines are viable, we noticed that all of the lines, but particularly <italic>nAChRα1, nAChRα2, nAChRα5</italic> and <italic>nAChRβ3</italic>, exhibited a curled abdomen phenotype that is most prominent in males (approximately 25, 20, 15% and 15% respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Morphological and locomotor phenotypes in <italic>nAChR</italic> subunit mutants.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Adult males from indicated <italic>nAChR</italic> subunit null mutants, black arrows indicate curled abdomens but even in lines with a low frequency the phenotype is prominent (blue arrow).

We prepared membrane enriched fractions from adult heads, solubilised these with SMA and separated the insoluble particles from the lipid discs by ultracentrifugation.

An analysis of Gene Ontology (GO) slim terms supports the conclusion that the SMALP preparations are enriched for membrane embedded and/or associated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), and that these are not limited to plasma membrane proteins. In the SMA-enriched samples, we found enrichment for proteins annotated with metabolic and catalytic activity terms and also enhanced response to biological stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>), highlighting the recovery of membrane-associated proteins. Next, we focused on identified membrane proteins predicted to contain transmembrane helical (TMH) domains and found an increased number of proteins containing TMHs in SMA solubilised samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). While the majority of these proteins contained a single TMH domain, we identified Piezo, a mechanosensory ion channel protein containing 37 predicted transmembrane helices.

While very few glycopeptides were observed in the flow through (an average 20 glycopeptides, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), we identified a total of 397 glycopeptides after enrichment and deglycosylation with Endo H or PNGase F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p>Shared glycopeptides from Dα5 and Dα7 nAChR subunits were identified after enrichment and deglycosylation with Endo H or PNGase F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

This asparagine residue was modified with an N-acetylhexosamine (HexNAc) truncated sugar chain.

We show for the first time that α-Btx has selective insecticidal effects against the Dα5, Dα6, and Dα7 subunits, which we further characterised at a biochemical level.</p><p>The pharmacology of Hv1a and α-Btx binding has been shown to be distinctive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chambers et al., 2019</xref>), correlating with our demonstration that these two peptide toxins mediate their effects through different receptor subunits. Furthermore, resistance to neonicotinoid insecticides, which interact most strongly with Hv1a binding, has been associated with Dβ2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Perry et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Perry et al., 2021</xref>), consistent with the involvement of this subunit in the response to Hv1a.

Multiple binding sites for the neonicotinoid imidacloprid can be resolved in equilibrium binding assays in many insect species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Xu et al., 2010</xref>) and by binding kinetics in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu and Casida, 1993</xref>).</p><p>The agonist actions of neonicotinoids were investigated with <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> Dα1/Dβ1, Dα1/Dα2/Dβ1, Dα1/Dβ1/Dβ2, and Dα1/Dα2/Dβ1/Dβ2 nAChRs expressed in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes, indicating that Dβ1 subunit is a key player in the recognition of these insecticides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ihara et al., 2020</xref>). It would be interesting to know if Dβ1 also plays a role in the in vivo interaction with insecticidal peptide toxins such as α-Btx or Hv1a, which is difficult to fully investigate because of the deleterious effects of <italic>nAChRβ1</italic> mutations.

Electron microscopy analysis indicated that receptor-like particles were recovered and these were substantially enriched by α-Btx pull-down. Mass spectrometry analysis showed an enrichment for the Dα5, Dα6 and Dα7 subunits in these preparations, which is concordant with our in vivo injection results and previous studies that characterised aspects of α-Btx binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lansdell and Millar, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lansdell et al., 2012</xref>).

In a prior study, they implicated Dα6 and Dα7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lansdell and Millar, 2004</xref>). However, these assays were performed with 5HT3A-nAChR subunit fusions, here we provide strong evidence that these three subunits bind to α-Btx in vitro and in vivo.</p><p>We note that at least some of the α-Btx binding receptors are likely to contain at least two Dα6 subunits since our non-reducing Western blots showed the presence of a dimer in the pull-downs. In addition, glycopeptide enrichment showed site specific glycosylation modifications on the Dα5 and Dα7 nAChR subunit ligand-binding domains. The unique lipid environment and glycosylation sites of nAChR α-subunits from the electric ray, <italic>T. californica</italic>, were found to be important for α-Btx binding activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Quesada et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rahman et al., 2020</xref>), and structural studies support this conclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dellisanti et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Our work supports the view that there is a role for Dα5 and Dα7 glycosylation modifications in the recognition of α-Btx in <italic>D. melanogaster.</italic> We note that Lansdell and colleagues have shown that Dα3 is implicated in α-Btx binding if it is co-expressed together with a non α-subunit such as mammalian b2, γ or δ in S2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lansdell and Millar, 2000</xref>). We did observe single peptides from Dα3 and Dβ3 in our α-Btx enrichments and our glycoproteomic analysis with α-Btx binding pull-downs identified additional shared peptides from Dα5 and Dα7 but also Dα3 and Dβ3, suggesting that there may be at least some α-Btx binding to receptors containing Dα3 together with a non α-subunit like Dβ3.</p><p>Localisation studies with fluorescence tagged endogenous Dα6 subunit, along with preliminary data from further three subunits indicates that a strategy generating C-terminal tagged subunits may be effective in following endogenous nAChR expression and opens the possibility of exploring receptor subunit composition using subunits with different fluorescent tags. Our analysis of Dα6 localisation showed relatively restricted expression in the brain and ventral nerve cord, with prominent expression in the Kenyon cells of the mushroom body. Our observations are largely consistent with recent reports of <italic>nAChRα6</italic> expression derived from expression reporters, particularly the strong mushroom body expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Perry et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Martelli et al., 2022</xref>), although we do observe weaker expression in the larval optic lobes, prefacing the later expression in the adult brain.</p><p>Work generating in locus Gal4 fusions for a variety of neurotransmitter receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kondo et al., 2020</xref>) would seem to indicate wider adult brain expression than we and others observed, perhaps reflecting a degree of translational control or, more likely, limitations in the sensitivity of our live imaging compared to Gal4 driven reporters. The expression of Dα6 in Kenyon cells across development is in line with a proposed role for this subunit in memory plasticity, along with other α-subunits including Dα5, in mushroom body output neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barnstedt et al., 2016</xref>). While our <italic>nAChRα6</italic> mutant shows significant resistance to α-Btx we still find α-Btx binding in the absence of Dα6 in our pull-down assays, likely a reflection of its restricted localisation. In contrast, it is clear that Dα6 plays a major and specific role in binding to the insecticide spinosad in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> since mutations in this subunit are highly resistant to the toxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Perry et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Translating our neurotoxin binding results to other target species, there are several studies showing that nAChRs are sensitive to α-Btx in other insects, including the cockroach <italic>Periplaneta americana</italic>, the moth <italic>Manduca sexta</italic> and the housefly <italic>Musca domestica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Salgado and Saar, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eastham et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jones et al., 1981</xref>). The exact α-Btx binding mechanism in these organisms is unknown or under investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Salgado, 2021</xref>). This indicates broader implications for our in vivo study determining the α-Btx binding nAChR subunits in the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, with our results potentially extrapolated to other target species that have similar nAChR subunits.</p><p>In conclusion, we identified ligand-binding subunit sites for a <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> nAChR antagonist with newly insecticidal effects.

Third instar larvae (wandering stage) were transferred to an adhesive surface after being quickly washed with water to remove food residues and gently dried using paper tissue. The micropipette was positioned over the approximate centre of the body, on the dorsal side, and the tip was advanced through the cuticle into the hemocoel of the larva. Larvae were injected with 69 nL of PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) supplemented with 10% (v/v) filtered food dye (PME, moss green food colouring; 0.2 µm filter). Food dye was included to aid in monitoring the success of the injection under a dissection microscope (Leica MZ65, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom). ω‐hexatoxin‐Hv1a (Hv1a, Syngenta, Schaffhauserstrasse, CH-4332 Stein, Switzerland) and α-Bungarotoxin α-Btx (ab120542, Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom) were added to the injection mix in order to obtain a final concentration of 2.5 nmol/g and 1.25 nmol/g, respectively (average larval weight was 2.14 mg).</p><p>After injection, larvae were then gently transferred into agar/grape juice (Ritchie Products Limited, Burton-On-Trent, United Kingdom) plates and kept at 25 °C.

C-18 material (three C-18 plugs were pasted in a 200 μl pipette tip, Pierce C18 Spin Tips, 84,850 Thermo Scientific, Bishop’s Stortford, United Kingdom) was equilibrated with methanol/ 0.1% FA, 70% ACN/ 0.1% FA and with 0.1% FA. Peptides were loaded on C-18 material, washed with 0.1% FA and eluted with 70% ACN/0.1% FA. Samples were dried and finally, peptides were resuspended in 20 μl 0.1% FA. For glycopeptide enrichment, peptides were first desalted using Poros oligo r3 resin (1-339-09, Thermo Scientific, Bishop’s Stortford, United Kingdom) as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gobom et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Queiroz et al., 2019</xref>).

Micro columns were prepared with 200 μl peptide tips filled with a C8 plug and iHILIC – fusion 5 µm, 100 Å silica based material (HCS 160119, Hilicon, Umeå, Sweden). Peptides were solubilised stepwise in 19 μl dH<sub>2</sub>O and then in 80 μl ACN plus 1 μl TFA acid. The micro columns were cleaned with 50 μl 0.1% TFA and three times equilibrated with 100 μl 80% ACN, 1% TFA. Peptides were loaded onto the micro column and washed twice with 100 μl 80% ACN, 1% TFA. Glycopeptides were eluted from the column using twice 40 μl 0.1% TFA and finally with 20 μl 80% ACN, 1% TFA. Samples were dried in a speed vac before peptides were deglycosylated with Endo H or PNGase F according to manufacturer’s instructions (P07025 &amp; P0710S, New England Biolabs Inc, Hitchin, United Kingdom).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-14"><title>LC-MS/MS</title><p>Peptide samples were dissolved in 20 μl of 0.1% (v/v) FA. Approximately 1 μg peptide solution was used for each LC-MS/MS analysis. All LC-MS/MS experiments were performed using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 RSLC nanoUPLC (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, Waltham, MA, USA) system and a Q Exactive<sup>TM</sup> Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, Waltham, MA, USA). Separation of peptides was performed by reverse-phase chromatography at a flow rate of 300 nL/min and a Thermo Scientific reverse-phase nano Easy-spray column (Thermo Scientific PepMap C18, 2 μm particle size, 100 Å pore size, 75 μm i.d. x 50 cm length). Peptides were loaded onto a pre-column (Thermo Scientific PepMap 100 C18, 5 μm particle size, 100 A pore size, 300 μm i.d. x 5 mm length) via the Ultimate 3,000 autosampler with 0.1% FA for 3 min at a flow rate of 15 μL/min. After loading, the column valve was switched to allow elution of peptides from the pre-column onto the analytical column. Solvent A was water +0.1% FA and solvent B was 80% ACN, 20% water +0.1% FA. The linear gradient employed was 2%–40% B in 90 min (the total run time including column washing and re-equilibration was 120 min). In between runs columns were washed at least four times to avoid carry overs. The LC eluant ionised by means of an Easy-spray source (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc). An electrospray voltage of 2.1 kV was applied in order to ionise the eluant. All m/z values of eluting ions were measured in an Orbitrap mass analyzer, set at a resolution of 35,000 and scanned between m/z 380 and 1500. Data-dependent scans (Top 20) were employed to automatically isolate and generate fragment ions by higher energy collisional dissociation (HCD; Normalised collision energy (NCE): 25 %) in the HCD collision cell and measurement of the resulting fragment ions were performed in the Orbitrap analyser, set at a resolution of 17,500. Singly charged ions and ions with unassigned charge states were excluded from being selected for MS/MS and a dynamic exclusion of 20 s was employed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-15"><title>Peptide/protein database searching</title><p>Protein identification was carried out using Sequest HT or Mascot search engine software operating in Proteome Discoverer 2.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eng et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Koenig et al., 2008</xref>).

For each experimental investigation, n ≥ 3 were considered and data are represented as means ± SEM. Experiments were performed in a blinded manner whenever possible. Data are presented as mean ± SD. Statistical tests for SMALPs were performed using two-tailed t-test with an unequal variance and p values of ≤ 0.05 were considered to be significant. In DAVID, Fisher’s exact p values are computed to measure the gene-enrichment terms. Fisher’s exact p value of 0 represents perfect enrichment of a term. Usually p value of ≤ 0.05 are to be considered as strongly enriched. In this study, the default threshold set in DAVID of 0.1 was used. Linear regression analysis was performed in order to study the efficiency of SMALPs extraction of membrane receptors.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-17"><title>Structural assessment and illustration of nAChR subunits</title><p>For structural alignment of nAChRs matchmaker command operating in UCSF Chimera X 0.91 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goddard et al., 2018</xref>) was used.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Henriette Elisabeth Autzen (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Functional verification of the predicted subunit-specific toxin effects, also taking into account that these toxins bind at subunit interfaces.</p><p>2) Additional negative stain EM analysis to substantiate claims with adequate statistics, or adjust analysis and claims to reflect limitations.</p><p>3) Data on alpha5/7 localisation or a clear narrative and justification of why only alpha6 was subjected to localisation studies.</p><p>4) Language should be carefully revised based on the comments below to make it accessible to a broader audience. Additionally, the manuscript needs to better reflect prior work, provide greater clarity on the final genotypes of the knockout strains and provide additional context and motivation for the proteomic/glycosylation work.</p><p>A straightforward way to address these requests would be inclusion of additional results. Further details of these concerns are in the reviews, along with suggestions that we hope you will find helpful.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Further comments and suggestions to the authors:</p><p>1) One is left to wonder why the authors didn't run the solubilized sample on an SDS page gel and subject it to Western blotting with nAChR specific antibodies to show how α-Btx affinity resin helped enrich the sample with nAChR. This would have been more quantitative than their TEM analysis.</p><p>2) The authors should provide info on the amount of membrane (g) used in their SMA solubilization described in the methods section.</p><p>3) The authors should substantiate their TEM analysis and claims with statistics by collecting more than a single TEM micrograph and used TEM software to calculate 2D class averages and compare those to see if there are &quot;side&quot; and top views of nAChR. The authors should also provide details on how many images their analysis is based upon in the methods section.</p><p>4) Figure 3C which validates coupling of α-Btx to the resin rightfully belongs in a lab notebook, not as a figure in the main text.</p><p>5) The authors should include a description of how to calculate the hydrophobicity score.</p><p>6) Line 308. As a reader, one wonders why there is no evidence of peptides mapping to TMH domains. The authors should explain.</p><p>7) Lines 308-310. The authors should expand their description of the mapping of the identified peptides. It is not clear why the identified peptides are outside of the α-Btx binding sites with the information that is currently given.</p><p>8) A Figure like the one in Supplement 3B should be found in the main text figures and not in the supplement. However, the figure should be better annotated such that the reader can easily understand whether the α-Btx is docked into the model or part of it.</p><p>9) Figure 6B. It is not clear which flowthrough that is meant. From α-Btx resin or the HILIC resin.</p><p>10) Information on how the -SMALP sample was prepared is missing from the methods. Was it simply prepared without SMA in the buffer or was something different done?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This study was carefully and comprehensively conducted to demonstrate that the two peptide toxins differentially target insect nAChRs by in vivo and biochemical experiments. It is, however, noteworthy that the in vivo data may be the results of compensation by other nAChR subunits. In the paper the ventral nerve cords of adult flies were used to purify the proteins but when other preparations or parts are used, different results may be obtained. The pull-down assay identified the main targets, but in the case of α Btx, alpha3 was also identified but in much lower frequency, which should also be noted in the text as a fact. As regards localisation of the subunits, it is plausible to investigate the localisation of α5 and α7 subunits to examine if these subunits are colocalized with α6 to form heteromers as the toxin binding sites.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The use of the term deletion to describe the strains is not quite accurate. The genes are clearly disrupted by the constructs and so a more appropriate term along these lines could be considered.</p><p>For the injection assay results, presentation of the individual replicate data points on the figure 2 would be a clearer way to provide insights to the reader regarding variability rather than relying on the table. I also have a question about the description of the figure (line 190) of there being 10 larvae per replicate, however there are a number of data points where 25% is reported in Appendix Table 2. How was this calculated and would raw data be more suitable to report in the table given the number of larvae tested was 10 for each replicate?</p><p>Related to the point in the public review, if the Dbeta1 strain in this study is able to survive until pupation, would it be possible to conduct the injection experiments on these to assay for the involvement of Dbeta1, particularly in the action of Hvl1a? This would enable results from the full set of genes to be reported, strengthening the findings.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74322.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Functional verification of the predicted subunit-specific toxin effects, also taking into account that these toxins bind at subunit interfaces.</p></disp-quote><p>In order to fully address this revision point, the following details were provided upon our request.</p><p>i) the comments made by reviewer #2 (i.e the request to test the toxins on recombinantly expressed nAChRs to support claims on subunit specificity)</p><p>ii) A more general request to revise the language to account for the fact that the toxins bind to subunit interfaces. In other words: we ask the authors to be more explicit on whether they conclude that the toxins bind to the interface of two identical subunits</p><p>(homomeric α5-α5 / α6-α6 / α7-α7 interfaces) or requires only a single principal (+) (or complementary (-)) interface of either of the toxin-binding subunits (α5, α6 or α7).</p><p>Please feel free to reach out if anything else requires clarification.</p><p>From our mass spectrometry data we cannot conclude whether a homomeric or a heteromeric receptor consisting of Dα5, Dα6, Dα7 binds to α-Btx. However, as we note in the manuscript, since we recover α-Btx bound receptors in each of the mutant pull-downs it is unlikely that a single receptor subtype is responsible. We include new Western blot data with tagged Dα6 that indicate at least one binding receptor contains a Dα6 dimer (Figure 3figure supplement 1C, 1D). These dimers are lost by adding dithiothreitol after performing pull-downs with α-Btx affinity beads (Figure 3C). We also note that Lansdell and colleagues show in an S2 expression system that a homomeric Dα6/5HT3A chimeric complex is able to bind on the cell surface to α-Btx, this aligns with our finding (Lansdell et al., 2004). Testing recombinant nAChRs in Xenopus laevis for α-Btx goes far beyond our in vivo analysis, which we note is well supported by cited data from heterologous or cell line systems. We emphasize that both our genetic and biochemical data are consistent with our claims and support the view that the Dα5, Dα6 and Dα7 subunits are involved in binding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Additional negative stain EM analysis to substantiate claims with adequate statistics, or adjust analysis and claims to reflect limitations.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed additional negative stain EM analysis and provide our reproduced TEM micrographs (Figure3-Source Data1). Further images were taken from purified nAChRs fractions. Membrane pellets were solubilized with SMA and these fractions were used to enrich for nAChRs with pull-downs using α-Btx affinity beads. TEM micrographs of negative stain grids were taken from three independent biological replicates using w1118, thus total we provide 28 images (15 micrographs from purified nAChRs with α-Btx affinity resin and 13 micrographs from total SMALP fractions before enriching nAChRs with α-Btx, Figure3 Source Data1). Counting individual particles or structures in the micrographs is not possible due to the complexity and heterogeneity within the samples.</p><p>From the newly acquired images it has become clearer that the nAChRs seem to bind to the TEM film grids in a preferred orientation providing mostly top/bottom views. This makes it much harder to visualize side views of the nAChR receptors as they are rarely positioned on the grids in that orientation. The heterogeneity within the samples and the preferred orientation of the nAChRs on the TEM grids does not allow to record a sufficient number of TEM micrographs in a certain orientation to undertake 2D class averaging (Gallagher et al., 2019).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Data on alpha5/7 localisation or a clear narrative and justification of why only alpha6 was subjected to localisation studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided more detail on why Dα6 was used in the localization studies. In brief, there are several studies reporting Gal4 driven Dα6 localization and RNA localization data, giving us information to validate our novel endogenous gene tagging approach. We emphasize that this was a pilot study to test the feasibility of the N-terminal tagging approach and in support of this provide a supplementary figure with preliminary data tagging three other subunits.</p><p>In addition, Dα6 is a well characterized target of the Spinosad insecticide (Zimmer et al., 2016; Martelli et al., 2022), which meant our tagged line was likely to have broader relevance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Language should be carefully revised based on the comments below to make it accessible to a broader audience. Additionally, the manuscript needs to better reflect prior work, provide greater clarity on the final genotypes of the knockout strains and provide additional context and motivation for the proteomic/glycosylation work.</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited all the comments below as best as we can to improve understanding. In addition, we have incorporated earlier findings and increased citations to prior work to better contextualise our findings. We provided more clarity on the phenotype of our newly constructed knockout strains, improved figures, and added a detailed motivation for our proteomic/glycosylation work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A straightforward way to address these requests would be inclusion of additional results.

The authors should also provide details on how many images their analysis is based upon in the methods section.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed additional negative stain electron microscopy (EM) analysis of three biological replicates. Requested additional EM experiments were performed with SMALP samples which were enriched with α-Btx affinity beads. Moreover, additional micrographs from SMALP samples without enriching them for nAChR were formed as requested. By repeating our analysis, we found increased numbers of ring-like structures in samples enriched for nAChRs that were not evident in unenriched preparations. Close inspection of the micrographs revealed no other obvious recurring structures.</p><p>It is possible be that nAChRs preferentially bind to TEM film grids in a certain orientation during negative staining, an issue known with other receptors and proteins. One reason for this could be the upper surface of the carbon grid, which allows the particles to only turn in a certain direction (Gallagher et al., 2019).</p><p>We describe in the methods section how many micrographs we used in the study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 3C which validates coupling of α-Btx to the resin rightfully belongs in a lab notebook, not as a figure in the main text.</p></disp-quote><p>We removed and replaced Figure 3C with Western blotting data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors should include a description of how to calculate the hydrophobicity score.</p></disp-quote><p>We included a detailed description how we calculated the hydrophobicity score:</p><p>“The hydrophobicity score was calculated by the sum of the hydrophobic or hydrophilic properties of amino acids divided by the length of identified proteins.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Line 308.

After our enrichment of nAChRs to study glycosylated peptides of receptor subunits we identified Dα3 and Dβ3. These two subunits were only identified after deglycosylation of enriched peptides with Endo H but not with a PNGase F treatment suggesting that these subunits are modified and are difficult in their identification.</p><p>Additional Western blotting investigations were performed and suggest that two Dα6 subunits interact with α-Btx (Figure 3—figure supplement 1 C, 1D). This may indicate that two Dα6 subunits are next to each other in a nAChR complex. From our mass spectrometry data we cannot rule out if Dα5, Dα6 and Dα7 each form a homomeric α5-α5 / α6-α6 / α7α7 interface that binds to α-Btx or if there are also other heteromeric possibilities feasible.</p><p>Given that none of the mutants are completely resistant to α-Btx and that pull downs in each of the mutants still have α-Btx binding, it suggests to us that α-Btx binding receptors can exist in a number of conformations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The use of the term deletion to describe the strains is not quite accurate.
