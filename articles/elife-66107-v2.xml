Aberrant repair after muscle injury can results in scarring, fibrosis, lipid infiltration, or heterotopic ossification (HO; bone formation in an inappropriate site). Although HO is a relatively uncommon complication, it can form after trauma, burns, spinal cord injuries, and surgical procedures such as hip arthroplasty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Matsuo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Meyers et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sullivan et al., 2013</xref>). Recently, HO has been reported in patients with severe COVID-19, suggesting a critical role for inflammation and muscle damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aziz et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>To better understand the link between skeletal muscle and HO, we studied fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) as a prototypical condition.

SCs marked by PAX7 (Paired Box 7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Seale et al., 2000</xref>), are a prerequisite for skeletal muscle regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mauro, 1961</xref>) and are thought to be the main human muscle stem cells (Hu-MuSCs) of postnatal skeletal muscle. Upon injury, activated SCs give rise to myoblasts, which form new myofibers or fuse to existing muscle fibers to repair muscle damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kuang et al., 2007</xref>). A subset of SCs does not differentiate and serves to replenish the SC pool. The BMP pathway is critical for maintaining <italic>PAX7</italic> expression in primary MuSCs and for preventing commitment to myogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Friedrichs et al., 2011</xref>). Abrogation of BMP signaling in SCs slowed myofiber growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stantzou et al., 2017</xref>), and increased BMP4 levels in Duchenneâs muscular dystrophy (DMD) can exacerbate the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shi et al., 2013</xref>). However, how the BMP pathway regulates muscle repair or SC function in conditions of HO such as FOP remains unclear and is a major knowledge gap.</p><p>Since primary tissues can only and safely be obtained from deceased FOP patients because of the risks of heterotopic ossification at the surgical site, patient-derived human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) provide a strategy to create FOP cells for in vitro and mouse xeno-transplant studies. Interestingly, BMP signaling is a key pathway that can be manipulated to make Hu-MuSCs-like cells from hiPSCs (iMPCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chal et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xi et al., 2017</xref>). Recent protocols to create Hu-MuSCs-like cells from hiPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Takahashi et al., 2007</xref>) could generate skeletal myogenic lineage cells, but with limited muscle regenerative capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Borchin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Magli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shelton et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">van der Wal et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xi et al., 2017</xref>). PAX7 cell engraftment capability was often not reported or showed limited success. Transgene-induced <italic>PAX7</italic> or <italic>PAX3</italic> expression in hiPSCs can increase engraftment of PAX7<sup>+</sup> cells and contribution to the SC pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al Tanoury et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wu et al., 2018</xref>); however, these engineered cells may not reflect physiology due to the genetic manipulation of these master transcription factors.</p><p>In this study, we used primary human muscle stem cells isolated from deceased FOP subjects and hiPSC-derived muscle progenitor cells from FOP subjects to elucidate how <italic>ACVR1</italic><sup><italic>R206H</italic></sup> affects muscle stem cell function and regenerative ability. Primary FOP Hu-MuSCs can engraft and regenerate injured muscle of immunocompromised (NSG) mice, but at lower efficiency than Hu-MuSCs from non-FOP donors, and the source of FOP Hu-MuSCs (biceps vs. diaphragm) appears to impact their engraftment efficiency. A new non-transgenic strategy for creating human iMPCs was developed and applied to multiple hiPSC lines from control subjects and subjects with FOP.

Our study uses the abnormal ACVR1 activity of FOP to dissect how the BMP/ACVR1 pathways impact skeletal muscle repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In the case of FOP, muscle injury can trigger disease progression or severe complications. Thus, generating large numbers of human iMPCs using transgene-free protocols holds promise for understanding pathological mechanisms and finding new therapeutic targets. The findings in FOP are also likely to help inform why HO sometimes forms in other conditions of muscle injury or inflammation, including burns, CNS injury, rheumatologic disorders, trauma, and surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Matsuo et al., 2019</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Testing the role of activated ACVR1 signaling in muscle repair.</title><p>FOP iMPCs and FOP primary human muscle stem cells are used for modeling muscle stem cell engraftment and regeneration properties.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-66107-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>This study revealed several novel findings, including deficiencies in the muscle repair capacity of FOP Hu-MuSCs obtained from two different subjects, abnormal production of extracellular matrix components by iMSCs and FOP Hu-MuSCs that may contribute to FOP disease progression, and important differences between primary Hu-MuSCs and iMPCs that may impact other studies. In addition, our results suggest that there are muscle specific differences in FOP Hu-MuSC repair capacity, potentially explaining why some skeletal muscles appear to be protected from developing HO.</p><p>The iMPC and primary Hu-MuSC single cell transcriptomes revealed clear subsets of cells at all stages of muscle differentiation (quiescent, activated, and differentiated). Satellite cell subtype markers e.g. <italic>COLs</italic>, <italic>DLK1</italic>, <italic>ID3</italic>, and <italic>HES1,</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barruet et al., 2020</xref>) were also highly expressed in iMPCs suggesting that in vitro differentiation may favor specific subtypes of satellite cells. iMPCs also expressed high levels of mesenchymal/ECM markers, similar to that in human fetal muscle progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Xi et al., 2020</xref>). These results suggest that iMPCs may retain a more progenitor-like phenotype as compared to Hu-MuSCs. In addition, we showed that PAX7<sup>+</sup> iMPCs can engraft in muscle injury models in mice but at lower efficiency.</p><p>This iMPC system revealed that activation of the BMP pathway by the FOP <italic>ACVR1</italic><sup><italic>R206H</italic></sup> mutation induced changes that could contribute to abnormal muscle healing. As expected, the classical SMAD pathways were active in FOP cells; however, it was unexpected to find that the p38 pathway via JUN/FOS was more active in the FOP iMPCs, considering that FOP cultures had a higher proportion of cells in the stem cell/progenitor and proliferating phases. While increased SMAD activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Billings et al., 2008</xref>) or misinterpretation of the Activin A ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hatsell et al., 2015</xref>) occur with the <italic>ACVR1</italic><sup><italic>R206H</italic></sup> mutation, abnormal p38 signaling may be critical in some cell types like macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barruet et al., 2018</xref>). Since p38 is a major regulator of Hu-MuSC function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">SegalÃ©s et al., 2016</xref>) and has been associated with inflammation and ECM accumulation in aged muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cosgrove et al., 2014</xref>), further studies are needed to determine how this p38 signaling contributes to satellite cell subtype specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barruet et al., 2020</xref>) and affect healing in FOP.</p><p>Importantly, our iMPC and Hu-MuSC transplant studies showed no HO in the recipient mice, consistent with prior FOP genetic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lees-Shepard et al., 2018</xref>) describing that other cell types may be directly responsible for bone formation. Indeed, several reports have suggested fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) as a candidate cell population to FOP pathogenesis. Interestingly, there are functional cross-talk between satellite cells and FAPs which is critical for muscle repair in homeostasis, disease, and aging contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Biferali et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Farup et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lukjanenko et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wosczyna and Rando, 2018</xref>). However, FOP iMPCs showed increased chondrogenic/osteogenic and ECM gene expression, a feature seen in other bone-related cell types in FOP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barruet et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Culbert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lees-Shepard et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, one possibility would be for FOP Hu-MuSCs to further contribute to HO formation indirectly by modulation of the osteogenic environment such as contributing to changes in muscle stiffness, as previously reported in FOP mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Haupt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stanley et al., 2019</xref>). This has also been reported in aged muscle, which show increased myofiber stiffness due to increased ECM deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hwang and Brack, 2018</xref>). In addition, while our results suggest no major differences or possibly a slight increase in the ability to form skeletal muscle progenitors, activated ACVR1 by the <italic>R206H</italic> mutation decreased (but did not abrogate) in vitro formation of mature myoblasts of FOP hiPSCs and in vivo muscle repair after transplant of primary FOP Hu-MuSCs.</p><p>Comparing primary FOP Hu-MuSCs from muscles that develop HO (biceps) and non-affected muscle (diaphragm) suggests that the source of the Hu-MuSCs may impact engraftment efficiency. The re-injury model showed that engraftment of Hu-MuSCs from FOP biceps, but not from diaphragm, remained significantly decreased. Thus, it is intriguing to consider that the clinical sparing of the diaphragm from HO in patients with FOP may result from a less impaired or unimpaired muscle repair process in diaphragm satellite cells. Further delineation of muscle-specific Hu-MuSC properties will be revealing to understand this observation. Our finding that primary FOP Hu-MuSCs have lower engraftment ability provides a potential explanation for the poor skeletal muscle repair observed in patients with FOP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shore, 2012</xref>). However, the FOP and control iMPCs showed no major differences in engraftment, possibly due to decreased assay sensitivity from the lower engraftment efficiency of iMPCs in general, which could be explained by iMPCs being more immature than primary Hu-MuSCs, the presence of cell contaminants after isolation, or that iMPCs represent a subtype of cells that may be more reflective of non-ossifying skeletal muscle like diaphragm.</p><p>This study has several limitations. Our transplant experiments used immunocompromised mice where mature B and T cells are absent and macrophages are defective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shultz et al., 2005</xref>). This may dampen the engraftment/regenerative phenotypes, particularly as immune cells are important in muscle regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Furrer and Handschin, 2017</xref>) and there is growing awareness of the role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of FOP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barruet et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Convente et al., 2018</xref>). Also, while our FACS strategy can isolate Hu-MuSCs and iMPCs without the need of transcription factors or markers, we noted that the engraftment efficiency still varied among the iMPC lines despite FACS purification. This heterogeneity is an ongoing problem among all published iMPC protocols to date. In our case, this was counter-balanced by our consistent findings across multiple lines and between iMPCs and the availability of primary Hu-MuSCs despite the absence of isogenic control and FOP lines. Although our primary cell studies were limited by the rarity of FOP (estimated at 1 in 1.4 million people) and even rarer suitable cadaveric samples where we were only able to obtain Hu-MSCs from two FOP subjects, the combination of iPSC-derived lineages with the rare primary samples provided multiple avenues for supporting our conclusions. Finally, the <italic>ACVR1</italic><sup><italic>R206H</italic></sup> mutation increases BMP signaling but also introduces neofunction to Activin A. Our studies are not able to distinguish between these two contributing pathways. Our finding of increased p38 activity in the FOP iMPCs was also seen in FOP subject monocyte-derived macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barruet et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that this alternate signaling pathway by ACVR1 should also be investigated further. Future studies, including the use of isogenic control lines, testing of neutralizing antibodies to directly target the ACVR1<sup>WT</sup> or ACVR1<sup>R206H</sup> receptors, and the use of other small molecule inhibitors of pathways downstream of ACVR1 (e.g. p38 or SMAD), will help elucidate the different factors that contribute to the hiPSC-line specific effects, including potential roles for disease modifier genes or BMP pathway modulators.</p><p>This study shows that human iPSC-derived muscle progenitor cells can be a valuable tool to model musculoskeletal diseases of skeletal muscle injury and repair. Correlating the findings in iMPCs with primary Hu-MuSCs revealed an indirect role for skeletal muscle progenitors in HO formation, as well as potential subtypes of Hu-MuSCs that could contribute to skeletal muscle specific regenerative capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These studies highlight the importance of skeletal muscle regeneration in disease pathogenesis and establish a foundation for understanding how skeletal muscle repair and osteogenesis are

Each sample was sequenced on 1 lane of the NovaSeq 6,000 S4. Sequencing reads were processed with Cell Ranger version 2.0.0. using the human reference transcriptome GRCh38. The estimated number of cells, mean reads per cell, median genes per cells, median UMI (Unique Molecular Identifier) counts per cells as well as other quality control information are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4âsource data 1</xref>. Gene-barcoded matrices were analyzed with the R package Seurat v3.1.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Satija et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Team, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>). Gene core matrices from single cell RNA sequencing of primary human satellite cells isolated from a vastus muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barruet et al., 2020</xref>) was used when comparing the transcriptional profile of hiPS-derived HNK1<sup>-</sup>CD45<sup>-</sup>CD31<sup>-</sup> CXCR4<sup>+</sup>CD29<sup>+</sup>CD56<sup>dim</sup> cells. For the comparison with primary Hu-MuSCs, hiPSC-derived cell sequencing reads were re-aligned using the human reference transcriptome hg19. Cells with fewer than 500 genes, greater than 5,000 genes and genes expressed in fewer than five cells were not included in the downstream analyses. Cells with more than 10 % mitochondrial counts were filtered out. Samples were normalized with NormalizeData using default settings. The FindVariableFeatures function was used to determine subset of feature that exhibit high cell-to-cell variation in each dataset based on a variance stabilizing transformation (âvstâ). We used the default setting returning 2000 feature per dataset. These were used for downstream analysis. In the case of the merged data analysis samples were combined utilizing the FindIntegrationAnchors function with the âdimensionalityâ set at 30. Then, we ran these âanchorsâ to the IntegratData function for batch correction for all cells enabling them to be jointly analyzed. The resulting outputs were scaled mitochondrial contamination regressed out with the ScaleData function. In addition, while we didnât regress out heterogeneity associated with cell cycle stage since it is an important factor in determining the state of quiescence of our sorted human muscle stem cells, we regressed out differences between G2/M and S cell cycle stage. PCA was performed with RunPCA, and significant PCs determined based on the Scree plot utilizing the function PCElbowPlot. The resolution parameter in FindClusters was adjusted to 0.5. Clusters were visualized by UMAP with Seuratâs RunUMAP function. We performed differential gene-expression utilizing Seurat v3âs FindMarkers function with default settings which utilizes the Wilcoxon rank-sum test to calculate adjusted p values for multiple comparisons. We used the CellCycleScoring function to assign score based on the expression of G2/M and S phase markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Regev et al., 2017</xref>). Myogenic cells were further analyzed by sub-clustering using the subset function. We then use the FindNeighbors (dims = 15) and FindClusters (resolution = 0.4) functions on the myogenic cell subset of the merged hiPSCs samples only to identify sub-clusters corresponding to different myogenic states. To order the cells in pseudotime based on their transcriptional similarity we used Monocle 2.12. Variable genes from Seurat analysis were used as input and clusters were projected onto the minimum spanning tree after ordering. Gene expression patterns were plotted with plot_genes_branched_heatmap, plot_genes_branched_pseudotime, and plot_multiple_branches_pseudotime. The BEAM (branch expression analysis modeling) function was used to score gene significance in a branch-dependent manner. Cells were re-ordered using the orderCells function to set branch A (myocytes) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref> as the âroot-stateâ.

The authors performed a variety of transplantation/histological analyses, as well as transcriptional profiling. Weaknesses were noted with the data analysis and in places, claims on mechanism were overly strongly stated.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Barruet et al., explore the impact of ACVR1R206H mutation responsible for FOP on skeletal muscle stem cells. In this rare genetic disease, over-activating point mutation in ACVR1 causes ectopic bone formation within skeletal muscles. This pathological response may occur due in part to abnormal skeletal muscle repair following injury, yet the cellular bases are not fully understood. Previous studies have revealed that the cells of origin for the ectopic bone formation are mesenchymal populations within the skeletal muscle interstitium, the fibro-adipo-progenitors (FAP), while ACVR1R206H mutation in other cell types such as endothelial cells or muscle stem cells alone do not cause the disease. However, the ACVR1R206H mutation in cell types other than FAP may contribute to the abnormal tissue environment and to the progression of the disease. Research aiming to elucidate the cellular mechanisms of FOP is hampered by the difficulty to have access to patient samples as muscle biopsy itself can trigger an injury response contributing to disease progression. Dr. Hsiao's team has developed over the past years the iPSCs technology to obtain FOP iPSCs in order to assess the consequences of ACVR1R206H mutation in several cell lineages. In this study, the authors concentrate on the myogenic lineage, and compare the muscle regenerative potential and transcriptome profiling by scRNAseq of iPSC-derived muscle stem/progenitor cells (iMPCs) and primary human muscle stem cells (Hu-MuSCs). Overall the data is of high quality. The results reveal that Hu-MuSCs from FOP patients have reduced regenerative potential compared to control. Reduced engraftment capacity was observed for Hu-MuSCs isolated from biceps but not diaphragm muscle. This correlates with the fact that diaphragm muscle is less affected in FOP, although results from diaphragm control would have further supported the claim. The authors used iPSCs from FOP patients and control to perform scRNAseq analyses. Reporting the similarities and differences in transcriptional signature of primary Hu-MuSCs and hiMPCs is an important contribution to the field and validates the use of iMPCs to further elucidate disease mechanisms. The conclusions drawn from the data presented were overreaching, which was in part due to a lack of clarity in the stated problem statement they were trying to address.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Barruet et al., investigates an interesting and rare skeletal muscle dystrophy (FOP).

We agree that the low engraftment of our iMPCs poses challenges for our analysis. We explore several reasons for this, including the possibility of other cell types present in the cultures (as described in Figure 4B-C) such as neuroprogenitor, neuroepithelial, glial, and mesenchymal cells. In addition, we believe that inclusion of the low engraftment efficiency samples in our data analyses is important, since we did not know if the ACVR1 mutation might increase engraftment. Such an unexpected effect was previously observed, where the <italic>ACVR1 <sup>R206H</sup></italic> mutation unexpectedly increased efficiency of iPSC formation (Hayashi, et al., PNAS, 2016). We revised the discussion to better state this limitation, and adjusted text throughout the manuscript to clarify this limitation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

In Figure 2D, the heterogeneity of our myogenic gene expression data can be explained by the presence of other cells types which has been described previously (Shelton et al., 2015 Stem Cell Reports; Hicks et al., 2018 Nat Cell Biol) and shown in Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B with TUJ-1 staining, Figure 3, and Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A with FACS analysis for CD45 (hematopoietic cells) and CD31 (endothelial cells).

In addition, strategies to directly target <italic>ACVR1</italic><sup><italic>WT</italic></sup> vs. <italic>ACVR1</italic><sup><italic>R206H</italic></sup> receptors are still being developed. Also, the direct targeting of the BMP pathway b the inhibitors will also inhibit the aberrant signaling induced by Activin A on ACVR1<sup>R206H</sup>.

LDN has a long track record of being used to inhibit the SMAD signaling pathways of the BMPs, and particularly the signaling downstream of ACVR1, and in our results suggested benefits for both FOP and control cells in myogenic differentiation. However, the heterogeneity in our current studies, the relatively low efficiency of transplantation by both control and FOP cells, and the lack of large numbers of primary cells prevent us from dissecting further the other signaling circuitry of ACVR1 (ie SMAD vs. p38, or ACVR1 itself). We hope to pursue these detailed studies in the future. This is clarified in the limitations paragraph of the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13.

Although at first glance it may seem that the muscle stem cells are too diluted in the dataset, we note that despite the overall number of cells per sample (7309 cells after filtering), the proportion of the population of interest (1009 cells or 13.8%) is still higher than physiological proportion (2-7%, Yablonka-Reuveni et al., 2011 J Histochem Cytochem). While higher cell numbers are often preferable, our studies using 1000 muscle cells is in fact a reasonable number: Past studies on rare population have been performed on similar or lower cell number (Rubenstein et al., 2020 Scientific reports; De Micheli et al., 2020 Cell Reports). In addition, using the Seurat algorithm (https://satijalab.org/howmanycells/) we would need only 624 cells to be 95% confident that our sample contains at least 5 cells from each cell types. Thus, we believe our analyses are reflective of the underlying biology we are observing.</p><p>We analyzed the expression of typical chondro/osteogenic markers that have been found to be altered in other cell types carrying the <italic>ACVR1</italic><sup><italic>R206H</italic></sup> mutation. This is now presented in Figure 5âfigure supplement 1F,G. <italic>SP7</italic> (Osterix) was not found to be expressed. Overall, those markers have very low level of expression, relatively few cells expressed them and none of them were significantly differentially expressed. <italic>Sox9</italic> expression is increased in FOP clusters.</p><p>We also analyzed the expression of cinq genes (<italic>CYR61</italic>, <italic>CTGF</italic>, <italic>NOV</italic> and <italic>WISPs</italic>) which have been shown to be induced during the process of trauma-induced HO and where WISP1 may have act as a negative regulator (Hsu et al., 2020 JCI Insight). None of those genes were significantly differentially expresse; however, CTGF expression was increased in FOP cells. Because this does not significantly impact our conclusions, these data are provided for the reviewer but not included in the current version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16. Fewer cells were analysed in the control sample compared to FOP sample.

However, as indicated in Figure 4-Source Data1, the Median Genes per cells is equivalent, thus compensating for the reads/cell difference and making our comparison relevant. Hence, we did not perform compensatory analyses, but have chosen to represent our results using Violin plots. These plots enable visualization of the probability density of a given gene expression in various samples, thus minimizing cell number bias between samples.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17. In Figure 4, very few Pax7+ and Myod + cells are detected in the myogenic cluster. To what extent are the differences between control and FOP samples due to non pax7+ cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important question. One major limitation of scRNAseq is the low sensitivity that doesnât detect all transcripts; therefore, scRNAseq analyses use unsupervised clustering as an unbiased way to identify various cell populations and subtypes. At the time this study was performed, the 3â v2 kit from 10X Genomics was standard, and thus was used for this study. Additional published studies from our groups and others on human satellite cells have shown that this newer version can detect higher proportion of PAX7 expressing satellite cells (Barruet et al., 2020 <italic>eLife</italic>; DellâOrso et al., 2019 Development). Despite the low amount of non-PAX7+ cells we were still able to confirm findings from our FOP primary Hu-MuSCs showing an increase in ECM and chondro-osteogenic markers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18.

The pseudotime analyses are were very confusing to the reviewers and the suitability and rigor of this analysis was questioned. The starting point A contains cluster 4 cells that are MYOG+ and MYOD1+. In panel D, how can differentiation markers exhibit a non-linear progression? Chondro/osteogenic markers should be validated and more specific.</p></disp-quote><p>We re-performed the pseudotime analyses in Figure 5 D-F as suggested, and adjusted the branch order for the pseudotime trajectories of myogenic markers for more clarity. While pseudotime analysis does not always reflect linear time, it can be useful to map gene expression changes that occur between cell populations. HuMuSC differentiation and return to quiescence is a dynamic process. Indeed, under the right stimuli, HuMuSCs undergo asymmetric division after proliferation by either self-renewal to replenish their pool or differentiation to form myotubes (Feige et al., 2018 Cell Stem Cell). It is highly probable that similar changes are happening in our myogenic differentiation thus exhibiting a non-linear progression of the myogenic markers. Indeed, our scRNAseq analysis shows different states of muscle stem cells in Figure 5B. The tip of branch A is now constituted of cycling muscle stem cells that have low expression of <italic>MYOG</italic>. The drop of <italic>MYOD1</italic> expression can be associated with cells returning to a more quiescent state such as cluster 0 which is located along to more proximal end of branch A and in the branchesâ intersection (Figure 5F). As expected, the myoblast cluster has higher level of <italic>MYOG</italic> and <italic>MYOD1</italic> expression.</p><p>Chrondro/osteogenic markers that have been reported to be upregulated in FOP cells are analyzed and shown in Figure 5âfigure supplement1 (see reviewerâs comment #15).</p></body></sub-article></article>
