To identify mechanisms that scale the spindle during <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> embryogenesis, we established an in vitro system using cytoplasmic extracts prepared from embryos that recapitulates in vivo spindle size differences between stage 3 (4 cells, 37 µm) and stage 8 (∼4000 cells, 18 µm). We identified the kinesin-13 kif2a as a driver of developmental spindle scaling whose microtubule-destabilizing activity is inhibited in stage 3 spindles by the transport receptor importin α, and activated in stage 8 when importin α partitions to a membrane pool. Altering spindle size in developing embryos impaired spindle orientation during metaphase, but chromosome segregation remained robust. Thus, spindle size in <italic>Xenopus</italic> development is coupled to cell size through a ratiometric mechanism controlling microtubule destabilization.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00290.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00290.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00290.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In the earliest stages of development, animal cells undergo multiple rounds of division without growth via a process known as mitosis. Over the course of just 12 rounds of cell division, a single fertilized egg is transformed into more than 4000 smaller cells.</p><p>Before dividing, the cell must first replicate its chromosomes. A structure called the mitotic spindle then separates the members of each chromosome pair and distributes them evenly between the two daughter cells. Given that the daughter cells become smaller with each round of division, the spindle must also become smaller to ensure that the chromosomes are pulled apart an appropriate distance. However, it has been unclear how the cell achieves this.</p><p>Now, Wilbur and Heald report insights into the mechanism by which spindle size is coordinated with cell size, using the model organism <italic>Xenopus laevis—</italic>a frog that produces large embryos that are easy to manipulate. They began by preparing extracts of cytoplasm from <italic>X. laevis</italic> embryos at two different developmental stages: one set of embryos contained 4 cells each and the other set contained ∼4000 cells. They found that the spindle, which is composed largely of microtubules—hollow filaments that can become longer or shorter through the addition or removal of tubulin building blocks—was almost twice as large in the four-cell embryos as in the more developed embryos.</p><p>Moreover, spindle size was determined by the actions of two proteins: kif2a and importin-α. Binding of kif2a destabilized microtubules and caused them to shorten; importin-α blocked this process by binding to kif2a and preventing it from interacting with microtubules. Wilbur and Heald found that over the course of development, importin-α became increasingly localized to the cell membrane, meaning that there was less available to bind to kif2a in the cytoplasm. This freed up kif2a to interact with and destabilize microtubules, and led ultimately to a reduction in spindle size.</p><p>Given that the overall ratio of cell surface membrane to cytoplasm increases as cells undergo division without growth, interaction between kif2a and importin-α could be the long-sought mechanism by which spindle and cell sizes are coordinated early in development.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00290.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00290.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>mitotic spindle</kwd><kwd>embryogenesis</kwd><kwd>microtubule</kwd><kwd>kif2a</kwd><kwd>intracellular scaling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM098766</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heald</surname><given-names>Rebecca</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An interaction between two proteins enables the spindle—the structure that segregates chromosome pairs during mitosis—to change size as cells divide.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell size varies widely among different organisms and cell types, and changes rapidly during early animal development when cell division occurs in the absence of growth. The mitotic spindle, a dynamic bipolar structure composed primarily of microtubules (MTs) and organizing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Walczak and Heald, 2008</xref>), must adjust to cell size to segregate chromosomes the proper distance and signal to the cell cortex to specify orientation of the cleavage furrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Levy and Heald, 2012</xref>). However, the mechanisms coordinating cell and spindle size are poorly understood, and the functional consequences of altering these mechanisms during vertebrate development are unknown.</p><p>Embryogenesis of the frog <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> typifies the developmental scaling problem, and both cell and spindle sizes have been measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wuhr et al., 2008</xref>). Following fertilization, the ∼1.2-mm-diameter egg synchronously divides 12 times at approximately 30-min intervals, leading to a ∼100-fold decrease in cell volume and at least a 20-fold decrease in cell diameter by the midblastula transition (stage 8.5), when zygotic transcription starts. Initially, the cortically localized meiosis II spindle (∼35 µm) segregates chromosomes a short distance, generating a small polar body that preserves egg cytoplasm. During the early cleavages, there is an upper limit to spindle size (∼60 µm), and astral microtubules mediate movement of chromosomes long distances during anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wuhr et al., 2008</xref>). At these stages, spindle size is small compared to cell size, and cytoplasmic mechanisms likely operate, since in vivo spindle size is maintained in extracts prepared from eggs or two-cell stage embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mitchison et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wuhr et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Loughlin et al., 2011</xref>). As cell and spindle size converge, a constant ratio of ∼2:1 cell diameter:spindle length is established, and spindle length reduces to ∼20 µm by the end of the synchronous cleavage divisions. To what extent cell size influences spindle size or if changes in cytoplasmic activities contribute to spindle scaling at these later stages is unknown.</p><p>Experiment and simulation indicate that the balance of MT nucleation, transport, and destabilization are critical for setting spindle size in egg extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Loughlin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brugues et al., 2012</xref>). By comparing two closely related <italic>Xenopus</italic> species, we showed previously that meiotic spindle size is partially controlled by activity of the MT severing protein katanin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Loughlin et al., 2011</xref>). However, the genetically encoded differences that underpinned variation in katanin activity cannot play a role during early development in an embryo with a single genetic background and when transcription is repressed. In early <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> development, decreasing spindle length correlates with a decrease in centrosome size and a decay gradient of the protein of TPXL-1 along spindle MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Greenan et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, spindle assembly in <italic>X. laevis</italic> egg extracts does not require centrosomes and depends heavily on a chromatin-centered gradient of RanGTP, which locally releases spindle assembly factors from the nucleocytoplasmic transport protein importin β and its adaptor importin α that binds nuclear localization sequence (NLS)–containing cargos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gruss et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kalab and Heald, 2008</xref>). The respective contribution of gradients and centrosomes are expected to alter spindle architecture and size, and could be influenced by cell size through availability of components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Goehring and Hyman, 2012</xref>). The gradual transition from meiotic to mitotic spindle architecture observed in mouse embryos supports this view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Courtois et al., 2012</xref>). Collectively, these observations suggest that changes in gradients and spindle assembly pathways are likely to accompany cell size changes and could influence spindle size.</p><p>To address how spindle size is determined during vertebrate embryogenesis, we created an embryo extract system capable of assembling spindles in cytoplasmic extracts at any stage of <italic>X. laevis</italic> development up to the midblastula transition when cell divisions become asynchronous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Newport and Kirschner, 1982</xref>). We compared stage 3 and stage 8, the two extremes of spindle size in our extract system, and found that MT dynamics are modified to reduce spindle size upon release of an inhibitory interaction between the MT depolymerizing kinesin kif2a and importin α. This occurs through redistribution of importin α from the cytoplasm to a membrane fraction. Taking advantage of this mechanism to modify spindle size without functionally perturbing the spindle allowed us to uncover an important role for spindle size in maintaining spindle orientation in the large cells of early <italic>Xenopus</italic> development. This work suggests that the changing physical features of the cell can drive intracellular scaling through biochemical partitioning and steady-state redistribution of activities.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Reconstitution of spindle size differences in extracts of developing embryos</title><p>To investigate how spindle size scales with cell size during development, we established a spindle reconstitution system utilizing cytoplasmic extracts from <italic>X. laevis</italic> embryos at different embryonic stages. This system is analogous to the cytostatic factor (CSF) arrested meiosis II extract derived from unfertilized <italic>X. laevis</italic> eggs, which has facilitated fundamental discoveries pertaining to the cell cycle and spindle assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Maresca and Heald, 2006</xref>). However, embryo extracts form mitotic rather than meiotic spindles, and spindles assemble to varying sizes corresponding to their developmental stage in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Since embryo extracts lack the natural metaphase arrest induced by CSF activity in egg extracts, it was necessary to artificially arrest them by adding a nondegradable form of cyclin B to maintain high cyclin-dependent kinase 1 activity together with a dominant negative inhibitor of the anaphase promoting complex, UbcH10 C114S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rape et al., 2006</xref>). Additionally, an empirically determined time point within each developmental stage was optimal for generating functional extracts. For example, to generate stage 3 extracts from embryos developing at 23°C, packing and crushing was initiated exactly 1 hr and 40 min after fertilization and completed 20 min later, just before the second embryonic cleavage would have occurred.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00290.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Embryo extracts recapitulate spindle scaling during development.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of early embryonic developmental stages of <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> used in this study and representative images of spindles formed in egg and embryo extracts and in fixed hemisected eggs or embryos.

Comparing the extracts that differed most, MTs typically appeared less dense in stage 8 spindles compared to stage 3 or meiosis II spindles, indicating different underlying MT architectures. In vivo spindle size can vary significantly within the different sized cells at a single developmental stage. For instance, stage 8 embryo spindles range from ∼20 µm in smaller cells of the animal pole to ∼50 µm in length in the large vegetal pole cells. Spindle size varied less within an embryo extract, and on average was slightly reduced compared to the equivalent stage in vivo. Stage 3 populations had average lengths ranging from ∼35 to 40 µm and stage 8, ∼17 to 20 µm, closer to the size of spindles in animal pole cells. The most common defect observed in embryo extract spindles was the failure of chromosomes to fully align at the metaphase plate, especially in stage 3 extracts, likely due to poor metaphase arrest (unpublished data). These observations indicate that embryo extracts do not entirely preserve spindle morphology and function. However, spindle scaling was apparent in vitro, with a ∼20 µm decrease in length between stage 3 and stage 8 extract spindles, compared to ∼30 µm in vivo.</p><p>To determine whether cytoplasmic mechanisms operate to control spindle size variation in the two extracts, we mixed them in different proportions before initiating spindle assembly. Altering the ratio of stage 3 and stage 8 extracts led to dose-dependent changes in spindle size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Since stage 8 extracts contain abundant endogenous nuclei whose chromosomes are incorporated into forming spindles, we wondered whether the ratio of nuclei to cytoplasm or the contents of endogenous nuclei were affecting spindle size in stage 8 extracts. We therefore compared reactions depleted of endogenous nuclei by centrifugation, or filtered to remove all nuclei, and then supplemented with exogenous sperm nuclei. Average spindle lengths were very similar in the presence of ∼2000 nuclei per microliter in untreated stage 8 extract, ∼1000 nuclei per microliter in centrifuged stage 8 extract, and ∼500 sperm nuclei per microliter in filtered stage 8 extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Furthermore, purified stage 8 nuclei added to stage 3 extracts yielded indistinguishable spindle lengths compared to sperm nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These experiments indicate that the major spindle size controlling factors in embryo extracts are soluble cytoplasmic components.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Spindles assembly occurs through different pathways in stage 3 and stage 8 extracts</title><p>To distinguish whether spindles assembled through different pathways in the two embryo extracts, we examined spindle assembly intermediates 15 min after reactions were initiated. Whereas MTs nucleated around chromatin in stage 3 extracts, and little interaction of centrosomal MTs with the forming spindle was observed, centrosomes provided most of the MT nucleation in stage 8 extracts and few MTs appeared around the chromosomes except when a centrosome was located nearby (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). These observations suggest that the spindle assembly pathway switches from chromatin-driven in stage 3 to centrosome-driven in stage 8 extracts. To test this idea, we compared the sensitivity of embryo extract spindle assembly to addition of Ran(T24N), a dominant negative inhibitor of the RanGEF RCC1 that destroys the chromatin-induced RanGTP and cargo gradients, severely disrupting spindle assembly in <italic>X. laevis</italic> egg extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kalab et al., 2002</xref>). Stage 3 spindles were similarly disrupted by this treatment, resulting in a significant (p&lt;0.001, comparing treated to control) loss of tubulin intensity in spindle center, while stage 8 extract spindles were unaffected under the same conditions (p&gt;0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). Thus, stage 3 spindles assemble by a chromatin-driven mechanism requiring a RanGTP gradient, similar to the <italic>Xenopus</italic> meiotic spindle, whereas stage 8 spindle assembly more closely resembles the centrosome-dominated spindle pathway typical of somatic cell types.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00290.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Spindle assembly pathways change during development.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Spindle assembly intermediates 15 min after initiation exhibit different morphologies in stage 3 and stage 8 extracts.

Quantification of immunofluorescence intensity revealed that compared to stage 3 spindles in which kif2a localized weakly to kinetochores and spindle poles, increased amounts of kif2a homogeneously localized to stage 8 extract spindles, with a slight enrichment at spindle poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). The case was markedly different for MCAK, which displayed a similar localization in both spindle types and had higher overall intensity in stage 3 extract spindles, indicating that it is unlikely to be involved in developmental spindle scaling. Changes in kif2a spindle recruitment between stage 3 and stage 8 spindles occurred without significant changes in protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Many spindle components implicated in regulation of catastrophe or nucleation were quantitatively similar in localization between stage 3 and stage 8 extracts. These include the MT minus-end protector patronin, the MT nucleator γ-tubulin, and the mitotic kinase aurora B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>).

We reasoned that the observed shift in spindle assembly pathways might contribute. Regulation of spindle assembly factors by nuclear transport proteins is central to the chromatin-mediated spindle assembly pathway in meiosis and at stage 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), but cytoplasmic levels of importin α decrease by almost 50% at stage 8, a change that affects nuclear size during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Levy and Heald, 2010</xref>), raising the possibility that importin α could impact spindle MT dynamics if it were able to regulate kif2a recruitment and activity.</p><p>Within the kif2a sequence, we identified a monopartite NLS in a surface-exposed loop of the motor domain that could potentially mediate importin α binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), and determined that this NLS is necessary to drive nuclear import of the recombinant kif2a motor domain in interphase egg extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). An interaction between kif2a and importin α could be detected by co-immunoprecipitation (IP) from egg extracts. Since IP with kif2a antibodies could co-IP importin α, but IP with importin α antibodies did not efficiently co-IP kif2a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), this interaction appears to be weak compared to other known importin α cargos, such TPX2 that can be co-depleted with importin α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gruss et al., 2001</xref>). This indicates that the binding affinity between kif2a and importin α may be in a regime that is sensitive to the levels of both proteins, as well as to cargos that compete for binding to importin α. In vitro, recombinant importin α and kif2a formed a complex detected by size exclusion chromatography, as a significant fraction of importin α shifted to a higher molecular weight and coeluted with kif2a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). To test whether importin α directly regulates kif2a activity, the proteins were added to fluorescent taxol-stabilized MTs in a flow chamber in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system. Under these conditions, 0.5 µM kif2a depolymerized MTs at 1.2 µm/min in an ATP-dependent manner, while preincubation with 1.5 µM importin α prevented MT depolymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>), indicating that importin α directly regulates kif2a.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00290.011</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Kif2a is regulated by importin α.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sequence alignment of region surrounding the nuclear localization signal (NLS) identified using PredictNLS program.

By microinjecting recombinant kif2a just prior to this division, we could specifically alter spindle size and assess both chromosome segregation and spindle orientation defects.</p><p>As in embryo extracts, excess kif2a decreased spindle size and kif2a ΔNLS possessed greater activity, reducing spindle length up to ∼32% in the developing embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Despite this significant size decrease, we did not observe any obvious problems with mitotic timing, metaphase chromosome alignment, or defects during anaphase such as lagging chromosomes. These data suggest that although increasing levels of kif2a decrease spindle size, the mitotic apparatus remains architecturally functional and chromosome segregation is robust to spindle size changes, as might be expected if we were manipulating a physiological mechanism of spindle scaling. Interestingly, however, orientation of metaphase spindles was frequently randomized in the presence of excess kif2a compared to control spindles that were typically nearly aligned with the long animal–vegetal axis of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). There was a clear correlation between metaphase spindle length and angle relative to the long axis, with shorter spindles less likely to be aligned even in unperturbed control embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). This effect was specific to metaphase as prometaphase and anaphase spindles were aligned along the long axis whether exogenous kif2a was injected or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). While we cannot rule out that orientation defects result in part from unknown pathways in which kif2a functions or from altered astral MT dynamics at metaphase, no effect was observed on prometaphase centrosome position and anaphase spindle orientation. Furthermore, spindle orientation in very large cells is established by orienting centrosomes during the previous telophase/interphase transition and not by astral MTs contacting the cell cortex hundreds of microns away (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wuhr et al., 2011</xref>).

Altogether, these data indicate that spindle length, which is controlled by regulation of MT-destabilizing activities within the spindle, impacts metaphase spindle orientation in the very large cells of the <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryo, but additional mechanisms operate to ensure properly positioned cleavage divisions.<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00290.019</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Metaphase spindle orientation in stage 3 embryos depends on spindle size.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Microinjection of kif2a into two-cell embryos just prior to cytokinesis decreases spindle size in the subsequent mitosis.

While a number of perturbations have been shown to alter spindle size, we have identified, out the hundreds of known spindle associated proteins, physiological effectors that operate to scale the spindle during embryogenesis. Considering our recent work identifying the microtubule severing enzyme katanin as an activity that scales spindle sized between related frog species, modulation of MT destabilization has now emerged as a general means of physiologically scaling spindle size in <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Loughlin et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast to interspecies spindle scaling, which relied on a regulatory phosphorylation site, the developmental mechanism described here depends on decreasing cytoplasmic levels of an inhibitor, importin α, which may be directly linked to changes in the ratio of surface membrane to cell volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Importantly, this mechanism functions cell autonomously and independent of developmental stage, thereby assuring that the spindle scales correctly over the range of cell sizes present in the embryo at each cleavage division. It is important to note that neither the interspecies nor developmental scaling mechanisms identified fully account for spindle size differences. Future research will tell whether many factors are involved and if there are other common themes.</p><p>In principle, any pathway containing factors that partition between the cytoplasm and membrane could have altered output with changing cell size during embryogenesis. Similarly, rounds of DNA, centrosome, or other organelle replication in the absence of cell growth could provide exponentially growing sinks for inhibitory factors or drive spatial redistribution of molecules that contribute to intracellular scaling. Structural components may also become limiting as the cytoplasmic volume decreases, or other aspects of changing cell geometry could alter spatial distributions and reaction rates. It is an open question how many of these processes function to modulate the size of the spindle and other organelles, compared to the contribution of zygotic transcription and other regulatory mechanisms that turn on later in development.</p><p>We have shown that developmental spindle scaling is coincident with a change in spindle assembly pathway from a chromatin-mediated mechanism to a centrosome-dominated mechanism. In egg extracts and large blastomeres, importin α binds to cargo proteins and provides, in combination with importin β, functional regulation downstream of the RanGTP gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nachury et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wiese et al., 2001</xref>). Although the mechanisms that regulate spindle assembly through the RanGTP gradient and downstream effectors are poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kalab et al., 2006</xref>), we show that the switch in spindle assembly to a more centrosome-mediated pathway occurs concomitantly with a decrease in cytoplasmic levels of importin α. This mechanism is consistent with the gradual change from meiotic to mitotic spindle morphology observed during early mouse development and suggests that the physical changes in embryonic cells size can impact biochemical reactions that alter spindle architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Courtois et al., 2012</xref>). In egg extracts, importin α phosphorylation is thought to liberate it from membrane stores into the cytoplasm, thereby promoting its transport activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hachet et al., 2004</xref>). Whether the multiple importin α bands in stage 7 and stage 8 embryos represent different phosphorylation states or some other posttranslational modification remains to be determined. Interestingly, nuclear size is also sensitive to importin α levels, and in this way, nuclear and spindle size may be coordinated, positioning importin α as a central molecule in controlling the size of multiple subcellular structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Levy and Heald, 2010</xref>).</p><p>While the RanGTP gradient is known to act through activation of MT stabilizers and motor proteins, we have identified kif2a as the first MT-destabilizing protein that could be regulated by this pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Walczak and Heald, 2008</xref>). Consistent with a role for kif2a in spindle size control, either increasing its levels or disrupting its localization by inhibiting dynein can modulate meiotic spindle size in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Gaetz and Kapoor, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ohi et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, inhibiting the other kinesin-13 family member MCAK dramatically affects global MT dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ohi et al., 2007</xref>). This difference may be due to high importin α levels limiting the activity of kif2a in egg extract spindles. Whether importin α regulates kif2a in cultured cells, where it is necessary for bipolar spindle assembly and poleward flux of MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ganem and Compton, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ganem et al., 2005</xref>), is unknown. Kif2a phosphorylation by aurora and polo kinases modulates its activity, which is also regulated through an interaction with inner centromere Kin-I stimulator (ICIS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Knowlton et al., 2009</xref>). A comprehensive evaluation of kif2a's many interactions will help determine how layers of regulation are integrated to control developmental spindle scaling.</p><p>By identifying a physiological mechanism that controls spindle size and then altering it, we have identified a role for spindle size in maintaining spindle orientation in very large cells of the early <italic>X. laevis</italic> embryo. However, chromosome segregation was robust to decreases in spindle size indicating that spindle architecture remained viable and a large spindle is not essential for division of large cells. Previous work has suggested that in contrast to the canonical spindle positioning pathways, astral MTs cannot reach the cortex of large cells to provide position cues and forces at metaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mitchison et al., 2012</xref>). Instead, centrosomes are likely positioned prior to spindle assembly through interactions with telophase MT asters of the previous division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wuhr et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2011</xref>), a mechanism that does not appear disrupted under conditions that reduce spindle size in our experiments. The randomized orientation of smaller spindles specifically at metaphase in stage 3 embryos suggests that in addition to initial positioning of centrosomes to define spindle orientation, there is a mechanism that maintains spindle orientation until anaphase onset, after which large anaphase asters may again provide orientation cues. Considering the spindle as a prolate ellipsoid in a viscous medium, the frictional resistance to rotation is nonlinearly related to length. A larger spindle may therefore resist rotation, especially given the highly viscous cytoplasm and the relatively short metaphase duration in blastomeres. While identifying the mechanisms that control spindle size revealed a cellular role in spindle orientation, in the future, it will be interesting to examine how changing spindle size affects the developmental program of the embryo. Overall, our embryo extract system, in combination with biochemical validation of regulatory interactions and experimental manipulation in developing embryos, allows the identification of physiologically relevant molecular mechanisms controlling spindle architecture and cell division.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cytoplasmic extracts</title><p><italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> egg extracts were made as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Maresca and Heald, 2006</xref>). <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> embryo extracts were generated by fertilizing eggs in vitro with crushed testes, dejellying with 3% cysteine in water pH 7.7, and allowing development to proceed at 23°C to a time point ∼15 min prior to the desired stage for extracts or fully to the desired stage for embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sive et al., 2000</xref>).

Your article has been evaluated by a Senior editor (Detlef Weigel) and 2 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments based on the reviewers' reports.</p><p>Your manuscript has been read and reviewed by two experts, who agree that your work is of general interest as scaling of cellular structures is a topic of foremost importance in modern cell biology. Both reviewers make the point that the first part of the paper (extract systems and the implications for changes in the spindle throughout development) is profound and very important, while the data presented in the second part (kif2a and importin α are responsible for the difference between spindle length) are not strong enough to provide extensive, mechanistic insights. However, we do believe that your work is worth publishing but for resubmission you would have to improve the second part as proposed below.</p><p>A major claim in the paper is that at stage 8, spindle size is reduced upon release of an inhibitory interaction between the kinesin kif2a and importin α. This occurs through redistribution of importin α from the cytoplasm to a membrane fraction. This point needs to be shown in a more direct and quantitative manner. We would ask you to measure the cytoplasmic levels of active importin α, data that can be collected either with (1) FCS, (2) FRET (sensors described in Sun et al., 2007, PNAS), or (3) quantitative pull downs. We suggest this because we expect that the reagents already exist in your lab, based on previous papers you have published.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00290.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>A major claim in the paper is that at stage 8, spindle size is reduced upon release of an inhibitory interaction between the kinesin kif2a and importin α.

Tagged recombinant kif2a was added to stage 3 or stage 8 extracts and then retrieved, revealing the amount of active importin α in the each extract that is free to bind kif2a, using a kif2a NLS mutant as control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). We found that in stage 3 extracts importin α could bind kif2a while in stage 8 extracts approximately ten-fold less importin α interacted with the added kif2a (quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p><p>In addition, we attempted to further quantify the kif2a-importin α by other approaches suggested by the reviewers. FCS experiments were performed upon addition of fluorescently labeled kif2a motor domain to either stage 3 or stage 8 extract at low concentrations. Fluorescence intensity was measured at 500 frames/sec and processed as by the PACI method developed by Needleman et al. (Biophysics J. 2009). Correlation curves indicated slower diffusion of kif2a motor domain in stage 3 compared to stage 8 extracts, indicating the interaction with other proteins and consistent with the formation of importin α-containing complexes. However, curve fits to this data were underdetermined for some parameters and therefore, despite qualitatively supporting our pulldown results, we feel the data are not strong enough to warrant addition to the manuscript.</p><p>Experiments utilizing FRET or other methods that require a fluorescently labeled version of importin α would require addition or overexpression of importin α and therefore perturbation of its levels. Given the small changes in importin α partitioning that affected spindle size, we were unable to interpret data from the system perturbed in this way since any additional importin α protein is expected to affect its steady state distribution.</p><p>Overall, the addition of the quantitative pulldown data strongly supports our model that partitioning of importin α out of the cytoplasm can decrease its interaction with kif2a, leading to a change in spindle size.</p></body></sub-article></article>
