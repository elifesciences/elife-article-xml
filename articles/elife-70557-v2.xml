An increase in fetal hemoglobin expression throughout adulthood, a condition named hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH), has been found to ameliorate hemoglobinopathies. Deletional HPFH occurs through the excision of a significant portion of the 3′ end of the β-globin locus, including a CTCF binding site termed 3′HS1. Here, we show that the deletion of this CTCF site alone induces fetal hemoglobin expression in both adult CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and HUDEP-2 erythroid progenitor cells. This induction is driven by the ectopic access of a previously postulated distal enhancer located in the <italic>OR52A1</italic> gene downstream of the locus, which can also be insulated by the inversion of the 3′HS1 CTCF site. This suggests that genetic editing of this binding site can have therapeutic implications to treat hemoglobinopathies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>3D genomics</kwd><kwd>hemoglobin switch</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000051</institution-id><institution>National Human Genome Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R35HG011279-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Jie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006019</institution-id><institution>Van Andel Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellow program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Xiaotian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001422</institution-id><institution>American Society of Hematology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Scholar Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Xiaotian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The 3'HS1 CTCF binding site directly modulates chromosomal loops to regulate γ-globin expression through the accession of the hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin enhancer.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The human β-globin locus consists of five globin genes embedded in the olfactory receptor cluster. During early development, these globin genes undergo gene switching from embryonic ε-globin (<italic>HBE</italic>) to fetal γ-globin (<italic>HBG1/2</italic>) and finally to adult β-globin (<italic>HBB</italic>). Inherited mutations in the <italic>HBB</italic> gene lead to dysfunction of the adult β-globin protein, causing hemoglobinopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bauer et al., 2012</xref>). The symptoms of these disorders, including sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia, can be alleviated by persistent expression of fetal hemoglobin (hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin [HPFH]) throughout adulthood, which compensates for the mutant adult β-globin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bank, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hassell, 2010</xref>). As such, multiple genome-editing strategies have been proposed to mimic HPFH as a treatment for hemoglobinopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bauer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Breda et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sankaran et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sankaran et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sankaran et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Traxler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Xu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ye et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zeng et al., 2020</xref>). Two types of HPFH have been identified based on patient genetics. First is the non-deletional HPFH caused by point mutations in the BCL11A binding site at the <italic>HBG1/2</italic> promoters, and disruption of this transcriptional repressor binding leads to the activation of these genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Forget, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Martyn et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Traxler et al., 2016</xref>). Second is the deletional HPFH that consists of the excision of a large genomic region within the β-globin locus, frequently including <italic>HBB</italic> and <italic>HBD</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Forget, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ye et al., 2016</xref>). These deletions can vary in length, and it remains unclear as to how they lead to the expression of fetal globin in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ye et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The human β-globin gene locus is flanked by five CTCF binding sites (CBSs), which form the anchors for six chromosomal loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huang et al., 2017</xref>). Two convergent CBSs, designated as 3′HS1 and HS5, are located at the borders of the globin gene cluster. These two CBSs are nested between a downstream CBS (referred to as 3'-<italic>OR52A5</italic>-CBS) and two closely spaced upstream CBSs (referred together as 5'-<italic>OR51B5</italic>-CBSs). The HPFH deletions frequently cover the 3′HS1 CBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that 3′HS1 may play a role in regulating β-globin cluster gene expression. To explore this, we first deleted the 3′HS1 using CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing technology in K562 myelogenous leukemia cells, which express high levels of hemoglobin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). At the same time, we also deleted HS5 as a control in K562 cells. We observed that deletion of the HS5 CTCF site resulted in the upregulation of the 3′ genes including <italic>HBB</italic> and <italic>HBG1/2</italic>. Interestingly, the disruption of 3′HS1 CBS led solely to the upregulation of <italic>HBG1/2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1s1sdata1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>). These results show that altering the CTCF binding profile across the locus can significantly change the expression of the β-globin genes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>3′HS1 modulates the hemoglobin gene expression in β-globin gene cluster.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Genome-wide Hi-C interaction map and regulatory landscape around β-globin gene cluster in human HUDEP2 cells.

To investigate further, we utilized the HUDEP-2 erythroid progenitor cell model, which predominantly express adult β-globin. We performed CRISPR/Cas9 editing to delete and invert the orientation of the 3′HS1 CBS to observe their respective impact on the expression of <italic>HBG1/2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In bulk edited cells, we found that HS5 deletion did not alter globin gene expression significantly, yet 3′HS1 disruption did increase γ-globin gene expression as observed in K562 cells with low deletion percentage and low editing efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). Subsequently, we generated two 3′HS1 CBS deletion clones (referred to as B6 and D3) and two 3′HS1 inversion clones (A2 and G3), whose genomic sequences were verified by Sanger sequencing and CTCF binding evaluated by CUT&amp;RUN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). To elucidate whether the genetic editing at 3′HS1 caused changes to gene expression, we differentiated the HUDEP-2 clones to activate β-globin expression.</p><p>We performed Hi-C and capture Hi-C to examine the changes to 3D chromatin organization at the β-globin locus following alterations to the CBSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>). In situ Hi-C data was generated with high resolution at 5 kb. A total of 15,207–16,529 loops could be detected in the HUDEP-2 clones used for in situ Hi-C using Mustache (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Roayaei Ardakany et al., 2020</xref>). The CTCF bound around the β-globin locus form four chromosomal loops and separate the cluster into three distinct domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Of notice, we could detect the enhancer to target gene interaction between the LCR and the <italic>HBB</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). We also tested the copy number variance (CNV) in the three particular HUDEP-2 clones, we could verify all clones have chromosome number 49–50,XY, which is of normal range in unmodified HUDEP-2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moir-Meyer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vinjamur and Bauer, 2018</xref>). Next, we tested if the chromosomal loops were altered by the 3′HS1 editing. We applied the HiCCUPS method to call the significant chromosomal loops in the β-globin locus, four loops were identified with q value less than 0.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and F</xref>). We then use the q value of the called loops by HiCCUPS to quantify the strength of loop interactions between CBSs. Of the convergent CTCF interactions, 3′HS1 to 5′-<italic>OR51B5</italic>-CBSs was not called as loop with q value over 0.25. One loop was called between the two forward CTCF CBSs – 3′HS1 and 3′-OR52A5 CBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and F</xref>). In the 3′HS1 deletion clone, the loss of CTCF at 3′HS1 resulted in the total loss of loops between 3′HS1 and HS5 as well as loops between 3′HS1 and 5′-<italic>OR51B5</italic>-CBSs (not called as loop). Concomitantly, a strong increase in the interaction between HS5 and 3′-<italic>OR51A5</italic>-CBS was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). This reveals how the loss of a CTCF anchor drastically alters the 3D chromatin organization in the β-globin locus. The inversion of the 3′HS1 CTCF caused a significant increase in the interaction between 3′HS1 and 3′-<italic>OR52A5 CBS</italic>. Meanwhile, 3′HS1 upstream interactions with HS5 and 5′-<italic>OR51B5</italic>-CBSs were decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). This revealed that the inversion of 3′HS1 CTCF drove the formation of chromosomal loops between the convergent CBSs, which may lead to stronger insulation of regulatory elements.</p><p>Next, we evaluated the expression of the β-globin genes and found that the <italic>HBG1/2</italic> and <italic>HBE</italic> genes upregulated 2.5- to 8-fold in the Δ3′HS1 clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>). In contrast, the inversion of 3′HS1 resulted in a &gt;50% reduction of <italic>HBE</italic> and near-complete depletion of <italic>HBG1/2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Most notably, the increase in <italic>HBG1/2</italic> upon deletion of the 3′HS1 CTCF site leads to a significant increase in fetal hemoglobin HbF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Consequently, we evaluated the clones for HbF+ cells by flow cytometry. Consistent with transcription level, we observed an increase in HbF+ cells from 4.3% in the Cas9 control clone to 37.8% and 53.1% in Δ3′HS1 B6 and D3 clones, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Meanwhile, inversion of 3′HS1 resulted in a decrease of HbF+ cells to below 1%. In contrast, deletion of the upstream HS5 CBS did not induce nor abrogate the quantity of HbF+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). All these clones are well differentiated at the same stage when HbF is measured by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>We then performed ATAC-seq and H3K27ac ChIP-seq in the Δ3′HS1 and 3′HS1 inversion clones to examine the regulatory landscape of the β-globin gene cluster. Following 3′HS1 CBS deletion, we observed significant open chromatin at the <italic>HBG1/2</italic>, <italic>BGLT3,</italic> and <italic>HBBP1</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). There was also a significant increase in activating H3K27ac in the <italic>HBG2</italic> gene body. Interestingly, these epigenetic changes upon deletion of 3′HS1 CBS do not occur at the promoter of <italic>HBG2,</italic> which suggests that this 3′HS1-dependent regulation is independent from BCL11A transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>To determine if other regulatory pathways, such as the transcriptional repressor BCL11A, are involved in the upregulation of γ-globin expression in Δ3′HS1 and 3′HS1 inversion clones, we performed RNA-seq to identify differentially expressed genes in these clones. We found 161 upregulated and 153 downregulated genes in the Δ3′HS1 clones with <italic>HBG1/2</italic> genes being the most significantly upregulated as well as β-globin cluster genes <italic>HBE1, HBBP,</italic> and <italic>BGLT3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and C</xref>). In the 3′HS1 inversion clones, we identified only 3 upregulated genes and 51 downregulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In these clones, we observed downregulation of <italic>HBG2</italic> and upregulation of the nearby <italic>OR52A5</italic> gene; however, we did not observe any change in the expression of known γ-globin regulators (<italic>BCL11A, ZBTB7A (LRF), ELF2AK1 (HRI), ATF4, ZNF410</italic>, and <italic>NFIX</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grevet et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Masuda et al., 2016</xref>). We further verified BCL11A protein level by immunoblotting and observed no significant reduction in Δ3′HS1 clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Taken together, we concluded that BCL11A does not contribute to the induction of HbF in the edited HUDEP-2 cells. To further elucidate the role of BCL11A in the regulation of <italic>HBG1/2</italic>, we performed targeted disruption of a known <italic>BCL11A</italic> gene enhancer in both WT and Δ3′HS1 HUDEP-2 clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2s1sdata1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bauer et al., 2013</xref>). This mutation resulted in a significantly lower BCL11A expression, and we observed further increase of <italic>HBG1/2</italic> expression level and HbF+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and F</xref>). Pomalidomide was found to boost the level of HbF in adult erythroblasts by destabilizing the BCL11A protein in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grevet et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, we treated HUDEP-2 3′HS1 deletion clones with pomalidomide and observed a significant reduction in BCL11A protein. This led to further increase in expression of fetal globin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2s2sdata1">Figure 2—figure supplement 2—source data 1</xref>). These results show that genetic editing of the regulatory <italic>cis</italic>-element (3′HS1 CBS) accentuates with depletion of the transcriptional repressor BCL11A. This further indicates that the γ-globin activation in 3′HS1 deletion HUDEP-2 cells was not driven by the BCL11A-associated pathways. The double disruption of BCL11A and 3′HS1 also led to similar level of γ-globin activation as the disruption of BCL11A alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). This data suggests that 3′HS1-regulated γ-globin repression might be hypostatic to the BCL11A-mediated γ-globin repression.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The induction of HbF in Δ3′HS1 cells is BCL11A independent.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Volcano plot of differentially expressed genes in two Δ3′HS1 clones (B6 and D3) vs. two wild-type HUDEP-2 biological duplicates.

The reduction of HbF in the 3′HS1 inversion HUDEP-2 clones suggests that potential enhancers may be located between 3′HS1 and 3′-<italic>OR52A5</italic>-CBS. These enhancers may be insulated by the loop formed between 3′HS1 to 3′-<italic>OR52A5</italic>-CBS in the inversion clones.

We then analyzed the ATAC-seq, GATA1 ChIP-seq data together to search for potential <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements.

This data suggests that the mouse olfactory receptor region 3′ to β-globin genes no longer bears GATA1 binding sites and enhancer activity. Overall, the loss of GATA1 binding in mouse clearly explains the difference between mouse and human on the effect of 3′HS1 deletion on globin gene expression.</p><p>Previously, it has been proposed that the juxtaposition of HPFH enhancer results in the activation of γ-globin. We wonder if the chromosomal distance between HPFH enhancer and globin genes also contributes to the regulation of globin gene expression. We used paired guide RNA to delete a 48 kb region between HPFH enhancer and 3′HS1, to access the effect of distance between enhancer and target genes in the presence of chromosomal insulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We obtained a heterozygous clone bearing this 48 kb deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

This condition is driven by alteration of the 3D genomic organization around the β-globin locus, which allows the long-range interaction of a distal enhancer in the <italic>OR52A1</italic> gene to drive the expression of <italic>HBG1/2</italic>. We further show that inversion of 3′HS1 insulates the enhancer element and further suppresses <italic>HBG1/2</italic>. Previously, induced LCR to <italic>HBG1/2</italic> interaction showed the importance of high-order chromatin structure in the regulation of globin gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Breda et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deng et al., 2014</xref>). However, the role of CTCF protein bound around the gene cluster was not clear. Our study reveals how CTCF binding at this locus modulates the accessibility of the fetal <italic>HBG1/2</italic> genes to a downstream enhancer. In the HPFH enhancer scenario, 3′HS1 limits the HPFH enhancer access to <italic>HBG1/2</italic> by forming the sub-TAD with 5′HS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Oudelaar et al., 2021</xref>). When the 3′HS1 CBS is deleted, the HPFH enhancer gains access to <italic>HBG1/2</italic> without the hinder of 3′HS1–HS5 loop. When the 3′HS1 CBS motif is inverted, the HPFH enhancer is further restricted by the pairing of 3′-<italic>OR52A5</italic>-CBS to the inverted 3′HS1 CBS, which results in the strong chromosomal loop formation between the two CBSs. This insulation leads to the reduced <italic>HBG1/2</italic> expression and upregulation of <italic>OR52A5</italic> (Figures 2B and 4E).</p><p>Furthermore, we have elucidated the function of long speculated HPFH enhancer in the induction of HbF with our Δ3′HS1 cells. However, we suspect that other regulatory elements also exist between 3′HS1 and 3′-<italic>OR52A5</italic>-CBS since we only get a partial decrease of <italic>HBG1/2</italic> expression with HPFH enhancer deletion in Δ3′HS1 cells. This may suggest that other previously identified HPFH enhancers also contribute to HbF induction in the Δ3′HS1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feingold and Forget, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Forget, 1998</xref>).

Overall, these observations suggest that GATA1 binding across the locus works collectively to activate <italic>HBG1/2</italic> expression with or without direct promoter-enhancer interactions. Interestingly, despite the evolution conservation of <italic>OR52A1</italic> gene in mammals, TF binding disrupting nucleotide substitutions occur at the GATA1 binding site in HPFH enhancer in some mammal species that do not express distinct form of fetal hemoglobin (mouse and rat) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>). This evolutionary alteration in the TF binding site suggests that HPFH enhancer may also play a role in regulating globin expression in other developmental stages. The consistent binding of GATA1 in high <italic>HBE/HBG</italic>-expressing K562 cells and high <italic>HBB</italic>-expressing HUDEP-2 cells suggests that the potential function of HPFH enhancer may still need the modulation of 3D genomic reorganization.</p><p>Despite our data suggesting that deletion of 3′HS1 is sufficient to induce the γ-globin activation, yet, the upregulation does not completely phenocopy the HPFH condition, in which the HbF is expressed at pancellular level. The deletion of 3′HS1 only induces a portion of cells to be <italic>F</italic>+ cells, with an interesting differentiation block phenotype in a large portion of clones we have selected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Although HUDEP-2 is known to be heterogenous in clonal level, the <italic>F+</italic> cell phenotype of 3′HS1-deleted cells suggests that the full HPFH phenotype may require the deletion of <italic>HBB</italic> and <italic>HBD</italic> genes to erase the strong enhancer-promoter interaction between LCR and <italic>HBB</italic>. Furthermore, our results indicate that the distance between HPFH enhancer and the globin locus could also play a role in regulating γ-globin gene expression. This data hints that the deletion of both 3′HS1 and the flanking region between 3′HS1 and HPFH enhancer may activate the fetal hemoglobin to an even higher level. Larger deletions will result in the reorganization of chromosomal loop interactions as well as the decrease of physical distance from HPFH enhancer to globin locus. The enhancers have to locate at certain range of distance from the target gene promoters to exert the maximal activation effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jessica Zuin et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, a method that can create large deletion that disrupts 3′HS1 and reduces enhancer-promoter distance simultaneously could be a potential gene therapy to effectively activate the γ-globin expression in hemoglobinopathies.</p><p>The differentiation stage of HUDEP-2 cell clones used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> was profiled by flow cytometry of CD71 and CD235a (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2s1sdata1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>).

In addition to clarifying and expanding upon prior studies related to deletional hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH), this work provides an interesting example of changes to gene expression and locus-specific chromatin organization upon manipulation of a CTCF binding site.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;3'HS1 CTCF binding site in human β-globin locus regulates fetal hemoglobin expression&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Present expression data for the genes within the β-globin cluster in different backgrounds as requested by the reviewers, including HBB expression in the 48 kb deletion and in the 3'HS1 deletion performed in the primary cell background.</p><p>2) Address the concerns of both reviewers concerning the clarity of the presentation of the Hi-C data and the interpretation of the ATAC- and H3K27ac ChIP-seqs, as well as the relative effects of the enhancer deletion on different genes.</p><p>3) Address or rebut the concern of reviewer #1 regarding the number of DEGs observed upon deletion of 3'HS1.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. (Lines 86-87, Figure 1) It is somewhat confusing for the authors to jump into Hi-C results immediately after introducing the derivation of single cell-derived HUDEP-2 subclones. Having shown expression of β-globin genes in CRISPR/Cas9-manipulated HUDEP-2 bulk populations (which is of limited utility here and might productively be omitted), one expects similar analysis of the subclones first. Instead, this is practically an afterthought in Figures G-H. The presentation in these panels is also odd, in that 2 3'HS1-deleted subclones are presented as relative HBB/HBG expression in G, and then a different one is presented as normalized expression of HBE/G/B in H. Why not show all 3 subclones in a clearer fashion? Also, while normalized expression certainly gives an idea of the magnitude of changes upon 3'HS1 deletion, given the authors' speculations regarding potential therapeutic ramifications of increased HBG expression here, it would be worth at least a supplemental panel showing the absolute levels of expression of each of these genes.</p><p>2. (Lines 124-129) Although it seems likely that the authors' statement is accurate thatincreased accessibility, as indicated by ATAC-seq, and increased H3K27Ac, occur over the bodies of the HBG genes upon 3'HS1 deletion (Figure S4A), the figure appears to show increases in accessibility at the HBB/D genes as well, and increases in H3K27Ac peaks both at the genes and across the LCR.</p><p>3. (Lines 128-129) &quot;…and the region with significant peak increase is not associated with BCL11A 129 binding at the HBG1/2 promoter region.&quot; This is confusingly worded. What the authors mean here is that the regions over the HBG genes associated with increased reads in the ATAC-seq and H3K27Ac ChIP-seqs do not map to the regions associated with BCL11A binding. In addition, however, this is an odd observation, which the authors do not attempt to clarify – that is, how is HBG expression increasing without any noticeable changes in accessibility at the promoter region? Is it just that the absolute levels of HBG expression are so low, and/or occurring in such a small proportion of cells, that such changes aren't being detected?</p><p>4. (Lines 133-135) Is it surprising to find so many DEGs upon deletion of 3'HS1? It seems odd to observe more than 300 DEGs after deletion of a single CTCF binding site within the β-globin locus. None of the nearby genes are known transcriptional regulators that might be expected to exert significant downstream effects on multiple additional genes, and based on the current literature one does not expect loss of a single CTCF binding site to exert such widespread effects beyond its specific location in the genome. What are these DEGs – is there any significance that emerges upon pathway analysis? Where are they located in the genome?</p><p>5. (Line 146) There is no Figure 2G; the authors are likely referring to Figure 2F here.</p><p>6. (Line 151) I'm not sure that &quot;synergizes&quot; is an accurate term here. The results suggest that 3'HS1 deletion results in upregulation of HBG expression via a mechanism unrelated to BCL11A-mediated transcriptional repression, though.</p><p>7. (Lines 173-180, Figures 3C-D) The GATA-1/enhancer deletions appear to affect HBE and HBB to the same or nearly the same degree as HBG.</p><p>8. (Lines 199-201) What is the effect of the 48 kb deletion on HBB?</p><p>9. (Line 227) This is likely not a proper TAD – TADs are generally much larger than the regions the authors describe here. &quot;Sub-TAD&quot; (as per terminology commonly used by the Higgs group with relation to locus organization at the α-globin locus) might be more appropriate.</p><p>10. (Lines 236-239) Where might the additional enhancers the authors refer to here actually be? There is nothing in Figure 3A that might suggest the presence of such enhancers. Can the authors clarify this further?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors analyzed the functional role of a CTCF binding site in the β-globin gene locus in Hudep-2 and differentiating CD34+ cells. Previous studies have shown that CTCF sites flanking the globin gene locus interact and form chromosomal loops. The authors found that deleting 3'HS1 specifically increased expression of the γ-globin gene and reduced expression of the β-globin gene. This seems independent from the levels of the known γ-globin repressor BCL11a. Through analysis of ATAC seq. and GATA1-ChIP-seq. data, they identified an enhancer that upon deletion reduced activation of globin in the 3'HS1 deficient cells. Deletion of a GATA1 site within this enhancer also reduced globin expression.</p><p>This is an interesting manuscript that provides functional insight into regulatory DNA elements located downstream of the β-globin gene cluster. This study is also significant with respect to potentially improving therapeutic fetal globin production. Overall, the experiments include appropriate controls and statistics.</p><p>The following issues should be address:</p><p>1. It is somewhat difficult to follow the authors interpretation of the Hi-C data in Figure 1 C-E. It appears that upon deletion of 3'HS1 a domain is formed between the most 3' CTCF site (OR52A5-CBS) and a sequence upstream of 3'HS1. This domain appears to contain the adult β-globin gene and there are more frequent interactions within this domain in 3'HS1 deleted cells, compared to WT cells. Could this in part explain why this deletion increases γ-globin and not β-globin. Likewise, the green-dotted circle seems to highlight interactions of OR52A5-CBS with a region upstream of HS5, but not with HS5.</p><p>2. The authors show that deletion or inversion of 3'HS1 does not affect expression of BCL11A. However, the western blot data in Figure 2E suggest that there is more BCL11A in the 3'HS1 inverted clones. This may explain why there is less γ-globin expressed in these cells.</p><p>3.

In the H3K27ac comparison, the signal at the HBB locus in WT is saturated and thus the signal is actually higher in WT than 3’HS1 deletion. So, with some variability, we believe that these subtle changes in ATAC and H3K27ac data is likely due to the clonal variation seen in HUDEP-2 cells before, and it is not necessarily an indicative of the functional gene expression alteration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

We performed gene ontology analysis on these genes and no significant enriched pathway (FDR &lt;0.1). The top enriched pathway in upregulated genes is associated with hemoglobin genes (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). These genes are randomly distributed on the genome without enrichment in particular chromosome (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). In summary, we believe that the differential expressed genes may be associated with clone-to-clone variation.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-70557-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

Indeed, in comparison with WT, we observed 60% decrease in HBB expression with HPFH enhancer deletion in comparison to Δ3’HS1 cells. We believe that upon the deletion of 3’HS1, HPFH enhancer is incorporated into the regulation hub of β-globin cluster. As a result, its activity might have contributed to the HBB expression.
