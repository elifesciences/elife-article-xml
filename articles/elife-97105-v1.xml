plays key roles in the acquisition of sperm fertilizing ability but its contribution to embryo development remains less understood. Female mice mated with males with simultaneous mutations in <italic>Crisp1</italic> and <italic>Crisp3</italic> genes exhibited normal <italic>in vivo</italic> fertilization but impaired embryo development. In this work, we found that this phenotype was not due to delayed fertilization, and it was observed in eggs fertilized by epididymal sperm either <italic>in vivo</italic> or <italic>in vitro</italic>. Of note, eggs fertilized <italic>in vitro</italic> by mutant sperm displayed impaired meiotic resumption unrelated to Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations defects during egg activation, supporting potential sperm DNA defects. Interestingly, cauda but not caput epididymal mutant sperm exhibited increased DNA fragmentation, revealing that DNA integrity defects appear during epididymal transit. Moreover, exposing control sperm to mutant epididymal fluid or to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-supplemented control fluid significantly increased DNA fragmentation. This, together with the higher intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels detected in mutant sperm, supports a dysregulation in Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis within the epididymis and sperm as the main factor responsible for embryo development failure. These findings highlight the contribution of the epididymis beyond fertilization and identify CRISP1 and CRISP3 as novel factors essential for sperm DNA integrity and early embryo development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>epididymis</kwd><kwd>embryo development</kwd><kwd>DNA fragmentation</kwd><kwd>CRISP</kwd><kwd>sperm</kwd><kwd>fertility</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002923</institution-id><institution>Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PIP 2022</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weigel Muñoz</surname><given-names>Mariana</given-names></name><name><surname>Cuasnicu</surname><given-names>Patricia S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100021778</institution-id><institution>Agencia Nacional de Promoción de la Investigación, el Desarrollo Tecnológico y la Innovación</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PICT 2019, No 3588</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weigel Muñoz</surname><given-names>Mariana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100021778</institution-id><institution>Agencia Nacional de Promoción de la Investigación, el Desarrollo Tecnológico y la Innovación</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PICT 2021, No 00765</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cuasnicu</surname><given-names>Patricia S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The identification of epididymal proteins relevant for sperm DNA integrity and early embryo development will contribute to a better understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of human infertility.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mammalian sperm that leave the testes do not have the ability to fertilize an egg and must undergo different processes to become fertilizing competent. Initially, they need to mature while they pass through the epididymis which provides a suitable environment for acquisition of fertilizing ability, storage, and protection of sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Robaire and Hinton, 2015</xref>). Subsequently, sperm must undergo another process known as capacitation while ascending through the female reproductive tract which will allow them to undergo the acrosome reaction in the head and to develop a hyperactivated motility in the tail, both essential for fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Florman and Fissore, 2015</xref>). Once they reach the site of fertilization in the oviduct, sperm penetrate the different coats that surround the egg (i.e. cumulus oophorus and zona pellucida (ZP)) and fuse with the plasma membrane of the egg, resulting in the formation of a single-cell zygote which then embarks on its development into a multicellular organism through a highly complex and tightly regulated process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ramathal et al., 2015</xref>). Whereas numerous reports show the relevance of post-testicular maturation for fertilization, less information exists on the contribution of epididymal transit to embryo development.</p><p>The epididymis, the main location where sperm maturation takes place, has a very specialized epithelium involved in ion transport, protein matrix formation, and both protein and vesicle secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Robaire and Hinton, 2015</xref>). Among such secretory proteins are CRISP (Cysteine-RIch Secretory Proteins), a group of evolutionarily conserved proteins mainly expressed in the male reproductive tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gibbs et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gonzalez et al., 2021</xref>). In mammals, four members have been described which escort sperm during their transit through both the male and female reproductive tracts. CRISP are characterized by the presence of 16 conserved Cys and two domains that have evolved to perform a variety of functions. Whereas the N-terminal domain of CRISP proteins (i.e. PR-1) is involved in cell-to-cell interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ellerman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maeda et al., 1998</xref>), proteolytic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Milne et al., 2003</xref>) and amyloid-like-aggregation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Olrichs et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sheng et al., 2019</xref>), the C-terminal domain (i.e. CRD) has the ability to regulate ion channels, such as ryanodine (RyR), CNGs, TRPM8, and Catsper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ernesto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gibbs et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gibbs et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yamazaki et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Biochemical, molecular, and genetic approaches from our group and others revealed that CRISP proteins play key roles in sperm maturation, capacitation and fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gonzalez et al., 2021</xref>). Epididymal CRISP1, first described by our laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cameo and Blaquier, 1976</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cohen et al., 2000a</xref>) associates with sperm during maturation and both inhibits CatSper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ernesto et al., 2015</xref>), the primary sperm Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel essential for male fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ren et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sun et al., 2017</xref>), and participates in gamete interaction through egg-complementary sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Busso et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cohen et al., 2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rochwerger et al., 1992</xref>). CRISP4, almost exclusively synthesized in the epididymis, also associates with sperm during maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jalkanen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nolan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Weigel Muñoz et al., 2019</xref>), inhibits Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel TRPM8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gibbs et al., 2011</xref>), and participates in the fertilization process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carvajal et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gibbs et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Turunen et al., 2012</xref>). CRISP3 exhibits a wider expression distribution including the epididymis and accessory glands within the male reproductive tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Haendler et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schwidetzky et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Udby et al., 2005</xref>) as well as organs and cells with immunological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Reddy et al., 2008</xref>). Whereas CRISP3 was found to bind to sperm with no roles in fertilization described so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Da Ros et al., 2015</xref>), several reports support its association with male fertility in different species including humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Doty et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gholami et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In spite of clear evidence supporting the relevance of CRISP proteins for fertilization, knockout (KO) male mice for each individual CRISP remain fertile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brukman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carvajal et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Da Ros et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gibbs et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Turunen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Volpert et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Weigel Muñoz et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting the existence of compensatory mechanisms among homologous CRISP family members. This idea was later confirmed by experiments from our group showing that simultaneous modifications in more than one CRISP gene can significantly impair male fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carvajal et al., 2018</xref>). Whereas males lacking epididymal CRISP1 and CRISP4 (C1/C4 DKO) were subfertile due to a significant decrease in <italic>in vivo</italic> fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carvajal et al., 2018</xref>), males lacking CRISP1 and CRISP3 (C1/C3 DKO) were subfertile but exhibit normal <italic>in vivo</italic> fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Curci et al., 2020</xref>), supporting the notion that fertility inhibition in this colony resulted as a consequence of post-fertilization defects. Interestingly, subfertility in C1/C3 DKO colony was associated with a failure of <italic>in vivo</italic> fertilized eggs to reach the blastocyst stage, revealing the potential relevance of CRISP1 and CRISP3 for early embryo development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Curci et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, examination of ejaculated sperm within the uterus of control mated females showed that while control sperm were freely moving in the uterine fluid, C1/C3 DKO sperm were mostly immotile and trapped into aggregates within a viscous uterine fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Curci et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting the relevance of these two proteins for sperm survival within the female reproductive tract. Considering the expression of CRISP1 and CRISP3 in the male reproductive tract, it is possible that defects during and/or following epididymal passage are responsible for the early embryo development defects observed for the mutant males. In view of this, in the present work, we explored possible mechanisms leading to C1/C3 DKO male phenotype and provide novel evidence supporting the contribution of the epididymis and the relevance of both CRISP1 and CRISP3 for sperm DNA integrity and early embryo development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Embryo development defects associated with the lack of CRISP1 and CRISP3 are not due to a delayed fertilization</title><p>To analyze whether defects in early embryo development were specifically linked to mutations in C<italic>risp1</italic> and <italic>Crisp3</italic> genes or could also be contributing to the subfertility of C1/C4 DKO males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carvajal et al., 2018</xref>), superovulated females were mated with mutant or control males from each DKO colony and those eggs recovered from the ampulla and reaching the two-cell stage <italic>in vitro</italic> (i.e. fertilized eggs) were further incubated to analyze the percentage progressing to blastocysts.

To this aim, we analyzed both sperm migration within the oviduct and <italic>in vivo</italic> fertilization shortly after mating (i.e. 4 hr) as a way to avoid the possibility that the prolonged stay of sperm within the female tract corresponding to the conventional mating schedule (18 hr), could be giving defective sperm enough time to reach the ampulla and fertilize the eggs. Using Acrosine-GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein)-tagged C1/C3 DKO or control males, we first examined sperm migration within the oviduct via fluorescence microscopy 4 hr after observation of copulatory plugs. Results indicated that both mutant and control sperm exhibited no difficulties to pass the uterotubal junction and migrate within the oviduct as judged by the presence of labeled sperm in both the lower and middle isthmus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The observation of very few fluorescent mutant or control sperm beyond the isthmus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref>) is due to the reported loss of the acrosome in sperm after reaching the middle/upper isthmus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">La Spina et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Muro et al., 2016</xref>). Consistent with these observations, examination of fertilization in the ampulla 4 hr after mating showed no significant differences between groups in the percentage of eggs recovered from the ampulla that develop to two-cell embryos <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), confirming no defects in the time of arrival of sperm to the ampulla. However, once again, the eggs fertilized by mutant sperm exhibited clear defects to reach the blastocyst stage <italic>in vitro</italic> compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Together, our observations suggest that factors other than a delayed fertilization due to transport defects were responsible for the observed embryo development phenotype of the mutant colony.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Sperm migration through the female reproductive tract.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative diagram showing sperm within the different regions of the female reproductive tract.

Thus, whereas males from both double knockout colonies are subfertile and share the lack of CRISP1, the mechanisms underlying their subfertility are different depending on the other simultaneously deleted protein, providing information on the different functional modules that operate within the CRISP family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Curci et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gonzalez et al., 2021</xref>), and establishing two models that uncouple fertilization from early embryo development. In this way, whereas C1/C4 DKO mice exclusively exhibiting defects in fertilization contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in gamete interaction, C1/C3 DKO males showing only defects in egg progression to blastocysts become an excellent model for elucidating the molecular mechanisms inherent to the early embryo development process.</p><p>Our findings showing the presence of aggregates of immotile sperm within the uterus of females mated with C1/C3 DKO males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Curci et al., 2020</xref>) opened the possibility that a delayed fertilization due to a retarded arrival of sperm to the ampulla (the site of fertilization) could be the reason for embryo development failure as previously reported for immature sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brackett et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lacham and Trounson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lacham-Kaplan and Trounson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Orgebin-Crist, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Orgebin-Crist and Jahad, 1977</xref>). Evaluation of sperm migration within the female tract shortly after mating to avoid a delayed fertilization showed, however, that mutant sperm could pass through the uterotubal junction and reach the lower/middle isthmus just like control sperm, indicating that embryo development failure in mutant mice is unlikely to be due to defects in sperm transport from the uterus to the oviduct and/or migration within the oviduct. Moreover, although the loss of the acrosomes due the occurrence of the acrosome reaction in the isthmus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">La Spina et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Muro et al., 2016</xref>) did not allow the detection of labeled sperm within the ampulla, our results indicated that the time of sperm arrival to the ampulla was comparable to that of control sperm as evidenced by fertilization rates not different from controls at 4 hr post copulation. However, in spite of the lack of differences in sperm arrival to the ampulla and fertilization rates observed shortly after mating, the fertilized eggs still exhibited an impaired ability to reach the blastocyst stage, not favoring the idea that a delayed fertilization and/or a consequently compromised oocyte quality could be responsible for the early embryo development defects observed in the mutant colony.</p><p>Considering various reports showing that male accessory glands contribute to proper embryo development without affecting fertilization rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jodar, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ma et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vallet-Buisan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">O et al., 1988</xref>), the possibility existed that the sperm defects leading to the embryo development phenotype were associated with the lack of CRISP1 and CRISP3 in the accessory gland secretions. Interestingly, however, when epididymal sperm were directly inseminated into the uterus, we observed again normal fertilization rates in the ampulla accompanied by impaired embryo development, revealing that defects were already present in epididymal sperm. This conclusion was further supported by IVF studies showing that cumulus oocyte complexes fertilized by mutant epididymal sperm also exhibited embryo development defects. Unlike <italic>in vivo</italic> assays, however, IVF studies revealed fertilization defects in mutant sperm not detected by mating. This difference is likely due to the effective mechanism of sperm selection within the female reproductive tract that allows only high-quality sperm to reach the eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cummins and Yanagimachi, 1982</xref>) even in males with reproductive deficiencies, thus, masking sperm defects detected under <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brukman et al., 2016</xref>). Nevertheless, the finding that C1/C3 DKO sperm exhibit IVF capabilities similar to those reported for sperm lacking only CRISP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Da Ros et al., 2008</xref>), does not support a major role for murine CRISP3 in gamete interaction in agreement with our previous observations for human CRISP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Da Ros et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The observation that ZP-free oocytes fertilized <italic>in vitro</italic> by mutant epididymal sperm also exhibited a lower ability to reach the blastocyst stage excluded potential delays generated by deficiencies in egg coat penetration as a cause of embryo development failure, indicating the existence of defects other than those associated with gamete interaction <italic>per se</italic> as responsible for the mutant colony phenotype. Interestingly, a proportion of ZP-free eggs fertilized by mutant sperm were still at Met II in contrast to all eggs exhibiting 2nd polar body in controls, supporting that immediate post-fertilization timing defects could be contributing to embryo development failure. In this regard, incorporation of the time lapse technology in human IVF treatments has highlighted the relevance of the timing of post-fertilization events and early cleavage as robust predictors of both embryo development to blastocyst and implantation success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basile et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Esbert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Meseguer et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Our observations showing defects in meiotic resumption in eggs fertilized by mutant sperm opened the possibility that an impaired egg activation could be the cause of embryo development failure. In this regard, the well-established significance of egg Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in predicting the developmental competence of mouse zygotes and their pivotal role in meiosis resumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miyazaki, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wakai et al., 2019</xref>), led us to analyze egg Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations following fertilization by mutant sperm. Results showing no difference in the pattern of oscillations nor in the time to the first peak which is indicative of gamete fusion confirmed immediate post-fertilization defects as responsible for egg development failure, dismissing alterations in Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations as the cause of embryo development impairment in the mutant mice.</p><p>Evidence showing that time is needed before the first embryonic cell division for activation of the egg DNA-repairing machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Martin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Newman et al., 2022</xref>) together with the known association between high levels of DNA fragmentation and abnormal embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Marinaro, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nguyen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Simon et al., 2014</xref>), raised the possibility that meiotic resumption failure may result from defects in sperm DNA integrity. In this regard, as spermatozoa harboring DNA damage have no mechanism for its repair but retain their ability to negotiate the female reproductive tract, reach the site of fertilization and fertilize oocytes, DNA-repairing activity relies on the oocyte once fertilization takes place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">González-Marín et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Martin et al., 2019</xref>), representing a critical step in the generation of viable embryos. Our findings showing significantly higher levels of DNA fragmentation in mutant than control cauda epididymal sperm support sperm DNA damage as the potential cause of the early post-fertilization defects. In agreement with this conclusion, several embryo kinetics studies showed a significant delay in the early stage of second polar body extrusion in human eggs fertilized by sperm with DNA fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Casanovas et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Esbert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wdowiak et al., 2015</xref>). Together, our observations underscore the intricate relationship between sperm DNA integrity and the regulatory role of CRISP proteins in shaping early embryonic outcomes.</p><p>How the lack of male CRISP1 and CRISP3 proteins could lead to higher levels of sperm DNA fragmentation? The finding that defects leading to embryo development in the mutant colony were present in epididymal sperm and that neither CRISP1 nor CRISP3 are expressed in the testes, supports the appearance of mutant sperm DNA fragmentation within the epididymis. In this regard, detection of these defects in cauda but not caput sperm supports that DNA integrity defects develop during epididymal transit and/or storage in agreement with the idea that the main pathways leading to DNA damage are triggered during epididymal transit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Okada et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sakkas and Alvarez, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Suganuma et al., 2005</xref>), probably to allow elimination of defective sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gawecka et al., 2015</xref>). Based on this, we can speculate that the lack of CRISP1 and CRISP3 in the epididymis renders sperm more susceptible to DNA degradation, i.e., by ROS. However, in spite of the commonly accepted association between DNA fragmentation and oxidative stress, our results did not show higher levels of ROS in mutant sperm, not favoring oxidative stress as the mechanism underlying DNA fragmentation in our mutant colony. These results differ from those reported for mice lacking epididymal antioxidant GPX5 (Glutathione Peroxidase 5) which showed higher incidence of embryo development defects and increased sperm DNA fragmentation but accompanied by higher levels of ROS in mutant sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chabory et al., 2009</xref>). Nevertheless, as these mice also exhibited changes in small RNAs within the epididymis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chu et al., 2020</xref>), we do not exclude the possibility that the lack of CRISP1 and CRISP3 in the epididymis may also affect the profile of small RNAs known to change during epididymal transit and to be important for embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yuan et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Previous reports showing induction of DNA fragmentation by exposure of mouse sperm to divalent cations (Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mn<sup>2+</sup>) in the presence of luminal fluids concluded that DNA fragmentation is largely controlled by the luminal fluids with a contribution from sperm that is acquired during maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gawecka et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shaman et al., 2006</xref>). This, together with the fact that all CRISP are Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel regulators, opened the possibility that changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation within the epididymis could be responsible for the higher fragmentation levels observed in our mutant sperm. Consistent with this idea, our results showed a significant increase in DNA fragmentation when WT sperm were exposed to either mutant epididymal fluid or WT epididymal fluid in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. These observations, together with the higher intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels detected in mutant sperm, support a dysregulation in Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in the epididymis and sperm as the main responsible for the observed sperm DNA integrity defects, probably through the activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent nucleases present within the epididymal fluid and/or sperm cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shaman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sotolongo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boaz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dominguez and Ward, 2009</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our observations provide strong evidence supporting the contribution of the epididymis beyond the acquisition of sperm fertilizing ability, identifying CRISP1 and CRISP3 as novel male factors relevant for sperm DNA integrity and early embryo development. Moreover, to our knowledge, this is the first report showing the relevance of epididymal proteins for early post-fertilization events. Given the existence of homologous human CRISP proteins in the epididymis and sperm playing equivalent roles to their rodent counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Curci et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gonzalez et al., 2021</xref>), it is possible that CRISP are also involved in human embryogenesis through similar mechanisms. Considering the incidence of sperm DNA fragmentation in male infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Esteves et al., 2020</xref>), we believe our findings not only provide key information on the impact of epididymal factors on mammalian embryo development but will also contribute to a better understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of human infertility.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and ethical approval</title><p>Adult males (3–5 months old) from C1/C3 DKO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Curci et al., 2020</xref>) or C1/C4 DKO colonies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carvajal et al., 2018</xref>) and control young (3–5 weeks old) or adult (2–5 months old) females were used.

Pictures of at least 200 sperm heads were taken and the halo area analyzed by ImageJ software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://imagej.nih.gov/ij">http://imagej.nih.gov/ij</ext-link>). Sperm DNA was considered fragmented when no halo was observed or when the halo area was smaller than twice the area corresponding to non-dispersed sperm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Analysis of ROS</title><p>ROS levels in sperm were measured by confocal microscopy. Briefly, after swim-out in capacitating medium without BSA, Hoechst 33342 (40 μg/ml) and CellROX-Green (25 μM) were added and sperm incubated under these conditions for 30 min at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Samples were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, exposed to 100 mM ammonium acetate (pH 9.0), centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 3 min two times and, finally, placed over a glass slide, mounted with glycerol and analyzed on an Olympus IX83 Spinning Disk microscope (Olympus Corp, Tokyo, Japan) (×600). Images of at least 200 sperm heads for each condition were analyzed and fluorescence intensity calculated by ImageJ software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://imagej.nih.gov/ij">http://imagej.nih.gov/ij</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Incubation of sperm with epididymal fluids</title><p>After 10 min of swim-out in capacitating medium without BSA, sperm were centrifuged 2 min at 1500 rpm and the recovered supernatants containing diluted cauda fluid stored at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% (vol/vol) CO<sub>2</sub> in air. Sperm were then washed two times with 1 ml of capacitating medium without BSA followed by a 2-min centrifugation at 1500 rpm. After the second centrifugation, cauda fluids from either the same or the other genotype were added and incubation continued for 1 hr at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% (vol/vol) CO<sub>2</sub>. For evaluation of the effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, sperm were incubated as described above in the presence of 10 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> prepared from a 100× CaCl<sub>2</sub> stock solution.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Sperm intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> measurement</title><p>Cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in sperm were measured by flow cytometry as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brukman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Curci et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, after 60 min of incubation in capacitation medium, sperm were loaded with 2 mM of Fluo-4 AM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA) diluted in 10% (wt/vol) of Pluronic F-127 (Invitrogen) and incubated for an additional 30 min. Samples were washed to remove the excess of probe, resuspended in BSA-free medium, and exposed to 2.5 μg/ml of propidium iodide (PI) just before measurement. Fluorescence was detected using a BD FACSCantoTM II analyzer following the manufacturer’s indications and at least 10,000 events were analyzed per sample. Data analysis was performed by FlowJo 10 software (FlowJo LLC, Ashland, OR, USA). In each condition, the fluorescence mean was normalized to basal Fluo-4-AM fluorescence.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data represent the mean ± SEM of at least three independent experiments and ‘<italic>n</italic>’ indicates the number of animals analyzed in each group for all experiments except for oocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations where ‘<italic>n</italic>’ indicates the number of oocytes analyzed. Calculations were performed using the Prism 8.0 software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). Comparisons between two experimental groups were analyzed by one-way Student <italic>t</italic>-test whereas comparisons among three or more groups were analyzed by two-way ANOVA followed by Fisher LSD for embryo development progression and Holm–Sidak’s for both resumption of meiosis and sperm intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In those cases in which data did not meet the assumptions required to perform two-way ANOVA (i.e. caput sperm DNA fragmentation, ROS levels, and incubation with fluids), non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis followed by Dunn’s test were used. In all cases, differences were considered significant at a level of p &lt; 0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Software, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Methodology, Software, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Approval for the study protocol was obtained from the CICUAL of the Instituto de Biología y Medicina Experimental (IByME-CONICET) (protocol N° 26/2018).

The authors demonstrate that C1/C3 DKO sperm exhibit defects in the DNA integrity, probably due to Ca2+ dysregulation in the epididymis. However, direct evidence for this mechanism requires further experiments. The finding of the involvement of the epididymal environment in embryogenesis is significant, but some results on sperm fertilizing ability of C1/C3 DKO mice were similar to the previous report. Thus, this point raises concern about the perspective of novelty.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors demonstrate that CRISP1 and CRISP3 regulate Ca2+ in the epididymal fluid, and loss of CRISP1 and CRISP3 disrupts Ca2+ regulation in the epididymal fluid, leading to sperm DNA fragmentation and impaired embryonic development after fertilization. This proposed mechanism is both novel and intriguing, offering valuable insights into the epididymal control of sperm quality.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The evidence supporting the mechanism of CRISP1 and CRISP3 in calcium regulation within epididymis and its contribution to the sperm DNA damage remains limited.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>The data provided in this manuscript (Figure 2A and B) appear to overlap with data in previously published paper (PMID:33037689), despite differences in the duration of <italic>in vivo</italic> fertilization after mating. The results in both studies show similar findings, raising concerns about potential data redundancy.</p><p>As shown in Figure 6A, while wild-type sperm were exposed to the epididymal fluid of C1/C3 DKO mice, the wild-type sperm exhibited DNA fragmentation. Additionally, when wild-type sperm were exposed to the epididymal fluid of wild-type mice with 10 mM Ca2+, DNA fragmentation is still observed. Therefore, the authors conclude that the DNA fragmentation in C1/C3 DKO sperm is due to the increased level of the Ca2+. However, the connection between the DNA damage in wild-type sperm exposed to the epididymal fluid of C1/C3 DKO mice and the increased levels of Ca2+ remains unclear. To clarify this, it is suggested that intracellular calcium levels in the wild type sperm should be analyzed before and after exposure to the epididymal fluid of C1/C3 DKO mice (or before and after adding 10 mM Ca2+ into wild-type fluid). Furthermore, the author should explain detailed information on epididymal fluid collection, because Ca2+ levels vary between different sections of the epididymis.</p><p>In lines 321-323, the authors mention the selection system of the female reproductive tract that only allows high-quality sperm to reach the eggs (Cummins and Yanagimachi 1982), but this paper is not listed in the bibliography. It is important to ensure proper referencing.</p><p>The discussion section is too long and difficult to follow well because there is redundancy of the results in many parts. It is recommended to shorten it by focusing only on relevant and important information.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.97105.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sulzyk</surname><given-names>Valeria</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03hnwy706</institution-id><institution>Instituto de Biología y Medicina Experimental (IByME-CONICET)</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Buenos Aires</named-content></addr-line><country>Argentina</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Curci</surname><given-names>Ludmila</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03hnwy706</institution-id><institution>Instituto de Biología y Medicina Experimental (IByME-CONICET)</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Buenos Aires</named-content></addr-line><country>Argentina</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>González</surname><given-names>Lucas Nicolás</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03hnwy706</institution-id><institution>Instituto de Biología y Medicina Experimental (IByME-CONICET)</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Buenos Aires</named-content></addr-line><country>Argentina</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Rebagliati Cid</surname><given-names>Abril</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03hnwy706</institution-id><institution>Instituto de Biología y Medicina Experimental (IByME-CONICET)</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Buenos Aires</named-content></addr-line><country>Argentina</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Weigel Muñoz</surname><given-names>Mariana</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03hnwy706</institution-id><institution>Instituto de Biología y Medicina Experimental (IByME-CONICET)</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Buenos Aires</named-content></addr-line><country>Argentina</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Cuasnicu</surname><given-names>Patricia S</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03hnwy706</institution-id><institution>Instituto de Biología y Medicina Experimental (IByME-CONICET)</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Buenos Aires</named-content></addr-line><country>Argentina</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The main observation that the sperm from CRISP proteins 1 and 3 KO lines are postfertilization less developmentally competent is convincing.

In addition, new observations showing that WT sperm exposed to WT epididymal fluid in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> also exhibit higher DNA fragmentation levels (Figure 6A) together with the finding that mutant sperm exhibit higher intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (Figure 6B) but no higher levels of ROS, strongly support a dysregulation in Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis within the epididymis and sperm as the main responsible for DNA integrity defects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The authors showed that CRISP1 and CRISP3, secreted proteins in the epididymis, are required for early embryogenesis after fertilization through DNA integrity in cauda epididymal sperm. This paper is the first report showing that the epididymal proteins are required for embryogenesis after fertilization. However, some data in this paper (Table 1 and Figure 2A) are overlapped in a published paper (Curci et al., FASEB J, 34,15718-15733, 2020; PMID: 33037689). Furthermore, the authors did not address why the disruption of CRISP1/3 leads to these phenomena (the increased level of the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> level and impaired DNA integrity in sperm) with direct evidence. Therefore, if the authors can address the following comments to improve the paper's novelty and clarification, this paper may be worthwhile to readers.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the constructive comments. Regarding the data included in Table 1 and Figure 2A, it is important to note that Table 1 includes data on embryo development corresponding to C1/C4 DKO mice not published before in which the data on embryo development corresponding to C1/C3 DKO was used as simultaneous control. Figure 2A showed <italic>in vivo</italic> fertilization results at short times after mating (4h instead of 18 h) that have been neither reported before.</p><p>Regarding studies to address why the disruption of CRISP1 and CRISP3 leads to defects in DNA integrity and Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, we have carried out new experiments showing that mutant sperm do not exhibit higher levels of ROS (see Figure 5C), not favoring oxidative stress as the mechanism underlying mutant sperm defects. In addition, we found that DNA integrity defects develop during epididymal transit (Figure 5B) and that exposure of WT sperm to epididymal fluid from mutant mice leads to an increase in sperm DNA fragmentation levels (Figure 6A), confirming that the absence of CRISP1 and CRISP3 alters the epididymal fluid. Finally, our new results showing that WT sperm exposed to WT epididymal fluid in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> also exhibit higher DNA fragmentation levels (Figure 6A) together with the higher intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels detected in mutant sperm (Figure 6B) strongly support a dysregulation in Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis within the epididymis and sperm as the main responsible for DNA integrity defects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Overall comments:</p><p>This manuscript investigates the mechanisms whereby the absence of the epididymal CRISP proteins 1 and 3 (Cysteine-Rich Secretory Proteins) causes infertility and lower embryo developmental rates.

However, the study is mechanistically incomplete, as there is no direct demonstration that the absence of these proteins alters the epididymal environment and fluid, wherein the passage through the epididymis the sperm become functionally defective, and whether mutant or control epididymal fluid or purified CRISP proteins can change, either reduce or overcome, respectively, the developmental competence of the control or mutant sperm and induce functional changes in the counterpart sperm. In summary, the main observation that the sperm from CRISP proteins 1 and 3 KO lines are post-fertilization less developmentally competent is significant and important, but the molecular characterization of the defects and the temporal appearance of defects requires additional studies.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>(1) Introduction.</p><p>It is too long.

Figures 2C and D have interesting data, although additional information would strengthen these results. The authors concluded that the sperm were defective in the epididymis. Where in the epididymis? These sperm were all from the cauda. Could the authors collect sperm from the upper portion of the cauda, or midportion, and compare if the defects manifest gradually?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this interesting and appropriate comment from the reviewer. In this regard, all the studies in our work were carried out using sperm from the whole cauda epididymis, the reason why we could not answer where defective sperm appear in the epididymis. In view of this, we have now conducted a comparative DNA fragmentation analysis between caput and cauda sperm from both genotypes. Our findings indicate that while cauda mutant sperm showed once again higher DNA fragmentation levels than controls, caput sperm exhibited levels of DNA damage not significantly different between genotypes. These results confirm that defects in DNA appear following sperm passage through the epididymal caput, supporting the hypothesis that defects in DNA fragmentation manifest during sperm transit through the epididymis and /or during storage in the cauda. These results have been included in the revised version of the manuscript (see lines 235-240/Figure 5B of the revised version)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Figure 3 displays the results of <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization, either COCs A-C or zona-free fertilization D-F.

Is there less expression of proteins related to these functions, or the function of some proteins is compromised? The authors should advance a hypothesis or a rationale to explain these results.</p></disp-quote><p>As indicated by the reviewer, our results showed differences between the fertilization rates observed for mutant mice under <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions, as previously observed for all our single and multiple KO models (Da Ros et al., 2008; PMID: 18571638, Brukman et al., 2016; PMID: 26786179, Weigel Muñoz, 2018; PMID: 29481619, Ernesto et al., 2015; PMID: 26416967, Carvajal et al,. 2018; PMID: 30510210) and also reported by other groups (Okabe et al., 2007; PMID: 17558467). In this regard, it has been well established that, although millions of sperm are ejaculated into the female tract, only a few (approximately one per oocyte) reach the fertilization site (i.e. the ampulla) (Cummins and Yanagimachi, 1982; doi:10.1002/mrd.1120050304). This efficient selection system by the female reproductive tract leads to the arrival of only the best sperm at the fertilization site, even in males with reproductive deficiencies, thereby “masking” sperm defects that can be detected under <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions due to the competition between good and bad quality sperm for the egg. Thus, although we can not exclude other mechanisms to explain the commonly observed differences between <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization rates, our rationale is that the natural and efficient sperm selection process that takes place within the female reproductive tract masks sperm defects that can, otherwise, be detected under the competitive <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions. This explanation is now included in the discussion of the revised version of the manuscript (see lines 320-325).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Data in Figures 4 and 5 support the interpretation of the authors. However, it is necessary to establish the level of oxidative stress in the mutant sperm vs. the controls. Also, a question to explore is for how long does the sperm need to reside in that mutant environment to start undergoing the DNA fragmentation reported?</p></disp-quote><p>In response to the valuable request from the reviewer regarding the level of oxidative stress in sperm, we have analyzed reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in mutant and control epididymal sperm. Our results showed that ROS levels in mutant sperm were not higher than those observed in the control group, supporting the idea that mechanisms other than oxidative stress may be leading to the increased DNA fragmentation observed in mutant sperm. These results are now included in the revised version of the manuscript (see Figure 5C).</p><p>Regarding the question on how long the sperm need to reside in the mutant environment to undergo DNA fragmentation, recent experiments carried out in response to this reviewer in which we analyzed DNA fragmentation in caput sperm led us to conclude that DNA fragmentation develops during epididymal transit and/or storage in the cauda.

It is the expected time, correct?</p></disp-quote><p>It is well established that after copulatory plug formation, most oocytes are fertilized within 2 to 8 hours, with fertilization rates that increase over time: 0–5% at 1.5 hours post-mating; 40% at 4 hours post-mating and more than 90% at 7 hs after mating (Muro et al., 2016; PMID: 26962112, La Spina et al., 2016; PMID: 26872876). In order to examine whether the embryo development defects observed for mutant mice were due to a delayed arrival of sperm to the ampulla, we decided to analyze the percentage of fertilized eggs recovered from the ampulla at “short times” (4 hs) after mating to avoid the possibility that the prolonged stay of sperm within the female tract corresponding to the usual “overnight mating” schedule could be giving defective sperm enough time to reach the ampulla and, finally, fertilize the eggs (i.e. delayed fertilization). Our results showed that, despite the expected lower fertilization rates observed for both control and mutant males when analyzed just 4 hs after mating, the fertilized eggs corresponding to the mutant group were still exhibiting clear defects to develop into blastocysts compared to controls, not favoring the idea that embryo development defects were due to a delayed fertilization. The sentence in lines “171 and 172” has been modified in the revised version of the manuscript to better explain this conclusion (see lines 152-155 of the revised version).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Line 177. Mutant epididymal sperm already carry defects leading to embryo development failure. Under this subheading, the authors compare within the same female the ability of mutant and control sperm delivered into different horns to support fertilization and embryo development. They show that the embryo development induced by mutant sperm is diminished vs. controls under very similar conditions, confirming the previous results of post-fertilization failure. The data also answers the question raised by the authors of whether the fertilization defects appear during or after epididymal transit; the interpretation of the results is the functional defects in the sperm are present before the transport into the female tract. Important unaddressed questions are, could these defects begin even earlier before arriving at the cauda? Did the authors try to incubate the mutant sperm with the epididymal fluid of WT mice to examine if the sperm defects could be rescued? The opposite experiment could also be performed, where WT sperm are incubated with the epididymal fluid of mutant mice, and the treated sperm examined for altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels or DNA fragmentation.</p></disp-quote><p>First of all, we would like to clarify that our question about whether the fertilization defects appear “during or after epididymal transit” was in fact referring to whether defects appear during epididymal maturation or later on, at the moment of ejaculation. In this regard, our <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization studies allowed us to conclude that defects were already present in epididymal sperm without excluding the possibility that additional defects could appear at the vas deferens or at the moment of ejaculation due to the contribution of seminal plasma secretions.</p><p>Regarding whether sperm defects could appear even earlier before arriving to the cauda, we have now analyzed DNA fragmentation defects in caput vs cauda both mutant and control sperm observing differences between genotypes only for cauda sperm. Based on these observations, we conclude that DNA integrity defects appear within the epididymis after sperm passage through the caput either when sperm reach the corpus or the cauda epididymis, or during their storage within the cauda region.</p><p>Also, as suggested by the reviewer, we incubated <italic>in vitro</italic> WT sperm with epididymal fluid from DKO mice (and vice versa) and then analyzed DNA fragmentation levels. Results showed that exposure of control sperm to the mutant epididymal fluid for 1 hr significantly increased DNA fragmentation levels. When mutant sperm (exhibiting higher levels of DNA fragmentation than control sperm), were exposed to epididymal fluid from WT mice, no differences between groups were observed. Together, these results confirm both that the epididymal fluid from mutant mice contributes to the higher DNA fragmentation levels detected in mutant sperm, and that normal epididymal fluid would not be able to rescue the DNA fragmentation present in mutant cells. These results are now included in the revised version of the manuscript (see Figure 6A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Lines 203 to 216. In these paragraphs the authors indicate &quot;that mutant sperm had a lower percentage of fertilization and lower rates of blastocysts (Figure 3D, E), indicating that defects in egg coat penetration were not responsible for embryo development failure. Later, they indicated that a few eggs fertilized by mutant sperm failed to activate. It is shown that Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations are normal, indicating that the defects lie elsewhere. Could the authors propose a mechanism based on their sperm DNA defects?</p></disp-quote><p>As described in the Result and Discussion sections of the original manuscript, we decided to investigate the existence of possible defects in sperm DNA fragmentation based on evidence indicating that delays in early embryo development may result from the time taken by the egg to repair damaged paternal DNA (Esbert <italic>et al</italic>., 2018; PMID: 30259705, Newman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022; PMID: 34954800, Nguyen <italic>et al</italic>., 2023; PMID: 37658763). In this regard, it is known that time is needed before the first embryonic cell division for activation of the egg DNA repairing machinery (Martin et al., 2019; PMID: 30541031, Newman et al., 2022; PMID: 34954800) and that increased sperm DNA damage may necessitate more time for repair by the oocyte (Martin et al., 2019; PMID: 30541031, Newman et al., 2022; PMID: 34954800). Based on this, we decided to examine possible DNA damage in sperm. Our finding that, in fact, sperm DNA fragmentation was clearly increased in mutant sperm led us to propose that delays in early embryo development in our mutant colonies may result from the time required by the egg to repair sperm DNA fragmentation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The demonstration that C1/C3 sperm have abnormal rates of DNA fragmentation and Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels is significant.

In fact, there is no evidence whether CRISP1/CRISP3 secreted from an epididymis exists in cauda epididymal sperm and directly controls the observed phenomena. Also, the authors wrote there is no strong evidence to exclude the possible role of small RNA in Crisp1/3 dKO sperm (lines 370-372). Therefore, it is at least necessary to measure small RNA abundance in dKO mice.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned by the reviewer and as cited in our manuscript, there is a report indicating that the small RNAs gained during epididymal transit may play a role in embryonic development (Conine et al., 2018; PMID: 30057276). However, the need of small RNAs for embryonic development still remains a topic of debate (Wang et al. 2020; PMCID: PMC7799177). In this regard, clear evidence indicating that sperm DNA fragmentation is associated with embryo development defects together with the increase in sperm DNA fragmentation levels observed in mutant sperm support sperm DNA damage as one of the causes leading to the observed phenotype in our mutant mice. Moreover, recent experiments carried out in response to Reviewer 1 comments revealed that exposure of control sperm to epididymal fluid from mutant mice significantly increases DNA fragmentation levels, confirming that the absence of CRISP1 and CRISP3 proteins in epididymal fluid contributes to sperm DNA damage in mutant sperm. Finally, whereas oxidative stress might also lead to embryo development impairment as mentioned in our original manuscript, recent evaluation of ROS levels in control and mutant sperm carried out in response to Reviewer 1’s comments did not show higher ROS levels in mutant sperm. Thus, although as mentioned in the manuscript, we do not exclude the possibility that small RNAs may also contribute to embryo development defects, our observations support DNA fragmentation and a dysregulation in Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis within the epididymis and sperm as the main responsible for embryo development failure in our mutant males. The experiments using epididymal fluid (Figure 6A) and those evaluating ROS levels (Figure 5C) have been included in the revised version of the manuscript and discussed accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Lines 245-248 and 354-374: According to Figure 5C, the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> level significantly increased in Crisp1/3 dKO sperm compared to control.

Crisp1/3 dKO and Crisp1/4 dKO mice share the disruption of Crisp1, but the phenotype is totally different. Thus, the authors should also examine the CatSper activity in Crisp1/3 dKO sperm.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's insightful comments. In this regard, whereas C1/C3 and C1/C4 DKO colonies shares the disruption of Crisp1, the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in these two colonies are different as no increase in sperm intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> was detected in Crisp C1/C4 DKO mice. Thus, this difference in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels might explain the different embryo development phenotype observed in our two DKO colonies. In this regard, our results revealed that sperm intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels are different depending on the Crisp gene being deleted. Whereas the lack of Crisp1 did not affect intracellular sperm Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (Weigel Munoz et al, 2018; PMID: 29481619), there was an increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in CRISP2 KO sperm (Brukman et al., 2016; PMID: 26786179) and a decrease in sperm when Crisp4 was deleted (Carvajal 2019, Ph.D Thesis). Thus, although the ability of CRISP3 to regulate sperm Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels has not yet been reported, the existence of functional compensations between homologous CRISP members (Curci et al., 2020; PMID: 33037689) makes it complicated to draw straightforward conclusions based on the behavior of each individual protein in Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation. In fact, while the lack of CRISP1 and CRISP4 does not affect sperm Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (Carvajal 2019, Ph.D Thesis), the simultaneous lack of CRISP1 and CRISP3 produced an increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and the lack of the four CRISP proteins showed a decrease in the intracellular levels of the cation after capacitation (Curci et al, 2020). Based on these observations, we conclude that the absence of CRISP1 may or may not lead to altered intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels depending on the other simultaneously-deleted gene/s.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors make a hypothesis that the increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> level may lead to damaged DNA integrity by citing a published paper (lines 360-363). In the published paper, the authors examined the influence of the luminal fluid of the epididymis and vas deference on sperm chromatin fragmentation (Gawecka et al., 2015). However, they did not mention the increased DNA fragmentation in epididymal sperm when these sperm were incubated with Ca<sup>2+</sup> or Mn2+. So, the authors' hypothesis is over discussion. Thus, the correlation between the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> level and DNA integrity in sperm is still unclear. So, the authors should show why the increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> level leads to DNA fragmentation with direct evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment regarding the work by Gawecka et al., (2015), and the opportunity to clarify the proposed mechanism underlying our observations. In the above mentioned paper, the authors reported that when mouse epididymal or vas deferens sperm were incubated with divalent cations (Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mn<sup>2+</sup>) in the presence of luminal fluid, they were induced to degrade their DNA in a process termed sperm chromatin fragmentation (SCF). The fact that both the ejaculated and epididymal mutant sperm used in our studies had been exposed to epididymal fluid lacking CRISP proteins known to regulate sperm Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, opened the possibility that changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels within the epididymal fluid and/or sperm could be responsible for the higher DNA fragmentation levels observed in mutant cells. In this regard, it is important to note that, as requested by Reviewer 1, we performed additional <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments in which WT epididymal sperm were exposed to mutant or WT epididymal fluid in the presence or absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and DNA fragmentation analyzed at the end of incubation. Results showed a significant increase in DNA fragmentation in WT sperm exposed to either mutant epididymal fluid or WT fluid in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Figure 6A). We believe these observations together with the higher intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels detected in DKO sperm (Figure 6B) provides strong evidence supporting changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in the epididymis and sperm as the main responsible for the observed sperm DNA integrity defects. This could be mediated by the activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent nucleases present within the epididymal fluid and/or sperm cells as previously suggested (Shaman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006; PMID: 16914690, Sotolongo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005; PMID: 15713834, Boaz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008; PMID: 17879959, Dominguez and Ward, 2009; PMID: 19938954).
