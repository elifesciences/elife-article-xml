Surveillance not only detects presence/absence but also reveals genetic diversity, which can inform our understanding of rapid adaptation and control measures. An often neglected aspect is that pathogens may also use crop wild relatives as alternative hosts. This study develops the beet (<italic>Beta vulgaris</italic>) rust (<italic>Uromyces beticola</italic>) system to explore how crop pathogens evolve to evade resistance using a wild reservoir. We test predictions that crop selection will drive virulence gene differentiation and affect rates of sex between crop- and wild-host rust populations. We sequenced, assembled, and annotated the 588 Mb beet rust genome, developed a novel leaf peel pathogen DNA extraction protocol, and analysed genetic diversity in 42 wild and crop isolates. We found evidence for two populations: one containing exclusively wild-host isolates; the other containing all crop-host isolates, plus five wild isolates. Effectors showed greater diversity in the exclusively wild population and greater differentiation between populations. Preliminary evidence suggests the rates of sexual reproduction may differ between populations. This study highlights how differences in pathogen populations might be used to identify genes important for survival on crops and how reproduction might impact adaptation. These findings are relevant to all crop-reservoir systems and will remain unnoticed without comparison to wild reservoirs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>disease emergence</kwd><kwd>pathogen adaptation</kwd><kwd>pathogen evolution</kwd><kwd>crop wild relative</kwd><kwd>pathogen genetic reservoir</kwd><kwd>clonal reproduction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/CCG1720/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hall</surname><given-names>Neil</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BBS/E/T/000PR9818</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hall</surname><given-names>Neil</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BBS/E/T/000PR9816</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hall</surname><given-names>Neil</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/T008717/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yvanne</surname><given-names>Hélène</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Evidence for those pathogen genes selected specifically for success on crops.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The world’s human population is projected to increase to 9.9 billion by 2050, yet two billion people are currently malnourished. With over 20% of crops being lost to disease annually, there is an opportunity to increase food production by improving crop disease tolerance/resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bruinsma and Bruinsma, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Savary et al., 2012</xref>). Crop protection by genetic resistance is characterised by short disease-free periods, or a lag while pathogens adapt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brown, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Karasov et al., 2020</xref>). Once resistance is broken, emergent diseases spread quickly, often clonally, through the host population. New sources of resistance take several years to develop and wild crop relative species are being explored as potential reservoirs of resistance gene diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arora et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Karasov et al., 2020</xref>). These wild crop relatives are also reservoirs for pathogens, and once we accept that crop pathogens may be exchanging genetic variation with reservoirs occupying different environments, we introduce the importance of understanding these as sources of novel pathogen genetic variation. Perhaps more importantly, crop-wild pathogen populations present an opportunity to identify genetic variation specifically adapted to crops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">McCann, 2020</xref>). Yet much of the work on crop pathogen emergence has not accounted for this wild reservoir of genetic diversity, and those that have consider one-off invasion scenarios, as opposed to understanding ongoing evolution through adaptation and gene flow (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Grünwald et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Martin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Martin et al., 2014</xref>, but see, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">McMullan et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Gene flow in its broadest sense occurs at different rates. At one end of the spectrum, we have single hybridisation/introgression events and, at the other, contemporary gene flow. Hybridisation events have been implicated in the generation and success of plant pathogens such as Dutch Elm Disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brasier and Kirk, 2010</xref>), wheat blast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Rahnama et al., 2023</xref>) and <italic>Zymoseptoria pseudotritici</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Stukenbrock et al., 2012</xref>), as well as human pathogens such as malaria, <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Galaway et al., 2019</xref>), and sleeping sickness, <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Goodhead et al., 2013</xref>). An example of an intermediate level of genetic exchange is seen in the brassica white rust pathogen (<italic>Albugo candida</italic>) that can infect over 200 plant species and in which host specialised lineages diverge but rare introgression events distribute diversity between lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Jouet et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">McMullan et al., 2015</xref>). Recombination within a diverse genetic reservoir has also been implicated in the generation of the rice blast pathogen, a devastating crop pathogen of global significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Latorre et al., 2020</xref>). However, while these rarer processes are important to understand the generation of novel pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">McCann, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Stukenbrock, 2016</xref>), the ongoing adaptation of crop pathogens to novel resistances may be better understood by using population genetics to consider their access to reservoirs of genetic diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gladieux et al., 2015a</xref>). Developments in genomic surveillance technologies such as Air-seq, may reduce the resource required to survey plant pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Giolai et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Peers et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Weisberg et al., 2021</xref>). Advances to our understanding of pathogen adaptation and emergence will benefit from replicated invasion experiments, and crop landscapes provide that replication. Crop domestication has bottlenecked plant genetic diversity in order to homogenise traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kumar et al., 2021</xref>). Infection of genetically depauperate hosts will favour specific pathogen gene diversity and selection at replicated crop environments can facilitate this understanding.</p><p>Rust fungi make up some of the most economically devastating crop pathogens, infecting crops of global significance such as wheat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Schwessinger et al., 2020</xref>), soybean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Loehrer et al., 2014</xref>), and coffee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Porto et al., 2019</xref>). They are also ideal systems for exploring host adaptation and the crop-reservoir pathogen populations because they are known for their complex life cycles, which include changes in ploidy, partitioned sexual, clonal, overwintering, and dispersal stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kristoffersen et al., 2018</xref>), but primarily because of their obligate association with the living host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Figueroa et al., 2020</xref>). In an agricultural context, the main infection phase is clonal, where urediniospores are found erupting from pustules on the surface of leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Each spore contains two haploid nuclei (dikaryotic). This clonal phase can continue indefinitely on susceptible hosts but can also alternate with a seasonal sexual stage, often on a wild host species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Figueroa et al., 2020</xref>). While there are exceptions, the general principle is that mutation increases heterozygous polymorphism between dikaryotic content (as well as within the population) in the clonal phase, and recombination shuffles this variation in the sexual phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Figueroa et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Schwessinger et al., 2020</xref>). The rare sexual reproduction on a wild host may be a key determinant in bouts of adaptation. In most cases, the sexual phase of the life cycle occurs on a different host plant, termed heteroecism (as opposed to autoecism). In the case of wheat stem rust, this alternate host is barberry, and the presence of this alternate host has been associated with increased rust virulence in Europe and the US for hundreds of years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Barnes et al., 2020</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Zooming in on beet rust, pustules from wild and crop hosts are peeled and sequenced.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>U. beticola</italic> pustules on sugar beet.

However, these processes are difficult to study, either because the wild hosts are peppered throughout a global range and difficult to locate, and/or they are in regions that are difficult to access. For instance, in wheat yellow (stripe) rust, the centre of genetic diversity and recombination are in Nepal, Pakistan, and China, and yet their largely clonally sustained populations expand to every continent except Antarctica (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ali et al., 2014</xref>). The present study is an attempt to resolve this obstacle by developing a system, the crop-wild beet rust system – sugar beet (<italic>B. vulgaris</italic> subsp. <italic>vulgaris</italic>), sea beet (<italic>Beta vulgaris</italic> subsp. <italic>maritima</italic>), and beet rust (<italic>Uromyces beticola</italic>) – which is ideally suited to study crop-wild pathogen evolution. Sugar beet is one of the most recently domesticated crop species (circa 200 y, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dohm et al., 2014</xref>), which is grown for sugar production and is being developed as a biofuel throughout Europe and the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Panella, 2010</xref>). Domesticated in Europe, it is often grown alongside coastally distributed sea beet, which remains a source of genetic variation for sugar beet breeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cauwer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Leys et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Sandell et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kristoffersen et al., 2018</xref> present the beet rust disease cycle, showing both sugar and sea beet are impacted by the autoecious rust pathogen, <italic>U. beticola</italic>. Being an obligate biotroph <italic>U. beticola</italic> must survive on wild hosts between sugar beet crops cycles. Despite living on a single host species, the beet rust lifecycle contain urediospore (n+n) and teliospore (2 n; and subsequent basidiospore (n), pycniospore (n) and aeciospores (n+n)) stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kristoffersen et al., 2018</xref>). It is the asexual urediospores that can cyclically reinfect, and sexual basidiospores that are important in the consideration of the impact of a partitioned lifecycle for invasion and evolution. Although relatively little is known about resistance mechanisms in beet species, one resistance locus, the Rz2 locus responsible for rhizomania resistance, has been well described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Rodríguez et al., 2019</xref>). Microsatellite analyses of wild sea beet populations demonstrate high levels of allelic diversity and heterozygosity, associated with outbreeding, which is corroborated at the genome scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fénart et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Ribeiro et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Stevanato et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Sandell et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Here, we explore the utility of the beet-rust system as a model to understand pathogen adaptation to agricultural environments. We have produced the first annotated <italic>U. beticola</italic> genome assembly and characterised population genetic diversity of rust isolates from sugar and sea beets collected across the east of England. We developed a DNA peel extraction protocol to favourably extract pathogen DNA relative to host DNA and re-sequenced 42 rust isolates (24 from sugar beet hosts and 18 from sea beets; ~370 km of coastline). Our predictions were that (A) isolates would partition into populations separated by the wild and crop host divide (allowing for some cross-infection) (B) genes important for success in these environments would be more genetically differentiated between populations, and that (C) the rate of clonal to sexual reproduction would be elevated in the crop pathogen population. Genes important for adaptation to the agricultural environment likely have many functions. However, we reason that host genetic diversity is one of the largest discriminating factors, and therefore we focused on pathogen genetic diversity at putative host interaction genes (effectors). Effector candidates can be readily identified using their secretion signals in the gene annotation process. Most importantly, these genes are known to be at the centre of the virulence-resistance arms race, where the right combination of effectors will increase the virulence of an isolate, and yet host recognition of a single effector will prevent infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Stukenbrock and McDonald, 2009</xref>). We find that (A) rust isolates from all crop hosts belong to a single genetic cluster, which also included five northern wild host isolates, indicating a potential invasion source. The remaining wild-host isolates fall in an exclusively wild clade. We find that (B) this wild reservoir clade has especially high diversity at effector genes, which are also more differentiated than non-effectors. We find that (C) the rate of clonal to sexual reproduction differs between populations, although this signal is in opposite directions based on genotypic and linkage-based analyses. Our results are by no means final, but they do bring us closer to understanding ongoing processes that generate novel virulent pathogen lineages. From a surveillance perspective, these methods have implications for pathogen invasion and emergence, and our ability to target treatment and reduce chemical inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Richard et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>U. beticola</italic> genome assembly</title><p>We assembled the <italic>U. beticola</italic> genome (588 Mbp) using short-read data into 19,690 contigs with a genome N50 of 74 Kbp, the largest contig being 554 Kbp (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

Using 1.87 million SNPs, we assessed genetic diversity at three levels. First, we used principal component analysis (PCA) and then discriminant analysis of principle components (DAPC) to identify structure in the distribution of genetic variation among isolates. PCA was run on 307,041 linkage pruned SNPs and represented as a scatter and a neighbour joining (NJ) tree. Isolates differentiate into two clusters across the first principal component (PC1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) which separates a group containing only wild-infecting isolates from another group containing all crop-infecting isolates plus five northern wild isolates. A neighbour joining tree is not able to accurately depict relationships among recombining isolates. However, the NJ tree does reflect populations partitioned across PC1 in addition to different patterns of diversification in both clades, which is consistent with clonality and rapid spread in the agricultural clade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). The five wild isolates found in the agricultural clade are not found together within the same subclade. DAPC is a method that utilises data transformation by PCA as a prior step to discriminant analysis, is not biased by linked sites, and is able to partition in the presence of clonally related isolates. Using 1.87 million SNPs, all 41 PCs were retained to determine using the lowest Bayesian information criterion (BIC), that isolates are partitioned into two clusters (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, Appendix 2). Fifteen PCs were used in the DAPC analysis, and this confirms that clusters are entirely disentangled across a single discriminant function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), with individual membership of each cluster equal to one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Population structure of wild and crop isolates.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Principal Component Analysis of 300 thousand linkage-pruned SNPs.

The neighbour-net network again shows differentiation of an exclusively wild population of isolates from three sites in the southeast of England (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>; Appendix 2). It is noteworthy that isolates from the five northern wild beets are again distributed throughout the clade of crop isolates, as opposed to clustering together. The fact that isolates from each site are distributed across the crop clade, suggests high levels of dispersal. With respect to wild and crop pathogen populations, dispersal may be bidirectional but is ultimately from a presumed wild source, as crop beets are not in the ground year-round but are required by this obligate biotroph. The exclusively wild isolates are clearly separated from the crop isolates, and reticulated patterns in the network suggest an impact of recombination which is found to a greater extent within the exclusively wild clade of isolates.</p><p>Admixture analysis is used here to assess whether the five northernmost isolates, that were sampled on a wild host but found within the crop-infecting lineage, carried any signal of hybridisation. We used an admixture methodology that does not assume Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Frichot et al., 2014</xref>), which is appropriate for species that can clonally reproduce. The methodology estimates population structure and admixture using sparse nonnegative matrix factorization (sNMF within LEA Frichot and François, 2015).

Combined, the evidence suggests two distinct populations (prediction A), the first of which we consider to be crop-infecting as it contains all of the crop-infecting isolates as well as five northern wild-host isolates. The second population infects exclusively wild hosts, and here we use this distinction (crop-infecting) to begin to understand pathogen evolution across a wild-crop boundary.</p><p>Network analyses were based on gene CDS regions from those genes with read coverage greater than 60% of the gene (per isolate). Low coverage genes, or gene absence did not appear to disproportionately impact one population. Low coverage impacted 87 out of 9148 genes. Most of these genes (48) were absent from all isolates. Seven genes were absent from the wild population, but they were also absent in the majority of individuals in the crop population. There was a high correlation between the presence of a gene in one population and that in another (r<sup>2</sup>=0.89; p=&lt;2.2e-16). This was the case regardless of whether isolates were grouped by DAPC clustered populations or by host affiliation (see below &amp; Appendix 3).

Therefore, gene and effector genetic diversity and differentiation values respectively represent a genome-wide distribution reflecting demography (i.e. migration and drift), as well as selective forces from the hosts and the environment.

We next assessed the evidence for prediction C: that crop selection increases the rate of clonal to sexual reproduction in the population containing those isolates. Perhaps surprisingly, the level of heterozygosity is not significantly higher in the crop population, as might be expected if clonality were operating long-term (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; median heterozygous site N<sup>o</sup>.: Agri = 326,246,, Wild = 321,031; Wilcoxon W=225, p=0.332; e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Schwessinger et al., 2020</xref>). To understand the relative contribution of sexual and asexual reproduction in wild and crop populations, we assessed the level of inbreeding. The inbreeding coefficient, <italic>F</italic>, is a genotype-based metric that describes the proportion of genetic variation contained within an individual isolate relative to its subpopulation. In most cases, <italic>F</italic> scales between zero and one, indicating a continuum between random mating and complete inbreeding. We found that <italic>F<sub>IS</sub></italic> is negative in all isolates of the crop population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Negative <italic>F<sub>IS</sub></italic> indicates excess heterozygosity and a role for the preservation of polymorphism via clonal reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Balloux et al., 2003</xref>).

Linkage disequilibrium is also informative for the rate of sexual reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Nieuwenhuis and James, 2016</xref>). Given the fragmented, repeat-rich nature of the present genome, we prefer to use these genotypic measures of inbreeding and clonality.

Blocks of excess heterozygosity (consecutive sites of excess heterozygosity based on a 5% significance level using the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test) impact crop and wild populations to different extents. We found that the crop population has approximately 22 thousand blocks (two or more consecutive excess heterozygous sites) where the wild population has less than ten thousand blocks (mean block length: Agri = 227.7 bp, Wild = 124.0 bp; mean N<sup>o</sup>. excess heterozygous sites: Agri = 5.1, Wild = 5.9).

There are several arguments that might account for this observation. First, there is no reason to expect that a crop-host isolate lineage can never infect a wild host, particularly given the prevalence of these isolates and the expectation that this crop population may have been seeded from a wild isolate. Unfortunately, host sequencing coverage was too low to identify any relationship between host and pathogen genetic diversity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>). We did additional analysis of pathogen data under a strict <italic>crop-host</italic> and <italic>wild-host</italic> criterion. In essence, this involved moving the five wild-host isolates found in the crop-host population, into the wild-host population, introducing nucleotide diversity. By forcing this direct split between wild-host and crop-host isolates we were interested to see whether there were effectors that increased levels of differentiation. There was a strong positive correlation between differentiation at all genes using both partitioning regimes and, as expected, the population partition had higher levels of differentiation (Appendix 5). This strong correlation preserved the signals observed in the previous (DAPC-based) analysis, albeit to a lesser degree. Effectors were also no more differentiated among host-partitioned isolates than for population partitioning.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we explored the potential for population genetic measures to describe the processes underlying contemporary crop pathogen adaptation and invasion. In doing so, we set out to highlight the importance of sampling and analysing a genetic reservoir outside of the agricultural system as a means of identifying genes important for survival within that agricultural system. This wild reservoir population’s genetic diversity would not have been visible had we only sampled the crop. Agriculture is a recent phenomenon and all plant pathogens, until crop domestication, evolved on wild relative hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Weisberg et al., 2021</xref>). Crop pathogens must therefore specialise, and we reasoned that the contemporary signal of this will be present in their genomes as: (A) population structure partitioned by wild and crop hosts, (B) polymorphism favoured at host interaction (effector) genes, in addition to (C) skewed reproduction towards clonality on their monoculture crop hosts (versus wild hosts). Analyses were selected because they can be applied to any gene or fragmented genome and have applications towards pathogen genomic surveillance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Peers et al., 2024</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Beet rust is differentiated into two populations in the UK</title><p>We found evidence for (prediction A) two populations overall – the population containing all the crop isolates spanned the 200 km sugar beet cropping area and surrounded the second, wild coastal population. Crop isolates were sampled just 10 km from these wild isolates at their nearest point. It is perhaps not surprising that all crop isolates belonged to the same population. However, as well as living on all crop hosts, this population continued outside of the beet cultivation area, northwards on sea beets, to the edge of our sampling range. Therefore, this crop population also included five northern wild isolates (24 crops and five wild isolates). Population genetic assignment, using PCA, DAPC, network, admixture, and machine learning analyses all identified these five northern sea beet isolates within this crop population, finding that they were no more admixed than crop isolates and did not occupy their own subclade of the network. This finding is perhaps consistent with the expectation that crop populations invade from a wild source (as well as reinfect). Without broader sampling into the northern wild range, or temporal sampling, we cannot speculate on the broader metapopulation dynamics of the source of the crop lineage and its turnover. However, host diversity is likely an important determinant of pathogen diversity and preliminary evidence from wild beet inoculation trials shows that northern (Humber) hosts represent both a distinct genetic group and have reduced resistance to crop rusts (Yvanne, et al., in prep).</p><p>To address whether a strict definition of a pathogen’s host affiliation impacted our results, we also analysed diversity under that definition, ignoring population structure. As expected, this reduced the overall level of differentiation among populations but the signal in effectors remained (see below).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Genetic reservoirs of effectors and their selection</title><p>Effectors had greater nucleotide diversity than non-effectors in the wild population but not in the crop-infecting population, which is consistent with the maintenance of polymorphism by balancing selection in the wild (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hughes and Yeager, 1998</xref>). This, and the observation that effectors were significantly more differentiated between wild and crop-infecting populations on average, are consistent with prediction B and suggests diversifying selection (host resistance) operating to distinguish diversity between populations. This is interesting because we do not discount the potential for effector diversity selected for both populations, reducing differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Muirhead, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Schierup et al., 2000</xref>).

Genetic diversity and differentiation of wild pathogens is not the way to identify specific resistance-virulence gene interactions. However, the molecular analyses required to do so are time-consuming and describe interactions based on a fixed background. With real world polymorphism, these interactions may break down where they operate redundantly, epistatically, or have a dosage component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Guo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Meile et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Thordal-Christensen et al., 2018</xref>).

In that work, the authors highlight both a role for host diversity driving pathogen selection as well as pathogen background genetic diversity originating from multiple genetic sources. Analysing pathogen diversity in this way can aid the classification of those genes most important for success on crops. For example, in the present study, two out of the top ten most differentiated genes are effectors, which is dramatically above the expected number given just 60 polymorphic effectors were identified. Moreover, these analyses broaden the focus by highlighting non-effector genes that could also increase the success of crop pathogens.</p><p>Genetic differentiation could be one of several criteria applied to define the importance of genes that are particularly successful on crop hosts. The absence of a barrier to gene flow between wild-host and crop-host isolates also provides a source of novel effector polymorphism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">McCann, 2020</xref>) and so the level of genetic differentiation at both extremes can inform on the importance of diversity as well as sources of introduction. Effectors in general tend to receive fewer functional annotations and, interestingly, differentiated effectors identified in the present study have fewer known functions compared to those pervasive effectors that are preserved in both wild and crop populations, and also tend to be retained among species. The present work provides a framework to identify agriculturally adapted gene candidates and subsequently identify the mechanisms that facilitate that adaptation via introgression and recombination.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Partitioning modes of reproduction</title><p>Rusts are among those fungi able to partition sexual (recombination) and clonal life stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Figueroa et al., 2020</xref>), and this strategy makes them particularly suited to invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gladieux et al., 2015a</xref>). The beet rust lifecycle is autoecious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kristoffersen et al., 2018</xref>) but the advantages of clonality (i.e. preservation of successful combinations of effectors and rapid spread on temporally available crop hosts), are as present as the advantages of recombining effectors on pervasive sexual wild hosts. Our third prediction (C), therefore, was that despite potentially high levels of gene flow (or frequent invasion), the advantages of clonal reproduction on crops would impose enough of a constraint to allow us to observe an increase in the signal of clonality in our crop-host pathogen population. Our observations here were mixed. At the genotypic level, we used isolate heterozygosity to observe a signal of clonality across the crop population. Incidentally, our five northern wild isolates from this crop population also had this signal of elevated inbreeding. Importantly, isolates from the wild reservoir population also carried signals of inbreeding alongside outbreeding, although significantly higher levels of outbreeding overall. These regions of heterozygous excess were not associated with repeats, which is consistent with an increase in the rate of clonality in agriculture, where clonal lineages preserve their heterozygosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Balloux et al., 2003</xref>). At the haplotypic level, however, the estimated rate of recombination was greater for the crop-infecting population compared to the wild.</p><p>The observation that crop populations have greater excess heterozygosity, while at the same time the rate of recombination (<italic>4N<sub>e</sub>r</italic>) is also higher, is unexpected for established populations. However, seasonal invasion and expansion of a crop population would preserve mutations despite frequent recombination occurring alongside the expansion, or prior to it, with its signal preserved in clonal haplotypes. So, while both analyses do confirm differentiated rates of sex in wild and crop populations, they are in opposite directions. It’s important to remember that one of the reasons these systems are poorly understood, is that they are dynamic, and degrees of clonality and recombination (varied in each population) may be interacting with invasion and frequent changes in population size. These phenomena break many of the assumptions made by classical population genetics models. Unfortunately, we can’t resolve all these questions here, but we highlight that more work is needed to understand pathogen invasion and adaptation to crops. Further work on single isolate, contiguous, phased genome assemblies (wild and crop) is required to add weight to haplotype-based analyses and facilitate hypothesis generation using simulations.</p><p>Investment in clonal or sexual reproduction can vary with environmental heterogeneity, where the advantages of sex for rapid adaptation diminish as environmental heterogeneity declines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Becks and Agrawal, 2010</xref>). Clonal pathogens spread rapidly and preserve their genotype, and this is of particular advantage on a monoculture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Maynard Smith et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Möller and Stukenbrock, 2017</xref>). These crop pathogens do generate novel polymorphism by mutation, but without recombination, selection at one locus will interact with another and reduce the rate of adaptation (Hill-Robertson effect, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hill and Robertson, 1966</xref>). Rapid spread on a monoculture is perhaps a worthwhile trade-off, at least until the genetic diversity of that monoculture is improved or increased. Wild pathogens, however, must infect a new genotype with every host and so recombination is not expected to be selected against to the same extent.</p><p>Crop pathogens represent a rare opportunity to study the trade-off of clonality and sex. Wheat stripe rust has bouts of clonality spanning decades where increased levels of isolate heterozygosity is believed to be driven by lack of a local sexual host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Schwessinger et al., 2020</xref>). The long term impact being that the incidence of clonal wheat rust epidemics appears related to the proximity of its sexual host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Mojerlou et al., 2025</xref>). <italic>M. lini</italic> also shows temporally varying levels of clonality associated with epidemic spread on flax (<italic>Linum marginale</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Susi et al., 2020</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Balloux et al., 2003</xref> state that mixed clonal and sexual reproductive modes are nearly indistinguishable from strict sexual reproduction. The fact that we observe excess heterozygosity in most isolates, with the wild population being impacted to a lesser extent, suggests that sexual reproduction may be infrequent in the wild and perhaps removed from agriculture by clonal spread post-invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Maynard Smith et al., 1993</xref>). This is despite polymorphism being low (e.g. 44.6% polymorphic gene CDS), perhaps suggesting temporally fluctuating population size. Sex and the rate of clonality, inflation of effective population size, and gene flow with boom and bust dynamics make accurate modelling of the population difficult (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Susi et al., 2020</xref>). The future impact of climate change on the availability of novel environments and environmental heterogeneity further complicates our ability to protect crops. A better understanding of genotypic- and linkage-based factors are important for this beet-rust system, but must be combined with work on the impact of lifestyle on invasion dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Taliadoros et al., 2025</xref>, <italic>in revision</italic>) to allow analysis of crop pathogen genetic diversity with reservoir populations in mind. Estimation of linkage and the rate of sex is not only critical to our ability to determine where novel pathogen lineages come from, but how they continue to adapt and overcome novel sources of host resistance and treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Genomic tools for population genetics</title><p>Identifying pathogen reservoirs of diversity is arguably the first step in determining sources of introgression (or recombination).

For population analyses, the number of isolates analysed here is relatively small. This perhaps makes the signals we observe even more striking. Further research in this system could go in each of two directions. Improving the assembly would facilitate stronger linkage analyses, more accurate estimation of recombination rate and then modelling invasion and population divergence scenarios. Targeted approaches would facilitate collection and analysis of rust pathogen populations in a new season at multiple locations across Europe. By not paying the price of whole genome sequencing for each isolate, analyses could focus on identifying evidence for selection of the same alleles on crop hosts in multiple independent populations across Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Peers et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>Pathogen genetic reservoirs may be operating in a number of crop wild relatives, or alternative hosts.

Important also is that RAiSD requires no other input parameters. RAiSD was used on all SNPs separately in the wild (1,172,766) and crop (1,309,150) populations. We used the <italic>μ</italic> statistic in two ways, first to identify genes within windows above given thresholds and second to determine the level of evidence for selective sweeps around genes in each of the wild and crop populations.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Supervision, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con17"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con18"><p>Supervision, Investigation, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Tables referenced in genome annotation methods.</title><p><italic>Genome</italic> – Assembly quality metrics such as N50. <italic>Reads Alignment</italic> – Mapping quality for the 12 RNA-Seq PE read libraries that were aligned to the genome. <italic>Transcript Assemblies</italic> – Transcript assembly metrics for two assembly methods. <italic>Repeats</italic> – Repeat masked regions for protein alignments and the gene build. <italic>Protein Alignments</italic> – Protein alignment summary from 26 representatives (including references). <italic>Mikado Transcript</italic> – Mikado transcript assembly integration gene model statistics. <italic>Augustus Training</italic> – Augustus training results based on Mikado Gold transcripts. <italic>Augustus</italic> – Gene model statistics from three Augustus runs using different levels of evidence. <italic>Minos Release</italic> – Final gene model statistics after selection using Minos-Mikado</p></caption><media xlink:href="elife-91245-supp1-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Tables detailing sample locations and proximity metrics.</title><p><italic>Sample</italic> – Isolate sampling data listed north to south including information on whether isolation was from a wild or crop beet (W-Ag_host) and how isolates clustered after DAPC analysis of genotypes (W-Ag_path-DAPC).

suggest first that there are two rust populations and second that five northern isolates sampled on wild hosts, cluster throughout the crop infecting population and apart from all other wild infecting isolates. Here, we look at the impact of increasing <italic>k</italic> values on the relationships of the isolates we sampled. Specifically, we confirm that increasing <italic>k</italic> clusters, does not partition the five northern wild sampled isolates, into a different clade. We must conclude, therefore, that they are part of the clade that includes all crop infecting isolates.</p><p>Here, we broaden admixture analyses (main text) to explore the impact of increasing <italic>k</italic> values with reference to isolates placement in the network. Furthermore, we apply a machine learning (ML) methodology in attempt to delineate diversity in the five wild infecting but agriculturally assigned isolates. In ML we used the five isolates in the training data inform the ML, and next we removed them. We set a Wild or Agricultural host, binary classification. In the informed training data, we were able to classify four out of five of these as wild. However, after removing these five wild individuals from the training data and using them as unseen test datapoints, we found that they were now classified as agricultural as in former analyses.</p><p>Combined these analyses suggest we have two populations, and that the agricultural population, to which all crop infecting isolates belong, includes the five northern wild infecting isolates. This first population is in addition to an exclusively wild population which is differentiated from that crop infecting population. While our agricultural population is not strict, wild reservoir diversity can be used to highlight diversity from the population containing all crop infecting isolates.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s8-2"><title>Methods</title><p>We used Scikit Learn (version 3.7) for the ML binary classification analysis to predict if a given sample was from a Wild (class 0) or Agricultural host (class 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Auton and McVean, 2007</xref>). The following classifiers were tested: Logistic Regression, Gaussian process, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, Support Vector Machine (linear kernel), Decision Tree, and K nearest neighbours (KNN). The features used to train the models were the 1,865,259 SNPs for each sample where SNPs were converted into numerical format with Reference Homozygous SNPs (0/0) denoted as 0, Heterozygous SNPs (0/1) as 1, Homozygous SNPs (1/1) denoted as 2 and missing alleles for a SNP (./.) as NA. Next, we removed any SNPs with NA’s (813,649 SNPs remaining). The MinMaxScaler was tested to scale the features from 0 to 1 and initially all samples were included in the analysis where at random 80% of the data was selected to be used for training and the remaining 20% was held out for testing. In the second part of our analysis the five wild individuals were removed during model training and testing and later used as unseen test datapoints. For both cases, next, fivefold cross validation was also performed on the training data. We used K-folds for cross validation (n_splits = 5, stratified k-fold). The methods’ hyperparameters were optimized using a grid search to test a range of parameters as per our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gardiner et al., 2021</xref>). Class weighting was used to account for uneven balance between the classes. We selected the best performing ML models (using best parameters after fine tuning), according to the highest mean F1-score on test set and cross validation.</p><p>We next ran a well-known model explanation algorithm called SHAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Lundberg and Lee, 2017</xref>) on the best ML model that was generated using the 813,649 SNPs. We used SHAP to show the local explanation for a specific set of samples to reveal the reasoning behind its prediction for each sample i.e., which SNPs most contributed to it being classified Wild or Agri by the model.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s8-3"><title>Results</title><p>The number of population clusters, as indicated by the ancestral populations entropy criterion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig1">Appendix 2—figure 1</xref>), was less clear than using the DAPC method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, main text) and, to specifically investigate the admixture in our five northern wild infecting agriculturally assigned isolates, we plot individual admixture for <italic>K</italic>=2:4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig2">Appendix 2—figure 2</xref>).

However, when the five northern wild infecting isolates were used as an unseen test set, this model labelled all five of the samples as Agri as per the DAPC methods.

diversifying selection might be expected to have higher levels of diversity and differentiation than other genes on average. In the main text we present work based on SNPs as measured by nucleotide diversity (<italic>μ</italic>) and genetic differentiation (<italic>F</italic><sub><italic>ST</italic></sub>) which are appropriate for population genetic analyses based on more fragmented genomes. However, these methods don’t specifically account for haplotype diversity. Here, we build on the methods used in the main text, first to better understand the impact of expression mediation of virulence, then the impact genetic divergence (<italic>d</italic><sub><italic>XY</italic></sub>) on effectors. We then use methods impacted to a greater degree by linkage to look for signals of selection (selective sweeps) and recombination. Not only are these linkage-based methods hindered by a fragmented repeat rich genome but additionally by invasion demography which can produce signals similar to a selective sweep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Pavlidis and Alachiotis, 2017</xref>). We do not find a signal consistent with mediation of virulence in effectors by expression. However, in analyses of divergence and selective sweeps we find some evidence of increases in both signals associated with effectors. Our assessment of recombination shows a somewhat contradictory pattern in this repeat rich dikaryon. Specifically, that the agricultural population has a higher rate of recombination than the wild.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s10-2"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>Effector silencing and alternative splicing could be an important, rapidly evolving mechanism of pathogen adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jeon et al., 2022</xref>). Here, using genome polymorphism data, we observe indeed that a greater proportion of non-effector genes are alternatively spliced (<italic>𝜒</italic>2: 198, df=1, p=0.03; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app4fig1">Appendix 4—figure 1</xref>). The partitioning of SNP and indel variants in genes and effectors did not appear to differ among gene types or populations. High impact mutations responsible for start lost, stop gained or stop lost impacted a very low proportion of gene types again with no consistent pattern.</p><p>Effectors retain a signal of diversifying selection, when compared between wild and crop populations (see main text). This signal is consistent with the idea that selection for alternative variants in these two populations, is present at enough effector genes to significantly increase the differentiation measure (<italic>F</italic><sub><italic>ST</italic></sub>) on average. However, this measure is based on allele frequency distributions, absolute sequence divergence (<italic>d</italic><sub><italic>XY</italic></sub>) is an independent measure used to indicate divergence, for a given region of the genome. To determine whether effector divergence is greater than that of non-effector genes, we re-called all positions in the genome to reduce bias caused by missing sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Korunes and Samuk, 2021</xref> and measured divergence and differentiation.</p><p>Both differentiation and divergence were estimated to be significantly greater at effectors than non-effector genes (median <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>ST</italic></sub>: Effector=0.103, non-effector Gene=0.085; Wilcoxon(<italic>π</italic>) W=751402, p=0.001; median <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>XY</italic></sub>: Effector=0.3×10<sup>-3</sup>, non-effector Gene=0.2×10<sup>-3</sup>; Wilcoxon(<italic>π</italic>) W=818110, p=0.031; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app4fig2">Appendix 4—figure 2</xref>). For genetic differentiation this recapitulates the result in the main text, although here using the all-sites methodology. The measure of absolute divergence is also significantly greater for 10kb windows that span an effector gene.</p><p>Divergence (<italic>D</italic><sub><italic>XY</italic></sub>), is often used as evidence for regions of the genome important for speciation, where divergence accumulates in regions important for ecological specialisation or reproductive isolation (<italic>genomic islands of speciation</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cruickshank and Hahn, 2014</xref>). Genomic regions resistant to gene flow would be expected to have higher absolute and relative measures of species divergence, as we observe in the present study. At the genome level however, we do not expect a trajectory of divergence leading towards speciation, and so divergent haploblocks are unlikely to extend from ecologically specialised haplotypes. To assess the broader patterns of divergence at the genome scale we plotted windows of divergence and differentiation.</p><p>Perhaps because of the fragmented nature of the genome assembly, we do not observe broader fluctuations in divergence and differentiation across many of these contigs, the majority of which contain fewer than ten independent windows (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app4fig3">Appendix 4—figure 3</xref>). While the largest contig in the assembly is over 500kb, it contains just six gene annotations, none of which are effectors. The mean number of genes present on a contig (with at least one gene) is just 2.3, and including those contigs greater than 200kb, this increases to 5.0 genes. Analysis of genomes at this scale favour gene level analyses (see main text), as short contigs prevent analysis of clusters of genes (or effectors), as well as capturing fluctuations in broader signatures around those regions. Moreover, such signals are usually observed between isolates over broader geographic, even global scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gladieux et al., 2015b</xref>), making our observation of both increased relative and absolute divergence at effector genes perhaps more remarkable.</p><p>In line with the observation that genetic divergence is greater in effectors, is the observation that the signal of selective sweeps is also greater in effectors, and that this signal is present in agricultural effectors but not wild ones (relative to non-effector genes; see main text), consistent with selection operating on effectors. However, the signal of selective sweeps is not so great in any one effector to take it over the 99% threshold and so, again, these observations must be taken in consideration of the fragmented genome and the underlying demography, in which we expected invasion dynamics to also limit levels of diversity across the genome, particularly in the crop infecting population.</p><p>In the main text we use <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>IS</italic></sub> to explore evidence for differing rates of clonality between the wild and agricultural populations and we find that the crop infecting population has significantly lower (and negative) levels of diversity which is consistent with the maintenance of heterozygosity in clonal lineages (see main text). Here, we used LDhat to identify evidence for varying rates of recombination among populations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Surprisingly we find that the crop infecting population has a higher rate of recombination, on average (and in 9 out of 10 contigs), than that of the wild population (mean 4<italic>N</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub><italic>r</italic>: agri=196.5, wild=90.1l <xref ref-type="table" rid="app4table1">Appendix 4—table 1</xref>). Reconciling these results with <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>IS</italic></sub> results from the main text is difficult without a high contiguity phased assembly. Heterozygosity-based measures (e.g. <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>IS</italic></sub>) of modes of reproduction are useful in the present case because they are biased to a lesser degree by the quality and contiguity of a genome assembly. Here, we have a highly fragmented unphased dikaryotic assembly. Our linkage-based statistics suggest the opposite is true, that rates of recombination are higher in the agricultural population. To further reconcile genotypic and haplotypic indications of the modes of reproduction operating in these two populations, we must generate de novo phased assemblies, from each population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s10-3"><title>Methods</title><p>Absolute genetic divergence requires an all sites vcf file to properly account for (and distinguish) missing sites from zero polymorphism between haplotypes.

Distinguishing these processes in the present system is difficult because we believe they may be interacting. For example, clonal reproduction is expected to preserve mutations in a heterozygous state and each polymorphism is expected to be observed at a low frequency (rare). This sets up the expectation that our agricultural population, which we predict has a greater rate of clonal to sexual reproduction, has a greater proportion of rare variants. However, we may also observe boom and bust cycles in this population because of recolonisation after crop free periods. These annual reduction and clonal expansions would preserve those heterozygous mutations and after expansion, they would be shared among all individuals of that linage, having the opposite effect. The pattern we observe in the present study is not clear cut and requires a better understanding of the rates of sexual reproduction (linkage) as well as temporal estimates of genetic differentiation in order to parameterise an individual based model and test our predictions against these observations.</p><p>First, we consider DAPC population. In the low allele frequency category, as expected we observe a larger number of rare variants in the agricultural population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app5fig1">Appendix 5—figure 1</xref>). However, agricultural and wild populations don’t deviate from each other in most of their minor allele frequency bins, nor in Tajima’s D. The increase in proportion of rare variants (increased clonal reproduction) in agriculture would have the impact of reducing Tajima’s D in the bins below zero. The DAPC agricultural population does dominate across this region but so too does it at higher Tajima’s D values (expansion from a bottleneck). Moreover, the DAPC wild and agricultural Tajima’s D distributions largely overlap.</p><p>The overall pattern of minor allele frequency and Tajima’s D distributions are somewhat similar when we consider individuals grouped by the host from which they were sampled. In this host differentiated set, the agricultural group again retain an increased rare variant frequency although this is much less apparent in the Tajima’s D distribution.</p><p>Next, to assess the impact of using host assignment as opposed to DAPC assignment (main text), we repeat analyses from the main text for host-grouping and compare to the DAPC-grouping results. The impact of host grouping on genome wide nucleotide diversity (median <italic>π</italic> 10 Kbp windows) is that the wild-host group further increases relative to wild-DAPC group, while on the agricultural side the decline is only marginal (Host <italic>π</italic>: Agri 0.251×10<sup>-3</sup>; Wild 0.320×10<sup>-3</sup> DAPC <italic>π</italic>: Agri = 0.252 × 10<sup>-3</sup>; Wild = 0.269 × 10<sup>-3</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and main text). This pattern suggests that transferring some agricultural-DAPC polymorphism over to the wild-host group, increases diversity there without reducing diversity in the agricultural host-group because much of the diversity remains in that group. The difference between wild and agricultural host-groups has increased and they remain significantly differentiated (Wilcoxon(<italic>π</italic>) W=2362353216, p&lt;0.001). The correlation in nucleotide diversity for host-grouping is strong (r2=0.94 p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app5fig2">Appendix 5—figure 2B</xref>) and marginally higher than for the DAPC-grouping (r2=0.92 p&lt;0.001; see main text). Again, this is consistent with the expectation, as five individuals from one DAPC defined group have been moved across to another, increasing the apprant correlation in diversity between wild-host and agricultural-host groups.</p><p>Analysis of polymorphic gene CDS nucleotide diversity results in the same conclusions as in DAPC defined groups (main text). The increase in wild-host nucleotide diversity is reflected here and increased the significance of agricultural comparisons to the wild, such that wild-host effector diversity (median <italic>π</italic>=0.482 × 10<sup>–3</sup>) remains significantly higher than agricultural-host effector diversity (median <italic>π</italic>=0.085 × 10<sup>–3</sup>; Wilcoxon(<italic>π</italic>) W=1106, p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app5fig2">Appendix 5—figure 2C</xref>) and wild-host non-effectors (median <italic>π</italic>=0.110 × 10<sup>–3</sup>) remain higher than agricultural-host non-effectors (median <italic>π</italic>=0.054 × 10<sup>–3</sup>; Wilcoxon(<italic>π</italic>) W=6500805, p&lt;0.001). Within population wild-host effectors remain significantly higher than non-effectors (Wilcoxon(<italic>π</italic>) W=70749, p&lt;0.001) and agricultural-host non-effectors remain not significantly less than effectors in their nucleotide diversity (Wilcoxon(<italic>π</italic>) W=111735, p=0.158).</p><p>Finally, we consider the impact of host grouping on genetic differentiation (<italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic>). DAPC-grouped <italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic> values are more than 40% greater than host-group values (non-effectors=1.49, effectors = 1.42) and, again these results are consistent with expectation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app5fig2">Appendix 5—figure 2D</xref>). The correlation in genetic differentiation at genes, between grouping methods (Host or DAPC) is strong (<italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic> Non-effectors: r<sup>2</sup>=0.95, p&lt;0.001; <italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic> Effectors: r<sup>2</sup>=0.97, p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app5fig2">Appendix 5—figure 2D</xref>). Despite the 40% lower level of genetic differentiation between host-grouped samples a small number of non-effector genes (272) have a greater differentiation in the host-differentiated set than the DAPC-differentiated. However, without an a priori prediction of the groups of genes we expect to find here such as the one we have for effectors, we can’t discriminate from chance within this set without temporal sampling.</p><fig id="app5fig1" position="float"><label>Appendix 5—figure 1.</label><caption><title>Minor allele frequency (MAF, top) and Tajima’s D (bottom) for all variants.</title><p>MAF and Tajima’s D analysed twice, once for each of the two methods of grouping these individuals (DAPC, left and Host differentiated, right; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-91245-app5-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="app5fig2" position="float"><label>Appendix 5—figure 2.</label><caption><title>Host defined groups retain a signal of adaptive diversity in effectors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Genome wide nucleotide diversity (π, 10 kbp non-overlapping blocks) is significantly higher in the wild host-group compared to the agricultural-host group and (<bold>B</bold>) at the gene level, nucleotide diversity within the gene coding sequence (CDS) is strongly correlated between agricultural-host and wild-host groups.

Given that generating long reads has become trivial (and cheap), I ask you to update the genome with a long-read assembly. If there are convincing reasons why you cannot generate a more contiguous assembly, please discuss this with me; you can reach me at weigel.<italic>eLife</italic>@gmail.com (note that I'm on vacation until the end of this week).</p><p>(ii) The number of isolates analyzed is relatively small, but given the striking differences you discovered between the agricultural and wild populations, this is acceptable. I would nevertheless ask you to explicitly discuss this potential weakness.</p><p>(iii) No simulations of demographic processes. Regardless of whether or not you can generate a long-read assembly, I would like you to look at recombination rates, given that you have contigs that extend over tens of kb. Hopefully, this will allow you to do the simulations the reviewers asked for. However, even if you cannot do simulations, I would like to learn whether there is any evidence for recombination rates being different between the two populations.</p><p>- Please remove Figure 3A from the main text. Sure, the difference between the two populations might be statistically significant, but given that the difference is so small and this simply reflects the large number of comparisons made, it does not really add information beyond what you show in Figure 3C.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Developing a crop- wild-reservoir pathogen system to understand pathogen emergence and evolution&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Polymorphism in Gene CDS Regions:</p><p>In the Materials and methods section, the authors mention that approximately 50% of the gene coding sequences (CDS) did not show polymorphism. While this is an intriguing observation, it seems notably high. I believe this point is relevant to the editor's earlier comments regarding recombination rates in these populations. Given the authors' findings of higher levels of diversifying selection, particularly in effectors across both crop and wild accessions, it would be valuable to provide an explanation for this lack of polymorphism in the Discussion.

Impact of Reproductive Pathway on Effector Diversity:</p><p>The manuscript currently gives limited attention to the role of Uromyces beticola's reproductive pathway in shaping effector diversity across crop and wild hosts. This aspect is critical, especially when considering how reproductive modes influence pathogen diversity and the potential implications for managing crop-wild pathogen reservoirs under climate change. Including an overview of the reproductive pathways of rust fungi in the Discussion would provide valuable context for readers and strengthen the manuscript's relevance to the broader understanding of crop disease evolution.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.91245.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>General Statements</p></disp-quote><p>We are developing systems in which to address questions around crop pathogen adaptation and introgression. Crop systems represent a unique opportunity to understand pathogen adaptation because host diversity is restricted in a way that wild host diversity is not. This is particularly true where crops share pathogens with wild crop relatives. Work in this area is important for our understanding of host pathogen co-evolution as well as having applications in crop protection, pathogen surveillance and emergence prediction.</p><p>Here, we compare population genetic diversity in a (wild and crop) beet infecting rust pathogen. We find that a wild beet pathogen population has greater diversity than the crop infecting population and that effector genes are specifically impacted by this diversity. Moreover, effectors are more differentiated than expected (based on non-effector genes) and this is consistent with predictions based on the hypothesis that effector diversity is selected for by the host. We also find evidence that the crop pathogen favours a clonal mode of reproduction.</p><p>The reviewers have, rightly, highlighted that these analyses are preliminary. To the best of our knowledge this is the first genomic / population genomic research on this rust pathogen. The 600Mb rust assembly and annotation is a first, and large rust assemblies are known for difficulties in assembly. In addition, we have re-sequenced more than 40 isolates to begin to address questions considering crop pathogen adaptation. We thank the reviewers for their time and this opportunity to publish this work as we are keen to continue to build on the exciting signals we uncover.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Description of revisions</p></disp-quote><p>For consistency we combine reviewer’s comments into sections where we feel they address related points..</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p><p>Further work required on divergence to address the observed level of gene flow between wild and crop populations and the lack of admixed/hybrid genomes.</p><p>Authors should plot Fst and Dxy along the main scaffolds. It would permit to see whether there is huge peaks of divergence and differentiation between the two populations.</p></disp-quote><p>We have measured Dxy across the genome and plotted against Fst across a number of contigs. This is part of a new supplement (8), where we emphasise how short these contigs are and that just a few genes on average are present in each one. We do see peaks and troughs in both <italic>D<sub>XY</sub></italic> and <italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic> but we don’t feel we are able to plot data over a large enough distance to draw appropriate conclusions. We do plot <italic>D<sub>XY</sub></italic> windows across effectors against non-effector genes and these confirm our previous observation based on <italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic> that divergence is greater at effector genes (see supplement 8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Virulence can be mediated at the expression level by effector silencing and the reviewer suggests looking for premature stop codons, deletion of an exons, or mutations in the promoter region.</p><p>Authors should also look for how many effector genes are non-expressed in cultivated population face to wild population.</p></disp-quote><p>SNPeff was used to identify and classify the impact of polymorphism across the genome. We queried this data in relation to effector and non-effector genes. We found that alternative splicing impacted non-effector genes to a greater degree. We also looked more generally at nonsense mutations and other High, then Medium, and Low impact variants (SNPs and indels combined). There were some instances where effectors in the wild population a greater number of these, but nothing that allowed us to draw a more general conclusion about the evolution of effectors, or evolution in reservoirs of diversity. However, this information may be useful for the community as analyses from crop pathogen reservoirs increase and are included in Supporting Information 8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Simulations would provide stronger support for conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>Absolutely. Simulations are important to validate our conclusions and improve our hypotheses as to the levels of selection, rates of gene flow and/or boom and bust. An important parameter for this model is the rate of recombination, and whether it varies between populations. In the main text of the MS we have utilised genotype (heterozygosity) based metrics and previously avoided linkage based metrics. This is because this is a repetitive, fragmented genome assembly, and in which the reference assembled contigs will represent a mosaic of two dikaryotic loci. Present analyses were designed to be informative at the population level, as the resource requirements are lower and therefore, the benefit to the community (generally lacking phased assemblies) are greater. At the request of the reviewer and editor we have added an analysis of recombination (and of selective sweeps, see below) to supplement 8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2 network suggests strong divergence between populations, and this needs further exploration because divergence and the locus level is very low.</p><p>– The reviewer requests a PCA</p><p>– (Reviewer #2 missed the Machine Learning in the supplementary which also speaks to this work).</p><p>– The Editor also suggested edits to improve clarity to figure 2</p></disp-quote><p>We have moved most Figure 2 panels to Figure 3. The suggested new PCA analysis now dominates Figure 2. The original Figure 2 (now 3) has reduced the content and includes only the map, the network, and the admixture plot. The new Figure 2 includes the expanded PCA and original DAPC analyses. By expanding PCA analyses, as suggested by reviewers, we can see in greater detail: -distinctions between isolates, -crop isolates tend to have long terminal branches for each isolate, -assignment to wild or crop population is high and not lower for the five wild harvested isolates identified within the crop infecting population.</p><p>We have also specifically mentioned in the main text the work that was done to try to partition those five individuals using machine learning methods.

As outlined above and briefly in the main text, analyses relying on linkage are caveated by the lack of phasing in this repetitive dikaryotic assembly. In the main text we outline the short length of contigs, containing in most cases less than three genes. At the genome level we observed effectors above 95% <italic>μ statistic</italic> values and the effector genes we observed were not proportionately more than expected by chance (see main text). We did however observe that the <italic>μ statistic</italic> was higher on average across regions containing effectors than non-effector genes and we now present this in Figure 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Comments</p><p>Figure 2 is somewhat hard to understand.

We have run a PCA (see also specific major comment) and plotted strains along both axes to show that the potential hybrids don’t even differentiate across the second axis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Effector candidates were not evaluated/characterized in any form.</p><p>Authors should compare pathogen features to other related species and try to contrast what stands out, especially the effectors' diversity</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer referred to a statement in which we suggest that it is difficult to functionally annotate effectors (“According to the authors, it is difficult to functionally annotate these genes in general”). Our statement in the manuscript was not intended to suggest that we did not annotate them, only that, effectors less often receive a functional annotation (in the databases used to annotate them). This is likely a consequence of their rapid evolution. To clarify, we did use effector functional annotations to refer to the presence of shared effector annotations in other rust species. For example, In the Results section we highlighted effector functional annotations and conservation among the Pucciniales (e.g. Rust Transferred Protein, Α-amylase, CSEP-06 and PriA, among others). We have clarify this below and in the main text to reflect our efforts in that area.</p><p>Details of cross species functional annotation were included in Supporting Information 01. They included annotation using AHRD, UniProt (Swss-Prot and TrEMBL) blast and InterProScan. AHRD uses a database of unbiased ground truth set of high-quality protein annotations with minimal redundancy to assign GO annotations. UniProt is the world’s leading high-quality protein sequence and functional information. It contains more than 190 million sequences with which to assign functional annotations to proteins. InterProScan was used to assign proteins into families as well as predict domains. All these methods utilise cross species information to assign gene/domain function and ontology (GO), the output from these is included for each gene, in addition to that gene’s population genetic signature (Supporting Information 09).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Where exactly the machine learning was used?</p></disp-quote><p>Machine learning was used in the supplement to try to experiment with forcing a partition between isolates. This involved first using them, and then removing them from the training set. The models were not able to partition those wild infecting isolates that were partitioned within the crop population, unless they appeared in the training set.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Comments</p><p>Lines 184 – 186: Can the lack of admixture and gene low among these wild isolates also explain this observation? what about the levels of FIS in these isolates? Clonality in these populations may have a significant impact on the genetic diversity in these populations.</p></disp-quote><p>This point appropriately tries to dig further into the relationship between the two populations, as well as that between the five isolates that fall, counterintuitively, in the crop infecting population. This point was originally in reference to the Splitstree network, and we have added significant extra information to complement this which we feel backs up our original interpretation, including:</p><p>– A new PCA analysis and an NJ tree which isolate population affiliation has not changed in neither the PCA nor NJ tree. Isolates that split from the crop population in the PC2 contain just one of the five isolates in question. This one isolate falls within a group of crop infecting isolates which can also be seen in the NJ tree and are specifically mentioned in the figure legend. The NJ tree also has a different branching pattern in the two populations, again consistent with the observations the reviewer is suggesting we address (see F<sub>IS</sub> below)</p><p>– sNMF analysis (now Figure 3) shows that the five isolates in question (asterisks) are no more partitioned (hybridised) than other crop isolates and this is now also complemented by a plot in figure 2 which looks at the probability of each individual being assigned to its population. These probabilities are all close to 1.</p><p><italic>–</italic> We plot the levels of F<sub>IS</sub> (now Figure 6) where we also highlight (with crosshairs) the five northern wild beet isolates that partition within the crop clade. These isolates are not distinct from this crop clade but the clade itself is distinct from the wild one where the signal of clonality is generally lower.</p><p>– We now highlight these five isolates with asterisks in figures, or in the text throughout so that the reader may see in each analysis that these isolates fall within the crop clade.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>lines 216-220: Is this also reflected in the excess of heterozygosity non-effectors in these crop populations? The mutations should equally accumulate in both gene categories.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, and no, we now look at this just prior to the work on nucleotide diversity that the reviewer is referring to (line ~250). We find as expected that observed heterozygosity is greater in the wild population (than agri), but within population there is no significant difference in the observed level of heterozygosity at effectors and non-effector genes. The test for excess heterozygosity did show a skew in the distribution of p values towards increased significance (for both gene types) in the crop population. However, this did not significantly impact the numbers of genes for which the test crossed the 5% threshold (28 crop genes vs 22 wild genes, out of 8950 in total). We have not included this excess heterozygosity analysis in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>lines 219-220: it is not clear which CDS are being referred to here; Are you talking about the correlation between the CDSs of wild and crops or effectors and non-effectors?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, yes, this has now moved to line 274 but we have added that this is comparison between populations</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1: I suggest separating F and G from the rest</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion.

Please explain how the windows were treated in this comparison.</p></disp-quote><p>This is now Figure 4B.

While many of our analyses are based around signals of effectors, recombination, is the main signal we want to pin down. We think its importance is overlooked in crop pathogen systems. We have run recombination analysis as suggested (LDhat) and it does find greater recombination in one population, although contrary to expectation, it is higher in the crop, not wild population. The results from genotype and linkage based methodologies contradict one another. We present both results and discuss the advantages of a more contiguous assembly. We also emphasize the importance of genotype based metrics for surveillance based methodologies. We will go on to improve this assembly (separately for wild and crop populations) and pin down recombination to develop our hypothesis using simulation, in further work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Please remove Figure 3A from the main text.

However, the current fragmented nature of the genome makes this impossible. This could be addressed using long read assemblies, funded by a new grant hopefully aided by this publication. The window-based recombination analyses we have added in response to the previous review are already reaching the limits of what can be supported (in our opinion), and we don’t think it appropriate to look for associations between diversity – effectors – recombination, at this stage. We have already highlighted in the discussion, our requirement for a longer phased reference assembly in order to begin to address the kinds of questions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.
