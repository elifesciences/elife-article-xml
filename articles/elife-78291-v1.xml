Therapeutic options to prevent sepsis-associated immunopathology remain scarce. Here, we established a mouse model of long-lasting disease tolerance during severe sepsis, manifested by diminished immunothrombosis and organ damage in spite of a high pathogen burden. We found that both neutrophils and B cells emerged as key regulators of tissue integrity. Enduring changes in the transcriptional profile of neutrophils include upregulated Cxcr4 expression in protected, tolerant hosts. Neutrophil Cxcr4 upregulation required the presence of B cells, suggesting that B cells promoted disease tolerance by improving tissue damage control via the suppression of neutrophils’ tissue-damaging properties. Finally, therapeutic administration of a Cxcr4 agonist successfully promoted tissue damage control and prevented liver damage during sepsis. Our findings highlight the importance of a critical B-cell/neutrophil interaction during sepsis and establish neutrophil Cxcr4 activation as a potential means to promote disease tolerance during sepsis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Sepsis</kwd><kwd>tissue protection</kwd><kwd>disease tolerance mouse model</kwd><kwd>B cells</kwd><kwd>neutrophils</kwd><kwd>Cxcr4</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CCHD</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gawish</surname><given-names>Riem</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 061-04</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Knapp</surname><given-names>Sylvia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>MRC-PHE Centre for Environment and Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/K0019494/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oakley</surname><given-names>Fiona</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1205FW</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gawish</surname><given-names>Riem</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>MRC program Grants</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/K0019494/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oakley</surname><given-names>Fiona</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>LPS pre-exposure is tissue protective during a subsequent lethal <italic>E. coli</italic> peritonitis by long-term modulation the bone marrow B-cell and neutrophil pool which affects neutrophil tissue damaging properties and therapeutic activation of Cxcr4 promotes tissue damage control during sepsis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sepsis is a life-threatening condition triggered by severe infections with bacteria, viruses, or fungi. In spite of the successful use of antimicrobial therapies, mortality rates remain high, with up to 50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mayr et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holzheimer et al., 1991</xref>). The main determinant of sepsis-associated mortality is rarely the pathogen, but instead the combination of dysregulated systemic inflammation, immune paralysis, and hemostatic abnormalities that together cause multiorgan failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Singer et al., 2016</xref>). Upon pathogen sensing, ensuing inflammation promotes the activation of coagulation, which in turn generates factors that further amplify inflammation, thus creating a vicious, self-amplifying cycle. These events result in systemic inflammation and the widespread formation of microvascular thrombi, that together cause vascular leak, occlusion of small vessels, and eventually multiorgan failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Semeraro et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gando et al., 2016</xref>). At the same time, sepsis goes along with a state of immune cell dysfunction characterized by immune cell exhaustion, enhanced apoptosis and impaired antigen presentation, cytokine production, and pathogen killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hotchkiss et al., 2013</xref>). Whether a patient suffering from sepsis enters this fatal circuit of immunopathology or instead is able to maintain vital organ functions and survives sepsis is not well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angus and van der Poll, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Levy et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kotas and Medzhitov, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The potent immunogen lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is an important driver of inflammation during Gram-negative sepsis, due to its ability to activate toll-like receptor (TLR)–4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beutler, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hoshino et al., 1999</xref>) and caspase-11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hagar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kayagaki et al., 2013</xref>). The state of sepsis-induced immune paralysis can be partially recapitulated in vitro by the phenomenon of LPS-tolerance, which is characterized by an unresponsive state of myeloid cells after repeated TLR stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Vos et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fan and Cook, 2004</xref>). In contrast, the concept of ‘disease tolerance’ describes a poorly studied, yet essential host defense strategy, on top of the well understood strategies of avoidance and resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Medzhitov et al., 2012</xref>). While avoidance means preventing pathogen exposure and infection, and resistance aims to more efficiently reduce the pathogen load in the course of an established infection, disease tolerance involves mechanisms, which minimize the detrimental impact of infection irrespective of the pathogen burden, thus improving host fitness despite the infection for example by improving tissue damage control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Medzhitov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Martins et al., 2019</xref>). Importantly, LPS-tolerance can impact both, pathogen resistance and/or disease tolerance. To this end, a number of mechanisms that shape the process of disease tolerance have been suggested, including alterations in cellular metabolism, DNA damage response, tissue remodeling or oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Martins et al., 2019</xref>). However, little is known about the specific contribution of immune cells to disease tolerance during severe infections, and therapeutic options to increase disease tolerance are limited due to a lack of knowledge about detailed molecular and cellular tolerance mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angus and van der Poll, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Levy et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kotas and Medzhitov, 2015</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we investigated mechanisms of disease tolerance and tissue damage control by comparing tolerant and sensitive hosts during a severe bacterial infection. While sensitive animals developed severe coagulopathy and tissue damage during sepsis, tolerant animals showed improved tissue damage control and were able to maintain tissue integrity in spite of a high bacterial load. Disease tolerance was induced by the prior exposure of animals to a single, low-dose of LPS and could be uncoupled from LPS-induced suppression of cytokine responses. We provide evidence for a deleterious and organ-damaging interaction between B cells and neutrophils during sepsis in sensitive animals, while in tolerant animals, neutrophils and B cells jointly orchestrated tissue protection during sepsis, which was associated with transcriptional reprogramming of neutrophils and B cell dependent upregulation of neutrophil Cxcr4. Our data suggest that B cells can modulate the tissue damaging properties of neutrophils by influencing neutrophil Cxcr4 signaling. Consequently, the administration of a Cxcr4 agonist prevented sepsis-associated microthrombosis and resulting tissue damage, thereby exposing a potential therapeutic strategy to foster tissue damage control in severe sepsis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>LPS pre-exposure induces long-term disease tolerance during Gram-negative sepsis</title><p>LPS pre-exposure has been shown to prevent hyperinflammation during fatal endotoxemia via the induction of LPS-tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">López-Collazo and del Fresno, 2013</xref>) and to improve the outcome of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis by promoting bacterial clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Márquez-Velasco et al., 2007</xref>). To investigate mechanisms of tissue damage control and disease tolerance during bacterial sepsis, we aimed for a setup with a stable pathogen load which would allow us to only interfere with sepsis-associated organ failure. We thus challenged mice intravenously (i.v.) with a subclinical dose of LPS 1-day, 2 weeks, 5 weeks, or 8 weeks, respectively, prior to the induction of Gram-negative sepsis by intraperitoneal injection of the virulent <italic>E. coli</italic> strain O18:K1. While LPS pretreatment 24 hr prior to infection significantly improved pathogen clearance, any longer period (i.e. 2–8 weeks) between LPS administration and infection did not affect the bacterial load when compared to control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Importantly, though all LPS pretreated groups were substantially protected from sepsis-associated tissue damage, illustrated by the absence of elevated liver transaminase (aspartate aminotransferase [ASAT] and alanine aminotransferase [ALAT]) plasma levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Thus, short-term (24 hr) LPS pre-exposure improved resistance to infection and consequently tissue integrity, while long-term (2–8 weeks) LPS pre-exposure enabled the maintenance of tissue integrity irrespective of a high bacterial load, which per definition resembles disease tolerance.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>LPS pre-exposure induces long-term disease tolerance during Gram-negative sepsis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>E. coli</italic> colony forming units (CFU) 18 hr post-infection (p.i.) in peritoneal lavage fluid (PLF) and liver of mice, which were pretreated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or saline (NaCl) at depicted time points before infection.

A major cause of organ damage during sepsis is the disseminated activation of coagulation, which is characterized by systemic deposition of micro-thrombi and substantial platelet consumption, resulting in a critical reduction in tissue perfusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Semeraro et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gando et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angus and van der Poll, 2013</xref>). While we discovered a severe decline in platelet numbers upon <italic>E. coli</italic> infection in sensitive mice, tolerant mice maintained significantly higher blood platelet counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) and, in sharp contrast to sensitive animals, showed almost no deposition of micro-thrombi in liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and I</xref>) and lung sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), indicating that tissue damage control occurred systemic and not organ specific. Considering that LPS exposure itself can impact coagulation factor levels and blood platelet numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asakura et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ohtaki et al., 2002</xref>), we importantly found similar platelet counts in sensitive and tolerant mice at the onset of <italic>E. coli</italic> infection (2 weeks post-LPS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). In addition, we did not detect any indication for an altered coagulation potential in tolerant mice before sepsis induction, as both groups showed a similar plasma thrombin generation potential prior to infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref> left panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). However, compared to sensitive animals, the thrombin generation capacity was only preserved in tolerant mice after infection (18 hr p.i.), suggesting that tolerance mechanisms prevented sepsis-associated consumption coagulopathy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref> right panel and 1 K). Taken together, low-dose LPS pretreatment prevented the formation of micro-thrombi and induced a long-lasting state of disease tolerance during subsequent sepsis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>B cells control tissue damage during sepsis independent of early inflammatory responses</title><p>Considering the long-term protective effect of LPS pre-exposure in tolerant animals, we next tested the possibility that long-lived immune cells like lymphocytes might impact tissue damage control during sepsis. Strikingly, the absence of lymphocytes, as in <italic>Rag2</italic> deficient (<italic>Rag2<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) animals, already resulted in profoundly reduced liver damage upon bacterial infection of naïve, sensitive mice and fully abrogated further LPS-induced tissue protection without affecting the bacterial load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). This indicated that lymphocytes on the one hand importantly contributed to the sensitivity of animals to sepsis-associated organ damage in naïve mice, and on the other hand were essential in mediating LPS-induced tissue protection in tolerant hosts. In support of this, adoptive transfer of splenocytes into <italic>Rag2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice re-established LPS-induced tissue damage control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Depleting CD8 or CD4 T cells, respectively, prior to LPS exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>) neither affected the difference between sensitive and tolerant animals to organ damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) nor the bacterial load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>) upon <italic>E. coli</italic> infection. In contrast, B cell deficiency (J<sub>H</sub>T mice) fully prevented the development of tissue damage during sepsis irrespective of tolerance induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and despite a high bacterial load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

These findings indicated that B cells, but not T cells, played an ambiguous role as they were involved in both, sepsis-associated organ damage and the establishment of LPS-triggered disease tolerance. We then tested if splenectomy would replicate the protective effects of full B cell deficiency during sepsis and interestingly found that splenectomy was associated with reduced liver damage in naïve, sensitive mice, which is in line with other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agarwal et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Karanfilian et al., 1983</xref>), but, in contrast to complete lymphocyte deficiency, not sufficient to abrogate LPS-induced tissue protection in tolerant animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>).

In both <italic>Rag2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and J<sub>H</sub>T mice, LPS pretreatment did not cause increased blood neutrophils nor a significant accumulation in the PLF during sepsis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H–I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G and H</xref>).

This suggested that in tolerant animals, B cells might affect systemic neutrophil trafficking and turnover after LPS-pre-exposure, whereas the suppressed neutrophil extravasation to the livers of tolerant mice occurred independent of B cells. In support of this idea, we discovered that blood neutrophils of tolerant mice expressed lower CD62L levels upon infection than those of sensitive controls, and that this phenotype required the presence of B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>). While CD62L has been studied extensively for its importance in neutrophil adhesion and rolling over the vascular endothelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ivetic, 2018</xref>), a recent study has identified decreased CD62L expression indicative of neutrophil aging, a process that is counteracted by Cxcr4 signaling, the master regulator of neutrophil trafficking between the bone marrow and the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adrover et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eash et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Martin et al., 2003</xref>).

Liver histology reflected the tissue protective effects of ATI2341 treatment, while control and ADM3100 treated mice developed profound liver necrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>).

To this end, no therapeutic option exists that can successfully prevent organ failure in septic patients. We established and investigated a model of disease tolerance during sepsis, which enabled us to reveal the importance of B cells and neutrophils in mediating tissue damage control in the context of severe infections. Building on the reported interplay between these two cell populations, our data suggest that B cells shape neutrophils’ tissue-damaging properties by modulation of neutrophil Cxcr4 signaling. Targeting Cxcr4 using a pepducin agonist protected mice from tissue damage during sepsis without affecting the bacterial load, indicating a Cxcr4-dependent disease tolerance mechanism.</p><p>Cellular depletion strategies allowed us to distinguish the contributions of selected cell types to infection-associated tissue damage in sepsis and, in parallel, to study their involvement in disease tolerance mechanisms. While we observe features of classical LPS-tolerance in our experimental setup, i.e., a reduction in early proinflammatory cytokine production, our data collectively suggest that this cannot be the sole reason for improved tissue damage control later. First, the depletion of monocytes and macrophages, which are the typical mediators of LPS-tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fan and Cook, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Divangahi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Freudenberg and Galanos, 1988</xref>), did not affect liver damage in our model and did not abrogate LPS-induced protection. Second, lymphocyte deficiency was tissue protective in naïve mice without affecting cytokine levels, thus uncoupling early inflammation from tissue damage control in our model. Interestingly, the depletion of neutrophils as well as the absence of B cells fully abrogated tissue damage during primary sepsis (i.e. without prior tolerance-induction by LPS exposure), pointing towards a common, deleterious axis of these two immune cell types. It is well established that protective neutrophil effector functions during infection can be accompanied by severe collateral damage due to their tissue damaging properties by releasing inflammatory mediators such as IL-1β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu and Sun, 2019</xref>) and reactive oxygen species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kolaczkowska and Kubes, 2013</xref>) or via tissue-factor mediated activation of coagulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Maugeri and Manfredi, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Østerud, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pawlinski and Mackman, 2010</xref>) and the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kimball et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yipp and Kubes, 2013</xref>). Our data indicate, that neutrophils are the primary effector cells that drive tissue damage, while B cells impact tissue damage by modulating neutrophil effector functions. It was demonstrated earlier that mature, splenic B2 cells promote neutrophil activation by boosting type-I interferon (IFN) dependent early inflammation, which in turn improves bacterial clearance and survival during CLP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kelly-Scumpia et al., 2011</xref>). While enhanced inflammation can mediate pathogen clearance during CLP, it at the same time contributes to tissue damage which is of particular importance in our model. In support of proinflammatory, tissue-damaging properties of mature B2 cell subsets, we found splenectomy similarly protective as B cell deficiency during primary sepsis and reconstitution of <italic>Rag2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice with B cells to increase tissue damage. Interestingly, we did not identify an important role for the proposed IFNAR-driven inflammatory function of B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kelly-Scumpia et al., 2011</xref>) in sepsis, and inflammation did not differ between wild type and lymphocyte deficient mice. However, it seemed counterintuitive at first, that the absence of neutrophils or B cells, respectively, prevented tissue damage in a primary infection, while they at the same time seemed critical for tissue protection in a model of LPS-induced tolerance. We thus hypothesized that B1 and B1-like cells, in contrast to B2 cells, reduced neutrophil’s tissue damaging effector functions. Using soluble IgM (sIgM) deficient mice (<italic>Ighm<sup>-/-</sup></italic>), enabled us to rule out a major role for IgM in tissue damage control during sepsis, even though IgM was reported to exhibit anti-thrombotic functions in cardiovascular diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Binder et al., 2016</xref>) and high plasma IgM levels positively correlate with a better outcome in human sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Krautz et al., 2018</xref>) and mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Márquez-Velasco et al., 2007</xref>). However, while sIgM deficiency did not prevent LPS-induced tolerance, naïve <italic>Ighm<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice developed less organ damage during primary sepsis as compared to control animals. As sIgM deficiency goes along with a decreased abundance of B2 and an increased abundance of B1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tsiantoulas et al., 2017</xref>) this further supported the notion of tissue damaging B2, and tissue protective B1 cells.</p><p>Since we discovered that LPS-induced protection was still observed in splenectomized animals, we considered the possibility that B cells regulate infection-induced neutrophil functionalities via effects exerted by sharing the same bone marrow niche. In fact, B cells, neutrophils and their precursors build up the majority of the constitutive CD45<sup>+</sup> bone marrow cell pool, where they mature while sharing the same niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). Due to their potential tissue damaging properties, granulopoiesis and neutrophil trafficking is tightly controlled. Under steady state conditions in mice, only 2% of mature neutrophils circulate through the body, while the majority of cells is stored in the bone marrow from where they can be quickly released upon e.g., infection, to traffic to the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Semerad et al., 2002</xref>). Accumulating evidence highlights the substantial plasticity and functional heterogeneity of neutrophils, dependent on their localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deniset et al., 2017</xref>), circadian rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adrover et al., 2019</xref>), or maturation stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Evrard et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>It has been proposed earlier that neutrophils and B cells regulate each other in a reciprocal fashion in the bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ueda et al., 2005</xref>). Based on our finding of a long-lasting transcriptional reprogramming in the neutrophil compartment and B cell dependency of tolerance-associated Cxcr4 upregulation, it is tempting to speculate that B cells act as important regulators of granulopoiesis and neutrophil trafficking at steady state and under inflammatory conditions. Cxcr4 interaction with its ligand Cxcl12 (stromal cell-derived factor 1, SDF1) has been shown to be critical for the retention of neutrophils in the bone marrow under steady state, their release to the periphery as well as their homing back to the bone marrow when they become senescent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eash et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Martin et al., 2003</xref>). Importantly, Cxcr4 signaling is essential, as <italic>Cxcr4</italic> knockout mice die perinatally due to severe developmental defects ranging from virtually absent myelopoiesis and impaired B lymphopoiesis to abnormal brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ma et al., 1998</xref>). A different sensitivity to changes in SDF1 concentrations as a potential mechanism of the reciprocal regulation of lymphopoiesis and granulopoiesis has been suggested earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ueda et al., 2005</xref>). Antagonizing SDF1/Cxcr4 signaling is approved for stem cell mobilization from the bone marrow and is under extensive research in oncology, as it is critical for tumor development, metastasis and tumor cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eckert et al., 2018</xref>). More recently, Cxcr4 signaling was described to delay neutrophil aging and to protect from vascular damage in an ischemia reperfusion model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adrover et al., 2019</xref>), supporting our data showing the tissue protective effects of upregulated Cxcr4 on neutrophils in sepsis. Given its clinical importance, Cxcr4 inhibition (using AMD3100) has been studied in different injury models, but interestingly only little is known about the therapeutic impact of Cxcr4 activation. Strikingly, activating, but not antagonizing, Cxcr4 during sepsis promoted tissue damage control in our model, which is in conflict with a study showing that Cxcr4 blockade with AMD3100 prior induction of peritonitis prevents neutrophil infiltration and tissue inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ngamsri et al., 2020</xref>). While we only see a tissue protective effect of ATI2341, but not AMD3100, we believe that this is due to differences in the timing and maybe also the route of drug administration. As we use a therapeutic approach and target Cxcr4 as late as 6 hr post <italic>E. coli</italic> injection, a time when there is already substantial neutrophilia in blood and organs, our data support an impact of Cxcr4 signaling on neutrophil tissue damaging properties and suggest that B cell driven regulation of Cxcr4 is a potential mechanism of disease tolerance and thus might be an interesting therapeutic target during severe sepsis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal studies</title><p>All experiments were performed using age-matched 8–12 week-old female mice.

Real-time PCR for mouse <italic>Cxcr4</italic> was performed with iTaq universal SYBR green supermix reagents (Applied Biosystems) on a StepOnePlus real-time PCR system (applied biosystems) using <italic>Gapdh</italic> as a housekeeper.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Histology</title><p>Liver sections (4 μm) were stained with H&amp;E and analyzed by a trained pathologist in a blinded fashion according to a scoring scheme, involving necrosis, sinusoidal-and lobular inflammation, steatosis, and endothelial inflammation (0 representing absent, 1 mild, 2 moderate, and 3 severe). The sum of all parameters indicated the total histology score. After staining for fresh fibrin (MSB stain, performed at the routine laboratory at Newcastle University), samples were scored for the presence of microthrombi by a trained pathologist in a blinded fashion. NIMPR1 immunostaining was performed on paraffin-embedded liver sections as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gieling et al., 2010</xref>). Briefly, antigen retrieval was achieved using a citrate-based buffer at pH 6.0 (Vector laboratories), followed by several blocking steps. Incubation with anti-NIMP-R14 antibody (Abcam) was performed at 4°C, over-night followed by 2 hr exposure to a biotinylated secondary goat anti-rat antibody (Serotec/Biorad). For F4/80 staining, antigen retrieval was achieved by protease type XIV (Sigma) digestion at 37°C for 20 min, followed by several washings and blocking steps. After 1 hr incubation with an anti-F4/80 antibody (Serotec), exposure to a biotinylated secondary rabbit anti-rat antibody was performed at room temperature. Finally, both stains were incubated with VECTASTAIN Elite ABC Reagent and visualized using diaminobenzidine peroxidase substrate (Vector Laboratories) followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin and embedding (Eukitt, Sigma).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical evaluation was performed using GraphPad Prism software except for statistical analysis of RNA sequencing data, which was performed using R. Data are represented as mean ± SEM and were analyzed using either Student´s t-test, comparing two groups, or one-way ANOVA analysis, followed by Tukey multiple comparison test, for more than two groups. Differences with a p-value ≤0.05 were considered significant. For DEG, genes with an FDR-adjusted p-value of &lt;0.1 were considered differentially expressed.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>is affiliated with Polypharma Biologics.

was to investigate the mechanisms of long-lasting disease tolerance to identify potential targets to prevent organ damage in sepsis. The results showed that interaction between B cells and neutrophils plays a pivotal role in preventing tissue damage and modulation, rather than upregulation of the Cxcr4 expression of neutrophils requires the presence of B cells, and this promotes disease tolerance by improving tissue damage control via the suppression of neutrophils' tissue damaging properties. Furthermore, treatment with a Cxcr4-agonist successfully replicated the tissue tolerance phenotype and prevented organ damage. These results could have important clinical and research implications by unveiling further Cxcr-dependent mechanisms and potentially can lead to the development of a novel therapeutic approach to sepsis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78291.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Molnár</surname><given-names>Zsolt</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/037b5pv06</institution-id><institution>University of Pécs, Medical School</institution></institution-wrap><country>Hungary</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.03.21.485114">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.21.485114v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

However, the correct term is LPS tolerance. They are using the traditional LPS tolerance approach which is different from sepsis tolerance. Should they need to report on sepsis tolerance, all studied mice should have been subject to moderate bacteremia or to be survivors from CLP sepsis. This needs to be acknowledged in the Discussion and amended throughout the manuscript.</p><p>– The model the authors are using is based on survival benefit 24 hours following challenge with one small amount of LPS. Why then do the authors state that they have decided to study mice primed the last two weeks with LPS?</p><p>– I suggest that in parallel to sacrifice experiments showing the laboratory read-out of deleted elements of the immune system, some survival experiments are necessary particularly with the Rag2-/- mice.</p><p>– LPS tolerance and modulation of the neutrophil phagocytosis requires decrease of the tissue bacterial load.

While this definition of LPS-tolerance is still valid in vitro, the term was subsequently used in multiple papers for all types of in vivo setups, where an initial LPS exposure protected from ANY second insult without investigating the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of protection. According to more recent literature, LPS tolerance is considered as a specific type of innate immune cell memory (Divangahi, Aaby et al., 2021) and is no longer the adequate term for many of those in vivo experimental setups, including the experimental setup we describe in our manuscript, which is why we have chosen the term “disease tolerance”.</p><p>“LPS tolerance” is today seen as a type of innate memory. It is typically mediated via monocytes and macrophages and was suggested to depend on the upregulation of negative regulators of TLR signaling, such as IRAK-M and the formation of inhibitory NFκB p50 homodimers (Fan and Cook 2004). While LPS tolerance (and other innate immune cell states like “differentiation”, “priming” or “training”, as reviewed in (Divangahi, Aaby et al., 2021)) can be nicely differentiated from each other in vitro, the clean separation of these effects in vivo is often impossible. With regards to LPS-tolerance, the in vitro phenomenon of a reduced cytokine response could be recapitulated as an outcome-driving mechanism in rather simple in vivo setups. Mice pretreated with either single or repetitive doses of LPS were protected from a final, otherwise fatal hit with LPS due to a suppressed cytokine storm (Zeisberger and Roth 1998) and protected from liver damage in a hepatic ischemia reperfusion model, again by reducing inflammatory cytokine-induced tissue injury (Sano, Izuishi et al., 2010). In line with established in vitro mechanisms, the importance of monocytes and macrophages for LPS tolerance in these in vivo setups could be elegantly shown by cell transfer experiments (Freudenberg and Galanos 1988). However, the term LPS-tolerance might not be 100% appropriate in cases where the second hit is a replicating microbiological agent. For example, repetitive oral LPS administration has been shown to protect mice in a subsequent cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) sepsis model (Marquez-Velasco, Masso et al., 2007). While the authors show that LPS-preconditioned mice exhibit lower cytokine levels in late stages of CLP, it remains unclear whether this is due to real LPS-tolerance of innate immune cells (i.e. a reduced responsiveness of cells) or whether this is the result of a reduced bacterial burden which would mean less stimulus exposure and subsequently less cytokine production. To make it even more complicated, a reduced bacterial burden could even be the consequence of a strong and powerful early cytokine response (due to innate immune training, the opposite of LPS-tolerance), which would then result in an improved bacterial clearance and better outcome upon CLP later. In line with this, we have just recently published that intranasal LPS pretreatment protects mice in a subsequent sepsis induced by S. Pneumoniae. Again, the protective mechanism was not “LPS tolerance”, but “training” which resulted in an improved clearance of bacteria (Zahalka, Starkl et al., 2022).</p><p>The term “disease tolerance”, which we used in our manuscript, was originally discovered in plant biology (Schafer 1971) and was only recently introduced to animals and human. In contrast to LPS-tolerance, “disease tolerance” goes beyond the single cell layer and was promoted a few years ago by several groups (most prominently by the groups of Ruslan Medzhitov, Miguel Soares and Janelle Ayres) as a new concept of host defense (Medzhitov, Schneider et al., 2012, McCarville and Ayres 2018, Martins, Carlos et al., 2019). The core concept of disease tolerance can probably be considered an extension of the earlier ideas of LPS tolerance and describes the phenomenon that some immune response pathways are not aimed at the elimination of microbes, but instead meant to protect the host from disease for example by maintaining tissue integrity during infection, irrespective of the pathogen burden. In other words, as explained by Janelle Ayres: “Two distinct defense strategies provide a host with survival to infectious diseases: resistance and tolerance. Resistance is dependent on the ability of the host to kill pathogens. Tolerance promotes host health while having a neutral to positive impact of pathogen fitness.” As such, two hosts with the same pathogen load can either get sick or stay relatively healthy (i.e. tolerant).</p><p>Mechanistically, tissue damage control, a terminology which we are now using in our revised manuscript instead of tissue tolerance, underlies many protective effects of disease tolerance and the underlying players that enable disease tolerance can vary widely and involve metabolic, inflammatory, innate or adaptive immunity, and even structural cells or neurons, to name a few (McCarville and Ayres 2018). In addition, any external trigger, be it microbial (e.g. LPS or others), metabolites or drugs, can potentially interfere with players of disease tolerance, thereby enabling or preventing it.</p><p>Importantly, most human and mouse studies in the field of severe infection and sepsis have focused on resistance mechanisms and antimicrobial therapies have been successfully developed to support pathogen clearance, which is why disease tolerance can be called a neglected defense strategy, as was just recently highlighted (“Immunology´s intolerance of disease tolerance” (Schneider 2021)).</p><p>Severe sepsis patients, in particular, often die due to tissue damage and subsequent organ failure in consequence of a derailed immune response to infection – despite of proper control of the pathogen load (by the use of antibiotics). It is not well understood why some patients can maintain organ integrity and survive while others slip into a fatal circle of dysregulated inflammation and coagulation, and finally die from organ failure. Importantly, the immunopathology of severe sepsis cannot be simply explained by uncontrolled cytokine responses by monocytes or macrophages but is caused by a derailed network of interacting cells. We therefore are convinced that a better understanding of cellular and molecular disease tolerance mechanisms can help to identify targets for reduced sepsis mortality. This is our motivation for the submitted work.</p><p>In this revision, we attempted to:</p><p>i) better explain the difference and overlaps of LPS-tolerance and disease tolerance in the introduction of the manuscript, and ii) provide a list of explanations and additions to support our claim of disease tolerance (and not exclusively LPS tolerance).</p><p>ii) better explanation of the differences between LPS-tolerance and disease tolerance: We are now using the established term “tissue damage control” as an underlying cause for the protective impact of “disease tolerance” and removed the term “tissue tolerance” from our manuscript and in detail discuss how LPS-tolerance is involved in our phenotype.</p><p>We have adjusted the title to avoid the term tissue tolerance:</p><p>“… B-cell axis impacts tissue damage control during sepsis via Cxcr4”. page 1, line 1</p><p>We added the following statements to abstract and introduction in hopes this will help to better understand the context of our study and the terminology we have used:</p><p>“Neutrophil Cxcr4 upregulation required the presence of B cells, suggesting that B cells promoted disease tolerance by improving tissue damage control via the suppression of neutrophils’ tissue damaging properties. Finally, therapeutic administration of a Cxcr4 agonist successfully promoted tissue damage control and prevented liver damage during sepsis…” Page 2, line 8-12</p><p>“At the same time, sepsis goes along with a state of immune cell dysfunction characterized by immune cell exhaustion, enhanced apoptosis and impaired antigen presentation, cytokine production and pathogen killing (Hotchkiss, Monneret et al., 2013).” Page 3, lines 10-12</p><p>“The potent immunogen lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is an important driver of inflammation during Gram-negative sepsis, due to its ability to activate Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 (Hoshino, Takeuchi et al., 1999, Beutler 2000) and caspase-11 (Hagar, Powell et al., 2013, Kayagaki, Wong et al., 2013). The state of sepsis-induced immune paralysis can be partially recapitulated in vitro by the phenomenon of LPS tolerance, which is characterized by an unresponsive state of myeloid cells after repeated TLR stimulation (Fan and Cook 2004, de Vos, Pater et al., 2009). In contrast, the concept of “disease tolerance” describes a poorly studied, yet essential host defense strategy, on top of the well understood strategies of avoidance and resistance (Medzhitov, Schneider et al., 2012). While avoidance means preventing pathogen exposure and infection, and resistance aims to more efficiently reduce the pathogen load in the course of an established infection, disease tolerance involves mechanisms, which minimize the detrimental impact of infection irrespective of the pathogen burden, thus improving host fitness despite the infection for example by improving tissue damage control (Medzhitov, Schneider et al. 2012, Martins, Carlos et al., 2019). Importantly, LPS-tolerance can impact both, pathogen resistance and/or disease tolerance.” Page 3, lines 15-26</p><p>“In this study, we investigated mechanisms of disease tolerance and tissue damage control, by comparing tolerant and sensitive hosts during a severe bacterial infection. While sensitive animals developed severe coagulopathy and tissue damage during sepsis, tolerant animals showed improved tissue damage control and were able to maintain tissue integrity in spite of a high bacterial load. Disease tolerance was induced by the prior exposure of animals to a single, low-dose of LPS and could be uncoupled from LPS-induced suppression of cytokine responses.” Page 3, lines 32-34, Page 4, lines 1-3</p><p>“… strategy to foster tissue damage control in severe sepsis.” Page 4, lines 11</p><p>iii) explanations and additions to support our claim of disease tolerance:</p><p>Taking past and recent literature into consideration, we argue that the herein studied tissue protection during sepsis is in fact improved tissue damage control, which is one key aspect of “disease tolerance”. In contrast, the term “LPS-tolerance” would not cover the full spectrum of effects we observe.</p><p>a) All in vivo studies about LPS-tolerance either used repetitive LPS preconditioning or a very short time window of 1-2 days between first and second hit and no studies exist, which address the long-term effects of LPS exposure on a subsequent lethal infection. Our model shows that a single subclinical LPS dose 2 days prior bacterial infection improved bacterial clearance and tissue protection (a similar setup like in other studies, which would not allow to specifically study tissue damage control mechanisms due to differences in the pathogen load) (Figure 1A and 1B). Importantly, when LPS was administered 2, 5 or 8 weeks prior bacterial infection bacterial clearance was no longer improved (Figure 1A), whereas organ-protection during sepsis was maintained (Figure 1B). This setting is defined as “disease tolerance” and was used for all follow-up experiments.</p><p>We explicitly address this in our manuscript with the following statements:</p><p>“LPS pre-exposure has been shown to prevent hyperinflammation during fatal endotoxemia via the induction of LPS-tolerance (Lopez-Collazo and del Fresno 2013) and to improve the outcome of CLP sepsis by promoting bacterial clearance (MarquezVelasco, Masso et al., 2007). To investigate mechanisms of tissue damage control and disease tolerance during bacterial sepsis we aimed for a setup with a stable pathogen load which would allow us to only interfere with sepsis-associated organ failure. We thus challenged mice intravenously (i.v.) with a subclinical dose of LPS 1 day, 2 weeks, 5 weeks or 8 weeks, respectively, prior to the induction of Gram-negative sepsis by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of the virulent <italic>E. coli</italic> strain O18:K1.” Page 5, lines 3-9</p><p>“Thus, short-term (24h) LPS pre-exposure improved resistance to infection and consequently tissue integrity, while long-term (2-8 weeks) LPS pre-exposure enabled the maintenance of tissue integrity irrespective of a high bacterial load, which per definition resembles disease tolerance. To dissect the underlying mechanism of tissue damage control in disease tolerant mice, we thus performed all subsequent experiments by treating mice with either LPS or saline two weeks prior to bacterial infection, allowing us to compare tolerant with sensitive hosts.” Page 5, lines 15-21</p><p>b) LPS-tolerance has been attributed to myeloid cells, typically monocyte and macrophage reprogramming and diminished cytokine responses (Freudenberg and Galanos 1988, Fan and Cook 2004). If LPS-tolerance was the main reason for organ protection in our model, one would assume that the absence of “tolerized” monocytes/macrophages would result in aggravated liver tissue damage. In our setup, the depletion of monocytes and macrophages did neither affect organ damage parameters in control mice (i.e. those cells do not contribute to organ damage) nor tolerant mice (i.e. those cells do not mediate tolerance) (Figure 4A). Moreover, IL-6 levels in PLF of chlodronate treated animals were substantially reduced (data not shown in manuscript), while liver IL-6 remained unaffected by MonoMac depletion, suggesting that i) LPS-tolerance in monocytes and macrophages was not driving disease tolerance in our model and ii) reduced cytokine responses were not directly coupled to organ damage.</p><p>We have adapted the following statement in the result section of our manuscript to clarify this point:</p><p>Surprisingly, monocyte and macrophage depletion neither influenced sepsis-induced tissue damage in sensitive animals nor did it impact on LPS-induced tissue damage control (Figure 4A), suggesting that classical LPS-tolerance is not the sole reason for protection. Page 8, lines 23-26</p><p>And discuss it in more detail in the discussion:</p><p>“While we observe features of classical LPS-tolerance in our experimental setup, i.e. a reduction in early proinflammatory cytokine production, our data collectively suggest that this cannot be the sole reason for improved tissue damage control later. First, the depletion of monocytes and macrophages, which are the typical mediators of LPS-tolerance (Freudenberg and Galanos 1988, Fan and Cook 2004, Divangahi, Aaby et al., 2021), did not affect liver damage in our model and did not abrogate LPS-induced protection.” Page 12, lines 14-18</p><p>c) While we observe aspects reminiscent of in vivo LPS-tolerance (i.e. reduced early (6h) cytokine response in LPS-pre-exposed animals as shown in Figure 2H and Supp. Figure 2G), our data suggest that this cannot explain improved tissue damage control later. First, cytokine levels at the time when first signs of sepsis-induced liver damage are detectable (which is only 16 – 18 h after infection), are indistinguishable between naïve and LPS pretreated mice (Figure 1F and Supp. Figure 1B-C). Second, while cytokine storm is typically considered associated with sepsis-induced organ damage, mice deficient for B- and T cells (Rag2<sup>-/-</sup> mice) are clearly less prone to liver damage (Figure 2A), but show similar levels of IL-6, CXCL1 and CCL2 (vs. wild type mice) (Figure 2H-I and Supp. Figure 2G-H). These findings uncouple inflammatory cytokine levels from organ damage in our model and suggest other mechanisms to be involved in the development of organ failure. Third, and most importantly, LPS pretreatment suppressed early inflammation in animals deficient for B and T cells (Figure 2I and Supp. Figure 2H), but did not lead to less severe liver damage during subsequent <italic>E. coli</italic> sepsis (Figure 2A), thus uncoupling early cytokine levels from organ damage in our setting.</p><p>We explain this in our Results section and have now slightly modified the text to clarify this point better:</p><p>“Six hours post <italic>E. coli</italic> infection, we found tolerant wild type mice to exhibit lower IL-6 levels in blood and liver (Figure 2H), as well as lower amounts of important regulators of peritoneal leukocyte migration (Bianconi, Sahebkar et al., 2018, Rajarathnam, Schnoor et al., 2019), like CXCL1 and CCL2 (Figure 2—figure supplement 1G) when compared to sensitive control mice, a phenotype which is reminiscent of LPS-tolerance. However, lymphocyte deficient Rag2-/- animals, in whom tissue damage control could not be improved by LPS preexposure (Figure 2A and Figure 2—figure supplement 1A), showed comparable reductions in these mediators of early inflammation in response to LPS pretreatment (Figure 2I and Figure 2—figure supplement 1H).” page 7, line 8-15</p><p>“These data suggested that in tolerant hosts, B cells contributed to tissue protection during sepsis, and that an LPS mediated modulation of early inflammation is unlikely to explain these protective effects.” page 7, line 19-21</p><p>“Second, lymphocyte deficiency was tissue protective in naïve mice without affecting cytokine levels, thus uncoupling early inflammation from tissue damage control in our model.” page 12, line 18-20</p><p>d) A key mechanism in LPS-tolerance is the upregulation of IRAK-M, which negatively regulates TLR signaling and thereby suppresses cytokine production. We have measured IRAK-M levels in livers of LPS pre-exposed mice and did not see any differences between naïve and tolerant animals (data not shown in the manuscript but can be provided upon request)</p><p>e) Another key mechanism of LPS-tolerance is the transcriptional suppression of inflammatory gene expression by the formation of NFkB p50 homodimers. We have tested mice deficient for the NFkB p50 subunit (NFkB<sup>-/-</sup> mice) in our model. As expected, they were hyperresponsive to LPS, and half of the mice died from the LPS pretreatment. However, surviving animals still exhibited improved tissue damage control as compared to naïve controls during subsequent bacterial peritonitis (Figure 2K), suggesting that LPSinduced protection was independent of NFkB p50, again excluding classical LPStolerance as a mechanism for improved tissue damage control in tolerant mice.</p><p>We already mention this fact in our manuscript:</p><p>“… tissue damage control and LPS-induced disease tolerance during sepsis was induced independent of interferon-a/b receptor (IFNAR) signaling (Figure 2J and Figure 2—figure supplement 1I) and the anti-inflammatory NF-κB subunit p50 (NF-κB1) (Figure 2K and Figure 2—figure supplement 1J), which has been shown to mediate the suppression of cytokine production during endotoxin tolerance in vitro (Ziegler-Heitbrock 2001, Fan and Cook 2004).” Page 7, line 15-19</p><p>Taken together, while we observe suppressed early cytokine production, the cardinal feature of LPS-tolerance in our model, organ damage/protection was uncoupled from cytokine levels and furthermore was independent of key cellular (monocytes and macrophages) and molecular (NFkB p50) drivers of LPS-tolerance. At the same time, tissue damage control was improved without alterations in the pathogen load, which is why “disease tolerance” is the more appropriate term.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please better explain the rationale of explanation leading from B-cell modulation to Cxcr4 and neutrophil activation</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We hypothesized a connection between B cells and neutrophils in the regulation of disease tolerance during <italic>E. coli</italic> sepsis because:</p><p>a) Deficiency of either B-cells or neutrophils abrogated sepsis-induced organ damage (Figure 2A, Figure 4A), suggesting a deleterious interaction of these two cell types in the regulation of tissue damage control.</p><p>To better explain this finding, we edited the Results section to now read:</p><p>“As the full deficiency of either B cells or neutrophils abrogated organ damage during <italic>E. coli</italic> sepsis and LPS-induced protection could be re-established by adoptive transfer of B cells into Rag2<sup>-/-</sup> mice, we hypothesized an alliance between neutrophils and B cells in tissue damage control during sepsis.“ page 9, line 1-4</p><p>b) While splenectomy reduced tissue damage in general (i.e. in naïve mice), LPS pretreatment was still beneficial for splenectomized animals, suggesting that B cells in a compartment other than the spleen, were mediating the protective effects (Figure 2G). Moreover, the bone marrow B cell compartment was strongly affected by LPS treatment (prior induction of <italic>E. coli</italic> sepsis) (Figure 3).</p><p>To explain these findings the manuscript text reads:</p><p>“We then tested if splenectomy would replicate the protective effects of full B cell deficiency during sepsis and interestingly found that splenectomy was associated with reduced liver damage in naïve, sensitive mice, which is in line with other studies (Agarwal, Parant et al., 1972) but, in contrast to complete lymphocyte deficiency, not sufficient to abrogate LPS-induced tissue protection in tolerant animals (Figure 2G and Figure 2—figure supplement 1F). This suggested that mature splenic B cells contributed to tissue damage during severe infections, while other, not spleen derived, B cell compartments were instrumental in driving disease tolerance.” page 6, line 32-34, page 7, line 1-4</p><p>“Taken together, tissue damage control was associated with long-term changes in the B cell compartments in the spleen and bone marrow…&quot; page 8, line 11-13</p><p>c) B cells and neutrophils are the most abundant cells in the murine bone marrow and are reciprocally (and functionally) regulated upon LPS challenge (Figure 4).</p><p>To address this fact, we state in the manuscript:</p><p>“In steady state, up to 70% of CD45+ bone marrow cells are composed of B cells and neutrophils, where both populations constitutively reside and mature by sharing the same niche” page 9, line 4-6</p><p>“We therefore first analyzed bone marrow B cell and neutrophil dynamics after LPS challenge, and discovered substantial stress-induced granulopoiesis, peaking around day four post LPS exposure, while B cells were regulated in a reciprocal fashion as they vanished by day four post LPS injection, to then increase and remain elevated two weeks post LPS treatment (Figure 4B and 3C) in tolerant, as compared to sensitive animals. At the same time total and relative neutrophil numbers in the bone marrow remained slightly reduced in tolerant wild type mice, but elevated in the absence of B cells (Figure 4C and Figure 4—figure supplement 1E)“ page 9, line 6-12</p><p>d) The idea that B cells and neutrophils are linked because they both utilize SDF1/Cxcr4 signaling was based on 3 key points:</p><p>– The SDF1/Cxcr4 axis is known to mediate B cell development and stem cell homeostasis as well as neutrophil retention in the bone marrow</p><p>– A study by Ueda et al., proposed competition of B lymphocytes and granulocytes for the same niche and enhanced sensitivity of B lymphocytes over neutrophils to drops in SDF1 levels (Ueda, Kondo et al., 2005). In a vaccination study, they convincingly showed that B cells and neutrophils regulate each other in a reciprocal fashion and that the decline in neutrophil numbers upon B cell expansion is directly dependent on B cells. They propose that this might be mediated via competition for SDF1.</p><p>– Our finding of elevated Cxcr4 expression in bone marrow neutrophils 2 weeks post LPS pretreatment and the absence of Cxcr4 upregulation in neutrophils of B cell deficient J<sub>H</sub>T mice, suggest an impact of B cells on neutrophil biology.</p><p>We already elaborate on these ideas extensively in our result section:</p><p>“Strikingly, bone marrow neutrophils of tolerant mice showed an enrichment of genes associated with cell migration, trafficking and chemotaxis (Figure 5C), such as genes involved in Cxcl12/Cxcr4 signaling including Cxcr4 itself (Figure 5—figure supplement 1E).</p><p>Considering the reported importance of Cxcr4 signaling in neutrophil trafficking between the bone marrow and periphery (Martin, Burdon et al., 2003, Eash, Greenbaum et al., 2010, Adrover, Del Fresno et al., 2019), we verified an upregulation of Cxcr4 on bone marrow derived neutrophils of tolerant mice compared to sensitive control mice on a transcriptional (Figure 5D) and protein level (Figure 5—figure supplement 1F). Importantly, this Cxcr4 induction depended on B cells, as Cxcr4 expression levels did not change in neutrophils isolated from LPS preexposed JHT mice (Figure 5D and Figure 5—figure supplement 1F). Based on these findings and the recent observation that Cxcr4 deficient neutrophils promote aging and neutrophilinduced vascular damage (Adrover, Del Fresno et al., 2019), we hypothesized that B cells impact the life cycle of neutrophils by influencing neutrophil Cxcr4 signaling, which in turn might promote tissue damage control during a subsequent sepsis.“ page 10, line 14-26</p><p>To further support this notion, we have now added a more detailed paragraph elaborating on this topic to our discussion:</p><p>“Cxcr4 interaction with its ligand Cxcl12 (stromal cell-derived factor 1, SDF1) has been shown to be critical for the retention of neutrophils in the bone marrow under steady state, their release to the periphery as well as their homing back to the bone marrow when they become senescent (Martin, Burdon et al., 2003, Eash, Greenbaum et al., 2010). Importantly, Cxcr4 signaling is essential, as Cxcr4 knockout mice die perinatally due to severe developmental defects ranging from virtually absent myelopoiesis and impaired B lymphopoiesis to abnormal brain development (Ma, Jones et al., 1998). A different sensitivity to changes in SDF1 concentrations as a potential mechanism of the reciprocal regulation of lymphopoiesis and granulopoiesis has been suggested earlier (Ueda, Kondo et al. 2005).“ page 13, line 33-34, page 14, line 1-7</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The novelty of the paper needs to be clarified by putting the comments of Reviewer #2 into context.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we have addressed most of Reviewer #2´s comments and stronger highlight the novelties of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– The authors discuss sepsis tolerance.
