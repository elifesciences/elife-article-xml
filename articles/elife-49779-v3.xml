are affected by eye diseases, such as retinopathies. It is therefore critical to improve imaging of eye disease mouse models. Here, we demonstrate that 1) rapid, quantitative 3D and 4D (time lapse) imaging of cellular and subcellular processes in the mouse eye is feasible, with and without tissue clearing, using light-sheet fluorescent microscopy (LSFM); 2) flat-mounting retinas for confocal microscopy significantly distorts tissue morphology, confirmed by quantitative correlative LSFM-Confocal imaging of vessels; 3) LSFM readily reveals new features of even well-studied eye disease mouse models, such as the oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) model, including a previously unappreciated ‘knotted’ morphology to pathological vascular tufts, abnormal cell motility and altered filopodia dynamics when live-imaged. We conclude that quantitative 3D/4D LSFM imaging and analysis has the potential to advance our understanding of the eye, in particular pathological, neurovascular, degenerative processes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Eye diseases affect millions of people worldwide and can have devasting effects on people’s lives. To find new treatments, scientists need to understand more about how these diseases arise and how they progress. This is challenging and progress has been held back by limitations in current techniques for looking at the eye. Currently, the most commonly used method is called confocal imaging, which is slow and distorts the tissue. Distortion happens because confocal imaging requires that thin slices of eye tissue from mice used in experiments are flattened on slides; this makes it hard to accurately visualize three-dimensional structures in the eye.</p><p>New methods are emerging that may help. One promising method is called light-sheet fluorescent microscopy (or LSFM for short). This method captures three-dimensional images of the blood vessels and cells in the eye. It is much faster than confocal imaging and allows scientists to image tissues without slicing or flattening them. This could lead to more accurate three-dimensional images of eye disease.</p><p>Now, Prahst et al. show that LSFM can quickly produce highly detailed, three-dimensional images of mouse retinas, from the smallest parts of cells to the entire eye. The technique also identified new features in a well-studied model of retina damage caused by excessive oxygen exposure in young mice. Previous studies of this model suggested the disease caused blood vessels in the eye to balloon, hinting that drugs that shrink blood vessels would help. But using LSFM, Prahst et al. revealed that these blood vessels actually take on a twisted and knotted shape. This suggests that treatments that untangle the vessels rather than shrink them are needed.</p><p>The experiments show that LSFM is a valuable tool for studying eye diseases, that may help scientists learn more about how these diseases arise and develop. These new insights may one day lead to better tests and treatments for eye diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>confocal microscopy</kwd><kwd>lightsheet

sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eye diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, cataracts, and glaucoma are becoming increasingly common with the increased age of the general population. Although advances in understanding and treating eye diseases have been made, the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved are still not fully understood. We believe that is partially due to the inadequate ability to image eye tissue in its natural, spherical state, to reveal the many distinct layers with interacting cell types oriented differentially within or between the layers. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an established medical imaging diagnostic tool that uses light to capture micrometre-resolution, three-dimensional images, non-invasively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Srinivasan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huber et al., 2009</xref>). Its main strength lies in revealing information on tissue depth preserving the eyes natural state. However, its limitation lies in not being able to provide a wide field of view, cellular or molecular information. Furthermore, being a non-fluorescent method, specific proteins cannot be labelled and tracked to investigate mechanisms. Currently, only confocal microscopy can deliver this detailed fluorescently labelled information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">del Toro et al., 2010</xref>), but the 3D nature of the tissue is likely distorted during flat-mounting and it is currently not known to what extent this might impact the obtained results. For instance, the vascular biology field is one clear example where these limitations can have a substantial impact. The mouse retina is a common model used to study vascular development and disease; confocal imaging approaches have been used to measure vessel morphology, vascular malformations, junctional organisation, and pathological tuft formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gerhardt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bentley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stahl et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, vessel diameters are now being used to predict blood flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernabeu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baeyens et al., 2016</xref>). Distortions arising from confocal flat-mounting could therefore have important ramifications for the overall conclusions of several studies.</p><p>Changes in cellular and tissue morphology are a hallmark of many eye diseases. For instance, retinopathy of prematurity and diabetic retinopathy are characterised by excessive, bulbous and leaky blood vessels that protrude out of their usual layered locations. These malformed vessels cause many problems including the generation of abnormal mechanical traction, which pulls on the different layers, eventually leading to detachment of the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nentwich and Ulbig, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hartnett, 2015</xref>). Yet, very limited information has arisen on the conformation and morphogenesis mechanisms of these vascular tuft malformations, despite a wealth of confocal studies of the related oxygen- induced retinopathy (OIR) mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Connor et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Another limitation of confocal microscopy for imaging of mouse retinal angiogenesis is the inability to perform live imaging of endothelial cell dynamics. Endothelial cells move and connect in highly dynamic, complex ways to generate the extensive vascular networks required to perfuse the retina over time (angiogenesis). Live, in vivo imaging of murine intraocular vasculature has been reported using confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ritter et al., 2005</xref>) and holds great promise for dynamic longitudinal studies of the growth/regression of large vessel such as hyaloid vessels. However, it does not as yet suit studies of smaller more dynamic cell and subcellular structures as being reliant on confocal currently limits such studies to slow frame rates (5–10 min intervals), limited z stack resolution with photobleaching issues and an apparent limited field of view. There are a small number of reports on ex vivo live-imaging of the retinal vasculature with confocal microscopy, but which clearly entails challenges as dissection of the retina for culture is time consuming, and moreover, the flatmounting is likely to disturb local tissue arrangement and mechanics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sawamiphak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rezzola et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, photobleaching, phototoxicity and long acquisition times continue to remain an issue.</p><p>A growing number of reports show that neurovascular interactions in the eye are important during development and disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akula et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Narayanan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nentwich and Ulbig, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Usui et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Verheyen et al., 2012</xref>). Neurons and vessels are however currently imaged with physical sectioning of paraffin or cryo-embedded retinas, which precludes concurrent visualisation of the vasculature, due to the orthogonal arrangement of neurons and vessels within or between retinal layers respectively. Likewise, current methods have limited potential for quantitative 3D and live imaging of fluorescently labelled neurons in neurodegenerative mouse models.</p><p>Recent advances in light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) have demonstrated its strength for allowing the rapid acquisition of optical sections through thick tissue samples such as mouse brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stelzer, 2015</xref>). Instead of illuminating or scanning the whole sample through the imaging objective, as in wide-field or confocal microscopy, the sample is illuminated from the side with a thin sheet of light. Thus, in principle LSFM would require little interference with the original spherical eye tissue structure, avoiding distortion of the tissue with flat-mounting. Moreover, LSFM is becoming a gold-standard technique to perform live-imaging in whole organs/organisms because it permits imaging of thick tissue sections without disturbing the local environment, while also reducing photobleaching and phototoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stelzer, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Reynaud et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, here we investigate the feasibility, advantages and disadvantages of LSFM for imaging the mouse eye for development or disease studies. We present an optimised LSFM protocol to rapidly image neurovascular structures, across scales from the entire eye to subcellular components in mouse retinas. We investigate the pros and cons of LSFM imaging of vessels over standard confocal imaging techniques in early mouse pup retinas. Importantly, we also demonstrate the benefits of LSFM using the OIR mouse model, where we discover previously unappreciated new spatial arrangements of endothelial cells in the onset of vascular tuft malformations due to the improved undistorted, 3D and 4D imaging capabilities of LSFM.</p><p>We conclude that LSFM quantitative 3D/4D imaging and analysis has the potential to advance our understanding of healthy and pathological processes in the eye, with a particular relevance for the vascular and neurovascular biology fields, as well as ophthalmology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>LSFM enables rapid 3D imaging of mouse eyes, and in particular retinas, in their natural state</title><p>To visualise the retinal vasculature using epifluorescence or confocal microscopes, the retina is flat-mounted by making four incisions before adding a cover slip containing mounting medium onto glass slides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, upper panel).

A network of capillaries was visible at P15, whereas the adult microvasculature consisted of radial branches of small vessels and capillaries in a relatively linear pattern. The major arterial circles (MICs) around the iris root were developed in both P15 and adult mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>).

Using LSFM, the vessels appeared straighter, and the MICs were not as close to the iris root, which could be because OCT involves live-imaging of the vasculature, without mechanically removing the sclera and cornea.</p><p>We next tested whether LSFM could resolve subcellular structures in the retinal vasculature such as the Golgi apparatus, which has recently been shown to be important for inferring cell polarity during vessel regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Franco et al., 2015</xref>). We found it feasible to stain and image the Golgi organelle (Golph4, Alexa 647) and the collagen IV-containing basement membrane around the vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c,d</xref>). Moreover, quantification of the nucleus-Golgi polarity axis was amenable when imaging the GNrep mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barbacena et al., 2019</xref>), which expresses Golgi-localised mCherry and nucleus-localised eGFP upon Cre-mediated recombination, enabling visualisation of endothelial specific nuclei and Golgi apparatus. We measured the polarity of cells in 3D by drawing lines from the centre of their nuclei to the nearest Golgi body. We observed endothelial cells collectively polarising against the flow direction along an arterial network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1e</xref>), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Franco et al., 2016</xref>).

On static images of mice expressing Lifeact-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Riedl et al., 2010</xref>) we performed deconvolution to reduce the light scattering effects and found this gave a marked improvement to the resolution of actin bundles within endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1i–l</xref>).

Thus, we next investigated whether concurrent imaging of neurons and vessels in the same sample might be achieved with the optical sectioning and rotational viewing capacity of LSFM.</p><p>We found that eye cups from P3 C57BL/6 Thy1-YFP mice, labelling retinal ganglion cells in yellow combined with IsolectinB4 labelled vasculature provided 3D high resolution images without the need for tissue clearing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c,d</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).

Since many studies use animals genetically engineered to express fluorescent markers such as Tomato or GFP, we decided not to pursue solvent-based clearing methods such as iDISCO, which do not maintain fluorescent protein emission for more than a few days after the clearing process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Renier et al., 2014</xref>). Overall, we found PACT was the most efficient and effective clearing method for retinal tissue, likely because it is relatively thin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Treweek et al., 2015</xref>).

The deep vascular plexus, visualised by IsolectinB4 staining could be seen between the ONL and INL, whereas the intermediate vascular plexus bordered the INL as expected.

In order to make direct, quantitative comparisons of the relatively small vessels in the superficial plexus, we used a correlative LSFM-confocal approach: we first imaged the retinal tissue with LSFM, which retains the natural tissue curvature, then we melted the agarose gel and flat-mounted the same retina onto a coverslip and imaged it again using confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). We first analysed the largest vessels near the optic nerve and then smaller capillaries in the sprouting vascular front from P4 WT retinas. Images obtained with our correlative LSFM-confocal approach were then brightness/contrast adjusted and cropped and surface rendered using Imaris to focus on small regions of same vessel segments in the corresponding confocal and LSFM images. Dramatically shallower side views and cross-sections of vessels were evident in the confocal images compared to LSFM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). We next quantified this shift in aspect ratio by measuring the diameter taken across the vessel in XY (hereafter ‘width’) and down through the Z-axis (hereafter ‘depth’) in the confocal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). For LSFM images, given the tissue can be at any orientation in the agarose with respect to the objective, the XYZ coordinate system of the image stack is not indicative of the equivalent width/depth measurement in confocal. Instead, the orientation of the surrounding vascular plexus at the point of the vessel segment was used as a reference surface ‘plexus plane’ to make the corresponding ‘width’ diameter measurement, as it is equivalent to the XY plane in the corresponding confocal image. Similarly, the ‘depth’ diameter in LSFM was defined as perpendicular to the plexus plane and width measurement (equivalent to the diameter through the z-stack in confocal). Vessels were significantly more elliptical (wider and shallower) under the confocal than LSFM, indicative of being compressed during flat-mounting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d,e</xref>).

The dynamics in vivo were assumed to be slower and more stable than in vitro live-imaging, however our new ex vivo observations indicate a very different set of dynamics and inter-cellular behaviors may be at work in the complex in vivo tissue. Timing is crucial, as the VEGF gradient dissipates after the retinas are dissected and submerged in agarose, at room air and the tissue is therefore no longer hypoxic. However, the directed growth of the filopodia towards the vascular front in our LSFM Videos suggests that this gradient remains intact for at least the first few hours after dissection. Further back from the sprouting front, in the vascular plexus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">Video 6</xref>), we occasionally observed the formation of connections over the course of a few hours, however, branch formation was a rare occurrence.

To this end, we used the OIR model, where mouse pups are placed in 75% oxygen from P7 to P12, and are then kept at room air from P12 to P17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Connor et al., 2009</xref>). During the hyperoxia phase, the vasculature regresses, and in the subsequent normoxia phase, new vessels grow in an abnormally enlarged and tortuous manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Connor et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, vessels also start to grow into the vitreal space forming bulbous vessels, known as ‘vascular tufts’, above the superficial vascular layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). In the past, it has been difficult to analyse and characterise the growth of these tufts because they are large formations, which appear to be distorted by the flat-mounting process. By performing IsolectinB4 and ERG immunostaining to visualise endothelial cells (ECs) and their nuclei, we obtained 3D-reconstructions of the tufts and were able to first classify them into different groups by quantifying both volume and number of nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a,b</xref>). As expected, we found that the number of nuclei increased with the size of the tuft (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.83). Interestingly, however we found many small tufts, and only very few large tufts. The smallest tuft we could identify had two nuclei parallel to each other, the cells growing straight up into the vitreous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, upper panel, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video10">Video 10</xref>). We found that most tufts have between 4 and 20 nuclei (‘Medium tufts’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, second panel row, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video11">Video 11</xref>). We also identified a few very ‘large tufts’ with over 20 nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, third panel row, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video12">Video 12</xref>). Next, we quantified the number of connections between the vasculature and the tuft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). The large tufts had a higher number of connections to the existing vasculature (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.61), Within the medium tuft class there is a linear increase of volume with nuclei number up to approximately 10 nuclei per tuft, but then the volume remained constant despite a doubling of the nuclei number to 20 at the top of this class. Within the large tuft class the volume remained unchanged despite a three-fold increase in nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Intriguingly, the number of connections to the plexus was approximately constant despite the increasing number of nuclei within these classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). However, the number of connections and tuft volume transitioned sharply, to ~2.5 fold and ~3 fold respectively, when the number of nuclei in the tuft exceeded twenty. This indicates that proliferation or an influx of cells to the tuft does not increase tuft volume, but rather, tuft volume only significantly increases when the number of connections to the plexus also increases. Based on this observation, we propose that large tufts are in fact formed by fusion of 2 or three medium tufts.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Analysis of three subclasses of OIR vascular tuft.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Representative 3D-rendered LSFM images of small (1<sup>st</sup> row), medium (2<sup>nd</sup> row), and large (3<sup>rd</sup> row) tufts showing the vasculature (IsoB4, green) and endothelial nuclei (ERG, magenta), scale bar = 10 µm.

Quantification of the number of curved nuclei/total nuclei in a tuft showed that in small and medium tufts, the number of curved nuclei correlated well with the number of total nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). In large tufts (over 20 total nuclei), the number of curved nuclei was stable suggesting actually a decline in curved nuclei as the number of cells in the tuft increased. Thus, the relative number of curved nuclei per tuft could also be used as a clear marker to distinguish medium and large tufts. As curved nuclei indicate cells are under severe mechanical strain, twisting or turning them around (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Xia et al., 2018</xref>), this suggests that larger tufts may be more stable and mature, whereas the small and medium ones are under more tension, still forming with significant forces curving and pulling the cells around in the tuft. Interestingly, highly curved nuclei have been shown to result in rupture of the nucleus and DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Xia et al., 2018</xref>), which may further exacerbate dysfunctional cell behaviour in tuft formation. It should be noted that care should be taken to rotate the image stack to confirm nuclear curvature, as two nuclei parallel to each other can look like only one nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, fourth panel row, blue arrow), emphasising the importance of 3D imaging with LSFM as rotating and viewing tufts from the side without distortion is not possible with confocal.</p><media id="video13" xlink:href="elife-49779-video13.mp4" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4"><label>Video 13.</label><caption><title>3D-rendered z-stack showed a curved nuclei in a ‘medium tuft’ from an OIR mouse retina stained for blood vessels (IsolectinB4, green), and the nuclear marker ERG (magenta).</title><p>The z-stack was rendered in Imaris.</p></caption></media><p>Finally, to quantify the level of distortion of vascular tufts incurred by flat-mounting and confocal imaging, we compared tuft depth measurements between retinas imaged with confocal and LSFM (depth defined the tuft length orientated perpendicular to plexus plane). The change in depth was particularly striking and more pronounced for larger tuft structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref> bottom panels, e).Taken together, this further confirmed that LSFM is superior to confocal to image larger structures in the eye.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>LSFM OIR Case-study: Pathological retinal neovascular tufts have a swirling/knotted morphology</title><p>In order to gain better resolution to characterise the specific morphology of the different sized tufts we performed computational image deconvolution on cropped LSFM images of vascular tufts (see Materials and methods), which helped to decrease the scattered light caused by imaging thicker tissue with the light sheet without the need to clear the tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Richardson and Lichtman, 2015</xref>). Upon deconvolution a previously unappreciated ‘knotted’ morphology of the tufts was evident across all tuft classes; often tufts had one or more holes going through (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a,b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a,b</xref> for more rotational views and original rotational <xref ref-type="video" rid="video14">Videos 14,S15</xref>). To describe these 3D tuft structures in detail, we first explored three systematic image analysis approaches: 1) by slowly shifting clipping planes through the tuft from the vitreous, facing side to the plexus-connecting side of the tuft, it was possible to better appreciate the upper and lower 3D organisation of the tuft; 2) carefully rotating and hand-drawing the tufts surface rendered structures from every angle and 3) comparing the colour-labelled positions of nuclei to indicate their depth position in the tuft. The first approach revealed that the tuft shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref> fourth panel row, had a figure of eight knot, with two clear holes through the tuft and an unexpected vessel connecting the upper vitreous surface of the tuft to the plexus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video13">Video 13</xref>). A combination of the second two approaches revealed a swirl structure to two tufts (small and medium in size), akin to a snake coiling upon itself in layers, with several highly curved nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d–i</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video16">Videos 16</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video17">17</xref>). We noted a central hole either through the entire tuft or evident in the upper vitreous facing portion, akin to a depression or invagination. A sprout-like protrusive tip with filopodia was often also evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Overall, all three, 3D rotational image processing/analysis approaches were extremely useful for better interpreting these complex 3D structures, providing a much deeper understanding of tuft morphology than would be possible using a 2D analysis of distorted tufts, viewed from above in standard flat mount confocal microscopy.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Knotted morphology of neovascular tufts revealed with LSFM.</title><p>(<bold>a,d,g</bold>) Representative 3D-rendered images (generated using IMARIS software) of large (upper panel), medium and small tufts showing the vasculature (IsoB4, green) and endothelial nuclei (ERG, red) from rotational <xref ref-type="video" rid="video14">Videos 14</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video15">15</xref> See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a</xref> for further views from different angles of the large tufts.

We therefore reproduced an OIR drug-treatment study using Everolimus, an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and compared the feasibility of quantifications (primarily quantifying 2D avascular and/or tuft area/numbers) between LSFM and confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yagasaki et al., 2014</xref>). In accordance to published data, we observed an evident increased avascular area and smaller tufts with drug treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3a</xref>). However, quantification of avascular area in LSFM was not feasible due to a lack of available computational tools to take account of the natural 3D curved retinal tissue surface, which suggests that confocal imaging is a more suitable imaging modality to quantify this 2D parameter. Yet, we found that LSFM was very practical to measure tuft volume and found that tufts in drug-treated retinas were markedly smaller than in untreated retinas, despite having comparable nuclear counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3b,c</xref>). Furthermore, drug-treated retinal tufts showed a particular small swirl/ordered two-layer cup morphologies with distinctive wide-reading filopodia all around the tuft, suggesting they are highly active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3d–j</xref>), similar to our previous observations in OIR untreated retinas (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). Thus, we concluded that LSFM is more suitable for 3D volume and tuft morphology characterisation to understand the mechanism of action of OIR drug treatments than confocal microscopy.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>4D LSFM live-imaging of the OIR mouse model reveals altered cell dynamics</title><p>To gain insights into endothelial cell behaviour in vascular tufts, we next imaged the OIR-induced tufts dynamically with LSFM. Thereby, we observed that filopodia extended/retracted from abnormal vascular tufts, similar to what is seen in the extending vascular front during development of the retina vasculature. However, filopodia formed from vascular tufts remained very short (mean 4.3 µm) as compared to normoxia (mean 14.84 µm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a,b</xref>). In OIR, filopodia more rapidly extended and retracted, without making connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a,c,d</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video18">Video 18</xref>). As the VEGF gradient is expected to be disrupted in the OIR model, timing from dissection to imaging is not as crucial. However, most filopodia movements occurred in the first few hours under this pathological condition. When imaging other parts of the OIR retinas to the tufts, we observed intriguing, abnormal EC behaviour. Their movements were undirected and appeared to involve blebbing-based motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e,f</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video19">Video 19</xref>). We observed both cells that were dividing, and undergoing apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video20">Video 20</xref>), which was not observed during normal conditions.

We have therefore established the first protocols to image and clear mouse eye tissue using LSFM. Because this protocol utilises optical sectioning of whole mount tissue, we found that LSFM is a very useful tool to rapidly image and reveal eye tissue at cellular and subcellular resolution without distortion of the sample due to flat-mounting, with the benefit to view, rotate and quantify structures in full 3D. As such, the present study provides a highly relevant and improved approach to examine the inter-relationships of normal neurovascular structures and the complex morphology of aberrant vascular structures in disease models, revealing for the first time an apparent knotted morphology to the vascular tufts in OIR. We have furthermore established an ex vivo 4D live-imaging method to follow angiogenic growth in the mouse retina in real-time, both during development and under pathological conditions, and feasibly quantified that these dynamics appear significantly altered in pathological conditions. The acquisition of 3D images of vascular structures at high spatial and temporal resolution within intact ocular tissue is both novel and significant. Overall, we strongly suggest the use of LSFM for 1) the study of larger or more complex 3D tissue structures reaching across the typical retinal layers, which are liable to distortion with standard approaches and 2) dynamic cell and subcellular processes in the mouse eye. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Singh et al. (2017)</xref> established LSFM imaging of rat retinas while this manuscript was in preparation, they focussed on static 3D imaging and analysis of vessels. Taken together with our results here in mice demonstrating LSFM for static 3D, live imaging and neuronal retinal studies in health and disease, this strongly indicates LSFM can bring improved 3D insights across rodent species for ocular development and disease studies. We see far-reaching potential of the approach for deeper insights into eye disease mouse models in particular. For example, it would now be feasible to skeletonise larger portions of the vascular network (ultimately, the entire retina vasculature), with accurate vessel morphometrics in order to perform flow simulations and understand how the biomechanical feedback of flow impacts vessel growth in healthy and diseased eyes.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>LSFM vs confocal: A balanced discussion</title><sec id="s3-1-1"><title>Benefits of LSFM:</title><p><italic><underline>Speed -</underline></italic> in general image acquisition with LSFM is widely known to be far faster than confocal due to the illumination of the entire optical plane at once combined with the use of a camera instead of detectors, and an extensive stack of the entire mouse retina can be acquired very quickly using LSFM (~60 s).​ <italic>Cost –</italic> the instruments cost approximately the same, but as imaging is approximately ~10 x faster, the LSFM can be considered cheaper overall. <italic><underline>Depth -</underline> </italic>LSFM is better for imaging thicker or very large tissues (such as the eye cup, which is thin, but topologically spherical), due to the fast acquisition rates and the large, rotatable sample holder, removing the limited single view point from above with upright microscopes and slide mounting. <italic><underline>Phototoxicity</underline></italic> - the illuminated plane generates less photobleaching and faster time frame rates for high temporal resolution live imaging of 3D/very thick tissues. We find LSFM imaging of the retina to be particularly informative over standard confocal microscopy when studying the following specific complex 3D and/or dynamic structures in the eye: 1<underline>) the adult retina in full</underline> - it is possible to visualise all three vascular layers in the LSFM, including direct cross-sectional viewing of the diving vessels oriented between layers by rotating the sample relative to the objective, which is not possible with confocal. Similarly, the iris and optic nerve can be observed in full, from any angle, undistorted with LSFM. 2) <underline>abnormally enlarged vessels/tufts</underline> - a new knotted morphological structure of tufts was apparent, and feasible to begin characterising due to the improved 3D imaging and rotational views possible with LSFM. With confocal imaging the tuft shape can only be inferred from above and we found the depths were significantly distorted and compressed, which is likely why knots have not been previously described. Interestingly, the VE-cadherin staining of endothelial junctions of several OIR tufts shown in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bentley et al. (2014)</xref> indicated there were ‘holes’ through tufts, as no junctional stains were found in clear pillars through them. However, the holes were not easy to confirm by isolectinB4 staining in those samples, likely due to spreading of the vascular structure when it was distorted during flat-mounting. We can confirm here with LSFM and microCT that holes and invaginations through tufts are evident and that tufts appear to consist of one or more long vessel structures intertwined, swirled and potentially looped upon themselves. 3) <underline>Neurovascular interactions in one sample</underline>, as neurons and vessels are oriented perpendicular to each other through the retina, they are normally imaged with separate physical sectioning or flattening techniques in either direction, prohibiting their concurrent observation. Optical sectioning of thick tissue and then rotating the undistorted image stacks allows both to be imaged together. Indeed, obtaining such images from one sample with LSFM will permit the quantification of vessels protruding through the neuronal layers, which is now only possible by performing time-consuming serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Denk and Horstmann, 2004</xref>). 4<underline>) Subcellular level resolution in undistorted 3D retinal structures.</underline> We have shown that even in WT retinas, 3D analysis of subcellular structures such as the Golgi-nucleus polarity axis can be revealing, showing cells hidden beneath those that would be assumed as one using current 2D methods. However, we see the greatest potential for subcellular analysis in future studies analysing disruptions in cell polarity, or other processes at the subcellular level such as actin localisation in large pathological vessels or other retinal structures. <underline>5) Live-imaging of developing mouse retinas</underline> – this has proven very difficult with in vitro methods providing more reliable assays, for example embryoid bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kearney and Bautch, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jakobsson et al., 2010</xref>). Although embryoid bodies do form vessel-like structures, they are not perfused and do not fully reflect the complex and tissue specific in vivo retinal environment. Moreover, the embryoid bodies are treated with VEGF supplied to the culture medium, while in vivo, endothelial cells are exposed to a VEGF gradient from the astrocyte network below. Our images suggest that the VEGF gradient remains intact in the retina samples for several hours in LSFM imaging. Furthermore, our protocol enables us to follow and quantify filopodia movements from minute to minute, revealing movements never seen before. Thus, we observed astonishing abnormal cellular and subcellular level dynamics under pathological OIR conditions by 4D live LSFM imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s3-1-2"><title>Benefits of confocal over LSFM</title><p>Confocal microscopy has a fundamentally higher spatial resolution with less light scatter than LSFM; clearer, more precise images of smaller structures can be obtained, such as endothelial junctions and tip cell filopodia morphology, provided the tissue sample is amenable to flat mounting without distortion or loss of information – i.e. it is naturally thin cross-sectionally and structures of interest have their main features in the XY plane, not in Z, XZ or YZ. Thus, confocal static imaging of normal developing vessels in a single layer of the retina will still yield better resolution images than LSFM and is very reliable for XY based quantifications such as branch point analysis and 2D vascular area measurements in disease models/drug studies. However, we find it is not reliable for acquiring accurate quantifications involving depth through Z such as vessel diameters or the morphology of cells that span between the layers (e.g. in the XZ or YZ planes). Thus, overall LSFM is not suggested to replace confocal for static developmental angiogenesis studies or 2D analysis metrics on retinas. However, to study and measure precise morphological attributes or dynamics of vessels with inherently 3D nature such as vessel radii, enlargements, malformations, diving vessels, iris, optic nerve or the deeper layers we find strong evidence to favor LSFM over confocal imaging.</p><p>In general, the quantification time was comparable between LSFM and confocal images but there is potential for image analysis to require more effort for LSFM as files can become quickly large due to the rapid imaging (~200 GB for static imaging and up to 4TB for live multichannel imaging). If an older eye is being imaged the three vascular layers will be somewhat visually overlapping (e.g. in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>), which could be hard to manually untangle due to the curvature, and as such represents a limitation. The preservation of the tissue depth information in the large Z-stack however, means by computationally fitting to the local curvature of the eye tissue one could computationally color code and subtract the retinal layers out for independent viewing and analysis, but this requires more investment than depth color coding of flat-mounted confocal images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Milde et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Vascular tuft formation</title><p>The OIR model is a commonly used to study retinopathies. The three-dimensional nature of vascular tufts makes them ideal for LFSM and though this is a widely studied mouse model, the improved three-dimensional imaging allowed us to identify several new features of the important pathological vessels it generates. Our observations of small, medium and large tuft classes with distinct properties and the observation of more complex knotted, swirling and looping morphologies than previously reported, suggest a new mechanistic explanation is required to understand how and why vessels twist and turn on themselves and why it appears that medium tufts reach a critical size then stop twisting and instead coalesce into larger more stable structures, akin to the development of blood islands in retinal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goldie et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Nuclei with unusual shapes have previously been identified in abnormally growing tissues, such as cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hida et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kondoh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Versaevel et al., 2012</xref>), and to reflect mitotic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gisselsson et al., 2001</xref>). It is remarkable that we observed the dramatically curved shape of EC nuclei in tufts. Although it remains unclear whether their unusual shape has consequences for EC function in the tuft, it is tempting to speculate that it would have some bearing on, or is at least be an indicator of abnormal cell behavior. Overall, the ability to rotate the tufts in 3D and view from the side, not just the top, gave a much clearer view of their structure potentiating a detailed analysis of their complex knotted structure in the future. It was particularly interesting that tufts in the Everolimus-treated OIR retinas appeared to conform to a specific swirl structure with many filopodia, suggesting that LSFM imaging could help reveal much greater information of the mechanism of action of many drugs targeting these or other complex 3D structures in the eye. LSFM therefore could greatly improve our understanding of these abnormal vascular formations, already opening up avenues for future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Reproducible live-imaging of angiogenesis in ex vivo retinas</title><p>Current retinal studies must infer dynamics from static images by hypothesising what might have happened in real-time to generate the retina’s phenotype. For example, CollagenIV-positive and IsolectinB4-negative vessels are considered to be empty membrane sleeves where the vasculature has regressed. It is therefore important to establish reproducible live-imaging methods. It will be interesting to investigate in future live-imaging studies how pervasive the kiss and run behaviors are across the plexus and under different conditions, in order to fully elucidate their functional role. We furthermore demonstrated the potential to quantify diverse subcellular level movements in the cells and altered cell movements in the OIR disease model as proof of concept. Previously undirected vascular movements have been indicated as due to the loss of the underlying astrocyte template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dorrell et al., 2010</xref>), LSFM now permits mechanisms involving multiple cell types to be investigated and confirmed live with fluorescent co-labelling studies of neurons/glial cells with vessels in the same retina. The LSFM live imaging protocol is sturdy as indicated from the testing in three different laboratories in three different countries (US, Sweden and Portugal) with different scientists performing the dissections and imaging, on different instruments. As such we can confirm that though challenging, the live imaging protocol has been optimised and is reproducible in different hands.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"

A 20 × 1.0 NA objective (RI = 1.56 corrected) was used for detection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Live-imaging</title><p>For live-imaging, mice were imaged at P4 or P5. The sample chamber was filled with DMEM without phenol red containing 50% FBS and P/S and heated to 37 °C. Retinas were quickly dissected in prewarmed HBSS containing penicillin and streptomycin. After dissection, retinas were rapidly cut into quarters (mainly to minimise the datafile size created, the curved form was preserved) and immediately mounted in 1% low melting agarose in DMEM without phenol red containing 50% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and 1x penicillin and streptomycin (P/S). To minimise curling of the retina, as with static imaging, apply 1–2 drops of low melting agarose on retina and start uncurling the retina before the gel is solidified. It can then be transferred to the cylinder for imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>MicroCT</title><p>Eyes were dissected and fixed for one hour in 4% PFA in 0.1 M PB pH 7.4. The retinas were isolated, and post-fixed overnight in 4% PFA plus 2.5% GA in 0.1 M PB pH 7.4 prior to storage in 1% PFA in 0.1 M PB. After washing in 0.1 M PB to remove fixative residues, secondary fixation was performed in 2% reduced osmium tetroxide (aqueous), followed by washes in H2O and storage at 4°C. For hydrated microCT imaging, individual retinas were mounted in CyGEL (Biostatus, Shepshed UK), and scanned using an Xradia 510 Versa (Zeiss). Scans were performed at 40 kV/3 W using an exposure of 10 or 20 s and 3001 projections (OIR overviews, 1.89 µm voxels,~3 mm field of view; WT overviews 3.78 µm voxels,~3 mm field of view). The data was reconstructed into 16-bit TIFF image sequences using Scout-and-Scan Control System Reconstructor software (Zeiss). For visualisation of retina overviews, the OIR datasets were binned in XYZ to reach a voxel resolution of 3.78 µm, thereby matching the WT datasets, and rendered in three dimensions using Drishti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Limaye, 2012</xref>). To visualise individual epiretinal tufts, the full resolution OIR datasets were cropped to smaller regions of interest, and rendered in three dimensions using the volume viewer plugin in Fiji, and Imaris.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Everolimus drug-treatment</title><p>Pups (P7) were put into the OIR chamber with the dam and exposed to 75% of O2 during 5 days (P11). At P11 animals were passed to normoxia conditions and injected with Everolimus (P11-P12-P13-P14) during four consecutive days. Sacrificed at P15 and retinas collected. Eyes were fixed with 2% of PFA for 5 hr. Everolimus (Selleckchem) treatment administered with subcutaneous injections of 5 ug/g of Everolimus and the Vehicle (DMSO + 30% PEG300).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>LSFM equipment</title><p>All LSFM images were acquired with a Zeiss Z.1 light sheet microscope except for those detailed below. The Zeiss objectives used for uncleared tissue and live imaging were Zeiss, RI = 1.33, 5x/0.16, and 20x/1.0. For PACT cleared tissue, RI = 1.45, 20x/1.0 (5.5mm working distance) was used. The Luxendo-Bruker MuVi-SPIM was used for specialised subcellular imaging of Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1e–h</xref>) and tuft morphology in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3d–j</xref>. The Miltenyi-LaVision BioTec Ultramicroscope II light sheet microscopes is particularly good for larger samples and used for the overview images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3a</xref>. The Luxendo objectives used were Olympus, RI = 1.33, 20x/1.0 in combination with a 1.5x magnification changer. The LaVision objective used was a Olympus MV PLAPO 2XC/0.5 in combination with a 2x zoom.All raw data were handled on a high-end DELL workstation (Dual 8-core Xeon Processors, 196 GB RAM, NVIDIA Titan Black GPU, Windows 7 64 bit) running ZEISS ZEN (Light sheet edition) or equivalent. Confocal images were taken with the LSM 880 Confocal Microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Image analysis</title><sec id="s4-10-1"><title>Visualisation of images in 3d</title><p>3D reconstructions of images up to 4 GB were obtained using Imaris software. Fiji was used for reconstruction of images larger than 4 GB. To quantify tuft volumes, Arivis Vision4D software was used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-2"><title>Visualisation of live-imaging</title><p>To visualise live-images, the maximum intensity projection of each timepoint was made in ZEN (Zeiss). The Videos were corrected for drift correction in Fiji using the StackReg plugin and the background subtracted in Fiji using rolling ball background subtraction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-3"><title>Deconvolution</title><p>In LSFM, when using a high NA (&gt;~0.6) objective, the optical section is determined by the depth of field of the objective and not the light sheet. However, in our system the light sheet is thicker than the objective’s depth of field and substantial out-of-focus light is captured relative to confocal. Additionally, thick tissue samples have an intrinsic milky appearance. This lack of clarity undermines sharp images and becomes progressively more of an impediment the deeper one tries to look into a tissue volume. This translucency is caused by heterogeneous light scattering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Richardson and Lichtman, 2015</xref>). As the tissue used for imaging in LSFM is thick, fluorescent light originating from deep within the tissue is scattered during its travel through the tissue volume, back to the objective. This results in both in- and out-of-focus light arriving at an incorrect position on the camera causing objects to blur.</p><p>To deconvolve and reduce this light scatter computationally images were split into channels with their respective emission wavelength. Microscopic parameters (including pixel size, objective and excitation wavelength) were inserted into the settings of Huygens software for each channel followed by choosing the signal to noise ratio (SNR) for each image and run the deconvolution with the same settings. The resulted deconvolved images were inserted into Imaris for further analysis in 3D if needed. Huygens software was used for deconvolving all images.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Actin-rich bundles and filopodia tracking</title><p>Tracking was performed manually using ImageJ/Fiji. For filopodia tracking, each filopodia was tracked between each frame of imaging and different analysis was performed. For tracking the actin-rich bundles, the Manual Tracking plugin in Fiji was used to manually select the ROI (=region of interest) and follow the pathway of each trajectory. The trajectories and the pathway were overlaid. Each trajectory could be visualised using Montage function.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Neuronal degeneration rho KO mouse retinal analysis</title><p>Nuclei Density Method: Using freehand selection in FIJI to define the ONL area in a given image slice, we performed a particle analysis after thresholding to obtain an estimate of nuclei density (n = 1 retina per condition). This was performed at multiple points (n = approx. eight areas per condition) in the retina by incrementing the Z-dimension 50 slices and retaking the measurements, before averaging across the densities across slices. ONL Thickness Method: To measure average ONL thickness (n = 1 retina per condition), we used straight line selection in FIJI at three points along the ONL in a given slice and averaged the lengths. This was performed at multiple points (n = approx. eight slices per condition) in the retina by incrementing the Z-dimension 50 slices, before retaking the measurements and averaging across slices to obtain an estimate for the overall ONL thickness.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Sven Terclavers (HCBI) for the excellent technical support; Alessandro Ciccarelli (The Francis Crick Institute, CALM STP) for LSFM imaging using the Luxendo and LaVision LSFM microscopes; Christopher Peddie and Lucy Collinson at The Francis Crick Institute (EM STP) for establishing and performing retinal microCT imaging; thanks also to Joe Brock and the Illustration team at The Francis Crick Institute for aiding with 3D drawing of tuft knots.

tissue morphology of mouse retinas during development and disease. The improvements described for ex vivo live imaging, as well as co-staining and analysis of neuronal and vascular systems together are particularly impressive and represent an important methodological advance in the field.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;3D/4D characterization of cell behavior in the mouse retina in health and disease&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Luisa Iruela-Arispe (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Although the reviewers found aspects of your study, particularly the methodology, to be of high quality the overall assessment was that the study was not sufficiently well developed for eventual publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In their manuscript &quot;3D/4D characterization of cellular behavior in the mouse retina in health and disease&quot; Prahst and colleagues demonstrate the potential of Light Sheet Fluorescence Microscopy (LSFM) in imaging complex tissues such as the mouse retina in 3D and 4D.</p><p>In the first part the authors describe the establishment of this imaging technique, which they then directly and quantitatively compare to images obtained by standard confocal microscopy on fixed material. They further show that LSFM is a powerful technique to investigate retinopathies such as in the OIR model. Importantly, LSFM can applied to live imaging of retinas in ex-vivo preparations.</p><p>Overall, this work is of high quality and demonstrates that the application of LSFM microscopy will be a useful technique to study angiogenesis especially when improved 3D resolution is warranted. The potential for LSFM in live imaging appears to be limited in spatial resolution and time.</p><p>At this point I have three concerns.</p><p>1) In Figure 3 the authors perform comparative analyses of a sample image acquired by LSFM and confocal microscopy. The confocal image (Figure 3A) appears to be saturated, which makes quantitative analysis difficult. In general, the authors should provide histograms to ensure that comparable images are being analyzed. Also, the pixel depth of images should be specified. Generally, most of the data presented are rendered images. A better representation of less processed images would be helpful.</p><p>2) When considering alternatives to confocal imaging, e.g. live imaging. The authors should also discuss optical coherence tomography (OCT), which has also been successfully applied for in vivo imaging of the mouse retina.</p><p>3) To assess the spatial resolution of LSFM compared to other imaging techniques it would be helpful to examine finer morphological structures – for example cell junction, Golgi or mitochondria.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The present manuscript communicates technology that enables visualization of the vasculature of the retina in the context of its 3D structure using light sheet microscopy. The authors argue that this technology is superior than observing the retina as a flatmounted structure. Basically, this is a methodological paper that provides a new approach on how to visualize angiogenesis, vascular dynamics and vascular pathological processes in a manner that respects the geometry of the eye.</p><p>Technical advancements go hand-and-hand with scientific progress, one pushing the other, thus I am happy to see that <italic>eLife</italic> submits to review cutting-edge methodologies that could significantly impact specific fields. A critical aspect of this manuscript is the value-added of this new technology. As an outside evaluator, I see both positives and negatives of this technology and it would be critical for the authors to provide a more balanced view of these. Or perhaps, if I am missing something, explain to the review team what is the misinterpretation on the aspects of the study indicated below.</p><p>1) A detailed evaluation of the images provided reveals the lack of a clear hierarchy when retinas are evaluated by LSFM versus confocal flat-mounted images. For example, Figure 1F shows the vasculature of a P10. At this time, the vessels should clearly depict hierarchic branching patterns with alternating arteries and veins. Instead, the image shows a mesh or vessels that lack hierarchical organization and absence of alternating arterial-vein vessels. Is this outcome due to the fact that three vascular layers are juxtaposed, providing excessive noise to the inner layer (the hierarchical layer)? If this is the case, there are several negatives associated with this approach, although again, there are several positives (important to bring balance to the manuscript).</p><p>2) For the visualization shown in Figure 3: Was this done using a flat mounted image? Or Having the eyeball as a curved structure? I believe it might be the former, and in this case, it is difficult to understand why there are differences in the evaluation. The authors offer that assessment of the vasculature using lighsheet shows wider vessels than confocal, but the problem with the out-of-focus light discussed by the authors brings a confounding factor on the metrics. Can the authors discuss this at greater length? Also how do these metrics compared to a perfusion-fixed transversal section of specific vessels?</p><p>3) It is hard to interpret Figure 4 without a full legend (missing in the manuscript) but the comparison between confocal and LSFM clearly shows the advantage of LSFM, as the tufts are not squeezed through mounting. However, I am having a hard time in really understanding what is a &quot;mature&quot; versus a &quot;knotting&quot; tuft. If a nomenclature is to be introduced, then a more detailed description, assessment of multiple retinas, etc should be provided.</p><p>4) Clearly a big advantage of LSFM is the live imaging shown in Figure 5. Because there are multiple image modalities, it will be important to clearly state how is the ex-vivo preparation (flat? Curved? With media? Without? Heat? Oxygen?).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Prahst and co-authors report the advantages of using light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) to image the mouse retina in its natural spherical conformation. The mouse eye is of particular interest to ophthalmology, neurosciences and vascular biology. Thus, methods improving the capacity to characterize the biological and cellular principles governing the development and function of the mouse eye will have a broad-spectrum impact.</p><p>Authors start by claiming that visualizing blood vessels in the retina's natural spherical conformation will be important for our understanding of vascular biology. Thus, a central point is to compare this new method with already existing methods, such as confocal microscopy. The only comparison done between both is related to vessel diameter, and no changes were found. Other quantitative information used in vascular biology includes: vascular density; number of branching points; number of endothelial tip cells; number of filopodia per tip cell; number of regressing branches; etc. Does LSFM improve the analysis of those parameters? It is likely not the case. Moreover, description of the deconvolution and segmentation parameters in Materials and methods is very vague and relies heavily on &quot;experts&quot; (subsections “Manual cropping of well-segmented regions” and “Isosurface extraction”).</p><p>Another advantage of LSFM could be that the new method is faster when coming to perform the same task (extract quantitative information of fluorescence images). However, authors did not discuss this aspect. It would be important therefore to include the amount of time needed to image and quantify these parameters per retina and compared it to confocal microscopy.</p><p>Authors also showed the capacity to perform live imaging of endothelial cells in the mouse retina. Despite being technically possible, the reviewer is sceptical on the value of the information that can be obtained in this way. Given the tremendous change in the environment, including oxygen concentrations, loss of vitreous humor, lack of blood flow, loss of intraocular pressure, which are known to affect endothelial cell biology, it is debatable how reliable can be any information acquired with this protocol. As a matter of fact, Sawamiphak et al., 2010 reported a similar protocol, but the impact in the field so far is very minor. Moreover, no quantification of cell migration or filopodia dynamics was attempted in order to illustrate the potential value of the method. The same holds true in regard to the pathological OIR model.</p><p>A potential interest of the report comes from the analysis of vascular malformations, so-called vascular tufts, in the OIR model. Authors describe in high detail different vascular structures including tufts of different sizes, ranging from 2 to &gt;20 endothelial nuclei, including the presence of some curved nuclei. Despite the novelty aspect of the observations, the reviewer is not convinced that the same structures could not be observed in confocal microscopy following careful analysis. Within the same context, authors claimed &quot;abnormal cell dynamics&quot; in the context of pathological angiogenesis. However, the manuscript includes very limited data (one video on filopodia, and 2 videos on undefined vessels) and no quantitative information to back up authors' claims. They suggest that those observations confirm previous hypotheses (Bentley et al., 2014 and Ubezio et al., 2016) concerning the oscillatory behavior of endothelial cells in vascular tufts, however the amount of data provided are less than enough to make such associations.</p><p>Finally, the analysis of the neuronal compartment of the mouse retina is very limited, although it would be very beneficial for the impact of the report. Another application would be to skeletonizes larger portions of the vascular network (ultimately, the entire retina vasculature) in order to perform flow simulations. It would be interesting to understand the value of LSFM for those larger scale segmentations and the benefits for flow modelling.</p><p>Overall, this report shows that LSFM is an additional way to image the mouse retina. Nonetheless, authors failed to show that LSFM will bring strong benefits to our understanding of vascular biology when compared to existing methodologies. Thus, the impact and applicability of LSFM in this field is dubious.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Mouse retinal cell behaviour in space and time using light sheet fluorescence microscopy&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has now been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Michael Dorrell (Reviewer #1); Kathryn Pepple (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In their article, Bentley and co-authors describe a novel use of LSFM for imaging and analyzing cellular and tissue morphology of mouse retinas during development and disease. As these models are frequently used to study retinal development and disease, as well as broader vascular disease, any model that improves upon current methodology will be highly beneficial. The improvements described for ex vivo live imaging, as well as co-staining and analysis of neuronal and vascular systems together are particularly impressive. The associated videos of endothelial dynamics were striking and of high quality. Adapting and expanding this technique to the visualization of additional intraretinal processes in ex-vivo samples holds exciting promise for the field of retinal biology and pathology. It is clear that the authors have made substantial improvements since the first version.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The shape of the 3D tufts is interesting, but the major use of the OIR model is to quantify changes in neovascularization, usually in response to gene alterations, protein agonists or antagonists, or various drugs. Certainly, differences in tuft size are observed by traditional confocal analysis and quantifiable changes have been made for decades with several novel adaptations over the years. The authors should compare the two methods in a study testing a drug or transgenic mouse known to affect tuft formation to see if there is indeed a dramatic improvement in quantification analysis in order to compare the two methodologies for this model system. While the structural analysis of the tufts (spirals, tuft fusion, etc.) are a very interesting finding, in terms of a broad improvement to the model, the benefits towards the OIR model's major purpose are less clear. If the authors choose not to perform the comparisons, the claims of their method being &quot;better&quot; would need to be appropriately tempered throughout the article.</p><p>2) The PACT analysis and description is good, along with the rational for choosing PACT. However, it is unclear if the authors ever tested that technique on transgenic mice where the fluorescence is innate to the tissue (not stained). Was the PACT procedure used for the live retinal vasculature studies in Figure 4? As one of the key parameters for choosing PACT, it seems that the maintenance of fluorescent protein emission should be tested and demonstrated using this procedure. Also, are clearing methods required for the vascular studies, or just for the neuronal studies and assessing retinal layers?</p><p>3) While the authors do a good job of demonstrating observations of subcellular structures like Golgi and actin dynamics, the authors should better discuss what might be learned from this level of resolution. For example, the authors mention using Golgi localization to study EC polarity in migration and regression, but the images shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1A make it seem like any such interpretation would be difficult. Similarly, it is unclear what is shown with regards to the actin dynamics in Figure 4 and corresponding videos or the practical utility of such studies.</p><p>4) The data in Figures 5 and 6 are difficult to interpret in isolation and the 3D rotational videos only provided limited assistance. Ideally to support the morphologies proposed in the schematics in Figure 6C, F, and I, additional stains or some other form of validation of the author's interpretations could be provided (histology, perfusion/fixation?). Particularly if the &quot;previously unappreciated knotted morphology of the tuft was evident across all tuft classes&quot; is a truly significant and novel advance to the field. If no new data are added, it would be good to tone down the writing.</p><p>5) Current key limitations of flat mounting and confocal imaging are live imaging capabilities and quantifying neuronal cells like photoreceptors in models of degeneration (including the OIR model). The authors show great improvements in live imaging and 3D neuronal staining in the spherical eye cups. If the authors can show quantification of photoreceptors (or other neurons) in a degenerative model, that could greatly increase the applicability of the model system.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49779.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration. What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…]</p><p>Overall, this work is of high quality and demonstrates that the application of LSFM microscopy will be a useful technique to study angiogenesis especially when improved 3D resolution is warranted. The potential for LSFM in live imaging appears to be limited in spatial resolution and time.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their positive response. To better assess the temporal/spatial resolution of live imaging we have now performed a much larger live imaging study, repeating imaging across spatial scales, thereby extending on the single examples given of WT and OIR in the previous version. Thereby, we have included more n and also show live imaging of subcellular actin dynamics using lifeact mice. Now our live imaging sample size is n=10, comprised of: mT/mG WT n=3, lifeact WT n = 6, mT/mG OIR n=1).</p><p>Furthermore, we found LSFM live imaging to be genuinely reproducible as we performed it across three different country locations with different collaborator teams to obtain the complete set (due to my own lab moving from the US to Sweden during the revisions and no longer having a mouse colony combined with technical issues with the Lightsheet microscope in Sweden). We have also developed a new method that limits curling up of the eye tissue permitting a wider field of tissue that can be live imaged (described in the Materials and methods: “To minimize curling of the retina, apply 1-2 drops of low melting agarose on retina and start uncurling the retina before the gel is solidified. It can then be transferred to the cylinder for imaging.”).</p><p>We find the approach is best suited to capture fast processes, given the high frame rates achievable with the LSFM over confocal. Altogether, the new cohort of data indicates the reverse of the reviewer’s comment – we do not find LSFM spatially restricted – subcellular processes across wide fields of view are entirely feasible, and we find high temporal resolution is also reliably achievable. The limitations rather lie currently with the overall length of a live imaging study (~2 hours with confidence). However, with a full optimization study of the tissue culture medium and conditions it may well be feasible to extend this window in the future, as the neurons in retinal explants are known to stably persist and grow in culture. The conditions used here may simply be too normoxic, to promote further angiogenesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>At this point I have three concerns:</p><p>1) In Figure 3 the authors perform comparative analyses of a sample image acquired by LSFM and confocal microscopy. The confocal image (Figure 3A) appears to be saturated, which makes quantitative analysis difficult. In general, the authors should provide histograms to ensure that comparable images are being analyzed. Also, the pixel depth of images should be specified.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this important comment. We have now removed the original Figure 3 and the entire section on automated image analysis of vessel diameters as we discovered some calibration issues and artifacts with the meshing software (holes and complications in the mesh). The software is undergoing a more thorough development and a refinement process before we publish it separately in the future.</p><p>However, to clarify, we apologize for the confusion over what the original images show in Figure 3. The images were not saturated as they were all the binary images from the thresholded original images. We are sorry this was unclear.

Our reasoning for this is that we are primarily concerned with fluorescent imaging approaches that can provide molecular mechanism detail. But realize this needed to be made clearer. We have now included the following:</p><p>“Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is an established medical imaging technique that uses light to capture micrometer-resolution, three-dimensional images non-invasively, now widely used as a diagnostic tool (Srinivasan et al., 2006; Huber et al., 2009). […] Furthermore, being a non-fluorescent method, specific proteins cannot be labelled and tracked to investigate mechanism.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) To assess the spatial resolution of LSFM compared to other imaging techniques it would be helpful to examine finer morphological structures – for example cell junction, Golgi or mitochondria.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included LSFM images of retinas showing Golgi, collagen and F-actin (lifeact), showing that these finer morphological structures can be successfully imaged with LSFM (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C-I).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] A critical aspect of this manuscript is the value-added of this new technology. As an outside evaluator, I see both positives and negatives of this technology and it would be critical for the authors to provide a more balanced view of these.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the positive and supportive comments on this study. To provide a clearer comparison of the pros and cons of both LSFM and confocal imaging of mouse retinas we have significantly extended the previous short Discussion section on into a full balanced Discussion. We also have now emphasized the inclusion of this clearer, balanced comparison to confocal in the Introduction, Abstract and Discussion, e.g. In the Abstract: “We compare our results to standard retinal imaging methods, in particular confocal microscopy. Through quantitative correlative Confocal-LSFM imaging we find that flat mounting retinas for confocal microscopy significantly distorts tissue morphology.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Or perhaps, if I am missing something, explain to the review team what is the misinterpretation on the aspects of the study indicated below.</p><p>1) A detailed evaluation of the images provided reveals the lack of a clear hierarchy when retinas are evaluated by LSFM versus confocal flat-mounted images. For example, Figure 1F shows the vasculature of a P10. At this time, the vessels should clearly depict hierarchic branching patterns with alternating arteries and veins. Instead, the image shows a mesh or vessels that lack hierarchical organization and absence of alternating arterial-vein vessels. Is this outcome due to the fact that three vascular layers are juxtaposed, providing excessive noise to the inner layer (the hierarchical layer)? If this is the case, there are several negatives associated with this approach, although again, there are several positives (important to bring balance to the manuscript).</p></disp-quote><p>The vessels shown in Figure 1F are imaged from the outside of the eye, so you predominantly see the deeper vascular plexus, which has less hierarchical structure at P10 than the inner layer. This is not easily studied using confocal so represents a benefit if the deeper plexus is the object of the study. However, if the eye is rotated relative to the objective such that we view from above/inside – the superficial layer is closest and cross-sectional structures can be seen straight on. However, the reviewer is correct; if an older eye is being imaged the three layers will be somewhat visually overlapping (e.g. in Figure 1—figure supplement 1B), which could be hard to manually untangle due to the curvature, and as such represents a limitation. The preservation of the tissue depth information in the large z stack, however, means by computationally fitting to the local curvature of the eye tissue one could computationally colour code and subtract the retinal layers out for independent viewing and analysis. We have added a note on this to the balanced Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) For the visualization shown in Figure 3: Was this done using a flat mounted image? Or Having the eyeball as a curved structure? I believe it might be the former, and in this case, it is difficult to understand why there are differences in the evaluation. The authors offer that assessment of the vasculature using lighsheet shows wider vessels than confocal, but the problem with the out-of-focus light discussed by the authors brings a confounding factor on the metrics. Can the authors discuss this at greater length? Also how do these metrics compared to a perfusion-fixed transversal section of specific vessels?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now removed the original Figure 3 and the entire section on automated image analysis of vessel diameters as we discovered some calibration issues and artefacts with the meshing software (holes and complications in the mesh) so it is undergoing a more thorough development and a refinement process before we publish it separately in the future.</p><p>To answer the reviewers first question here and to better explain the tissue handling and correlative imaging process we added schematic Figure 3A. Indeed, the tissue was imaged curved first in LSFM and then flat mounted to view the same regions in confocal to compare any distortions directly.</p><p>To be completely confident of the comparative measurements we had two independent postdocs hand measure the width and depth of the same vessel segment in the corresponding images. We also re performed the analysis on LSFM vessels after deconvolution using Huygens but found no differences to the measurements made with the unprocessed LSFM images. Thus, to answer the reviewers second question we can confirm that out-of-focus light did not affect the measurements in these images. We suspect this is due the early postnatal stage of these retinas (P4) meaning they are very thin so have minimal light scatter.</p><p>To address the final point, we scoured the literature but could not find corresponding measurements of these very small vessels that we analyzed using perfusion-fixed transversal sections, but would be very open to comparing if a reference could be highlighted?</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is hard to interpret Figure 4 without a full legend (missing in the manuscript) but the comparison between confocal and LSFM clearly shows the advantage of LSFM, as the tufts are not squeezed through mounting. However, I am having a hard time in really understanding what is a &quot;mature&quot; versus a &quot;knotting&quot; tuft. If a nomenclature is to be introduced, then a more detailed description, assessment of multiple retinas, etc should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize entirely for the lack of figure legend to Figure 4 (now Figure 5). This was a great disappointment as this figure really does indeed showcase one of the major benefits of LSFM as the reviewer points out – improved imaging and understanding of vascular malformations. Indeed, we have included quantification of the exact level of distortion confocal flatmounting incurs to tufts (Figure 5E).</p><p>The analysis was performed over multiple retinas, n=6 and each dot in the quantitative analysis (Figure 5B-D) is an individual tuft analysed.</p><p>To better explain the knotting nomenclature in response to the reviewer, we have now included a much deeper study of the 3D morphological structure (Figure 6), we explored deconvolution (reducing lightscatter using Huygens software) and using different 3D methods to view/understand, draw and analyse the 3D structures. This extra effort has turned out to be transformative, revealing nuances of complex vessel interlacing structures not before reported.</p><p>To simplify the nomenclature, we have changed to ‘small, medium and large’, instead of ‘initiating, knotting and mature’ as per reviewer 3’s request to avoid inferring too much temporal ordering of the process from static images until we know more. However, we make it clear in the discussion our assumption is that this is the likely ordering, based on the peak proportion of curved nuclei in medium sized tufts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Clearly a big advantage of LSFM is the live imaging shown in Figure 5. Because there are multiple image modalities, it will be important to clearly state how is the ex-vivo preparation (flat? Curved? With media? Without? Heat? Oxygen?).</p></disp-quote><p>Information is in the Materials and methods section. In summary, Retina are curved in media containing 50% FCS with 5% CO2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…]</p><p>Authors start by claiming that visualizing blood vessels in the retina's natural spherical conformation will be important for our understanding of vascular biology.

The revised version now includes many new quantifications, including comparative OIR tuft depth distortions across tuft sizes when imaged with confocal vs LSFM (Figure 5E); a substantial new vessel diameter analysis, performed by hand by two independent postdocs, following a correlative imaging approach to ensure precision and accuracy, that the exact same vessel diameter is directly compared between the imaging modalities. This study revealed that distortions are present in even very small developing vessels when imaged with a confocal (Figure 3). Furthermore, we have added a significant new section to the Discussion comparing the benefits and limitations of LSFM and confocal as suggested by reviewers 2 and 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other quantitative information used in vascular biology includes: vascular density; number of branching points; number of endothelial tip cells; number of filopodia per tip cell; number of regressing branches; etc. Does LSFM improve the analysis of those parameters? It is likely not the case.</p></disp-quote><p>In the new Discussion section we point out that for such static quantifications of XY plane properties of developmental angiogenesis in just the superficial plexus, which all these quantifications relate to, confocal has better resolution and remains preferable to LSFM. We are not proposing LSFM to replace for this type of analysis, and go further to demonstrate with LSFM that the vessels in this superficial layer during development are not distorted, adding further confidence to the confocal approach in this setting. However, for pathological angiogenesis, where enlarged or abnormally oriented vessels grow, e.g. as in the tufts that protrude outside of the superficial plexus into the vitreous, we find a distinct advantage of LSFM over confocal. The tuft morphology is much less flattened and distorted, and the ability to image all around them and rotate in videos to view the tuft fully from the side or any angle helped to reveal the complex knotted morphology, not previously discovered across the many confocal studies of the OIR vasculature.</p><p>The key strength of LSFM is for rapid 3D-4D imaging, which can reveal many other important regions/processes in the retina that currently are less well studied or standardized, in vascular biology and opthalmology, beyond developmental angiogenesis in the superficial plexus. Analysis of deeper layers, diving vessels, interconnecting neurons and vessels with differential orientations in the tissue, abnormally enlarged or altered 3D structures such as vascular tufts, but potentially any region of the eye that has become abnormally shaped in 3D, might benefit from this type of imaging.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, description of the deconvolution and segmentation parameters in Materials and methods is very vague and relies heavily on &quot;experts&quot; (subsections “Manual cropping of well-segmented regions” and “Isosurface extraction”).</p></disp-quote><p>We have entirely removed the automated analysis pipeline which this comment relates to, while it undergoes more rigorous development and calibration due to some meshing artefacts that may have affected results. We have replaced the Materials and methods section on deconvolution, which was subsequently performed using Huygens software in this revised version, with a more detailed description of the process (Materials and methods).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another advantage of LSFM could be that the new method is faster when coming to perform the same task (extract quantitative information of fluorescence images). However, authors did not discuss this aspect. It would be important therefore to include the amount of time needed to image and quantify these parameters per retina and compared it to confocal microscopy.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer, and have emphasized better the speed improvements with LSFM, indeed putting it as the first benefit listed, in the new Discussion section comparing LSFM and confocal. Generally speaking, while the image capture is dramatically faster for LSFM, we found that the quantification time (the time required to quantify the images) is comparable between LSFM and confocal, which has also been added to this section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Authors also showed the capacity to perform live imaging of endothelial cells in the mouse retina.

We have thus significantly improved the live imaging Results section, repeating the WT live imaging with mT/mG mice so n=3 and including a new study using WT lifeact mice n=6 showing subcellular actin dynamics can be quantified. Given cell shape, migration, division and junctional dynamics all depend on actin this potentiates novel studies with many mouse mutants to gain quantifiable results. Furthermore, we have now included quantifications of the filopodia dynamics comparing the healthy retina to the OIR, which already indicated that the filipodia are dramatically altered in the OIR condition, worthy of greater study and indicating that live imaging with LSFM could generate data with dynamic insight and value for development and disease models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given the tremendous change in the environment, including oxygen concentrations, loss of vitreous humor, lack of blood flow, loss of intraocular pressure, which are known to affect endothelial cell biology, it is debatable how reliable can be any information acquired with this protocol.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree there are of course aspects that have changed, however compared to the standard use of in vitro assays for live imaging endothelial behaviour, such as bead sprouting assays and ES cell assays the tissue environment and cell behaviour within the largely intact local retinal tissue around the vessels is likely to yield more realistic cell behaviour than in vitro. Furthermore, if studying tip cell dynamics and filopodia, these are not perfused vessels, so the lack of blood flow is not likely a huge factor. We also see this as a first step in a longer goal were we or other labs can improve the tissue medium, dissection process and exploring micro pumps and fluidics to perfuse vessels via the optic nerve to get closer and closer to imaging longer time windows with in situ processes in an otherwise fully working ex vivo mouse eye.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As a matter of fact, Sawamiphak et al., 2010 reported a similar protocol, but the impact in the field so far is very minor.</p></disp-quote><p>We discuss this particular study in the Introduction section of the manuscript and point out their protocol involves significant delay between dissection and imaging due to the need to flatmount the tissue first. The flatmounting also creates more distorting and destruction of tissue gradients than our protocol.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, no quantification of cell migration or filopodia dynamics was attempted in order to illustrate the potential value of the method. The same holds true in regard to the pathological OIR model.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and this has been significantly improved with the addition of more live imaging repeats. We have now included a full quantification study of filopodia comparing vessels in the healthy tissue and OIR, as well as subcellular actin dynamics, overhauling and extending the two live imaging Results sections significantly as well as updating Figure 5 and including the new Figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A potential interest of the report comes from the analysis of vascular malformations, so-called vascular tufts, in the OIR model.

We now quantitatively show that confocal microscopy distorted tuft depth significantly meaning the side view of tufts is almost impossible to interpret and unreliable in confocal images (as shown in Figure 5), which means the same structures could not be observed in confocal following the standard flatmounting procedures.</p><p>Furthermore, it would be much more difficult to see curved nuclei using confocal microscopy due to the potential for distortion to be curving them and the lack of the extra perspective side view to tell if they are truly curved. We have extended a sentence on this in the results to better emphasize: “It should be noted that care should be taken to rotate the image stack to confirm nuclear curvature, as two nuclei parallel to each other can look like only one nucleus (Figure 5A, fourth panel row, blue arrow), emphasizing the importance of 3D imaging with LSFM as rotating and viewing tufts from the side without distortion is not possible with confocal.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Within the same context, authors claimed &quot;abnormal cell dynamics&quot; in the context of pathological angiogenesis.

We do feel the approach has broad benefits for eye research beyond vascular biology, but also that is has several key benefits for vascular biology in terms of studying abnormally enlarged or dynamic structures as described in response to point 1 above.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The shape of the 3D tufts is interesting, but the major use of the OIR model is to quantify changes in neovascularization, usually in response to gene alterations, protein agonists or antagonists, or various drugs. Certainly, differences in tuft size are observed by traditional confocal analysis and quantifiable changes have been made for decades with several novel adaptations over the years. The authors should compare the two methods in a study testing a drug or transgenic mouse known to affect tuft formation to see if there is indeed a dramatic improvement in quantification analysis in order to compare the two methodologies for this model system. While the structural analysis of the tufts (spirals, tuft fusion, etc.) are a very interesting finding, in terms of a broad improvement to the model, the benefits towards the OIR model's major purpose are less clear. If the authors choose not to perform the comparisons, the claims of their method being &quot;better&quot; would need to be appropriately tempered throughout the article.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer makes a very useful suggestion to better balance our claims of when exactly confocal or LSFM might be more appropriate given what the study might aim to quantify, e.g. as they note, in OIR studies. As this was a very interesting point, we took the reviewers advice and performed a comparative 3D analysis, LSFM study of a published OIR drug treatment (Yagasaki et al., 2014). We looked at the effects of Everolimus, an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), previously analysed with standard confocal area metrics to see whether LSFM could a) match the confocal measures and/or b) improve upon the insights gained with 2D area measurements. We have added the following results to the text, Figure 6—figure supplement 3 and also added further discussion and clarification on when confocal is more appropriate for certain analyses such as 2D area measurements. Overall, we have also tried to temper the language and be more balanced throughout.</p><p>“Next, we investigated whether LSFM could provide added benefits for OIR drug study quantifications, when compared to confocal microscopy. […] Thus, we concluded that LSFM is more suitable for 3D volume and tuft morphology characterisation to understand the mechanism of action of OIR drug treatments than confocal microscopy.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The PACT analysis and description is good, along with the rational for choosing PACT. However, it is unclear if the authors ever tested that technique on transgenic mice where the fluorescence is innate to the tissue (not stained).</p></disp-quote><p>Due to the high expression levels of mT/mG-YFP, and its proximity to the surface in these samples, PACT clearing of the tissue was not required. However, it was well established in the original PACT publication (Yang et al., 2014), and in many subsequent publications utilizing the PACT technique, that genetically encoded fluorescent proteins maintain their fluorescence throughout the PACT clearing protocol.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Was the PACT procedure used for the live retinal vasculature studies in Figure 4?</p></disp-quote><p>No, the PACT procedure was not used here. We have now indicated the images are of “uncleared” in the figure legend to clarify.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As one of the key parameters for choosing PACT, it seems that the maintenance of fluorescent protein emission should be tested and demonstrated using this procedure. Also, are clearing methods required for the vascular studies, or just for the neuronal studies and assessing retinal layers?</p></disp-quote><p>In general, the need for clearing increases with the developmental stage of the eye cup and the depth of the structure of interest within the tissue. Therefore, we only utilized clearing for the vascular and neuronal samples in Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1. Currently, clearing of living tissue has not been demonstrated. Therefore, we were careful to calibrate our optical image system as close as possible to the refractive index of the tissue without impacting the viability of the living samples. This involved maintaining the sample in a physiological aqueous buffer, using a water dipping objective, and adjusting the Z-position of the light-sheet within the tissue to ensure optimal alignment with the focal plane of our imaging objective.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) While the authors do a good job of demonstrating observations of subcellular structures like Golgi and actin dynamics, the authors should better discuss what might be learned from this level of resolution. For example, the authors mention using Golgi localization to study EC polarity in migration and regression, but the images shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 make it seem like any such interpretation would be difficult. Similarly, it is unclear what is shown with regards to the actin dynamics in Figure 4 and corresponding videos or the practical utility of such studies.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this concern, we have now improved on the subcellular section by performing a demonstration that LSFM allows for Golgi-nucleus polarity assignment. For this, we utilized a new Golgi and nuclear double reporter mouse (GNrep mouse) (Barbacena et al., 2019).</p><p>The following text has been added to the manuscript together with new in panels Figure 1—figure supplement 1E-H:</p><p>“Moreover, quantification of the nucleus-Golgi polarity axis was amenable when imaging the GNrep mouse (Barbacena et al., 2019), which expresses Golgi-localised mCherry and nucleus-localised eGFP upon Cre-mediated recombination, enabling visualisation of endothelial specific nuclei and Golgi apparatus. […] The ability to 3D rotate the undistorted vascular image stacks obtained with LSFM revealed hidden cells whose polarity could be analysed, not visible when analysing the same image stack using standard confocal 2D imaging (i.e. viewed only from above) (Figure 1—figure supplement 1F-H).”</p><p>We have also added further discussion on this, as suggested, to better explain the benefits that subcellular level LSFM studies of undistorted 3D eye tissue could bring:</p><p>“Subcellular level resolution in undistorted 3D retinal structures. […] However, we see the greatest potential for subcellular analysis in future studies analysing disruptions in cell polarity, or other processes at the subcellular level such as actin localisation in large pathological vessels or other retinal structures”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The data in Figures 5 and 6 are difficult to interpret in isolation and the 3D rotational videos only provided limited assistance. Ideally to support the morphologies proposed in the schematics in Figure 6C, F, and I, additional stains or some other form of validation of the author's interpretations could be provided (histology, perfusion/fixation?). Particularly if the &quot;previously unappreciated knotted morphology of the tuft was evident across all tuft classes&quot; is a truly significant and novel advance to the field. If no new data are added, it would be good to tone down the writing.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have now performed additional supportive 3D imaging using a different approach – we chose microCT imaging as it provides an independent high-resolution volumetric imaging of the undistorted 3D tissue structure with which to assess tuft structure and compare to LSFM. We found this feasible and assessed two retinas from control and OIR mice each finding that tufts indeed often had evident holes/invaginations and bridged connections to the plexus. We have added the following text and Figure 6—figure supplement 2:</p><p>“To further validate these unexpected tuft morphologies with an independent high-resolution 3D imaging method, we performed microCT on intact health control and OIR retinas. […] On close inspection we indeed found tufts also appear to have holes/invaginations (Figure 6—figure supplement 2B-C) indicating further study of these complex 3D structures is warranted.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Current key limitations of flat mounting and confocal imaging are live imaging capabilities and quantifying neuronal cells like photoreceptors in models of degeneration (including the OIR model). The authors show great improvements in live imaging and 3D neuronal staining in the spherical eye cups. If the authors can show quantification of photoreceptors (or other neurons) in a degenerative model, that could greatly increase the applicability of the model system.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the suggestion and have now included quantification of neuronal dropout in a Rho KO mouse model of neuronal degeneration when imaged with LSFM. The following text has been added to the manuscript and Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p><p>“In order to establish whether LSFM could be used to quantify neuronal changes in a retinal degeneration model we imaged retinal cups from the Rho KO degeneration model (Figure 2—figure supplement 1) (Humphries et al., 1997). […] The ONL had almost entirely lost its stable convex curvature by 8 weeks in the KO retina and the inner nuclear layer (INL) also appeared ruffled when viewed in 3D which may be due to the unevenness of dropout of photoreceptors (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, B).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
