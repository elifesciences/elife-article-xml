and labor-intensive phenotyping experiments. Here, we explored the possibility that non-target reads from plant DNA sequencing can serve as phenotyping proxies for addressing such questions. We used data from a whole-genome and -epigenome sequencing study of 207 natural lines of field pennycress (<italic>Thlaspi arvense</italic>) that were grown in a common environment and spontaneously colonized by aphids, mildew, and other microbes. We found that the numbers of non-target reads assigned to the pest species differed between populations, had significant SNP-based heritability, and were associated with climate of origin and baseline glucosinolate contents. Specifically, pennycress lines from cold and thermally fluctuating habitats, presumably less favorable to aphids, showed higher aphid DNA load, i.e., decreased aphid resistance. Genome-wide association analyses identified genetic variants at known defense genes but also novel genomic regions associated with variation in aphid and mildew DNA load. Moreover, we found several differentially methylated regions associated with pathogen loads, in particular differential methylation at transposons and hypomethylation in the promoter of a gene involved in stomatal closure, likely induced by pathogens. Our study provides first insights into the defense mechanisms of <italic>Thlaspi arvense</italic>, a rising crop and model species, and demonstrates that non-target whole-genome sequencing reads, usually discarded, can be leveraged to estimate intensities of plant biotic interactions. With rapidly increasing numbers of large sequencing datasets worldwide, this approach should have broad application in fundamental and applied research.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The genetic code of organisms is made of DNA, a molecule consisting of long sequences of four different base pairs. To gain insights into the organisms’ genetic information, it is necessary to establish which base pairs are in its DNA and in what order. This is known as ‘sequencing’, and it allows scientists to ‘read out’ the genetic information of an organism.</p><p>Technically, sequencing often involves shearing the organisms’ DNA into smaller pieces, so that the enzymes that do the sequencing can fully ‘read’ each molecule of DNA. However, when DNA is isolated from an organism, for example a plant, not only the DNA from the plant will be obtained. A small portion of DNA from other organisms, including viruses, bacteria, fungi and even insects that visited the plant will also be isolated and sequenced. These ‘non-target’ DNA fragments are usually discarded because they do not match the reference genome of the sequenced plant.</p><p>However, the genetic information of these other organisms can provide additional insights into the plant. This is particularly true when scientists sequence a large collection of individual plants from the same species. In this case, the DNA of other organisms isolated along with each plant’s own DNA can tell researchers about differences between the plants, such as whether they are able to resist a particular disease or establish symbiosis with a specific fungus.</p><p>Galanti et al. wanted to find out more about the genetic background and characteristics of a European plant called the field pennycress, <italic>Thlaspi arvense</italic>. To do this, they used the fact that plants from different regions would acquire different pests depending on their genetic background, and the fact that the DNA from different creatures living with the plant would be gathered when the plant DNA was collected.</p><p>First, Galanti et al. collected pennycress seeds from across Europe and grew them in the same environment, and then they let these plants be colonized by pests. Next, the researchers tested whether the DNA of pests living on the plants reflected differences in resistance to these pests, and whether that could explain why some plants were more or less resistant based on their geographic origin and genetic background.</p><p>Galanti et al. found that, in general, plants collected in warmer and thermally stable climates, where pests usually thrive, had fewer pests in the controlled environment, suggesting that these plants had developed resistance to the pests. With this information, the researchers were also able to unravel the genetic bases of resistance, finding genetic variants in the plants with pests that were close to defense genes.</p><p>These results highlight the potential of acquiring important insights from non-target DNA fragments, especially to study plant-pathogen interactions. This could be useful in plant breeding programmes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>aphids</kwd><kwd>mildew</kwd><kwd>plant defense</kwd><kwd>GWAS</kwd><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd><kwd><italic>Thlaspi arvense</italic></kwd><kwd>Field pennycress</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>764965</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bossdorf</surname><given-names>Oliver</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>401829393</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bossdorf</surname><given-names>Oliver</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Aphid and mildew read counts leftover from the sequencing of greenhouse plants correlated with the environment of origin of the plants, and allowed the mapping of pathogen resistance genes.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plant pests, such as pathogens and herbivores, can cause major yield losses in crops and often require the massive use of pesticides to control their damage. Natural plant populations, on the other hand, are constantly exposed to such biotic stressors and their higher genetic diversity often allows these populations to become locally adapted. Since many pest species are sensitive to climatic conditions, their pressure on plant communities is spatially heterogeneous, maintaining geographically structured genetic variation in plant defenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Züst et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kerwin et al., 2015</xref>). For these reasons, natural plant populations are highly suitable to study defense mechanisms and evolution of defenses, and also a very useful source of beneficial and resistance alleles for specific pathogens and environmental conditions. This genetic variation in defense-related genes can for example be screened through genome-wide association (GWA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corwin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Thoen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hanson et al., 2018</xref>) or approaches based on known candidate genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kerwin et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Many pest species are also highly sensitive to temporal variation in weather conditions. This temporal heterogeneity in pathogen pressure can induce plastic responses in plants, involving gene expression and epigenetic changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jaouannet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Geng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Annacondia et al., 2021</xref>), which may also be studied through stress experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jaouannet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Geng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Annacondia et al., 2021</xref>). Some plastic epigenetic responses can have a transient stability and be transmitted to the next generations through inheritance of epigenetic marks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kinoshita and Seki, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Espinas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lämke and Bäurle, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">He and Li, 2018</xref>). In particular, DNA methylation has been shown to respond to biotic and abiotic stresses through gene expression regulation and transposable elements (TEs) reactivation, and can be inherited across generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Annacondia et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lämke and Bäurle, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Roquis et al., 2021</xref>). In plants, DNA methylation can occur in the three sequence contexts CG, CHG, and CHH (H being A, T, or C), which differ in their molecular machineries depositing, maintaining, and removing methylation and consequently also in their transgenerational stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Law and Jacobsen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). While CG methylation is usually more stable across generations, CHH methylation is less stable and more responsive to stress and the sensitivity of CHG methylation lies somewhere in between (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Law and Jacobsen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liu and He, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Whether inherited or induced, some strategies of plants for defense against pathogens and herbivores include: (i) physical barriers such as reinforced cell walls, leaf protective layers, or closing stomata, (ii) production of specialized (secondary) metabolites that reduce palatability or are toxic to pests, (iii) oxidative bursts, (iv) the activation of signaling cascades to induce systemic responses, and (v) RNA interference mechanisms to silence pathogen genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wojtaszek, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">War et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kant et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Melotto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Muhammad et al., 2019</xref>). In Brassicaceae, a particularly important and diverse class of defense metabolites are glucosinolates, which often show local adaptation driven by variation in pests and can also be induced by herbivore and pathogen attacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Züst et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kerwin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kutyniok and Müller, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Studying natural variation in plant resistance, along with associated genetic and epigenetic variation, can identify genes involved in defense and their regulators, including vital genes whose function cannot be determined through knockout experiments. Such knowledge, and especially the discovery of natural resistance alleles, are crucial sources for the breeding of more pest-resistant crop varieties. Nevertheless, because of the diversity of resistance mechanisms and their often multigenic nature, plant defense mechanisms remain difficult to study. In particular, antixenosis (the prevention of pathogen settlement) and antibiosis (the repression of pathogen growth and reproduction) require extensive and time-consuming phenotyping, based for example on choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nalam et al., 2018</xref>) or settling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Annacondia et al., 2021</xref>) assays, and such assays are extremely challenging to perform on large collections. On the other hand, there are increasing numbers of large sequencing datasets, which may also be used to quantify contaminants or microbiome composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sangiovanni et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Roman-Reyna et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gathercole et al., 2021</xref>) and thus as proxies for resistance phenotyping. In this study we investigated such usage of exogenous reads, i.e., reads not mapping to the target reference genome, as a source of information for quantifying herbivore and pathogen abundance in large collections.</p><p>We worked with field pennycress (<italic>Thlaspi arvense</italic>), an annual plant in the Brassicaceae family that is increasingly studied as a model species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Geng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nunn et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Troyee et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Galanti et al., 2022</xref>) and new biofuel and winter cover crop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dorn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frels et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chopra et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhao et al., 2021</xref>). In a previous study, we investigated natural epigenetic variation in a collection of 207 <italic>Thlaspi</italic> lines from across Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Galanti et al., 2022</xref>). Prior to their whole-genome (WGS) and -epigenome sequencing these lines had been grown in a common environment, an open glasshouse where the plants were spontaneously colonized by aphids and powdery mildew, as well as by other microbes. At the time of sequencing, pathogen contamination was still very limited but appeared highly variable, and preliminary analyses showed that it resulted in sizeable amounts of non-target reads assigned to the pest species, i.e., contamination of the DNA samples. Inspired by other recent studies on non-target reads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sangiovanni et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Roman-Reyna et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gathercole et al., 2021</xref>), we asked if there was systematic variation in the numbers of aphid and pathogen reads among different <italic>T. arvense</italic> lines, and whether these data, together with our whole-genome plant sequencing data, could provide insights into the genomic basis of plant resistance variation.</p><p>The goals of our study were thus twofold: (i) to contribute to a mechanistic understanding of pest resistance in <italic>T. arvense</italic>, and (ii) to explore whether non-target reads from plant sequencing can be used as proxies for studying plant biotic interactions. Considering that we are moving toward an increasingly sequencing-prone world, with more and larger datasets being generated for many species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kajiya-Kanegae et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Colgan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Habyarimana et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mekbib et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Metheringham et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nocchi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Friis et al., 2024</xref>), the use of non-target reads has very broad potential.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Reads classification and species identification</title><p>Starting from our previously published sequencing data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Galanti et al., 2022</xref>), the first step of our analysis was to separate the WGS reads of each sample into the ~99.5% mapping to the <italic>T. arvense</italic> reference genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nunn et al., 2022</xref>) and the ~0.5% that did not, hereafter called ‘exogenous reads’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Initially, we used all mapped reads for calling variants in <italic>Thlaspi</italic>, but after some difficulties with genome-wide association (GWA) analyses (see below) we suspected that some plant reads were false and mapped to the <italic>T. arvense</italic> genome only because of the high cross-taxa similarity of some genomic regions. We therefore remapped all reads to the genomes of the aphid <italic>Acyrthosiphon pisum</italic>, its endosymbiont <italic>Buchnera aphidicola</italic> and the powdery mildew <italic>Blumeria graminis</italic>, and found that, on average, 7.4% of the reads mapped to both <italic>T. arvense</italic> and at least one of the pests. We removed these ambiguous reads from our analyses and used only the <italic>T. arvense</italic> target reads, 92.1% on average, for variant calling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Classification of sequencing reads in <italic>T. arvense</italic> whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Workflow of the analyses, including reads classification (orange nodes) into target, ambiguous, and exogenous reads, and downstream analysis (dark blue nodes) (see Materials and methods).

Out of the 78% of the exogenous reads that passed the MG-RAST quality control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) the majority belonged to bacteria and smaller fractions to fungi, plants, and animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). For subsequent group-level analyses, we then focused on nine taxonomic groups that occurred consistently within our samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), and that were particularly abundant or relevant: Erysiphales (fungi), Peronosporales (oomycetes), Aphididae, and Culicidae (both insects), and five bacterial families.</p><p>Visual inspection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and other sources of information narrowed down the observed aphid and mildew species to a few candidates. For aphids we considered <italic>A. pisum</italic> (indicated by MG-RAST), <italic>Myzus persicae</italic> (visual match, and a generalist attacking Brassicaceae; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">CABI, 2021</xref>) and <italic>Brevicoryne brassicae</italic> (attacks Brassicaceae including <italic>Thlaspi</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gabryś and Pawluk, 1999</xref>).

A powerful source for obtaining resistant varieties is natural variation in plant defenses, but phenotyping large collections can be very time-consuming and error-prone. Here, we describe how an unplanned pest infestation in a glasshouse experiment, together with available WGS data, can be used to estimate aphid, mildew, and microbial loads, and thus variation in plant resistance. The approach is straightforward, makes use of WGS data without microbiome-specific DNA extraction, and can in principle be applied to many other situations such as field experiments. It is not error-free, but we highlight some potential pitfalls, show how to reduce noise, and illustrate its potential to detect associations with climatic, genetic, and epigenetic variation.</p><p>An important first step in our analyses was the identification and classification of pest-related reads in the plant WGS data. We began by classifying all reads as target (only mapping to <italic>T. arvense</italic>), ambiguous (mapping to <italic>T. arvense</italic> and at the same time to at least one of the pest genomes), or exogenous (not mapping to <italic>T. arvense</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We demonstrated the importance of removing ambiguous reads prior to variant calling, as this prevented calling false positive variants caused by exogenous DNA that also mapped to highly conserved or repetitive sequences in the <italic>T. arvense</italic> genome. We then classified the exogenous reads using MG-RAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Meyer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Keegan et al., 2016</xref>) or by confident mapping to specific pest genomes, and selected the 11 most relevant and/or abundant taxonomic groups to focus our analyses on. To obtain unbiased pest/microbe loads we also corrected the read counts for the total number of deduplicated reads of each sample. A competitive mapping approach allowed us to identify the aphid and mildew species that had occurred in our experiment as the generalist aphid <italic>M. persicae</italic> and the powdery mildew <italic>E. cruciferarum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>Since we suspected a non-random colonization of pests and microbes in our <italic>T. arvense</italic> collection, we tested for population differences as well as SNP-based heritability. We found significant population differences for most pest and microbe loads, and often heritabilities above 15%, which although low, is still indicative of genetic determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Thoen et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, Erysiphales load had a particularly high heritability of 47% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). We therefore next asked what could explain the observed variation in pest loads in our experiment. As pathogen abundances in the field are often determined by climatic conditions, we expected plants originating from climates less favorable to aphids to perform worse in our glasshouse, i.e., to have higher pathogen loads. As expected, aphid counts were negatively correlated with temperature of origin (particularly minimum temperature), and positively with temperature variability (mean diurnal range and temperature annual range) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), suggesting that plants from colder and more thermally fluctuating climates, which are less favorable to aphids, were less well defended and performed worse in our glasshouse. We found similar but weaker patterns for Erysiphales load.</p><p>As we expected the observed climate-associated variation in pest loads to be at least partially explained by variation in chemical defenses, and since in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> glucosinolates, the main defensive compounds, are known to be geographically structured in response to aphid distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Züst et al., 2012</xref>), we also tested for association of aphid and mildew loads with glucosinolates in our collection. In accordance with literature on <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kim and Jander, 2007</xref>), we observed a positive correlation of aphid loads with total glucosinolates as well as with the most abundant glucosinolate sinigrin (aliphatic glucosinolate), but a negative correlation with benzyl glucosinolate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). These findings suggest that glucosinolate composition, rather than total amount, is important for aphid defense, and that while benzyl glucosinolate might have a deterrent effect, sinigrin might on the contrary attract <italic>M. persicae</italic> or act as a stimulant, which would be in accordance with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Klingauf et al., 1972</xref>).</p><p>To detect genetic variants associated with pest and microbe loads, we then conducted a GWA study (GWAS). For aphid (<italic>M. persicae</italic>) load, we detected only one non-significant peak in Scaffold 5, close to a pathogenesis-related coding gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and D</xref>). For Erysiphales load, however, there were several significant associations neighboring genes directly involved in defense, mostly members of the <italic>MLP</italic> family, clustered in a large peak on the first arm of Scaffold 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). <italic>MLP165</italic>, the closest gene to the most significant variant in the peak, is indirectly involved in glucosinolate biosynthesis in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR), 2000</xref>), which might explain why baseline glucosinolate levels were associated with Erysiphales load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Further GWA peaks for Erysiphales pointed toward other genes indirectly involved in the defense response through phytohormone signaling (e.g. <italic>CAR8, PBL7, GH3.1</italic>) or preventing pathogen access through cell wall reinforcement or stomatal closure (<italic>SRF3, PBL7</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Further experiments would be necessary to confirm the functionality of these genes.</p><p>An important general insight from our GWA analyses was the frequent ambiguity of reads that mapped to both pest and host plant genomes. Such ambiguous reads generated false variants only present in samples with pest DNA, which resulted in highly significant false associations, and it was therefore important to remove these reads before variant calling. Another potential reason for sequence similarity between host and pathogens could be defense mechanisms such as RNA interference. If <italic>T. arvense</italic> produces small or micro-RNAs to silence pathogen genes, this would originate from genomic regions of high similarity between the host and the pathogen, and thus reflect a true association. However, a BLAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Camacho et al., 2009</xref>) of the region in which the suspicious associations occurred did not reveal any similarity to aphid or mildew genes, but instead to the highly conserved ribosomal RNA coding regions. While genetic variants are generally inherited from parents and thus reflect evolutionary processes, DNA methylation variants can be heritable but can also reflect plastic responses to environmental stresses like herbivores or pathogens. Our data do not allow to confidently distinguish between these two sources of DNA methylation variation, and thus should be interpreted with caution, especially with regard to the directionality of associations. A beneficial DNA methylation variant is expected to be associated with lower pathogen load when already present before pathogen arrival, but with higher pathogen load when plastically induced by pathogens during the experiment. For both <italic>M. persicae</italic> and Erysiphales, the majority of DMRs were hypomethylated in affected samples, which is in accordance with the loss of methylation observed in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and <italic>T. arvense</italic> upon aphid feeding, and in diploid wheat upon powdery mildew infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Geng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Annacondia et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Troyee et al., 2022</xref>), but we also detected hypermethylation at several loci. <italic>M. persicae</italic> load was associated with differential methylation at only few genes but several TEs, which is in accordance with the aphid or stress-induced TE reactivation observed in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Annacondia et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Roquis et al., 2021</xref>). Erysiphales load was associated with hypomethylated Copia TEs upstream of <italic>MAPKKK20</italic>, a gene involved in ABA-mediated signaling and stomatal closure. Since stomatal closure is a known defense mechanism to block pathogen access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Melotto et al., 2017</xref>), it is tempting to conclude that hypomethylation of the <italic>MAPKKK20</italic> promoter might induce its overexpression and consequent stomatal closure, thereby preventing mildew access to the leaf blade. Overall, we found associations between pathogen load and TE methylation that could potentially act both in <italic>cis</italic> (e.g. Copia TE methylation in <italic>MAPKKK20</italic> promoter) and in <italic>trans</italic>, e.g., through transposon reactivation (e.g. LINE, Helitron, and Ty3/Gypsi TEs isolated from genes). Although we cannot confidently distinguish inherited vs. induced DNA methylation variants, to our knowledge this is the first coupled GWA-EWA analysis conducted on a large natural plant collection.</p><p>In summary, our study offers first insights into the defense mechanisms of <italic>T. arvense</italic>, including candidate genes and alleles which may be of interest for breeding efforts in this novel biofuel and cover crop. It also provides a proof of principle that exogenous reads from large sequencing efforts, usually discarded if not mapping to the target genome, can be leveraged to extract additional information about important biotic interactions of the target species, including its antagonists and microbiome components. We combined this approach with data from a common environment experiment to show that pest and microbiome load were geographically structured, as expected from locally adapted traits, and associated with both genetic and DNA methylation variants. In principle, our approach can be applied to many other designs. For example, field-collected samples could be used to quantify geographic pathogen distributions. With the decreasing cost of sequencing and increasing large-scale and single-species sequencing projects (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kajiya-Kanegae et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Colgan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Habyarimana et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mekbib et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Metheringham et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nocchi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Friis et al., 2024</xref>), the number of datasets suitable for such analyses is set to rapidly increase in the near future.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant growth and sequencing</title><p>The WGS data used in this study were already published in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Galanti et al., 2022</xref>.

Briefly, we collected 207 <italic>T. arvense</italic> accessions from 36 European populations in July 2018, and we grew their offspring in a completely randomized design, in a glasshouse at the University of Tübingen (48°32'21.3&quot;N, 9°02'04.2&quot;E) between August and October 2019. The glasshouse was located in biodiverse surroundings, and insects and pests could enter when the windows opened for temperature regulation. A few weeks after germination, we noticed aphid and mildew infestations. After 46 days we sampled the third or fourth true leaf of each plant and snap-froze it in liquid nitrogen. We extracted DNA using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, DE), sonicated (Covaris) 300 ng of genomic DNA and used the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs) to prepare the libraries. Half way through the protocol we split the DNA into 1/3 for genomic libraries and 2/3 for bisulfite libraries. For the bisulfite conversion we used the EZ-96 DNA Methylation-Gold MagPrep (ZYMO) kit. We sequenced paired-end for 150 cycles using Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) for genomic libraries and HiSeq X Ten (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) for bisulfite libraries.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Reads mapping and classification</title><p>Upon demultiplexing the raw reads, we used cutadapt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Martin, 2011</xref>) for quality (minimum quality of 20) and adaptor trimming, excluding reads shorter than 35 bp.

To generate the methylation input files we first used custom scripts (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Dario-Galanti/WGBS_downstream/tree/main/WGBS_simpleworkflow">https://github.com/Dario-Galanti/WGBS_downstream/tree/main/WGBS_simpleworkflow</ext-link>, copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Galanti, 2024c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Galanti et al., 2022</xref>) to unite individual-sample bedGraph files into unionbed files and retain positions with coverage&gt;3 in at least 95% of the samples and a methylation difference of at least 5% in at least two samples. We then intersected the unionbed files with the DMRs of the corresponding sequence context using bedtools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>) and converted unionbed to BIMBAM format as input for GEMMA.</p><p>We ran EWA for individual positions within the DMRs and calculated Bonferroni thresholds based on the number of DMRs, assuming that cytosines within the same DMR are mostly autocorrelated. To observe in which genomic features associations with lower p-values were located, we performed enrichment analyses similar to the ones performed for defense a priori candidate genes in GWA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atwell et al., 2010</xref>), but based on whole genomic features. Starting from all cytosines used for EWA, we calculated the background frequency as the fraction of all cytosines located in each genomic feature and then calculated the observed frequency in the same way for -log(p) 0.5 increments, with enrichment as the ratio of observed and expected frequencies.

Nonetheless, the authors currently only show variation in pest read counts among plant accessions, not in pest abundance.

Methodological clarifications, especially regarding the normalization of read counts, now provide a stronger foundation for the presented results. Statistical enhancements, including more robust methods for controlling population structure and refined GWAS approaches, have solidified the reliability of the findings, effectively linking genetic variants and epigenetic modifications to pest loads. The discussion section has been improved to offer a more cautious interpretation of the correlations between transposable element (TE) methylation and pathogen load, emphasizing the associative nature of these findings. Additionally, increased transparency in data handling, particularly the treatment of ambiguous reads, has significantly reduced potential biases. These improvements have made the manuscript better suited to the readership, providing clearer insights into the genomic and epigenetic underpinnings of plant pest resistance.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.95510.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Galanti</surname><given-names>Dario</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03a1kwz48</institution-id><institution>University of Tübingen</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tübingen</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jung</surname><given-names>Jun Hee</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03a1kwz48</institution-id><institution>University of Tübingen</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tübingen</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Müller</surname><given-names>Caroline</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Bielefeld University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bielefeld</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bossdorf</surname><given-names>Oliver</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03a1kwz48</institution-id><institution>University of Tübingen</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tübingen</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Galanti et al. present an innovative new method to determine the susceptibility of large collections of plant accessions towards infestations by herbivores and pathogens.

However, compared to such counts one strength of our sequencing-based approach is that it (presumably) integrates over longer periods than a single observation (e.g. if aphid abundances fluctuated, or winged aphids visited leaves only temporarily), and that it can detect pathogens even when invisible to our eyes, e.g. before a mildew colony becomes visible. Moreover, the key point of our study is that we can detect variation in pest abundance even in the absence of count data, which are really time consuming to collect.</p><p>Conducting a new experiment, with controlled aphid infestations and continuous monitoring of their abundances, to test for correlation between pest abundance and the number of detected reads would require resequencing at least 30-50% of the collection for the results to be reliable. It would be a major experimental study in itself.</p><p>Regarding the origin of aphid reads and the differences in read-counts between e.g. aphids and mildew, we believe this should not be of concern. DNA contamination is very common in all kinds of samples, but these reads are simply discarded in other studies. For example, although we collected and handled samples using gloves, MG-RAST detected human reads (Hominidae, S2 Table), possibly from handling the plants during transplanting or phenotyping 1-2 weeks before sequencing. Therefore, although we did remove aphids from the leaves at collection, aphid saliva or temporary presence on leaves must have been enough to leave detectable DNA traces. Additionally, the fact that the <italic>M. persicae</italic> load strongly correlates with the <italic>Buchnera aphidicola</italic> load (R2=0.86, S6 Table), is reassuring. This obligate aphid symbiont is expected to be found in high amounts when sequencing aphids (see e.g. The International Aphid Genomics Consortium (2010))</p><p>The higher amount of aphid compared to mildew reads, can probably be explained by aphids having expanded more than mildew at the time of plant collection, but most importantly, as already mentioned by the reviewer, the read-counts were meant to compare plant accessions rather then pests to one another. We are interested in relative not absolute values. Comparisons between pest species are a challenge because they can be influenced by several factors such as the availability of sequences in the MG-RAST database and the DNA extraction kit used, which is plant-specific and might bias towards certain groups. All these potential biases are not a concern when comparing different plants as they are equally subject to these biases.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Galanti et al investigate genetic variation in plant pest resistance using non-target reads from whole-genome sequencing of 207 field lines spontaneously colonized by aphids and mildew.

However, some conclusions seem incomplete, lacking sufficient support from the data, or requiring additional methodological details for proper evaluation. Addressing these limitations through additional analyses or clarifications is recommended.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Major comments:</p><p>- So far it is not clear to me how read numbers were normalised and quantified. For instance, Figure 1C only reports raw read numbers. In L149: &quot;Prior to these analyses, to avoid biases caused by different sequencing depths, we corrected the read counts for the total numbers of deduplicated reads in each library and used the residuals as unbiased estimates of aphid, mildew and microbe loads&quot;. Was library size considered? Is the load the ratio between exogenous vs no exogenous reads? It is described in L461, but according to this, read counts were normalised and duplicated reads were removed. Now, why read counts were used? As opposite to total coverage / or count of bases per base? I cannot follow how variation in sequencing quality was considered. I can imagine that samples with higher sequencing depth will tend to have higher exogenous reads (just higher resolution and power to detect something in a lower proportion).</p></disp-quote><p>Correcting for sequencing depth/library size is indeed very important. As the reviewer noted, we had explained how we did this in the methods section (L464), and we now also point to it in the results (L151):</p><p>“Finally, we log transformed all read counts to approximate normality, and corrected for the total number of deduplicated reads by extracting residuals from the following linear model, log(read_count + 1) ∼ log(deduplicated_reads), which allowed us to quantify non-Thlaspi loads, correcting for the sequencing depth of each sample.”</p><p>We showed the uncorrected read-counts only in Fig 1 to illustrate the orders of magnitude but used the corrected read-counts (also referred to as “loads”) for all subsequent analyses.</p><p>In our view, theoretically, the best metric to correct the number of reads of a specific contaminant organism, is the total number of DNA fragments captured. Importantly, this is not well reflected by the total number of raw reads because of PCR and optical duplicates occurring during library prep and sequencing. For this reason we estimated the total number of reads captured multiplying total raw reads (after trimming) by the deduplication rate obtained from FastQC (methods L409-411). This metric reflects the amount of DNA fragments sampled better than the raw reads. Also it better reflects MG-RAST metrics as this software also deduplicates reads (Author response image 1 below). We also removed duplicates in our strict mappings to the <italic>M. persicae</italic> and <italic>B. aphidicola</italic> genomes.</p><p>Coverage is not a good option for correction, because it is defined for a specific reference genome and many of the read-counts output by MG-RAST do not have a corresponding full assembly. Moreover, coverage and base counts are influenced by read size, which depends on library prep and is not included in the read-counts produced by MG-RAST.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Linear correlations between the number of MG-RAST reads post-QC and either total (left) or deduplicated (right) reads from fastq files of four full samples (not only unmapped reads).</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-95510-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The general assumption is that plants with different origins will have genetic variants or epigenetic variations associated with pathogen resistance, which can be tracked in a GWAS. However, plants from different regions will also have all variants associated with their origin (isolation by state as presented in the manuscript). In line 169: &quot;Having established that our method most likely captured variation in plant resistance, we were interested in the ecological drivers of this variation&quot;. It is not clear to me how variation in plant resistance is differentiated from geographical variation (population structure). in L203: &quot;We corrected for population structure using an IBS matrix and only tested variants with Minor Allele Frequency (MAF) &gt; 0.04 (see Methods).&quot;. However, if resistant variants are correlated with population structure as shown in Table 1, how are they differentiated? In my opinion, the analyses are strongly limited by the correlation between phenotype and population structure.</p></disp-quote><p>The association of any given trait with population structure is surely a very important aspect in GWAS studies and when looking at correlations of traits with environmental variables. If a trait is strongly associated with population structure, then disentangling variants associated with population structure vs. the ones associated with the trait can indeed be challenging, a good example being flowering time in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (e.g. Brachi et al. 2013).</p><p>In our case, although the pest and microbiome loads are associated with population structure to some extent, this association is not very strong. This can be observed for example in Fig. 1C, where there is no clear separation of samples from different regions. This means that we can correct for population structure (in both GWAS and correlations with climatic variables) without removing the signals of association. It is possible that other associations were missed if specific variants were indeed strongly associated with structure, but these would be unreliable within our dataset, so it is prudent to exclude them.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Similarly, in L212: &quot;we still found significant GWA peaks for Erysiphales but not for other types of exogenous reads (excluding isolated, unreliable variants) (Figure 3A and S3 Figure).&quot; In a GWA analysis, multiple variants will constitute an association pick (as shown for instance in main Figure 3A) only when the pick is accentuated by lockage disequilibrium around the region under selection (or around the variant explaining phenotypic variation in this case). However, in this case, I suspect there is a strong component of population structure (which still needs to be corroborated as suggested in the previous comment). But if variants are filtered by population structure, the only variants considered are those polymorphic within populations. In this case, I do not think clear picks are expected since most of the signal, correlated with population has been removed. Under this scenario, I wonder how informative the analyses are.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, the traits we analyse (aphid and mildew loads) are only partially associated with population structure. This is evident from Fig. 1C (see answer above) but also from the SNP-based heritability (Table 1, last column) which measures indeed the proportion of variance explained by genetic population structure. Although some variance is explained (i.e. the reviewer is correct that there is some association) there is still plenty of leftover variance to be used for GWAS and correlations with environmental variables. The fact that we still find GWAS peaks confirms this, as otherwise they would be lost by the population structure correction included in our mixed model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- How were heritability values calculated? Were related individuals filtered out? I suggest adding more detail in both the inference of heritability and the kinship matrix (IBS matrix). Currently missing in methods (for heritability I only found the mention of an R package in the caption of Table 1).</p></disp-quote><p>We somehow missed this in the methods and thank the reviewer for noticing. We now added this paragraph to the chapter “Exogenous reads heritability and species identification”:</p><p>“To test for variation between populations we used a general linear model with population as a predictor. To measure SNP-based heritability, i.e. the proportion of variance explained by kinship, we used the marker_h2() function from the R package heritability (Kruijer and Kooke 2019), which uses a genetic distance matrix as predictor to compute REML-estimates of the genetic and residual variance. We used the same IBS matrix as for GWAS and for the correlations with climatic variables.”</p><p>We also added the reference to the R package <italic>heritability</italic> to the Table 1 caption.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 2C. in line 188: &quot;Although the baseline levels of benzyl glucosinolates were very low and probably sometimes below the detection level, plant lines where benzyl glucosinolate was detected had significantly lower aphid loads (over 70% less reads) in the glasshouse (Figure 3C)&quot;. It is not clear to me how to see these values in Figure 2C. From the boxplot, the difference in aphid loads between detected and not detected benzyl seems significantly lower. From the boxplot distribution is not clear how this difference is statistically significant. It rather seems like a sampling bias (a lot of non-detected vs low detected values). Is the difference still significant when random subsampling of groups is considered?</p></disp-quote><p>Here the “70% less reads” refers to the uncorrected read-counts directly (difference in means between samples where benzyl-GS were detected vs. not). We agree with the reviewer that this is confusing when referred to figure 2C which depicts the corrected <italic>M. persicae</italic> load (residuals). We therefore removed that information.</p><p>Regarding the significance of the difference, we re-calculated the p value with the Welch's t-test, which accounts for unequal variances, and with a bootstrap t-test. Both tests still found a significant difference. We now report the p value of the Welch’s t-test.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- I think additional information regarding the read statistics needs to be improved. At the moment some sections are difficult to follow. I found this information mainly in Supplementary Table 1. I could not follow the difference in the manuscript and supplementary materials between read (read count), fragment, ambiguous fragments, target fragments, etc. I didn't find information regarding mean coverage per sample and relative plant vs parasite coverage. This lack of clarity led me to some confusion. For instance, in L207: &quot;We suspected that this might be because some non-Thlaspi reads were very similar to these highly conserved regions and, by mapping there, generated false variants only in samples containing many non-Thlaspi reads&quot;. I find it difficult to follow how non-Thlaspi reads will interfere with genotyping. I think the fact that the large pick is lost after filtering reads is already quite insightful. However, in principle I would expect the relative coverage between non-Thlaspi:Thlaspi reads to be rather low in all cases. I would say below 1%. Thus, genotyping should be relatively accurate for the plant variants for the most part. In particular, considering genotyping was done with GATK, where low-frequency variants (relative coverage) should normally be called reference allele for the most part.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that some clarification over these points is necessary! We modified Supplementary Table 1 to include coverage information for all samples before and after removal of ambiguous reads and explained thoroughly how each value in the table was obtained. Regarding reads and fragments, we define each fragment as having two reads (R1 and R2). The classification into Target, Ambiguous and Unmapped reads was based on fragments, so we used that term in the table, but referring to reads has the same meaning in this context as for example an unmapped read is a read whose fragment was classified as unmapped.</p><p>We did not include the pest coverage specifically, because this cannot be calculated for any of the read counts obtained with MG-RAST as this tool is mapping to online databases where genome size is not necessarily known. What is more meaningful instead are the read counts, which are in Supplementary tables 2 and 6. Importantly as mentioned in other answers, if different taxa are differently represented in the databases this does not affect the comparison of read counts across different samples, but only the comparison of different taxa which was not used for any further analyses.</p><p>Regarding the ambiguous reads causing unreliable variants, these occur only in very few regions of the Thlaspi genome that are highly conserved in evolution or of very low complexity. In these regions reads generated from both plant or for instance aphid DNA, can map, but the ones from aphid might contain variants when mapping to the Thlaspi reference genome (L207 and L300). The reviewer is right that there is only a very small difference in average coverage when removing those ambiguous reads (~1X, S1 Table), but that is not true for those few regions where coverage changes massively when removing ambiguous reads as shown on the right side Y axes of S2 Figure. Therefore these unreliable variants are not low-frequency and therefore not removed by GATK.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- L215. I am not very convinced with the enrichment analyses, justified with a reference (52). For instance, how many of the predicted picks are not close to resistance genes? How was the randomisation done? At the moment, the manuscript reads rather anecdotally by describing only those picks that effectively are &quot;close&quot; to resistance genes. For instance, if random windows (let's say 20kb windows) are sampled along the genome, how often there are resistant genes in those random windows, and how is the random sampling compared with observed picks (windows).</p></disp-quote><p>Enrichment is by definition an increase in the proportion of true positives (observed frequency: proportion of significant SNPs located close to a priori candidate genes) compared to the background frequency (number of all SNPs located close to a priori candidate genes). So the background likelihood of SNPs to fall into a priori candidate SNPs (i.e. the occurrence of a priori candidate genes in randomly sampled windows, as suggested by the reviewer) is already taken into account as the background frequency. We now explained more extensively how enrichment is calculated in the relevant methods section (L545-549), but it is an extensively used method, established in a large body of literature, so it can be found in many papers (e.g. Atwell et al. 2010, Brachi et al. 2010, Kawakatsu et al. 2016, Kerdaffrec et al. 2017, Sasaki et al. 2015-2019-2022, Galanti et al. 2022, Contreras-Garrido et al. 2024).</p><p>Although we had already calculated an upper bound for the FDR based on the a priori candidates, as in previous literature, we now further calculated the significance of the enrichment for the Bonferroni-corrected -log(p) threshold for Erysiphales. Calculating significance requires adopting a genome rotation scheme that preserves the LD structure of the data, as described in the previously mentioned literature (eg. Kawakatsu et al. 2016, Sasaki et al. 2022). Briefly, we calculated a null distribution of enrichments by randomly rotating the p values and a priori candidate status of the genetic variants within each chromosome, for 10 million permutations. We then assessed significance by comparing the observed enrichment to the null distribution. We found that the enrichment at the Bonferroni corrected -log(p) threshold is indeed significant for Erysiphales (<italic>p</italic> = 0.016). We added this to the relevant methods section and the code to the github page.</p><p>In addition, many other genes very close (few kb max) to significant SNPs were not annotated with the “defense response” GO term but still had functions relatable to it. Some examples are <italic>CAR8</italic>, involved in ABA signalling, <italic>PBL7</italic> in stomata closure and <italic>SRF3</italic> in cell wall building and stress response (Fig 3D). This means that our enrichment is actually most likely underestimated compared to if we had a more complete functional annotation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- L247. Additional information is needed regarding sampling. It is not clear to me why methylation analyses are restricted to 20 samples, contrary to whole genome analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>The sampling is best described in the original paper (on natural DNA methylation variation; Galanti et al. 2022), although the most important parts are repeated in the first chapter of the methods.</p><p>Regarding methylation analysis, they are not restricted to 20 samples. Only the DMR calling was restricted to the 20 vs. 20 samples with the most divergent values (of pest loads) to identify regions of variation. This analysis was used to subset the genome to potential regions associated with pest presence rather than thoroughly testing actual methylation variants associated with pest presence. The latter was done in the second step, EWAS, which was based on the whole dataset with the exclusions of samples with high non-conversion rate. This left 188 samples for EWAS. We added this number in the new manuscript (L251 and L571).</p><p>To clarify, we made a few additions to the results (L250) and methods (last two subchapters) sections, where we explain the above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- No clear association with TEs: in L364: &quot;Erysiphales load was associated with hypomethylated Copia TEs upstream of MAPKKK20, a gene involved in ABA-mediated signaling and stomatal closure. Since stomatal closure is a known defense mechanism to block pathogen access (21), it is tempting to conclude that hypomethylation of the MAPKKK20 promoter might induce its overexpression and consequent stomatal closure, thereby preventing mildew access to the leaf blade. Overall, we found associations between pathogen load and TE methylation that could act both in cis (eg. Copia TE methylation in MAPKKK20 promoter) and in trans, possibly through transposon reactivation (eg. LINE, Helitron, and Ty3/Gypsi TEs isolated from genes).&quot; I find the whole discussion related to transposable elements, first, rather anecdotical, and second very speculative. To claim: &quot;Overall, we found associations between pathogen load and TE methylation&quot;, I believe a more detailed analysis is needed. For instance, how often there is an association? In general, there are some rather anecdotical examples, several of which are presented as association with pathogen load on the basis of being &quot;in proximity&quot; to a particular region/pick. The same regions contain multiple other genes and annotations, but the authors limit the discussion to the particular gene or TE concordant with the hypothesis. This is for both the discussion and results sections.</p></disp-quote><p>Here we are referring to associations in a purely statistical sense. The fact that “Overall, we found associations between pathogen load and TE methylation” is simply a conclusion drawn from Fig. 4b, without implying any causality. Some methylation variants are statistically associated with the traits (aphid or mildew loads), and whether they are true positives or causal is of course more difficult to assess.</p><p>Regarding the methylation variants associated with mildew load in proximity of <italic>MAPKKK20</italic>, those are the only two significant ones, located close to each other and close to many other variants that, although not significant, have low <italic>P</italic>-values (Author response image 2 below), so it is the most obvious association warranting further exploration. The reviewer is correct that there are other genes flanking the large DMR that covers the TEs (Fig. 4D), but the DMR is downstream of these genes, so less likely to affect their transcription.</p><fig id="sa3fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-95510-sa3-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Regarding all other associations found with <italic>M. persicae</italic> load, we stated that these are not really reliable due to a skewed <italic>P</italic>-value distribution (L269, S5B Fig), but we think that for future reference it is still worth reporting the closeby genes and TEs.</p><p>We slightly changed the wording of the passage the reviewer is citing above to make it clearer that we are only offering potential explanations for the associations we observe with TE methylation, but by no means we state that TE reactivation is surely what is happening.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- One conclusion in the manuscript is that DMRs have been mostly the result of hypomethylation. This is shown for instance in supplementary Figure 4. However, no general statistic is shown of methylation distribution (not only restricted to DMRs). Was the ratio methylation over de-methylation proportional along the genome? Thus the finding in DMRs is out of the genome-wide distribution? Or on the contrary, the DMRs are just a random sampling of the global distribution. The same for different annotated regions. For instance, I would expect that in general coding regions would be less methylated (not restricted to DMRs).</p></disp-quote><p>Complete and exhaustive analyses of the methylomes were already published in the original manuscript (Galanti et al 2022). However, the variation among these methylomes is complex and influenced by multiple factors including genetic background and environment of origin, and talking about these things would have been beyond the scope of our paper. In this paper, we just took advantage of the existing methylome information to identify the few genomic regions that are consistently differentially methylated between samples with extreme values of pest loads. As for the GWAS, the phenotypes are only partially associated with population structure, so the 20 samples with the lowest and the 20 with the highest pathogen loads are not e.g. all Swedish vs. all German but they are a mixture, which allowed us to correct for population structure running EWAS with a mixed model that includes a genetic distance matrix.</p><p>In this study we called DMRs between two defined groups: samples with the lowest amounts of pathogen DNA (not-infected; the “control” group) vs. samples with the highest amounts of pathogens (infected or the “treatment” group), so we could define a directionality (“hyper vs. “hypo” methylation). However, this is not the case for population DMRs called between many different combinations of populations. This is why the hyper- and hypomethylated regions found here cannot be compared to the genome-wide averages, which are influenced by other factors than the pathogens. Even with relaxed thresholds we indeed found very few DMRs associated to pathogen presence here.</p><p>Specifically about coding regions, the reviewer is correct that they are less methylated, especially because <italic>T. arvense</italic> has largely lost gene body methylation (Nunn et al. 2021, Galanti et al. 2022), but this is unrelated and was discussed in the original publication (Galanti et al. 2022).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:- Figure 1B: it would be good to add also percentage values.</p></disp-quote><p>As the figure is already tightly packed, we rather keep it simple. As the chart gives a good impression of frequencies of different kingdoms, and the frequences of several relevant groups. Also, as explained in a previous answer, comparing different taxonomic groups could be imprecise (as opposed to comparing the same group between different samples), so exact percentages seem unnecessary. If needed, the exact percentages can still be calculated from S2 Table.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- L159: It is not clear to me what &quot;enemy variation&quot; is referring to here.</p></disp-quote><p>We are referring to variation in enemy densities (attack rates) in the field, that could potentially be carried over to the greenhouse to cause the patterns of infection we observed.
