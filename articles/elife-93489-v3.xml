simultaneously with budding and maturation. In these viruses, maturation is initiated by oligomerization of polyprotein precursors. In contrast, several retroviruses, such as Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (M-PMV), assemble in the cytoplasm into immature particles that are transported across the PM. Therefore, protease activation and specific cleavage must not occur until the pre-assembled particle interacts with the PM. This interaction is triggered by a bipartite signal consisting of a cluster of basic residues in the matrix (MA) domain of Gag polyprotein and a myristoyl moiety N-terminally attached to MA. Here, we provide evidence that myristoyl exposure from the MA core and its insertion into the PM occurs in M-PMV. By a combination of experimental methods, we show that this results in a structural change at the C-terminus of MA allowing efficient cleavage of MA from the downstream region of Gag. This suggests that, in addition to the known effect of the myristoyl switch of HIV-1 MA on the multimerization state of Gag and particle assembly, the myristoyl switch may have a regulatory role in initiating sequential cleavage of M-PMV Gag in immature particles.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>myristoyl switch</kwd><kwd>betaretrovirus</kwd><kwd>matrix protein</kwd><kwd>protease</kwd><kwd>maturation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Viruses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Grant agency of the Czech Republic</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>22-19250S</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ruml</surname><given-names>Tomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Union - Next Generation EU</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Programme EXCELES, ID Project No. LX22NPO5103</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ruml</surname><given-names>Tomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Biochemical and instrumental analysis showed that the membrane-induced exposure of myristoyl from the MA protein of Mason-Pfizer monkey virus triggers allosteric conformational changes resulting in MA oligomerization and unfolding of the cleavage site between MA and downstream domains of Gag.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Interaction with the plasma membrane (PM), budding, and maturation of viral particles are the final steps in retroviral replication cycles. In most retroviruses, the Gag–PM interaction is mediated by a bipartite motif consisting of a highly basic region and the N-terminal myristoyl (myr) moiety of MA. Despite similarities in the main mechanisms of viral capsid assembly and membrane targeting, there are remarkable morphogenetic differences between retroviruses. One significant difference lies in the location of the assembly sites; these are located at the PM for C-type retroviruses such as HIV and in the cytoplasm for D-type retroviruses, such as Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (M-PMV). The pre-assembled intracytoplasmic viral particles (ICAPs) of D-type retroviruses are then transported to the PM for budding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rhee and Hunter, 1990</xref>).</p><p>Retroviral MA proteins are the key players in targeting Gag to the PM. HIV-1 MA is myristoylated and exists in two conformational states dictated by its location. In the cytoplasm, the myristoyl (myr) moiety is sequestered inside the hydrophobic pocket of MA. Upon Gag interaction with the PM, myr is expelled from the MA molecule and inserted into the lipid bilayer by the so-called myr switch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tang et al., 2004</xref>). In HIV-1, the myr exposure is triggered by the interaction of the MA domain of Gag with phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>], which is present exclusively in the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ono et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Saad et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tang et al., 2004</xref>). The equilibrium between exposed and sequestered myr states in HIV-1 MA is concentration and oligomerization dependent, in contrast to myristoylated HIV-2 MA, which is exclusively monomeric in vitro. This can be explained by the tighter sequestration of the myr chain within the protein core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Saad et al., 2008</xref>). In D-type retrovirus M-PMV, MA myristoylation is also essential for the targeting of immature particles to the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rhee and Hunter, 1991</xref>), but with a significantly lower affinity for water-soluble PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> compared to HIV-1 MA. In addition, the interaction with this PM component fails to induce the myristoyl switch in purified M-PMV (myr+)MA in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kroupa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Prchal et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>After the interaction of Gag or pre-assembled viral particles with the PM and budding, maturation occurs. The proteolytic maturation involves a delicately regulated sequential processing of polyprotein precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Konvalinka et al., 2015</xref>). The importance of sequential cleavage of HIV-1 Gag to liberate the mature structural proteins matrix (MA), capsid (CA), nucleocapsid (NC), and p6 and the spacer peptides SP1 and SP2 has been recognized for decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Erickson-Viitanen et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Pettit et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tritch et al., 1991</xref>). However, our understanding of how this coordinated event is regulated remains incomplete.</p><p>Recently, the challenge of analyzing a population of viruses in heterogeneous life cycle phases was overcome with an approach using a photo-destructible HIV protease inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schimer et al., 2015</xref>). This allowed synchronization of the immature virus particles and triggering of polyprotein processing with light. However, it also uncoupled maturation from assembly, preventing study of the interplay between these processes and the impact of Gag–membrane interactions on proteolytic cleavage. Recently, experiments using nanoscale flow cytometry and instant structured illumination microscopy demonstrated that activation of HIV-1 protease occurs during viral assembly prior to release of the virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tabler et al., 2022</xref>). However, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy and single-virus tracking revealed that there is a delay between HIV-1 particle assembly and maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Qian et al., 2022</xref>). The importance of precise regulation of maturation was demonstrated by overexpression of HIV-1 protease which, in addition to its cytotoxic effects, prevented HIV-1 particle formation and budding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Karacostas et al., 1993</xref>). Similar effect was also shown for Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) where premature proteolytic processing also lead to budding defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xiang et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>In vitro data suggested that initial cleavage of HIV-1 Gag occurs at the SP1/NC site, followed by cleavage at the SP2/p6 and MA/CA sites, and finally at the NC/SP2 and CA/SP1 sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Pettit et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wiegers et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wondrak et al., 1993</xref>). Researchers observed a similar pattern of ordered processing in infected cells by using mutants in which individual cleavage sites were disrupted by point mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wiegers et al., 1998</xref>). These data led to the conclusion that the cleavage events at individual sites occur with different kinetics. The initial fast cleavage at the C terminus of SP1, releasing NC, allows condensation of the ribonucleoprotein core. Next, CA is liberated from the MA, and finally, the release of SP1 from CA initiates capsid condensation and core formation. Interestingly, even a small proportion of uncleaved Gag has a dominant negative effect on HIV-1 infectivity, as shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Müller et al., 2009</xref>. Blocking cleavage of MA/CA site had the most pronounced impact, exhibiting a transdominant negative effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lee et al., 2009</xref>). Both MA–CA and MA–CA–SP1 maturation products accumulated in cells when the MA/CA cleavage site was blocked by point mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">de Marco et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mattei et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Müller et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, in murine leukemia virus, partially cleaved Gag interferes with infectivity when present at equimolar concentrations with the mature proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rulli et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In M-PMV, the protease domain of Gag-Pro and Gag-Pro-Pol polyproteins can theoretically dimerize in ICAPs, however, processing is not initiated until the particles reach the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Parker and Hunter, 2001</xref>). Thus, the maturation of D-type retroviruses must be tightly regulated and the mere Pro dimerization is probably not sufficient for effective ICAP maturation. In vitro analysis of the proteolytic processing of intracytoplasmic M-PMV particles also suggested a sequential manner of Gag maturation. However, the first protein domain released by M-PMV protease from Gag was MA, with a 10-fold greater affinity for the MA/PP cleavage site than other Gag cleavage sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pichová et al., 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Parker and Hunter, 2001</xref> observed similar cleavage kinetics for M-PMV MA/PP and PP/p12 cleavage sites in COS-1 cells. This is in contrast with data on HIV-1, for which initial cleavage occurs at SP1/NC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wiegers et al., 1998</xref>), and RSV, for which in vivo studies showed that the MA–p2 junction is the most slowly cleaved site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xiang et al., 1997</xref>). This was supported by in vitro cleavage of peptides mimicking the cleavage sites in RSV Gag, in which both the MA–p2 and p2–p10 junctions were cleaved very inefficiently compared to the other sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cameron et al., 1992</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the HIV-1 (myr+)MA V7R mutant, in which myr is sequestered in the MA core, was shown to be defective in Gag processing in HeLa and 293T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hikichi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ono and Freed, 1999</xref>). This was confirmed in CD4(+) T cells, which are the natural target cells of HIV-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lee et al., 1998</xref>). In M-PMV, the possible role of MA myristoylation in maturation was also suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Prchal et al., 2011</xref>). Even though M-PMV MAPP (matrix-phosphoprotein) (MA C-terminally extended with part of the downstream phosphoprotein [PP] domain of M-PMV Gag) can be cleaved efficiently by M-PMV protease in vitro, the N-terminally myristoylated MAPP [(myr+)MAPP] is cleaved very poorly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Prchal et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, the NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) solution structure of myristoylated MAPP showed a short alpha helix spanning the position of the MA/PP cleavage site that is closely associated with the myristoyl moiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Prchal et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Data presented in this study indicate that the interaction of M-PMV Gag with the PM can significantly enhance both trimerization and cleavage of MA from the rest of Gag, suggesting it may serve as an additional mechanism for maturation control. More broadly, we demonstrate that the interaction of the N-terminal myristoyl with the PM can be projected to the C-terminal region of MA to increase the availability of the domain for downstream processes such as proteolytic cleavage.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Interaction of M-PMV (myr+)MAPP with liposomes triggers MA myristoyl switch and subsequent proteolytic processing at the MA/PP junction</title><p>M-PMV maturation occurs upon the interaction of M-PMV ICAPs with the PM during and after buddin-g. However, as we have already shown, the myristoylated M-PMV MA extended with 18 amino acid residues from the downstream PP domain of Gag and a His-tag anchor [ (myr+)MAPP] is cleaved very poorly by M-PMV protease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Prchal et al., 2011</xref>). The mechanism that could trigger proteolytic processing of membrane-bound myristoylated Gag is the exposure of myristoyl from the hydrophobic pocket of MA, the myristoyl switch. Therefore, we sought to confirm that interaction with liposomes enables cleavage at the MA/PP junction in (myr+)MAPP. We compared the efficiency of cleavage of both M-PMV (myr−)MAPP and (myr+)MAPP bound to liposomes mimicking the phospholipid composition of the PM inner leaflet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Doktorova et al., 2017</xref>). As previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Prchal et al., 2011</xref>), in the absence of liposomes, (myr−)MAPP was quickly cleaved by M-PMV protease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), but cleavage of (myr+)MAPP was significantly delayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Our new data reveal that binding of (myr+)MAPP to liposomes significantly enhances the cleavage kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Therefore, we propose that the interaction of (myr+)MAPP with liposomes triggers the myristoyl switch that subsequently enables efficient cleavage at the MA/PP junction of M-PMV (myr+)Gag.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>MAPP cleavage by Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (M-PMV) protease.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) (myr−)MAPP, (<bold>B</bold>) (myr+)MAPP, (<bold>C</bold>) ‘myrOUT’ mutant (myr+)MAPP I51A, and (<bold>D</bold>) ‘myrIN’ mutant (myr+)MAPP A79V were cleaved by M-PMV protease in the absence or presence of liposomes mimicking the plasma membrane (PM) inner leaflet.

To design the ‘myrOUT’ mutant, we identified large hydrophobic amino acid residue I51 which is in direct contact with the myristoyl in M-PMV (myr+)MAPP (9) and substituted it with alanine (I51A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). For the ‘myrIN’ mutant, we introduced the A79V mutation previously suggested to affect myristate accessibility in M-PMV (myr+)MA (36) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). None of these mutations lie near the cleavage site of the MA/PP junction, to exclude the possibility of its direct structural alteration. We also measured HN-HSQC spectra of both (myr+)MAPP mutant proteins and compared them with the WT spectrum. We observed bigger chemical shift changes only for the signals of residues in proximity of the mutation which proves that neither mutation has altered the overall fold of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Here, we show that ‘myrOUT’ (myr+)MAPP mutant was cleaved more efficiently than WT (myr+)MAPP (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref>), but less efficiently than the WT (myr−)MAPP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), that fully mimics the ‘myrOUT’ conformation. The effect of the ‘myrIN’ substitution in (myr+)MAPP was apparent only upon interaction with liposomes, when preventing the switch should reduce cleavage efficiency compared to the WT (myr+)MAPP. As expected, in the absence of liposomes, both the ‘myrIN’ mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and WT (myr+)MAPP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) were cleaved poorly. More importantly, in the presence of liposomes, the cleavage of ‘myrIN’ mutant was slower than that of WT (myr+)MAPP (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and B</xref>). These results show that the myristoyl switch enables cleavage of (myr+)MAPP by M-PMV protease and the sequestered myristoyl delays the cleavage.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Liposome interaction and myristoyl switch induce (myr+)MAPP oligomerization</title><p>Based on the known structure of the M-PMV (myr−)MA trimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vlach et al., 2009</xref>), we designed a mutant allowing covalent cross-linking of monomers to enrich transiently formed MA trimers. We used an approach similar to that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tedbury et al., 2016</xref> for HIV-1 MA. They introduced cysteines at positions G62 and S66 of HIV-1 MA, allowing spontaneous disulfide bridge formation between MA molecules. Accordingly, we replaced threonine at position 69 of M-PMV MAPP with a cysteine residue for trimer stabilization. In the M-PMV (myr−)MA trimer, T69 is located directly opposite C62 from the neighboring MA monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

This hypothesis was based on previous results showing that non-myristoylated MA, in contrast to the myristoylated version, is efficiently cleaved from its downstream sequence in M-PMV Gag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Prchal et al., 2011</xref>). Our basic assumption was that myristoylated M-PMV MA achieves a conformation similar to that of non-myristoylated MA upon the exposure of myristoyl from the MA during the interaction with the PM.</p><p>There is a logical basis for proteolytic release of MA from M-PMV Gag to be driven by a myristoyl switch at PM. In D-type retroviruses, pre-assembled ICAPs consisting of N-terminally myristoylated Gag must travel to the PM. Premature intracytoplasmic cleavage of (myr+)MA from Gag or its myristoylation defect would prevent transport of ICAPs to the PM. This was documented by Rhee and Hunter, who showed that mutant non-myristoylated M-PMV particles failed to reach the PM and accumulated in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rhee and Hunter, 1987</xref>).</p><p>Unlike in HIV-1, in M-PMV the MA myristoyl switch has not been proved. In HIV-1, the myr exposure is triggered by the interaction of the MA with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ono et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Saad et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tang et al., 2004</xref>) and the equilibrium between exposed and sequestered myr states in HIV-1 MA is also concentration dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Saad et al., 2008</xref>). Recently, it has been shown that upon interaction with the PM, MA induces the insertion of a single PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> acyl chain into the lipid-binding pocket of MA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Qu et al., 2021</xref>). However M-PMV MA has significantly lower affinity for water-soluble PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and the interaction with this PM component fails to induce the myristoyl switch in purified M-PMV (myr+)MA in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kroupa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Prchal et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>To prove the myristoyl switch in M-PMV MA and show its possible role in the proteolytic cleavage at MA/PP junction in vitro, we tried to simulate the in vivo situation, by interacting M-PMV MAPP with liposomes mimicking the composition of an inner leaflet of the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Doktorova et al., 2017</xref>). And indeed, we have shown that the interaction of M-PMV (myr+)MAPP with liposomes enabled efficient cleavage of M-PMV (myr+)MA from the downstream PP domain of Gag, probably due to the induced myristoyl switch in (myr+)MAPP. The role of the myristoyl switch itself, rather than the overall interaction of (myr+)MAPP with liposomes, on (myr+)MAPP cleavage was demonstrated using the ‘myrOUT’ mutant, where the isoleucine residue at position 51, which is in direct contact with myristoyl in the M-PMV (myr+)MAPP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Prchal et al., 2012</xref>), was substituted by alanine (I51A). This amino acid substitution should facilitate myristoyl release by reducing the hydrophobicity of the protein core. The ‘myrOUT’ (myr+)MAPP I51A mutant was cleaved more efficiently than WT (myr+)MAPP, but less efficiently than the WT (myr−)MAPP, that fully mimics the ‘myrOUT’ conformation, confirming the impact of the myristoyl switch on the cleavage. Furthermore, the role of interaction of (myr+)MAPP with liposomes in (myr+)MAPP myristoyl switch was confirmed using the ‘myrIN’ mutant, which carries the A79V substitution known to impact myristate accessibility in M-PMV (myr+)MA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Conte et al., 1997</xref>). In the presence of liposomes, the (myr+)MAPP A79V mutant was cleaved more slowly than the WT (myr+)MAPP. This indicates that the interaction of (myr+)MAPP with liposomes activates the myristoyl switch in (myr+)MAPP, allowing for subsequent cleavage.</p><p>We used HDX-MS to confirm differences in accessibility of the MA/PP junction in (myr+) MAPP and (myrr−)MAPP. HDX is a valuable method for probing protein conformation and dynamics without perturbation. This technique utilizes MS to monitor the time-dependent incorporation of deuterium into solvent-accessible backbone amide hydrogens of peptides. Rapid exchange rates of these amide hydrogens suggest flexibility in the surrounding region, whereas slower exchange rates indicate a relatively rigid conformation. Consequently, these exchange rates provide insights into the protein conformation. Although, due to the technical limitations, the data were collected in the absence of membrane, the comparison of the (myr+)MAPP, (myrr−)MAPP, and the mutants reflects the membrane bound and unbound states of the proteins. The only evidence of possible transition between the two conformational states (myrIN and myrOUT) was observed by HDX-MS for I51A mutant. Destabilization of hydrophobic core shifts this mutant phenotypically closer the (myr−)MAPP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, peptides 90–102 and 101–108) mimicking the membrane-bound (myr+)MAPP with exposed myristoyl. HDX-MS data showed that the absence of the N-terminal myristoyl in the binding pocket destabilizes the otherwise alpha-helical secondary structure in the K92-L110 region of (myr+)MAPP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Prchal et al., 2012</xref>), which makes the protease cleavage site more accessible. The effect of the myristoyl switch was further confirmed by analysis of cleavage of (myr+)MAPP protein carrying amino acid substitution I51A. This ‘myrOUT’ mutant was cleaved more efficiently than WT(myr+)MAPP. HDX-MS analysis documented changes in the region spanning residues 89–110 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>), most prominent in the peptides 90–102 and 101–108 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In contrast, the ‘myrIN’ A79V (myr+)MAPP mutant with tightly sequestered myristoyl group was cleaved less efficiently in the presence of liposomes compared to WT. The tightly sequestered myristoyl hindered the myristoyl switch in liposome-bound ‘myrIN’ mutant, slowing the cleavage. Results of HDX-MS analysis also showed a similar, pattern of slowly increasing deuterium exchange rate for 89–110 regions in the ‘myrIN’ mutant and WT (myr+)MAPP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In both the ‘myrIN’ mutant and WT (myr+)MAPP, the plateau of deuteration for peptides 90–102 and 101–108 was achieved only after an extended period of 20 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, peptides 90–102), or after 120 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, peptides 101–108). Similarly, the well-cleaved ‘myrOUT’ mutant was almost deuterium saturated after only 2 s and showed no significant evolution after that, suggesting that the region spanned by peptides 90–102 and 101–108 is highly dynamic and thus accessible for deuterium exchange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The fast HDX kinetics of ‘myrOUT’ mutant corresponds with its higher susceptibility to proteolytic cleavage compared to WT (myr+)MAPP and ‘myrIN’ mutant. The differences in dynamics reflecting protease cleavage site accessibility could be monitored for up to 5 s with a dramatic difference in the first 2 s. These results support our data suggesting that the sequestered myristoyl participates in the mechanism preventing proteolytic separation of MA from the rest of Gag prior to its interaction with the PM.</p><p>Analysis of the secondary structure parameter estimation suggested that the region spanning amino acid residues 98–103 in (myr−)MAPP is unstructured and lacks any periodic secondary structure. In contrast, the region spanning these residues in (myr+)MAPP is ordered into the terminal fifth alpha helix of MA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Prchal et al., 2012</xref>). Residue 98 directly interacts with the myristoyl moiety, and residues 101 and 102 with the loop connecting helices II and III. The conformation of this loop differs depending on the myristoylation state of MA, as the loop is directly involved in the formation of the myristoyl-holding cavity. Thus, the switch can lead to a large conformational change in this region and destabilize the helix, resulting in exposure of the MA/PP cleavage site. This indicates that the interaction of the MA domain of M-PMV Gag with the PM, triggering the myristoyl switch, may be an important regulatory element in the Gag processing of D-type retroviruses. The MA-embedded myr could prevent premature cleavage of (myr+)MA from the downstream portion of Gag during transport of immature particles to the PM. Some premature cleavage was suggested by previously observed intracytoplasmic protease activation in transfected cell lysates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rhee and Hunter, 1990</xref>). However, it remains unclear whether this cleavage occurred in the cytosol or upon the interaction of immature particles with the PM and MA myristoyl switch.</p><p>In type C retroviruses, the myristoyl switch promotes Gag anchoring in the PM and thus final steps of particle formation, budding, and maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hermida-Matsumoto and Resh, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Spearman et al., 1997</xref>).

However, in vitro experiments with immature particles from COS-1 cells showed that the reducing agent induces activation of the M-PMV protease to form MA, PP, and CA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Parker and Hunter, 2001</xref>). The same authors observed that the M-PMV MA was separated from the rest of Gag in the absence of membranes very inefficiently, aligning with the sequestration of myristoyl in MA. However, the (myr+)MA/PP junction was cleaved more readily compared to other processing sites.</p><p>In addition to aiding Gag processing, myristoyl exposure at the PM modulated the oligomerization of M-PMV MA. Although tertiary structures of MA proteins are very similar across retroviruses, they vary in their primary structures and surface features, including the surface distribution of hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues. In HIV-1, (myr+)MA occurs in a momomer–trimer equilibrium, with the myristoyl sequestered in the monomer and exposed in the trimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tang et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, MA trimers in HIV-1 particles have been observed in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tedbury et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, structurally similar HIV-2 MA is monomeric in both its myristoylated and non-myristoylated forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Saad et al., 2008</xref>). M-PMV significantly differs from the C-type retroviruses in the MA interaction with membrane components, Gag organization and particle assembly. Some of these properties preclude the use of full-length M-PMV Gag for structural and some functional studies. The obstacles are related to the fact that M-PMV Gag assembles into immature particles in vitro in the absence of membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Klikova et al., 1995</xref>), but HDX and NMR methods are not suitable for working with pre-assembled particles. A possible method for obtaining relevant structural data would be cryo-EM, which was used to obtain the high-resolution lattice structure of MA HIV-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Qu et al., 2021</xref>). However, unlike the distinctive hexagonal lattice formed by HIV-1 MA trimers, the M-PMV MA layer lacks any observable ordered structure (James Stacey, personal communication). This confirms lower oligomerization capacity of M-PMV MA compared to HIV-1 MA. Given the above, the MA–PP fusion protein appears to be the best available model mimicking M-PMV. We also hypothesize that within the overall context of Gag, M-PMV MA retains significantly higher structural flexibility compared to HIV-1 MA. This is because HIV-1 MA is separated from the rigid CA Gag domain layer solely by relatively short flexible linker, in contrast to M-PMV MA which is separated from CA domain by two protein domains, PP and p12.</p><p>As mentioned above, unlike HIV-1 (myr+)MA, M-PMV (myr+)MAPP does not oligomerize in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Prchal et al., 2012</xref>) and (myr−)MA exists in a monomer–dimer–trimer equilibrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Srb et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vlach et al., 2009</xref>). These findings along with our cleavage experiments, justifies the hypothesis that the myristoyl switch converting M-PMV (myr+)MA into (myr−)MA-like conformation promotes its oligomerization. This suggests that the presence of the myristoyl in the hydrophobic cavity of (myr+)MA affects the hydrophobic interactions occurring at the oligomerization interfaces of the monomers. This was confirmed by using the T69C mutant with stabilized (myr+)MAPP oligomers through disulfide bridges. In the absence of liposomes, we observed only the monomeric fraction, but in their presence, we also observed dimers, trimers, and even tetramers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Our previous research indicated that (myr−)MA at the same concentration primarily forms dimers and some trimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Prchal et al., 2012</xref>). In the T69C trimer, C69 is located directly opposite C62 from the second monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Dimers are likely stabilized by disulfide bridges between C62 residues and in the T69C mutant also by two disulfide bridges between C42 and C69 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We also observed tetramers, which we believe are two non-specifically cross-linked dimers.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Structure of (myr−)MA wild-type dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vlach et al., 2009</xref>).</title><p>Previously published ribbon structure of (myr−)MA wild-type dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vlach et al., 2009</xref>) showing positions of residues T69 (in red), C62 (in yelow), and C42 (in orange).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-93489-fig5-v3.tif"/></fig><p>Our findings reveal that the PM interaction induces myristoyl exposure from the hydrophobic core of M-PMV MA. The myristoyl switch then supports both proteolytic separation of MA from the downstream part of Gag and MA oligomerization. Broadly, these results suggest that similar mechanisms of functional modulation may occur in domains of other myristoylated proteins. For example, recoverin and calcium- and integrin-binding protein 2 exploit a myristoyl switch to modulate calcium binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ames et al., 1997</xref>). Thus, myristoyl exposure-triggered structural changes may have more general validity and may play various regulatory roles in other N-terminally myristoylated proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Vectors</title><p>All mutations in the vector pET22bMAPPHis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Prchal et al., 2011</xref>) were introduced using Efficient Mutagenesis Independent of Ligation (EMILI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Füzik et al., 2014</xref>).

a D-type retrovirus is activated and in particular how the exposure of the myristoyl group is required for processing of the Gag matrix precursor. The supporting evidence is convincing and suggests that M-PMV proteolytic maturation is triggered by a myristyl switch that occurs when the matrix (MA) domain of Gag interacts with the PM.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Miles Davenport as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All recommendations by reviewers #1 and #2.</p><p>2) With regards to reviewer #3, the most important revision is: &quot;The authors can show the specificity of the oligomerization reaction by moving the cysteine to other surface locations and testing whether other locations would also support oligomer formation. Since the diffusion of the MA on the liposome is 2D, it is possible that oligomers would form with almost any surface interactions, which would be informative. Regarding the authors extrapolation of the observed allosteric interaction within monomers in solution, to the fully assembled particles interacting with membrane, I think all they have to do is discuss it. Comparison to recent MA maturation in HIV-1 observed by CryoEM would be nice to add. &quot;</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Figure 1.

Similarly, in Figure 4, no explanation is provided about what is being shown and what the Talos+ software does.

The evidence of oligomerization is very limited with no controls aside from the non-reducing conditions. Please provide more direct evidence of this claim by making more controls.</p><p>3. There is no evidence presented that shows the proposed conformational changes in the matrix actually happen during interaction of the fully assembled particle by the plasma membrane.

Some of these properties preclude the use of full-length M-PMV Gag for structural and some functional studies. The obstacles are related to the fact that M-PMV Gag assembles into immature particles in vitro in the absence of membranes (Klikova et al., 1995), but HDX and NMR methods are not suitable for working with pre-assembled particles. A possible method for obtaining relevant structural data would be cryo-EM, which was used to obtain the high-resolution lattice structure of MA HIV-1 (Qu et al., 2021). However, unlike the distinctive hexagonal lattice formed by HIV-1 MA trimers, the M-PMV MA layer lacks any observable ordered structure (James Stacey, personal communication). This confirms lower oligomerization capacity of M-PMV MA compared to HIV-1 MA. Given the above, the MA-PP fusion protein appears to be the best available model mimicking M-PMV. We also hypothesize that within the overall context of Gag, M-PMV MA retains significantly higher structural flexibility compared to HIV-1 MA. This is because HIV-1 MA is separated from the rigid CA Gag domain layer solely by relatively short flexible linker, in contrast to M-PMV MA which is separated from CA domain by two protein domains, PP and p12.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

This technique utilizes mass spectrometry (MS) to monitor the time-dependent incorporation of deuterium into solvent-accessible backbone amide hydrogens of peptides. Rapid exchange rates of these amide hydrogens suggest flexibility in the surrounding region, whereas slower exchange rates indicate a relatively rigid conformation. Consequently, these exchange rates provide insights into the protein conformation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.
