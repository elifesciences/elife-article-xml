health, its biological mechanism for inducing lung cancer remains unclear. Here, by investigating FPM’s bioactivities in lung carcinoma mice models, we discover that these particles promote lung tumor progression by inducing aberrant thickening of tissue matrix and hampering migration of antitumor immunocytes. Upon inhalation into lung tissue, these FPM particles abundantly adsorb peroxidasin (PXDN) – an enzyme mediating type IV collagen (Col IV) crosslinking – onto their surface. The adsorbed PXDN exerts abnormally high activity to crosslink Col IV via increasing the formation of sulfilimine bonds at the NC1 domain, leading to an overly dense matrix in the lung tissue. This disordered structure decreases the mobility of cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes into the lung and consequently impairs the local immune surveillance, enabling the flourishing of nascent tumor cells. Meanwhile, inhibiting the activity of PXDN abolishes the tumor-promoting effect of FPM, indicating the key impact of aberrant PXDN activity on the tumorigenic process. In summary, our finding elucidates a new mechanism for FPM-induced lung tumorigenesis and identifies PXDN as a potential target for treatment or prevention of the FPM-relevant biological risks.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>inhaled fine particulate matter</kwd><kwd>cancer immunosurveillance</kwd><kwd>migration of immune cells</kwd><kwd>collagen crosslinking</kwd><kwd>lung tumorigenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31971309</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dong</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32001069</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Zhenzhen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81973273</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Junfeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004608</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BK20200318</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Zhenzhen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006469</institution-id><institution>Fundo para o Desenvolvimento das Ciências e da Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FDCT 0018/2019/AFJ 0060/2020/AGJ</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Chunming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004733</institution-id><institution>Universidade de Macau</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MYRG2020-00084-ICMS</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Chunming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>the funds for the International Cooperation and Exchange 31961160701</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dong</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008048</institution-id><institution>Nanjing University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities 020814380115</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dong</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Inhaled fine particulate matters impair immune defense to accelerate tumorigenesis by pulling the strings of interstitial collagen in lung tissue.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Inhalable fine particulate matter (FPM) with a diameter less than 1 μm in air pollutants and tobacco smoke has been recognized as a group 1 carcinogen and substantial threat to global health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lim et al., 2012</xref>). About 10 μg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in its concentration was correlated with an 8% rise in lung cancer mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guan et al., 2016</xref>). However, its carcinogenic mechanism remains unclear. During lung tumorigenesis, both the growth of cancer cells per se and the supporting microenvironment are crucial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martin et al., 2021</xref>). Earlier studies propose that the particles directly induce gene mutations and carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wu et al., 2004</xref>). Clinical data suggests smoking as the factor for the highest prevalence of somatic mutation among lung cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexandrov et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexandrov et al., 2013</xref>). However, despite its mutagenic potential, recent investigations reveal that FPM does not directly promote (and even inhibit) the proliferation of lung cancer cells. These inconsistent findings suggest that FPM might have unidentified targets other than cancer cells in promoting tumorigenesis, such as immune cells that play key roles in tumor development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bissell and Hines, 2011</xref>). Under normal circumstances, the immune system rapidly detects and suppresses the tumor progression at the initial stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Iwasaki et al., 2017</xref>). Especially, the mostly ‘informed’ defender immunocyte – cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes (CTLs) – protect against potential cancer through efficient migration and cytotoxic contact with transformed or tumorigenic cells that have emerged in the lung interstitial space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">DuPage et al., 2011</xref>). Once this crucial immunosurveillance and defense process of CTLs were compromised, the tumorigenesis would be uncontrollable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Joyce and Fearon, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Under the chemotaxis of biochemical signals, the mobility of immunocytes depends on not only its intrinsic capacity but also the microstructure of the interstitial extracellular matrix (ECM), that is, the way paved for immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krummel et al., 2016</xref>). For the former, evidence about the direct effect of FPM on the immune cell’s migration capacity was validated. It is estimated that tobacco smoke particulates (TSPs) could impair the migration function of macrophages to mycobacteria and lead to increased susceptibility to tuberculosis in smokers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berg et al., 2016</xref>). For the latter, clinical evidence links a dense collagen matrix surrounding the tumor with the restriction of T cells’ access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Salmon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Valkenburg et al., 2018</xref>). Based on these reports and analysis, we speculated that FPM could disturb the migration and distribution of T cells in lung tissue, thus impairing CLTs’ immune defense capacity against cancerous cells and consequently promoting tumor progression.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we set out to study the effect of FPM inhalation on CTLs’ immune response and tumor development by using both transplantation (Lewis lung carcinoma [LLC]) and transgenic (<italic>Kras<sup>G12D</sup>Trp53<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) mouse models of lung carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Johnson et al., 2001</xref>). First, we validated that FPM promotes tumorigenesis by impairing CTLs’ migration towards cancerous cells. The defect was attributed to denser collagen structure induced by FPM on CTLs’ migration path, generating the physical isolation around tumor cells. More interestingly, we found that FPM exerts this effect by adsorbing peroxidasin (PXDN) – a crucial enzyme specifically mediating collagen crosslinking at NC1 domain – and increasing this enzyme’s activity to over-crosslink ECM and prevent CTLs migration, which eventually tolerates tumor progression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>FPM promotes lung cancer development by hampering CTLs’ migration</title><p>To analyze the effect of FPM on lung tumorigenesis, first, we collected and prepared particulate matter in air pollutants with diameter &lt;1 μm (PM1) from seven locations in China and the tobacco smoke particle (TSP), respectively. Given that these particles displayed diverse morphology and physicochemical characteristic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), which is consistent with the material property of particles in other reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kelly and Fussell, 2012</xref>), we mixed PM1 with the equal proportion from each collection to eliminate the interference of sampling resources. Then, mice exposed to mixed PM1 (mixture) or TSP were analyzed on two cancer animal models: the syngeneic LLC inoculation model (LLC model) or the transgenic mouse model (<italic>Kras<sup>G12D</sup>Trp53<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>. Gross view (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>) and histological hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) indicated that the FPM treatment markedly increased the tumors’ multiplicity and progression. As <italic>Kras<sup>G12D</sup>Trp53<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice could generate multifocal tumors corresponding to different grades of lung carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sayin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">DuPage et al., 2009</xref>), the histological grade of this model was further analyzed. Tumors in FPM-exposed lung tissue were mainly classified as grade II and the ones of grade III and IV were significantly higher, whereas the majority of tumors in the phosphate buffer saline (PBS) group were of grade I, showing FPM leads to more advanced lung tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Statistical analysis suggested that the number of tumors in the FPM-treated group was significantly higher than that in the PBS group (about three- to fivefold higher in LLC model and twofold higher in <italic>Kras<sup>G12D</sup>Trp53<sup>-/-</sup></italic> model) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Furthermore, the scenario was further validated by the corresponding tumor burden, based on the percentage of the area of tumor regions versus that of the total lung (about 7-fold more in LLC model and 10-fold more in <italic>Kras<sup>G12D</sup>Trp53<sup>-/-</sup></italic> model). Moreover, in both models, PM1 and TSP exposure significantly shortened the survival of mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These results validated the correlation between FPM exposure and lung cancer development, in agreement with the epidemiological studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Atkinson et al., 2014</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Fine particulate matter (FPM) accelerated lung tumorigenesis by inhibiting cytotoxic T cell lymphocyte (CTL) infiltration.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining images of different model 20 or 50 days after FPM-exposed mice were stimulated with LLC or Cre-inducible adenovirus (AdCre).

The conditions of the seeds and soil – the uncontrollably proliferative cancer cells and a tolerable immune microenvironment – are both crucial for tumor development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Altorki et al., 2019</xref>). We analyzed the effect of FPM on the tumor cells and their congenial microenvironment, respectively. Interestingly, FPM hardly promoted the growth of tumor cells and even inhibited their proliferation at higher concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). EdU incorporation assay was further employed to determine the impact of FPM exposure on tumor cells’ proliferation in vivo. The result showed that the tumor site displayed similar replication capacity regardless of its size and advancement in these groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), casting the doubt on FPM’s direct promotion of tumor growth. These results inspired us to assess the effect of FPM on the immune microenvironment. Among these immunocytes related to immune surveillance, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) as the most ‘‘informed’’ defender are critical for locally extinguishing the nascent tumor. The efficacy of these cells determines the fate of transformed cells – to death or flourish. Thus, we examined the change of CTLs’ response in different groups during tumor progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). In the LLC model, CTLs in the PBS group were efficiently recruited into lung tissue to defend LLC stimulation, increasing up to about ninefold than that under the physiological condition at the initial stage (1–3 days). Conversely, the lung tissue with FPM exposure displayed blunt and insufficient early immune defense, with slight CTLs infiltration, decreasing by more than 60% relative to that of the PBS group, though there was no dramatic difference in CTLs accumulation among these groups at late stage (5–20 days). The immunofluorescence (IF) images also showed that FPM-exposed lung tissue was infiltrated with lower CTLs at the initial stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>). These results indicated that the CTL’s early immune response might not be normal in FPM-exposed mice and be decisive for the lung tumorigenesis, which is consistent with the reports in transgenic autochthonous lung tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">DuPage et al., 2011</xref>). Then, we detected the CTLs’ infiltration in <italic>Kras<sup>G12D</sup>Trp53<sup>-/-</sup></italic> model 4 weeks after tumor initiation, during which the immune response was reported to reach to the peak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">DuPage et al., 2011</xref>). The results displayed similarly insufficient CTLs’ defense in the FPM-exposed group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>).</p><p>To further determine whether CTLs’ reaction was specific to tumor cells, we further evaluated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation in an OT-1 TCR transgenic mouse model, in which the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells express a T cell receptor recognizing the SIINFEKL peptide of ovalbumin (OVA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Upon the stimulation of OVA-expressing LLC (OVA-LLC) cells, the flow cytometry analysis of activated CTLs in lung tissue showed consistent tendency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8</xref>). OVA-LLC-specific immunity response in lung tissue was also tested by interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISpot) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). The result further demonstrated that the antigen-specific-activated CTLs were significantly impaired by FPM exposure, decreasing to about 25% of that in the PBS group. Furthermore, to testify the indispensable role of CTLs on the tumor development, LLC cells were intravenously injected into FPM-exposed athymic <italic>Foxn1</italic><sup><italic>nu</italic></sup> nude mice with T cell deficiency. As expected, the difference of lung tumorigenesis in PBS and FPM-exposed groups was abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I and J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1—figure supplement 9</xref>), highlighting that the influences of FPM to tumor development were mediated by the CTLs. Additionally, without using tumor cells, we treated mice with a T cell chemokine – C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Griffith et al., 2014</xref>), or named as interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) – intrabronchially for 2 hr, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s10">Figure 1—figure supplement 10A</xref>, and found that the proportion of CTLs in FPM-treated mice (about 8%) significantly decreased compared with that of the PBS group (about 18%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s10">Figure 1—figure supplement 10B</xref>). This finding is consistent with the scenario observed in the tumor (LLC and <italic>Kras<sup>G12D</sup>Trp53<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) model and strengthens the conclusion that FPM exposure delays the CTLs’ instantaneous defense response. The above results, taken together, indicate that FPM accelerates lung tumorigenesis via impairing CTLs’ infiltration into the lung tissue.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>FPM hinders CTLs’ migration by crosslinking type IV collagen and thickening tissue matrix</title><p>Next, we explored the reason for the impaired early response of CTLs under FPM exposure. CTLs’ distribution in the lung interstitial tissue depends on its migration ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Weninger et al., 2014</xref>), which is related to both the intrinsic activity of cells and the structure of the interstitial space formed by the local ECM on its migrating path (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mrass et al., 2010</xref>). We analyzed which factor was mainly affected by FPM. First, T cells treated with FPM in vitro or the CTLs separated from FPM-exposed lung tissue were respectively analyzed. Integrin-1 (ITGB-1), C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR 3), and Rho-associated kinase (ROCKi) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Overstreet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tharaux et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ariotti et al., 2015</xref>), the biomarkers related to CTLs’ migration, were detected with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). These results showed that FPM stimulation had little effect on the migration potential of CTLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Second, we analyzed the change of the lung tissue structure after FPM exposure for 7 days. From scanning electron microscope (SEM images and quantitative analysis of the pore size of interstitial matrix) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), we noticed that the FPM exposure dramatically compressed the structure and crushed the interstitial space of the lung tissue. Further, Masson’s trichrome staining indicated a higher density of collagen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These data implied that FPM inhaled into the lung tissue condensed the native framework of ECM, which could block the path of CTLs migrating to the tumor site.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Fine particulate matter (FPM) impaired cytotoxic T lymphocytes’ (CTLs’) migration by increasing Col IV crosslinking in the lung tissue.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scanning electronic microscope (SEM) images of the interstitial matrix in the lung tissue exposed to FPM for 7 days.

The migration of CTLs in the slice of lung tissue (native or FPM-exposed) was analyzed by dynamically visualizing the cells’ movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). According to the outcomes from time-lapse sequential images and trajectory analysis of CTLs’ migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1 fig2video2 fig2video3">Figure 2—videos 1–3</xref>), in the lung tissue exposed to FPM, CTLs struggled to migrate, while those of the PBS group displayed quick migration pattern. Statistical analysis further validated that compared with the PBS group the FPM-treated lung tissue severely hindered the migration of CTLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), which were weakly motile and showed insufficient displacement, distance, and velocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bougherara et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, the change in the interstitial space, rather than attenuated migrating potential of CTLs per se, is responsible for the weakened infiltration of these cells in the FPM-treated lung tissue.</p><p>Then, we asked what caused the change of the lung structure after FPM exposure. Collagens, the main ECM components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gaggar and Weathington, 2016</xref>), especially three kinds of ones enriched in lung tissue, including the type I, III, and IV ones (Col I, Col III, and Col IV) were focused on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Laurent, 1986</xref>. First, ELISA was performed after different fragments of collagens were respectively harvested and divided into two categories by a reported protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Popov et al., 2011</xref>), that is, ‘low-crosslinked’ ones (low-cross) – containing freshly secreted collagens, procollagens, and moderately crosslinked collagens – and the other remainder ‘high-crosslinked’ ones (high-cross) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). The results showed both PM1 and TSP exposure significantly elevated the high-crosslink proportion of Col IV, twofold higher than that in the PBS group, based on the separate examination of low-cross and high-cross ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Next, the relative quantification of high-crosslinked collagens compared with low-crosslinked ones based on Western blotting (WB) analysis showed consistent changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). Besides, the IF images indicated that FPM exposure induced Col IV in the lung tissue to generate enhanced crosslink and denser distribution, leading to the collagen network with more junction site and higher junction density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>). However, the other two types of collagens (Col I and Col III) showed no obvious change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref>), demonstrating an increased Col IV crosslinking accounted for the change in the lung ECM structure. Furthermore, based on the related integrated optical density (IOD) of Col IV in lung tissue slices and related CTLs’ migration index (migration distance, displacement, and velocity) of different groups in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, we performed the Pearson’s correlation analysis and found an inverse relationship between Col IV density and CTLs’ migration potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2—figure supplement 8</xref>). Furthermore, we pretreated the FPM-exposed lung tissue with collagenase D to reduce the Col IV crosslink and alleviate Col IV density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). The trajectory images and related quantification analysis showed that CTLs’ migration was effectively recovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L and M</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video4 fig2video5 fig2video6 fig2video7">Figure 2—videos 4–7</xref>), further validating the crucial role of Col IV crosslink on the CTLs’ movement. These data together suggested that FPM exposure blocked CTLs migration and trapped these cells mainly through increasing Col IV crosslinking and consequently generating a denser ECM in the lung tissue, which might isolate the tumor cells from the CTLs’ attack (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s9">Figure 2—figure supplement 9</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>FPM increases Col IV crosslinking through promoting sulfilimine bond formation</title><p>We then investigated why FPM exposure led to increased Col IV crosslinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gaggar and Weathington, 2016</xref>). According to recent discovery, protein adsorbed onto the nanoparticles surface would endow them with new activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Monopoli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). As the median size of both PM1 and TSP is about 100–200 nm, it is possible that the collagen-crosslinking activity of FPM is derived from the proteins adsorbed onto their surface from lung tissue. To elucidate this, we separately incubated FPM in PBS or lung homogenate (LH) to simulate the scenario of FPM per se (FPM group) or the complex of FPM and its surface proteins (LH-FPM group, including LH-PM1 and LH-TSP). Then, according to an established experimental model with a slight modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bhave et al., 2012</xref>), soluble Col IV was generated by stimulating mouse bone marrow fibroblasts M2-10B4 cells, which highly express Col IV, with the inhibitor of collagen crosslink (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Next, the effect of FPM on the crosslink of soluble Col IV in the cellular system and acellular system was respectively analyzed as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>. For the cellular system, Col IV immunostaining result of M2-10B4 cells showed FPM itself could not induce the crosslinking of soluble Col IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Relatively, the LH-FPM initiated the crosslinking and reinforced the network to a greater extent than that induced by LH per se, which could be validated by intensive crosslink intensity and a denser Col IV distribution, and collagen network with more junction site and higher junction density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–F</xref>). Meanwhile, for the acellular experiment, the cell lysate of M2-10B4-enriched soluble Col IV was incubated with FPM or LH-FPM mixture. WB result showed a similar scenario – the naked FPM had little devotion to Col IV crosslink, but the LH-FPM dramatically enhanced the high-crosslinked Col IV fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Fine particulate matter (FPM) increased Col IV crosslink via promoting sulfilimine bond formation at the NC1 domain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the procedures to generate soluble Col IV and analyze the effect of FPM on its crosslink.

During crosslinking, the triple-helical protomer of Col IV, as the building block, forms network through two key types of crosslinking sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brown et al., 2017</xref>): NC1 domains including sulfilimine bond (-S=N-) formed at the C-terminal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vanacore et al., 2009</xref>) and 7S tetramers, including aldehyde group formed at the N-terminal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Risteli et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). To distinguish which one is mainly disturbed by the FPM, we detected their changes under FPM stimulation respectively: (1) for the NC1 domain, sulfilimine bond (-S=N-) is formed by two juxtaposed Col IV protomers at residues methionine 93 (Met93) and hydroxylysine 211 (Hyl211) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bhave et al., 2012</xref>). Based on indicated theoretical mass of crosslinked tryptic peptides containing -S=N in NC1 domain, we performed high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis to differentiate these peptides. For the NC1 domain separated from the crosslinked Col IV as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, we found significantly more sulfilimine-containing peptides in LH-FPM-treated soluble Col IV than that in the LH group according to the total ion chromatography (TIC) diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). (2) For the 7S domain crosslinking site, it was derived from the oxidation of one lysine residue in the N-terminal to the aldehyde (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anazco et al., 2016</xref>). The generated allysine would subsequently undergo a series of condensation reactions with other amino acids, mainly the other lysine or lysines on neighboring C-terminus, forming methylenimine bond (-C=N-), pyridine, or others to stabilize crosslink (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>). During the process, the detection of primary product allysine could reflect the level of 7S domain crosslink. With the reported specific and efficient probes to allysine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Waghorn et al., 2017</xref>), the allysine yielded during the crosslinking of the soluble Col IV incubated with LH or LH-FPM was respectively analyzed. The result showed a slight difference, indicating the 7S domain would not be interfered by FPM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B</xref>).

To elaborately dissect this process, following a standard procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carrillo-Carrion et al., 2017</xref>), we separated the biomacromolecules from LH-FPM, the majority of which are proteins and also known as ‘protein corona’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Monopoli et al., 2012</xref>). Unexpected corona formation can trigger serious pathological reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tenzer et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, we speculated whether FPM could recruit certain proteins related to Col IV crosslink into its corona, thereby enriching and empowering this protein – to influence the crosslinking of collagen IV.</p><p>Given that the sulfilimine bond is uniquely catalyzed by PXDN enzyme in animal tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bhave et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Weiss, 2012</xref>), we focused and detected the PXDN in FPM’s protein corona. The LC-MS result showed that PXDN was listed in the component profile of protein corona on both PM1 and TSP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>), reflecting the interaction of PXDN and FPM. We further analyzed PXDN adsorbed on FPM and its time evolution with WB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). The data showed that PXDN was not only adsorbed on the FPM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), but also stably tethered to FPM as the incubation time increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), underlying that it might affect FPM’s biological behavior durably. To further assess the adsorption of FPM to PXDN, we injected rhodamine fluorescence-labeled particles (R-FPM) via the trachea into the lung tissue and detected PXDN therein. The IF co-localization of FPM and PXDN in vivo was clearly presented, confirming the recruitment of this enzyme to FPM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), which could be further validated by the dramatically similar distribution of PXDN and FPM on M2-10B4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

Thus, we examined the activity of FPM-recruited PXDN as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>. Aimed at the substrate H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, the intermediates hypohalous acids, and the final NC1 domain with sulfilimine bond, different experimental analyses were respectively performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bhave et al., 2012</xref>). First, peroxidase activity of PXDN incubated with FPM was measured through Amplex Red molecular probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bathish et al., 2018</xref>). The relative fluorescence intensity showed that FPM incubation raised the enzymatic activity of PXDN up to 5- to 10-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Next, PXDN’s enzyme kinetic behaviors were investigated according to the Michaelis–Menten model. Based on the generated Line weaver–Burk representative plot, the Michaelis constant (Km) and turnover number (Kcat) were calculated, which respectively reflects the enzyme-substrate binding efficiency and the enzymatic efficiency. The result showed that PXDN incubated with FPM revealed significantly decreased Km (PM1: 7.36 μM; TSP: 13.10 μM vs. PBS: 15.92 μM) and increased catalytic efficiency about 1.4- to 1.8-fold than the enzyme per se (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Also, the secondary product hypohalous acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bhave et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McCall et al., 2014</xref>), for instance, HOBr and HOCl, generated by PXDN from bromide and chloride, were respectively analyzed. For HOBr, bromohydrin formed by the bromination of NADH was measured based on its close relation with HOBr production as reported in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bathish et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Soudi et al., 2015</xref>). The LC-MS detection showed that the ratio of bromohydrin to NADH in the group of PXDN incubated with FPM was three- to fivefold higher than that of the enzyme per se group, indicating more HOBr production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Besides, we measured HOCl in consideration of the vast excess of Cl<sup>-</sup> over Br<sup>-</sup> in most animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Weiss et al., 1986</xref>), although PXDN uses Br<sup>-</sup> to catalyze the formation of sulfilimine crosslinks with greater efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McCall et al., 2014</xref>). With the detection of a hypohalous acid-detecting fluorescent probe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Xing et al., 2018</xref>), we found that HOCl produced by the FPM-incubated PXDN was about two- to fourfold higher than that of the PBS group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Furthermore, to analyze the effect of FPM’s adsorption on the catalytic product, after the commercial non-crosslinking NC1 domain (NC1<sub>mo</sub>) was reacted with FPM-incubated PXDN, the generated crosslinked dimeric with sulfilimine bond (NC1<sub>di</sub>) therein was detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bhave et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fidler et al., 2014</xref>). The result suggested that FPM incubation significantly enhanced PXDN’s enzymatic performance, with a higher yield of crosslinked NC1 dimeric subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that the pro-crosslink potential of FPM is attributed to the aberrant enzyme activity of PXDN adsorbed on its surface.</p><p>Next, we gave an insight into the mechanism of PXDN’s tampered catalysis. Recent emerging evidence suggests that phase transition (or separation) is a common way to regulate proteins’ activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2019</xref>). Phase transition refers to the process that macromolecular solution condenses into liquid droplets, solids, or gels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">O’Flynn and Mittag, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Boeynaems et al., 2018</xref>) in response to certain physicochemical stimuli, sharply increasing the macromolecule’s concentration and separating them from the surrounding compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alberti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Peeples and Rosen, 2021</xref>). Such enrichment affects the subsequent biochemical reactions. Thus, we asked whether the FPM’s adsorption could induce the PXDN’s phase transition, thus disturbing the latter’s enzymatic activity. Taking PM1 as an example, with a series of microscopic observations, we found the formation of PXDN’s liquid-like droplets in LH after its incubation with PM1 with both confocal fluorescence and phase-contrast microscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A</xref>). However, for the PXDN alone in LH under the same processing time and imaging parameters, no assemblies are observed. Moreover, the profiles of fluorescence distribution further indicated the phase-separating PXDN’s accumulation was initialized on the PM1, based on their evident colocalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4B</xref>). Besides, to characterize the dynamic nature of the droplets, we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments. FRAP studies revealed that fluorescence of the bleached region of PXDN droplets could be partially recovered in minutes after photobleaching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K and L</xref>). The reversible characteristic observed for PXDN droplets on PM1 further validated that PXDN underwent phase separation. More interestingly, the droplet-like accumulation of PXDN on FPM could also be observed in M2-10B4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Overall, these results indicated that the increased activity for PXDN’s crosslinking Col IV was triggered by its phase transition on the FPM surface.</p><p>Furthermore, we theoretically inferred the relationship of PXDN’s phase separation with its enzymatic performance. First, we focused on the low-complexity domains in PXDN sequence, which could drive phase transition and be predicted by intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>). The analysis indicated that PXDN’s phase separation might occur at sequence 200–400 aa, which shows a higher IDR score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alberti et al., 2019</xref>). More importantly, it is away from PXDN’s activity center (800–1200 aa) according to the spatial structure in SWISS-MODEL, giving us a hint that PXDN’s phase transition on FPM surface might not lead to deformation of PXDN’s catalytic center and loss of its function. Next, protein-protein interactive docking simulation was performed at the interface of PXDN with its substrate NC1 domain through ZDock protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M</xref>). As a homotridmeric multidomain enzyme, PXDN exists as trimerization in solution, and three monomers of PXDN are linked by disulfide bonds at the indicated flexible linker region in the residual noncatalytic domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bathish et al., 2018</xref>). According to the reported modeled structure of PXDN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Paumann-Page et al., 2020</xref>), its trimeric peroxidase domain displayed a triangular arrangement. However, oversized trimerization of PXDN might not get in contact thoroughly with its substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lázár et al., 2015</xref>). So we chose the PXDN monomer with the exposed enzymatic surface contacting with NC1 domain to simulate its function at solution state. The computational result indicated that once PXDN triggered phase separation, which transferred from the solution state to the aggregation one (the putative assembly structure created through homology modeling) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bernardes et al., 2015</xref>), the interactive area at the NC1 interface would be notably increased, thus facilitating the enzymatic catalysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Inhibiting PXDN ameliorates FPM-induced tumorigenesis</title><p>Based on the above findings, we speculated that inhibiting PXDN could abolish ECM change and recover CTLs migration in the lung.

Existing findings, though supporting that FPM induces lung cancer, provide insufficient and inconsistent explanations for the underlying mechanism. In this study, we have discovered an unexpected mechanism that, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, apart from directly targeting tumor cells, the inhaled FPM changes the formation of lung tissue matrix to prevent the infiltration of T lymphocytes and their antitumor immunosurveillance, which consequently accelerates lung tumorigenesis.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Schematic diagram of the mechanism underlying how fine particulate matter (FPM) promotes lung tumorigenesis.</title><p>The adsorption of FPM triggers the phase separation of peroxidasin (PXDN) to generate an aberrant catalytic activity and induce a disordered crosslink of Col IV.

Most previous studies suggest that FPM directly acts on cells by inducing gene mutation and increasing malignant ‘seed cells’ in the affected lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Somers et al., 2004</xref>). They further suggest that the particles carry chemical reagents, such as acrolein, nicotine, oxidants, and reactive nitrogen moieties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hecht, 2002</xref>), into the lung to exert such effects. However, the respiratory tract is exposed to various environmental substances (e.g., O<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>3</sub>) that are much more powerful in damaging DNA, more abundant in the air, and more soluble in the tissue than the above chemicals. It requires further explanation of how these assumed mutagens, delivered in a trace amount by the particles into the lung tissue, could significantly increase lung cancer incidence. Moreover, FPM from different locations carries distinct types of those carcinogens existing in the local environment, but these highly various particles exert the same carcinogenic effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kelly and Fussell, 2012</xref>), which is unexplainable. Additionally, in vitro, FPM is considered more capable of entering the cell than larger particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gratton et al., 2008</xref>) (such as the PM10, i.e., the particulate matter with the diameter of 1–10 μm); but in vivo, particles are difficult to directly contact with cells due to the barrier effects from sticky body fluids and gel-like ECM proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fernandes et al., 2009</xref>). Since inhaled particles are mostly accumulated in the ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Engin et al., 2017</xref>), there is no reason to ignore the impact of ECM and only focus on the interaction between particles and cells. Thus, we suspected that the lung tissue ECM, apart from the cells, could also be affected by the particles. Indeed, ECM abnormality is closely correlated with cancer development. On the one hand, the clinical samples showed the developed tumor was surrounded by a dense collagen matrix; on the other hand, one typical example is that tissue fibrosis often precipitates tumor development in the same tissue – such as liver cirrhosis progressing into hepatoma and pulmonary fibrosis leading to lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cox and Erler, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tzouvelekis et al., 2020</xref>). These clinical and experimental proven reports prompt us to investigate the pathological change of FPM-stimulated lung interstitial ECM and its role in lung tumorigenesis.</p><p>Our experimental findings validated this assumption by demonstrating – and elucidating the mechanism of – FPM-induced alteration in the interstitial lung structure. As soon as we, for the first time, found that FPM in the LH dramatically enhanced the crosslinking of soluble Col IV, we speculated that a specific biomolecule in LH enriched on the FPM surface mediates this action. With proteomics tools, we identified PXDN; this enzyme, specialized in catalyzing collagen network formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bhave et al., 2012</xref>), is enriched in the protein corona of FPM, enabling FPM to mediate ECM remodeling. Meanwhile, for PXDN, its adsorption onto FPM triggered its aberrant enzymatic activity through a ‘phase-transition’ process, which further disturbs Col IV crosslinking and the organization of the lung interstitial space. Pretreatment using PXDN inhibitor could alleviate the tumor-promoting effect of FPM. Therefore, an aberrant ECM remodeling mediated by enriched PXDN in the particle corona is the key pathological change caused by FPM.</p><p>Our study further elucidates how such a change in ECM accelerates tumor development. As a consequence of FPM treatment, the denser Col IV and more compacted interstitial space in lung tissue would hinder the migration of CTLs, which are the most ‘informed’ defender to protect against potential cancer and delay malignant progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">DuPage et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krummel et al., 2016</xref>). Once CTLs’ migration track was blocked, the CTLs’ infiltration would be impaired, thus decreasing the chance of cell-cell cytotoxic interaction to tumor cells in lung tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hanahan and Coussens, 2012</xref>). According to the correlation between tumor mutation burden and immune infiltration in lung tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Thorsson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Helleday et al., 2014</xref>), we speculated that the deficiency further aggravated the mutation of cancerous cells in the lung tissue. The insufficiency of CTLs’ early response to tumor cells results in weakened immune surveillance and unmonitored mutation that in turn accelerate tumorigenesis. All the evidence recapitulates how FPM accelerated the development of lung cancer by interfering with the lung immune microenvironment, shedding light on the sequential consequences between particle-induced ECM remodeling, impaired immunosurveillance, and tumorigenesis.</p><p>Taken together, our study reveals a completely new mechanism by which inhaled fine particles promote lung tumor development. This mechanism is notable in three aspects. First, we herein provide direct evidence that protein corona on those foreign objects can elicit such a significant and adverse effect. Although corona formation on nanoparticles has been extensively studied in recent years, its involvement in a pathogenic process related to a global health issue is rare. Our findings here highlight the importance of the corona-endowed, ‘new’ enzymatic bioactivity of nanomaterials in vivo – and in a particular tissue. The data suggests that coronas adsorbed from the environment could also be catalytic, other than simply transforming the cellular and higher-level interactions, in agreement with other literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dawson and Yan, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shang et al., 2021</xref>). Second, PXDN, or other proteins mainly engaged in ECM modulation, is less expected as a major player in lung carcinogenesis, especially at the initial stage, until this study reveals it as a specific and unexpected molecular target for FPM. These investigations enable the specific design of PXDN-targeted preventive or therapeutic approaches. The relationship between the physicochemical properties of FPM and the affected PXDN activity should be further explored in greater detail. Third, in a specific organ (the lung), our data demonstrate that physical blockage of immunocytes movement directly increases tumorigenesis, which suggests an important previously unconsidered role of the in vivo delivering or deploying the power of the immune system in various immune-oncology processes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>FPM collection and preparation</title><p>FPM samples within sizes of 1 μm were collected using TH-16A multiple-channel atmospheric particulate automatic sampler (Wuhan Tianhong Instrument Ltd., Wuhan, China) and filtered through Whatman PTFE membranes (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, USA).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Paul Noble as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Zhe-Sheng Chen (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers were positive about your work. If you could address the points raised by reviewer #3 in the discussion it would be appreciated. The reviews are below for your consideration.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I would say this is a most interesting paper with novel thinking. It is a big ambitious hypothesis, with many interwoven issues and steps, and a single paper would find it hard to conclusively prove such a claim. I would therefore suggest that the paper be published because it is sufficiently well argued to make the idea credible, but would also suggest to the authors to couch their language in a more cautious manner. I know this is sometimes hard to do when one is being reviewed, but maybe the Editor would allow some possibility for the authors to self critique from a secure basis. Personally, I think the article will come across much better, and having confidence in the ideas, I would like to see that.</p><p>I think everyone concerned will be well aware of the impossibility of conclusive arguments based on the limited scale of study and examples provided in Figure1,2. In my view the data seems sufficiently strong to somewhat support the claims, but this will always be questioned.</p><p>Obviously, part of Figure 3 really purports to establish that the cross linking is catalysed by this 'corona'. [1] For obvious reasons I would be anxious to make absolutely sure of this effect, for once that is done (as it can be shown in simple physiochemical manners), the rest seemed strongly likely. The in vitro mechanistic verification is particularly important in my view because it excludes many of the other cellular effects that themselves could also lead to aberrant matrix, and if it could be made conclusive would I think be itself of great interest. It belongs to a small but growing group of claims in which coronas adsorbed from the environment are catalytic [2] rather than simply transform the cellular and higher level interactions [3]. So, I would ask the authors if they can envisage a really more conclusive experiment for this effect? Can they make a quasi-quantitative experiment in which the evolution of the reaction can be followed? Can they poison the peroxidasin most convincing in these experiments, and see what happens? I think it is possible.</p><p>I would also comment, though this could be more of a discussion point, that the cross-linking hypothesis should be affected by different kinds of bare particle surfaces since their propensity to adsorb will change with the original surface. I am not sure this study is really necessary in such a hypothesis building paper, but certainly if I were the authors, I would want to have a series of particles with different adsorbed species and propensities and the levels of peroxidasin correlated with the effects. Again, not a trivial experiment do well, and be sure the original bare surface is stable in situ etc, but feasible.</p><p>My feeling is that this should be published, possibly with some consideration of points made by reviewers, but it looks really important for the community to see.</p><p>[1] Nat.

The tobacco smoke induces a unique mutational signature in lung cancer tissue (a C&gt;A transversion, or signature 4 as reviewed in Helleday et al., 2014, Nature Review Genetics). It would be interesting to test whether the presence of smoke mutational signature (or the smoke history of patients) is associated with decreased infiltration of T cells or an immunosuppressive microenvironment in lung cancer patients. Such association may be tested using processed data in TCGA datasets of lung cancer patients.

We have modified our description more cautiously, especially for the sentences related to FPM’s pro-tumorigenesis potential and PXDN’s phase separation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Obviously, part of Figure 3 really purports to establish that the cross linking is catalysed by this 'corona'. [1] For obvious reasons I would be anxious to make absolutely sure of this effect, for once that is done (as it can be shown in simple physiochemical manners), the rest seemed strongly likely.

Can they make a quasi-quantitative experiment in which the evolution of the reaction can be followed? Can they poison the peroxidasin most convincing in these experiments, and see what happens? I think it is possible.</p></disp-quote><p>These questions are extraordinarily inspiring and in line with our plan for future study. First, our finding fully supports the catalytic role of coronas. We had speculated that FPM increased collagen crosslinking by upregulating PXDN expression; however, the data showed no significant difference in the level of PXDN! From this observation, we started focusing on the catalytic activity of corona including PXDN adsorbed on FPM and, through hierarchical clustering, found these coronas rich in enzymes. We are glad to know our finding agrees with a growing group of claims that coronas adsorbed from the environment are catalytic (<italic>Nat. Nanotechnol. 2021.16,229.; Nat. Catal.,2021.4,607</italic>.).</p><p>Next, as the reviewer pointed out, the in vitro mechanistic validation is important. We also analyzed the FPM-PXDN interaction in vitro by incubating the particles with the purified fulllength native peroxidasin. The data (including those in Figure 4E-4I) indicated that FPM incubation significantly enhanced PXDN’s enzymatic performance. During these experiments, to quantitatively analyze the HOBr production generated by FPM-PXDN’s catalytic process, LC-MS was employed to determine the bromination of NADH (<italic>Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2018. 646,120; J. Biol. Chem.2015. 290, 1087; Cell. 2014.157,1380</italic>). We believe a more comprehensive study in future into the kinetics of enzyme-substrate reactions, based on dynamic quantification of this pair, would help describe this evolution process. As the reviewer wisely suggests, poisoning peroxidasin in vitro can also be an interesting experiment to perform.</p><p>We will most likely use methods shown as below:</p><p>1) Because that the generation of crosslinked dimeric (NC1<sub>di</sub>) is directly related to the consumption of un-crosslinked monomeric subunits (NC1<sub>mo</sub>), the enzymatic performance of FPM/PXDN can be investigated with a NC1<sub>mo</sub>-to-NC1<sub>di</sub> conversion assay, followed by quantitative western blotting. Besides, after FPM and PXDN were incubated for the indicated time, NC1<sub>mo</sub>-to-NC1<sub>di</sub> transformation curves could be performed to analyze the correlation between the incubation time and the yield of NC1di.</p><p>2) To validate the catalytic reaction mediated by the FPM’s surface, an active dimethyl labelling strategy combined with MS could be applied to systematically probe the lysine-proximal microenvironments of the FPM/PXDN complexes. It’s reported that the lysine residues on the free enzyme are more easily accessed and labeled than those adsorbed on materials’ surfaces (<italic>Nat. Catal. 2021.4,607.; Anal. Chem. 2016. 88, 12060.</italic>). Thus, this method could reflect the state of PXDN.</p><p>3) For poisoning the peroxidasin in in vitro experiments, perhaps the adsorption of peroxidasin could be competitively inhibited by the addition of some other targeted proteins by utilizing the preference of FPM’s protein corona. If feasible, it inspires us to design the therapeutic method to prevent FPM’s biological risk by modulating its protein corona.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I would also comment, though this could be more of a discussion point, that the cross-linking hypothesis should be affected by different kinds of bare particle surfaces since their propensity to adsorb will change with the original surface. I am not sure this study is really necessary in such a hypothesis building paper, but certainly if I were the authors, I would want to have a series of particles with different adsorbed species and propensities and the levels of peroxidasin correlated with the effects.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion and agree with the reviewer that this is an interesting topic to explore in our future study. In the current study, due to the complexity of the environmentally collected FPM, we mixed an equal proportion of different samples to eliminate the interference of sampling resources and discovered peroxidasin as the biomarker in the corona related to crosslinking. In future, we can study the physicochemical features of individual samples and their absorbed PXDN levels, followed by linking the abundance to eventual tumorigenic activities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) Why did the authors focus on PM1 rather than PM2.5 or PM10? How was the administration dose of FPM selected?</p></disp-quote><p>1) According to the reports related to the fractional deposition of particulate matters inhaled into the respiratory tract (<italic>Respirology.2012. 17, 1031.</italic>), the nanosized components with a diameter less than 1 μm (PM1) displayed the highest deposition efficiency in the alveolar and bronchioles region. Besides, these particles are more likely to disturb the encounters when they interact with cells or subcellular components due to their extraordinarily high number concentrations per given mass and increased surface area per unit mass (<italic>Environ. Health. Perspect. 2005. 113</italic>, 823.). Thus, we focused on the effect of PM1 on lung tissue.</p><p>2) For the FPM-exposed experimental model, previous studies adopted different methods. The administration dose ranged from 2 mg/kg to 30 mg/kg. We chose an average one at 10 mg/kg and exposed FPM to mice by intratracheal instillation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) For Figure 1I and 1J, to further validate the crucial role of CTLs' insufficiency induced by FPM in lung tumorigenesis, the effect of the adoptively transferred CTLs on the tumor burden of FPM-exposed nude mice should be detected.</p></disp-quote><p>Although we did not adoptively transfer CTLs into the nude mice, its effect on the tumor burden could be predicted from Figure. 5C-5F. We observed significantly attenuated tumor development along with the recovery of CTLs’ infiltration in the FPM-exposed lung tissue. These outcomes to some extent could testify CTLs’ crucial role in FPM-related lung tumorigenesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Also, to testify an immune response closely mediates the FPM's pro-tumorigenesis activity, the EdU staining in the lung tissue of nude mice should be supplemented to exclude the direct role of FPM on tumor cells.</p></disp-quote><p>This analysis is very interesting for our future study. The similar tumor burden and tumor number of nude mice suggested little difference in cancerous cells’ proliferation after FPM exposure. This could be further validated by the EdU staining in Figure 1E. All these results remaindered us that the immune response might be the main attribution to the FPM's protumorigenesis activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 4 showed that FPM increased peroxidasin (PXDN) activity. Other than upregulating the enzymatic activity, does the FPM affect PXDN's expression in the lung tissue?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this insightful question. Actually, in our preliminary experiment, we had speculated that FPM promoted Col IV crosslink by increasing PXDN’s expression in the lung tissue. However, we analyzed the transcription and protein’s expression level of PXDN through qRT-PCR and WB analysis and found little difference before and after FPM exposure. These interesting results pushed us to focus on the change of PXDN’s enzymatic activity after its adsorption on FPM’s surface. And that’s the main reason why we explored the catalytic analysis of PXDN, rather than its direct cellular biological effect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In Figure 1F, 5C and 5D, flow cytometry was performed to analyze the CTLs in lung tissue one day or indicated time after LLC stimulation. The authors should discuss whether the FPM exposure also induced the change of other immune cells, especially NK.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this excellent question. When T cells crawl in the lung tissue, the extracellular matrix serves as their migration scaffolds (<italic>Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2014. 14, 232</italic>).</p><p>Similarly, NK cells use such migration strategies in the lung interstitial space (<italic>Trends. Cell Biol. 2020. 30</italic>, 818; <italic>ELife. 2022. 11, 76269</italic>). Based on our study, migrating CTLs could be repelled by dense ECM bundles induced by FPM. We speculated that the same scenario applies to NK cells. FPM exposure might also impair the NK’s mobility in the lung tissue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) This study mainly detects the effect of FPM exposure on extracellular matrix and immune response during the early stage of tumorigenesis. The long-term impact of the inhaled particles on lung tumors should also be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the role of extracellular matrix and immune response on the cancerous cells varies along with the tumor development (<italic>Nat. Commun. 2020. 11, 5120; Front. Mol. Biosci. 2020. 6, 160.</italic>), including the initiation, growth, migration, and others. And vice versus, the ECM and immune cells could be dynamically regulated or educated by the tumor cells (<italic>Nat. Immunol. 2013. 14, 1014; Nature. 2021. 599, 673</italic>), which should be also taken into consideration. Taken together, it is challenging to predict the long-term impact of FPM on lung tumor development.</p><p>But it is worth being explored in our further study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) For Materials and methods, more details in the section of 'Molecular Docking on The Effect of Phase Separation on Enzymatic Reaction.' should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We have supplemented some details in the section of 'Molecular Docking on The Effect of Phase Separation on Enzymatic Reaction.' in the Revised Manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Overall, the hypothesis was tested carefully with both in vitro and in vivo experiments, and the data was convincing.

The mutational signature based on TCGA analysis and immune cell fractions in lung cancer tissue in the patient data could provide solid support for our study (<italic>Nature. 2013. 499, 214.; Science. 2013. 339, 1546; Nature. 2013. 500, 415; Immunity. 2018. 48, 812; Nat.

If not, it may be explained in the discussion for non-expert readers.</p></disp-quote><p>1) The relative abundance of PXDN on FPM could be estimated according to its rank in the LC-MS list and the quantitative western blot. For the former one, we observed the PXDN both in PM1 and TSP’s corona (PM1: 378/1488;TSP: 417/1290); for the latter one, as shown in Figure 4A, PXDN in the total protein absorbed on FPM was detected by Western blotting, with a serial content of recombinant protein as the standard control. The data showed that about 100 ng PXDN was tethered to FPM.</p><p>2) Indeed, PXDN is not the only one enzyme in the protein corona that might affect the collagen crosslink, which also include MPO, EPO, CAPN1 and others. Some of them even displayed higher abundance in the LC-MS list. But among these proteins, PXDN is the specifically one mediating the formation of sulfilimine bond, the central target of FPM’s bioactivity. The activities of other proteins is hardly detectable, which might owe to their conformation change or misfolding during protein corona’s formation (<italic>J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2013. 135, 17359.; Biomaterials.2021. 265, 120452; Adv Mater. 2019. 31, e1805740.</italic>). Thus, we focused on PXDN, the one endows FPM with pro-crosslink activity, despite its abundance is ordinary.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. It is a nice piece of interdisciplinary work. Some details may be added for readers in different fields.
