We examine public preferences in six European countries regarding the allocation of COVID-19 vaccines between the Global South and Global North.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We conducted online discrete choice experiments with adult participants in France (n=766), Germany (n=1964), Italy (n=767), Poland (n=670), Spain (n=925), and Sweden (n=938). Respondents were asked to decide which one of two candidates should receive the vaccine first. The candidates varied on four attributes: age, mortality risk, employment, and living in a low- or high-income country. We analysed the relevance of each attribute in allocation decisions using conditional logit regression.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In all six countries, respondents prioritised candidates with a high mortality and infection risk, irrespective of whether the candidate lived in the respondent's own country. All else equal, respondents in Italy, France, Spain, and Sweden gave priority to a candidate from a low-income country, whereas German respondents were significantly more likely to choose the candidate from their own country. Female, younger, and more educated respondents were more favourable to an equitable vaccine distribution.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Given these preferences for global solidarity, European governments should promote vaccine transfers to poorer world regions.</p><p><bold>Funding:</bold> Funding was provided by the European Union's Horizon H2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement 101016233 (PERISCOPE).</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Viruses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>No 101016233 (PERISCOPE)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Steinert</surname><given-names>Janina I</given-names></name><name><surname>Veltri</surname><given-names>Giuseppe A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><back><sec id="s1" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interest</title><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf1"><p>The authors declare that no competing interests exist.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: The study received approvals from the ethics committees of the medical faculty at the Technical University of Munich (TUM, IRB 227/20 S) and the ethics board at the University of Trento (Trento, IRB 2021-027). Participants were given an individual link to the survey, where they first received information about the study's purpose, data protection regulations, and voluntary participation. All participants provided written electronic consent to participate in the study prior to commencing the survey. Personally identifying information such as names and contact details were not collected and data is thus fully anonymised. After completing the survey, participants received a voucher worth three to five Euros, which was distributed by the survey company.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional Files</title><sec id="s3" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analysed during this study are made publicly available via the Open Science Framework under the following link: https://osf.io/72jrq/</p><p>The following datasets were generated:</p><p><element-citation id="dataset1" publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>Steinert</collab><collab>Sternberg</collab><collab>Veltri</collab><collab>Büthe</collab></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2021">2021</year><source>Public Opinion on the Distribution of COVID-19 Vaccines between the Global North and South</source><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/72jrq/">https://osf.io/72jrq/</ext-link><comment>OSF</comment></element-citation></p></sec><supplementary-material><ext-link xlink:href="elife-79819-supp-v1.zip">Download zip</ext-link><p>Any figures and tables for this article are included in the PDF.
