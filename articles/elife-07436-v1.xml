However, recent studies in non-human primates have shown that neural activity does not simply represent muscle or movement parameters; instead, its temporal structure is well-described by a dynamical system where activity during movement evolves lawfully from an initial pre-movement state. In this study, we analyze neuronal ensemble activity in motor cortex in two clinical trial participants diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). We find that activity in human motor cortex has similar dynamical structure to that of non-human primates, indicating that human motor cortex contains a similar underlying dynamical system for movement generation.</p><p>Clinical trial registration: NCT00912041.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07436.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07436.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07436.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Every conscious movement a person makes, whether lifting a pencil or playing a violin, begins in the brain. To be more specific, neurons in a part of the brain called the motor cortex send signals to muscles to cause them to move.</p><p>But many of the details about how messages from the motor cortex produce movements remain unclear. Some scientists believe that individual neurons in motor cortex send direct messages that tell the muscles which direction to move in, how fast, and how forcefully. But other scientists suggest that this is not the case. Instead, they propose that neurons in motor cortex work together as part of a dynamic system to create rhythmic patterns of activity for movement. These rhythmic patterns then sum together to create the signals that muscles need to carry out the movements.</p><p>Studies in monkeys have supported the idea that the neurons in the motor cortex are not just direct messengers. These studies showed what appears to be a rotating set of patterns in neuronal activity in the motor cortex during movement. Now, Pandarinath et al. have shown that a similar rotation of neuronal activity patterns occurs during movement in two human volunteers. The participants both had a disease called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (or ALS for short). This disease had nearly paralyzed their arms and legs because it causes a progressive loss of muscle control. In the experiments, the volunteers used their index fingers to try to move a computer cursor to a target using a touch pad.</p><p>Pandarinath et al. recorded activity in the volunteers' motor cortices while they completed the tasks. The experiments uncovered a predictable series of patterns that started when the individual first thought about moving. These patterns progressed in a rotation as the movement was carried out. The rotation was not tied to the direction of the movements and would be completely unexpected if the individual neurons were simply acting as direct messengers.</p><p>It is hoped that these findings will help efforts to create prosthetic devices (such as robotic arms) that can better respond to an individual's thoughts. But further experiments are also needed in people without ALS to verify that the patterns observed weren't specifically related to this disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07436.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07436.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>motor control</kwd><kwd>dynamical system</kwd><kwd>computational neuroscience</kwd><kwd>motor cortex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DC009899</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hochberg</surname><given-names>Leigh R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>N01HD53403</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hochberg</surname><given-names>Leigh R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>N01HD10018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hochberg</surname><given-names>Leigh R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-NS066311</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Henderson</surname><given-names>Jaimie M</given-names></name><name><surname>Shenoy</surname><given-names>Krishna V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000738</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>B6453R, B6310N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hochberg</surname><given-names>Leigh R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Garlick Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Henderson</surname><given-names>Jaimie M</given-names></name><name><surname>Shenoy</surname><given-names>Krishna V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005191</institution-id><institution>Craig H.

Though motor cortex has been extensively studied over the past century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Lemon, 2008</xref>), the complexity of these patterns remains poorly understood. Early work demonstrated that neural firing correlates with external variables such as movement direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Georgopoulos et al., 1982</xref>), and an ongoing debate centers on whether the firing patterns represent muscle or movement parameters (e.g., joint position, intended velocity, reach endpoint, muscle forces, and so on; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Kalaska, 2009</xref>). A recent approach has been to ask, instead, whether these patterns of activity reflect an internal dynamical system across the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Fetz, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Todorov and Jordan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Churchland and Shenoy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Scott, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Churchland et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Graziano, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Shenoy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kaufman et al., 2014</xref>). In this view, the system's initial state is set by preparatory activity, and consistent rules govern how firing rates evolve over time across movement conditions, regardless of movement direction or other externally changing variables.</p><p>This dynamical view is supported by recent studies in rhesus macaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Churchland et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Shenoy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kaufman et al., 2014</xref>). At the level of single neurons, responses during movement show brief but strong oscillatory components, even for straight point-to-point reaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Churchland and Shenoy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Churchland et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, at the population level, the responses are well-described by a simple dynamical model in which the population response (the neural state) rotates with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Churchland et al., 2012</xref>). Importantly, the presence of a strong rotational component in these dynamics is not predicted by the prevailing view of motor cortical activity (i.e., cosine direction tuning, linear speed scaling) that, instead, predicts solely expansive and contractive dynamics (detailed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Churchland et al., 2012</xref>, Figure 4 and associated text).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07436.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Neural population responses show rotational activity during movement epochs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Projections of the neural population response onto the first jPCA plane for a monkey during an arm-reaching task (monkey N, 108 conditions; adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Churchland et al., 2012</xref>).

This ongoing, multi-site, pilot clinical trial is performed under an FDA Investigational Device Exemption and has been approved by local institutional review boards at all study sites. The study participants (T6, T7) had differing degrees of motor impairment due to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). T6 retained the ability to make several dexterous movements (especially of the fingers and wrist), while T7 retained limited finger movements.</p><p>Neural signals were recorded using 4 mm × 4 mm, 96-channel silicon microelectrode arrays, which were implanted in the hand area of dominant M1. APs were recorded as participants performed visual target acquisition tasks. Participants attempted to move a cursor from the center of a computer screen to one of eight peripheral targets, with the cursor's position controlled by index finger movements on a computer touchpad (see ‘Materials and methods’).</p><p>We first tested whether an underlying dynamical structure existed in the neural activity. If present, a population-level analysis should reveal orderly rotational structure that is consistent across conditions (i.e., independent of the direction of movement). To search for rotational patterns in the neural population state, we used a three-step procedure: first, for each condition (i.e., for a given target), we averaged the activity on each electrode across all trials. Next, we performed principal components analysis (PCA) on the high-dimensional population data. We restricted the data to the top 6 PCs, that is, we only preserved the six response patterns most strongly present in the data. Finally, for this reduced-dimensional data set, we applied the jPCA method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Churchland et al., 2012</xref>), which searches the data for 2-dimensional planes that capture the strongest rotational tendencies. Restricting the jPCA analysis to the dimensionality-reduced data (6-D) ensured that any rotational structure revealed by the analysis was present in the most prominent response patterns in the data.</p><p>For both participants, the population activity exhibited strong rotational dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Each trace shows the population activity in the top jPC plane for a single condition. 250 ms of data are shown, beginning with the rapid change in neural activity that precedes movement onset (the evolution of the neural state over time for each participant is shown in <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). Rotations proceeded in the same direction across conditions, following from the initial pre-movement state. The top jPCA plane captured 61% (T6) and 27% (T7) of the variance of the high-dimensional neural data (for comparison, the macaque study reported 28% for the top plane on average).<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="mov" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-07436-media1.mov"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07436.004</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Neural population responses show rotational activity.</title><p>Video shows the evolution of the neural state over time in the first jPCA plane for participants T6 and T7.

To test for this possibility, we performed three control analyses, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Churchland et al., 2012</xref>. In these controls, the data were shuffled to disrupt underlying rotational structure across response patterns, while preserving the complexity of the individual response patterns. If the previously found rotational structure were simply a by-product of the analysis technique, then the shuffled data sets should still show prominent rotations in the top jPCA planes. This was not the case. Rotations were no longer qualitatively seen in the projected responses after shuffling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, top row). We next measured the fraction of variance of the changes in neural state (6-D) that could be explained by rotational activity alone (see ‘Materials and methods’) and found that this greatly decreased after shuffling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, bottom row).

As with macaques, rotations were consistent across conditions and followed naturally from an initial pre-movement state. As mentioned above, and in contrast to the macaque study, both participants in this study had a diagnosis of ALS with resultant motor impairment. Participant T7's movements in particular were very limited and occurred with a long latency following target onset (detailed in ‘Materials and methods’). Both participants likely had substantial changes in motor cortex due to their disease progression; therefore, these results do not conclusively show that dynamical activity is present in healthy human motor cortex. However, given the finding that dynamical activity is prominent in motor cortex in people with abnormal motor function, and given the similarity of this activity to that of healthy non-human primates, the results strongly suggest the presence of dynamical activity in human motor cortex in general and may also hint at which aspects of motor cortical function are preserved despite the progression of a severe motor neuron disease.</p><p>Given the findings of dynamical activity during overt movements, a potentially exciting open question is whether motor cortex exhibits dynamical activity during purely imagined movements. Recent studies (Feldman et al., Society for Neuroscience, 2011, 2012; Pandarinath et al., Society for Neuroscience, 2013) have demonstrated that motor cortex is active during both overt and imagined movements. If the functional role of rotational dynamics is to serve as an oscillatory basis set for generating muscle activation patterns (e.g. electromyogram activity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Churchland et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Sussillo et al., 2015</xref>), then one might expect these dynamics to be absent during imagined movements, when the subject is specifically trying to avoid generating motor output. However, if activity during imagined movements serves as a mechanism for the ‘covert rehearsal’ of activity during overt movements, then dynamics might still be present (but might be, for example, orthogonal to patterns of activity that drive motor output). Future studies will attempt to directly address this question.</p><p>The current study’s findings also suggest a promising avenue to improve the performance of Brain–Machine Interfaces (BMIs) for persons with tetraplegia, as previous work with macaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Kao et al., 2015</xref>) demonstrated that incorporating neural population dynamics into BMI control algorithms may lead to performance improvements. Finally, as with macaques, the presence of these rotations calls into question the prevailing model of motor cortical activity (i.e., that motor cortical firing patterns represent muscle or movement parameters) in favor of a dynamical systems perspective in humans as well.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Permission for these studies was granted by the US Food and Drug Administration (Investigational Device Exemption) and Institutional Review Boards of Stanford University (protocol # 20804), Partners Healthcare/Massachusetts General Hospital (2011P001036), Providence VA Medical Center (2011-009), and Brown University (0809992560).

The data were originally collected for neural prosthetic decoder calibration, as part of research testing algorithms for closed-loop neural cursor control (Gilja et al., Society for Neuroscience, 2013). In the ‘center-out’ task, participants controlled the position of a cursor on a computer screen by making physical movements with their fingers on a wireless touchpad (Magic Trackpad; Apple, Cupertino, CA). The cursor began in the center of the screen, and targets would appear in one of 8 locations on the periphery. Participants then acquired the targets by moving the cursor over the target and holding it over the target for 500 ms. In contrast to the prior macaque study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Churchland et al., 2012</xref>), the target acquisition task used in this work did not include a delay period. Therefore, participants were free to move as soon as the target appeared. Participant T6 was not limited in her ability to span the workspace of the touchpad. Participant T7's limited movements spanned a small region on the touchpad, approximately 1/8″–1/4″ wide.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Recordings and data analysis</title><p>Data were aggregated over multiple sessions (T6: 8 sessions, T7: 2 sessions).

Choice of threshold was dependent on the array (T6: −60 μV, T7, Lateral array: −80 μV, Medial array: −95 μV). Analyses were restricted to electrodes known to have significant modulation during attempted movements (T6: 39 electrodes, T7: 78 electrodes).

This period began approximately 180 ms and 300 ms after target onset for T6 and T7, respectively, corresponding to a difference in reaction times between participants. Overt movement was detectable at approximately 230 ms and 600 ms after target onset for T6 and T7, respectively.

Each of the three ‘shuffle’ controls preserves the diversity and complexity of responses, but perturbs the structure of the responses at the population level. Specifically, the dynamical model assumes that neural activity during the movement epoch follows in an orderly fashion from its pre-movement state. To test this assumption, the three shuffle control analyses disrupt the relationship between the pre-movement activity and the movement epoch for each channel. If these shuffled data sets still showed prominent rotatory activity, it would indicate that rotations might be found by the jPCA method even when not truly present.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank participants T6, T7, and their families; B Davis, B Pedrick, E Casteneda, M Coburn, B Travers, and D Rosler for administrative support; L Barefoot, P Gigante, A Sachs, S Cash, J Menon, SI Ryu, and S Mernoff for clinical and surgical assistance; J Saab and N Schmansky for technical assistance; JP Cunningham, MM Churchland for helpful comments on the manuscript and jPCA and related MATLAB code; MT Kaufman for helpful comments on the manuscript; JP Donoghue for helpful scientific discussions.</p><p>This work was supported by: Stanford Institute for Neuro-Innovation and Translational Neuroscience; Stanford BioX/NeuroVentures; Stanford Office of Postdoctoral Affairs; Garlick Foundation; Craig H.

We agree, understanding whether ensemble activity exhibits rotational dynamics during imagined movements is a very interesting scientific question. More broadly, we are interested in discerning the cognitive and neurophysiological correlates of imagined or intended movements in people with tetraplegia, and are pursuing this topic as part of our ongoing research. However, we feel this is beyond the scope of the current work. We believe, and the reviewers seem to agree, that the importance of the current short report is the clinical translation of a key finding from non-human primate studies. In contrast, we don't have a good prediction, based on the prior work, for whether motor cortex should show dynamical activity during imagined movements.</p><p>Concretely, if the functional role of rotational dynamics is to serve as an oscillatory basis set for EMG generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Churchland et al., 2012</xref>, Sussillo et al., 2015), then one might expect these dynamics to be absent during imagined movements, when the subject is specifically trying not to move. However, if activity during imagined movements serves as a mechanism for the “covert rehearsal” of activity during overt movements, then dynamics might still be present (but might be, for example, orthogonal to patterns of activity that drive motor output). Due to the complexity of this issue, and the necessity for dedicated experiments and controls, we feel this is better addressed in a follow-on study than in this short report.</p><p>We agree that it is beneficial to raise this interesting question, and have added text (similar to the above) to the Discussion to highlight this issue.</p><p><italic>2) Some words about to what extent the recorded activity can be extrapolated to normal motor cortex function is needed. ALS is a severe motor neuron disease. The Title and Abstract should at least be modified to reflect this (Neural population dynamics in human motor cortex during movements in patients with ALS) and mentioning of this in the Discussion is needed. The fact that the dynamical structure was found may speak to the robustness of the observations</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers' comments: it is important to highlight that the study participants have ALS, and to discuss the relationship between the current findings and humans with normal motor cortex function. (We avoid the use of the word “patient” as the current trial does not medically treat their condition.) To this end, we have modified the Title and Abstract to make this immediately clear, and have expanded the Discussion to consider the implications of these findings for healthy human motor cortex (see text below).</p><p>Title: “Neural population dynamics in human motor cortex during movements in people with ALS.”</p><p>Abstract: “Here we analyze neuronal ensemble activity in motor cortex in two clinical trial participants diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). We find that activity in human motor cortex has similar dynamical structure to that of non-human primates, indicating that human motor cortex contains a similar underlying dynamical system for movement generation.”</p><p>Discussion: “These results demonstrate prominent rotations of the neural population state in human motor cortex during movements. […] and may also hint at which aspects of motor cortical function are preserved despite the progression of a severe motor neuron disease.”</p><p><italic>3) It will be appropriate to address possible ethical issues of using invasive surgical experiments in patients with a severe disease and limited motor function</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that ethical issues in human neuroscience are of paramount importance, but we believe that a detailed discussion of these topics is outside the scope of this very brief report focusing specifically on neuronal population dynamics. Nonetheless, we certainly agree that it is important to state the ethical review process that preceded and continues to accompany this research. We have added a sentence to the main text clarifying that this protocol was approved by multiple institutional review boards and is performed under an Investigational Device Exemption granted by FDA. We have also clarified the Methods regarding this point, and to note that these data were not collected solely for this purpose, but were collected as part of a pilot clinical study testing the safety and feasibility of an intracortical neural interface system (BrainGate, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.braingate2.org">www.braingate2.org</ext-link>) for people with tetraplegia. As part of this carefully performed clinical research, research participants contribute enormously by testing evolving algorithms for closed-loop neural cursor control and by providing feedback on the communication and external device control interfaces being developed for use by people with tetraplegia. In addition, the ability to chronically record motor cortical neuronal ensembles in people—for years at a time—provides a simultaneous and unprecedented opportunity to pose questions and to learn about the human nervous system, not only for its fundamental scientific benefits, but directly toward harnessing that knowledge toward the creation of advanced neural interfaces for people with neurologic disease.</p></body></sub-article></article>
