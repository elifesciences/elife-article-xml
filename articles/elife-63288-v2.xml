Yet, the forces that drive the association of these proteins remain to be delineated, as the lipid bilayer is a solvent environment that is both structurally and chemically complex. In this study, we reveal how the lipid solvent defines the dimerization equilibrium of the CLC-ec1 Cl<sup>-</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter. Integrating experimental and computational approaches, we show that monomers associate to avoid a thinned-membrane defect formed by hydrophobic mismatch at their exposed dimerization interfaces. In this defect, lipids are strongly tilted and less densely packed than in the bulk, with a larger degree of entanglement between opposing leaflets and greater water penetration into the bilayer interior. Dimerization restores the membrane to a near-native state and therefore, appears to be driven by the larger free-energy cost of lipid solvation of the dissociated protomers. Supporting this theory, we demonstrate that addition of short-chain lipids strongly shifts the dimerization equilibrium toward the monomeric state, and show that the cause of this effect is that these lipids preferentially solvate the defect. Importantly, we show that this shift requires only minimal quantities of short-chain lipids, with no measurable impact on either the macroscopic physical state of the membrane or the protein's biological function. Based on these observations, we posit that free-energy differentials for local lipid solvation define membrane-protein association equilibria. With this, we argue that preferential lipid solvation is a plausible cellular mechanism for lipid regulation of oligomerization processes, as it can occur at low concentrations and does not require global changes in membrane properties.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>A cell’s outer membrane is made of molecules called lipids, which band together to form a flexible thin film, just two molecules thick. This membrane is dotted with proteins that transport materials in to and out of cells. Most of these membrane proteins join with other proteins to form structures known as oligomers. Except, how membrane-bound proteins assemble into oligomers – the physical forces driving these molecules to take shape – remains unclear.</p><p>This is partly because the structural, physical and chemical properties of fat-like lipid membranes are radically different to the cell’s watery interior. Consequently, the conditions under which membrane oligomers form are distinct from those surrounding proteins inside cells. Membrane proteins are also more difficult to study and characterize than water-soluble proteins inside the cell, and yet many therapeutic drugs such as antibiotics specifically target membrane proteins. Overall, our understanding of how the unique properties of lipid membranes affect the formation of protein structures embedded within, is lacking and warrants further investigation.</p><p>Now, Chadda, Bernhardt et al. focused on one membrane protein, known as CLC, which tends to exist in pairs – or dimers. To understand why these proteins form dimers (a process called dimerization) Chadda, Bernhardt et al. first used computer simulations, and then validated the findings in experimental tests.</p><p>These complementary approaches demonstrated that the main reason CLC proteins ‘dimerize’ lies in their interaction with the lipid membrane, and not the attraction of one protein to its partner. When CLC proteins are on their own, they deform the surrounding membrane and create structural defects that put the membrane under strain. But when two CLC proteins join as a dimer, this membrane strain disappears – making dimerization the more stable and energetically favorable option.</p><p>Chadda, Bernhardt et al. also showed that with the addition of a few certain lipids, specifically smaller lipids, cell membranes become more tolerant of protein-induced structural changes. This might explain how cells could use various lipids to fine-tune the activity of membrane proteins by controlling how oligomers form. However, the theory needs to be examined further. Altogether, this work has provided fundamental insights into the physical forces shaping membrane-bound proteins, relevant to researchers studying cell biology and pharmacology alike.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>membrane transporter</kwd><kwd>dimerization</kwd><kwd>lipids</kwd><kwd>energetics</kwd><kwd>computational modeling</kwd><kwd>single-molecule</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM120260</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Robertson</surname><given-names>Janice L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21GM126476</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Robertson</surname><given-names>Janice L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Differences in the lipid solvation energetics of associated and dissociated states is a primary driving force for membrane protein oligomerization, presenting a molecular mechanism for lipid regulation in biology.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lipid bilayers are the most common means of chemical compartmentalization in biology. The bilayer interior, formed by the acyl chains, is a ≈30 Å layer of low-dielectric fluid oil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fricke, 1925</xref>) that provides a natural electrostatic barrier for the passage of charged and polar species. This insulating core enables the cell to generate trans-bilayer chemical and electrical potential-energy gradients that fuel essential metabolic functions. While the macroscopic structure of the lipid bilayer is shared across nearly all species and organelles, their chemical compositions are remarkably diverse. For example, phospholipids can vary in their headgroup moieties, in the length and degree of saturation of the acyl chains, and in the chain-headgroup linkage, i.e. ester vs. ether (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van Meer et al., 2008</xref>). Acyl chains can feature modifications such as branching, or even form covalent bonds across monolayers, as in tetraether lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Valentine, 2007</xref>). Lipidomics studies indeed show that cellular membranes include hundreds of lipid types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brügger, 2014</xref>). It has been proposed that this diversity is in part explained by the ‘homeoviscous adaptation’ of cells, that is, the need to maintain an appropriate membrane fluidity under a wide variety of environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sinensky, 1974</xref>). For example, a recent study indicates that under varying dietary fatty acid input, mammalian cells alter the lipid composition of their membranes to regulate this key property (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Levental et al., 2020</xref>). Yet, some of these compensatory chemical changes appear to be excessively redundant. For example, under cold growth temperatures <italic>E. coli</italic> generates unsaturated lipids to increase membrane fluidity, but it also increases production of short-chain lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marr and Ingraham, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sanders and Mittendorf, 2011</xref>). Do these different chemical strategies target others cellular processes that change coincidentally with variations in fluidity? Is there more to the vast diversity in lipid compositions observed across different types of membranes and conditions, beyond the basic requirement of a fluid lipid bilayer?</p><p>One possibility is that this lipid diversity reflects a coupled relationship with the other major constituent of all cellular membranes, namely integral membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Phillips, 2018</xref>). The mechanisms of these proteins are, fundamentally, not unlike those of water-soluble proteins, and entail processes such as molecular recognition, conformational exchange and catalyzed chemistry. For membrane proteins, however, the lipid bilayer provides a distinct reaction environment where lipid molecules are the primary solvent. In any biological equilibrium reaction, the solvent plays a major role in defining the energetic landscape; it seems therefore logical to hypothesize that the variability in the chemical composition of physiological membranes might reflect adaptive mechanisms of regulation of protein structure and function. A key question is, however, how this kind of regulation can be sufficiently targeted and specific, rather than globally disruptive.</p><p>Here, we examine the molecular role of the lipid solvent in a highly prevalent reaction in membrane biology, namely protein oligomerization. Indeed, among membrane-protein classes of known structure, approximately 70% are found as homo- or hetero-oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aleksandrova et al., 2020</xref>), compared with about 55% of water-soluble proteins. This comparison is striking because the principal driving force for the formation of protein oligomers in water, that is, the hydrophobic effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tanford, 1978</xref>), cannot be a dominant factor in the membrane, as its interior is largely dehydrated. Membrane protein complexes do bury large non-polar surfaces, bringing many hydrophobic side-chains into close proximity, in the range of van der Waals interactions. Yet, it is unclear whether these kinds of protein-protein contacts are the main drivers for the association of integral membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cristian et al., 2003</xref>) as these side chains also form numerous, similarly favorable contacts with lipids in the dissociated states. Likewise, it is not evident that interfacial tensions at the protein-lipid boundary are a dominant factor; while the acyl-chain core would favor association to reduce the total area of the protein-lipid interface, the head-group layer has an opposite effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dixit and Lazaridis, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marsh, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Nonetheless, it has long been recognized that the complementarity between membrane proteins and their lipid environment is imperfect, resulting in different kinds of perturbations in the structure and dynamics of the bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mouritsen and Bloom, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marsh, 2008</xref>). In the context of protein-protein association, local perturbations in membrane thickness are particularly noteworthy; this effect, referred to as ‘hydrophobic mismatch’, is a key factor in the dimerization equilibrium of helical peptides such as Gramicidin A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goforth et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersen and Koeppe, 2007</xref>) and WALP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sparr et al., 2005</xref>), and has also been proposed to explain the organization of various rhodopsins and other GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mondal et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pearson et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Soubias et al., 2015</xref>). This type of perturbation results from a suboptimal match between the exposed non-polar surface of a transmembrane protein and the intrinsic thickness of the acyl-chain core of the bilayer, for a given composition. This mismatch typically forces the bilayer to deform, which translates into an energetic penalty; thus, oligomeric states that minimize this penalty are favored, at least in regard to the membrane energetics. Furthermore, because this energetic penalty will depend on the unperturbed bilayer thickness, variations in lipid composition might provide a means for the cell to regulate oligomerization processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersen and Koeppe, 2007</xref>). However, the potential for this seems limited, as there is an inherent biological drive for cells to maintain the basic biophysical properties of their membrane through homeostatic adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Levental et al., 2020</xref>). Yet, in a mixed lipid bilayer that better reflects a biological membrane, it is important to consider that lipids will exhibit differential distributions depending on their energetics. Early lattice models of model membrane systems demonstrated that differential energy terms for lipids around protein surface vs. the bulk would lead to enrichment around proteins, that would in turn provide a lipid-mediated driving force for protein association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marcelja, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sperotto and Mouritsen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sperotto and Mouritsen, 1993</xref>). Thus, we hypothesize that the physiological mechanism of lipid regulated oligomerization equilibrium will involve a molecular mechanism such as this, occurring at low concentrations of regulatory lipids within the membrane, targeting local membrane defects around the protein surface that are introduced by hydrophobic mismatch, and occur in the absence of macroscopic changes in membrane structure.</p><p>A key to evaluating the dominant driving forces for membrane protein oligomerization is to develop assays that quantify this kind of equilibria in lipid bilayers with sufficient accuracy and sensitivity to variations in lipid composition. Previously, we established such an assay based on single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, and carried out measurements of the free-energy of dimerization of the <italic>E. coli</italic> Cl<sup>-</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter CLC-ec1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) in 2:1 palmityl, oleoyl phosphatidyl-ethanolamine/phosphatidyl-glycerol (2:1 POPE/POPG) lipid bilayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chadda et al., 2016</xref>). These membranes are a synthetic mimic of the <italic>E. coli</italic> polar-lipid content, and consist of C16:0/18:1 acyl-chains, the most commonly found in biological membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Phillips, 2018</xref>). While CLC-ec1 had been known to exist as a homodimer in detergent and membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maduke et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dutzler et al., 2002</xref>), our measurements revealed this complex results from association of two functionally competent monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Robertson et al., 2010</xref>), via an interface of about 1200 Å<sup>2</sup>, most of which is inside the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Specifically, the measured equilibrium dimerization free energy for this complex is −10.9 kcal/mole, relative to a standard state of 1 monomer/lipid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chadda et al., 2018</xref>). This is a remarkable finding, in that it implies that the population of dissociated monomers at biological protein-expression levels is virtually zero. This interaction is thus reminiscent of obligate water-soluble homomeric complexes, whose association is dominated by the hydrophobic effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bahadur et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yan et al., 2008</xref>); by analogy, it is reasonable to infer that the energetics of the lipid solvent might also be key for CLC-ec1 dimerization. Indeed, examination of the dimerization interface shows that the two central helices are much shorter than what is typical in transmembrane segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In the monomeric state, a significant hydrophobic mismatch might therefore exist between this protein surface and the surrounding membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), which would be completely eliminated upon dimerization, possibly explaining the remarkable stability of this complex.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The CLC-ec1 dimerization reaction in lipid bilayers.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Side view of the CLC-ec1 homodimer in the lipid bilayer.

That is, can protein-induced membrane deformations contribute to explain the structure and stability of obligate membrane protein complexes? What is the extent of the changes in membrane lipid composition that are necessary to influence these oligomerization reactions, what is the underlying mechanism, and importantly, are those changes physiologically viable, that is, do they preserve or impair protein function? To address these questions, we first use molecular dynamics simulations of monomeric and dimeric CLC-ec1 in 2:1 POPE/POPG, to evaluate the lipid bilayer structure in each state. This analysis informs a series of new experimental assays, namely small-angle neutron scattering measurements, Cl<sup>-</sup> transport assays and single-molecule photobleaching analyses, with which we determine how varying quantities of short-chain C12:0, di-lauryl (DL) lipids alter the dimerization equilibrium as well as the activity of this transporter. To obtain a molecular level interpretation for these new experimental results, we return to molecular dynamics simulations in membrane mixtures that mimic the experimental conditions. These studies lead to a perspective of the dimerization reaction as primarily controlled by the energetics of local lipid solvation of the associated and dissociated states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marsh, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marsh, 2008</xref>), and underscore the essential role of molecular-scale heterogeneity of the lipid bilayer in defining membrane protein association equilibria.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The CLC-ec1 dimerization interface causes a structural defect in the surrounding membrane</title><p>As mentioned, the features of the CLC dimerization interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) suggest that, when exposed in the monomeric state, there might be a hydrophobic mismatch with the surrounding membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). If so, the energetic cost associated with solvating the monomer could translate into an effective driving force toward dimerization; by burying these ‘problematic’ interfaces away from the lipids, the system would gain free energy upon association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To begin to validate or refute this hypothesis, we first studied the structure of the lipid bilayer around the CLC-ec1 monomer and dimer, using coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations, and evaluated whether the exposed dimerization interface indeed appears to cause the membrane to adopt a higher energy state, relative to the other regions of the protein surface. For both monomer and dimer, we used 2:1 POPE/POPG membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), corresponding to the C16:0/18:1 acyl chains used in our previous experimental measurements of the reversible dimerization reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chadda et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>It is worth noting that any simulation of a non-homogenous membrane necessarily presupposes an initial spatial distribution of the lipid components, which is not only arbitrary but also may not be representative of the equilibrium condition. Prior to examining the structure of these membranes, it is therefore key to ascertain that the simulations are long enough for the two lipid components to mix fully and spatially re-distribute according to the free-energy landscape of the molecular system. One way to examine this process of mixing is to quantify, for each lipid in the simulation box, what fraction of all other lipids in the same leaflet are at some point part of their first solvation shell. In our case, this analysis shows that each lipid, on average, is in direct contact with 80% of all other lipids in the course of each of our simulations (i.e. over 1100 molecules) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Given that at any given timepoint, a solvation shell consists of fewer than 10 lipids, this result implies extensive mixing and hence no concern in regard to the starting condition. We also examined the orientation of the protein in the bilayer, which is also an arbitrary initial condition. This analysis indicates that the simulations broadly explore orientation space, resulting in clearly defined probability distributions for both monomer and dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>With sufficient lipid exchange over the time-scale of the simulations, we proceeded to analyze the shape of the lipid bilayer near the monomer and the dimer as well as other structural descriptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). From the simulated trajectories, we calculated 3D density maps reflecting the spatial distribution of both acyl chains and ester linkages in the protein vicinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). The results for the monomer show that the membrane shape is deformed at the dimerization interface, thinning near the two shorter helices at the center. Elsewhere along the monomer perimeter the membrane is largely unperturbed, and its shape is nearly identical to what we observe for the dimer, confirming the simulations are probing the membrane structure reliably. Quantitative analysis of bilayer thickness, measured by the separation between the outer and inner ester layers and represented on a 2D heat map, shows that the magnitude of this thinning defect is about 8 Å relative to the bulk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), that is, nearly a quarter of the unperturbed hydrophobic thickness of this 2:1 POPE/POPG membrane. This defect is also clearly specific to the dimerization interface in the monomeric state, consistent with the 3D density maps. Smaller defects are discernable elsewhere but, as noted, they are indistinguishable if monomer and dimer are compared.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Membrane morphology around CLC-ec1 monomer and dimer from molecular dynamics simulations.</title><p>Results are shown for 2:1 POPE/POPG membranes, averaging eight independent trajectories of ≈ 7.5 μs each for the monomer, and 10 trajectories of ≈ 10 μs each for the dimer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>).

In this case, however, the mean acyl chain end-to-end distance near the protein is only a fraction of 1 Å smaller than the bulk value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>); this minor perturbation is also not specific to the dimerization interface, but is present at other regions. Therefore, the thinning defect that we observe does not arise due to a significant compression of the acyl chains. Instead, our simulations show that increased lipid-chain tilt is in large part what leads to the membrane thinning. This effect is clear from analysis of the orientation of the acyl chains in terms of the coarse-grained equivalent of a second-rank order parameter, which reveals a clear change at the dimerization interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>). To quantify this effect more directly, we evaluated the mean lipid-chain tilt angle across the system, relative to the membrane normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In the bulk, this angle averages to 0° for one leaflet and 180° for the other, as one would expect, as the lipid dynamics are isotropic. Approaching the dimerization interface, however, this angle increases gradually and is maximally deflected by 60°, in both leaflets. This drastic change in orientation can be clearly visualized in 3D by analyzing the ‘average structure’ of the lipid molecules residing at different positions along the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In the bulk, this average yields a linear structure, perfectly perpendicular to the membrane mid-plane, again due to the isotropy of the lipid configurational dynamics. However, inthe lipids that are closest to the dimerization interface (yellow helices), the acyl chains adopt tilted, non-bilayer configurations in order to optimally solvate the protein. Alongside this drastic change in tilt angle, we also observe that near the dimerization interface the acyl chains in one leaflet show a greater degree of inter-digitation with those in the other leaflet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>), compared to the bulk or elsewhere along the protein perimeter.</p><p>In summary, our simulation data clearly shows that when the dimerization interface of CLC-ec1 is exposed to the lipid solvent, it deforms the surrounding membrane by thinning and twisting the bilayer structure (additional effects in lipid density and hydration will be discussed later below). To solvate this ‘problematic’ interface, C16:0/18:1 lipids must adopt non-bilayer configurations that are significantly tilted and more entangled with lipids in the opposite leaflet. Interestingly, the perturbations we observe are in all cases symmetric with respect to the bilayer midplane, consistent with the fact that the CLC-ec1 monomer consists of two topologically inverted structural repeats; this observation further underscores that it is the protein structure that dictates the morphology of the adjacent bilayer. Altogether, these results clearly indicate that optimal lipid solvation of the monomeric state in C16:0/18:1 lipids requires the membrane to adopt a high-energy conformation. Because dimerization completely eliminates this membrane defect, the cost of lipid solvation of monomeric CLC-ec1 must therefore translate into an attractive force. Although the precise magnitude of this stabilizing effect is not directly revealed by the results presented thus far, our single-molecule TIRF assays enable us to evaluate its significance experimentally. That is, if solvation of the membrane defect caused by monomeric CLC-ec1 indeed implies a dominant energetic penalty, then the dimerization equilibrium should be shifted toward the monomeric state by introducing lipids that are a ‘better’ solvent for this defect; this shift should be reflected in the measured free-energy of dimerization.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Evaluating short-chain lipids as an alternative lipid solvent</title><p>Since the membrane defect induced by monomeric CLC-ec1 is constructed by hydrophobic thinning, we decided to test this hypothesis by introducing short-chain di-lauryl (DL) C12:0 lipids into the C16:0/18:1 PO lipid membranes while keeping the overall 2:1 PE/PG headgroup composition constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). DL lipids are shorter than PO lipids by 4–6 carbons per chain, and are also fully saturated, losing the ω−9 double bond in one chain. Before drawing any conclusions in regard to the CLC-ec1 dimerization, we sought to characterize the intrinsic properties of these quaternary lipid bilayers. To do so, we first measured phase-transition thermograms for different DL/PO ratios by differential scanning calorimetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The mixtures show broad profiles; however, the membranes are fluid at room temperature, with the exception of the 100% DL condition. Plotting the peak <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic> as a function of DL shows eutectic behavior with a minimum <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic> at about 30% DL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Next, we examined the structure of the DL/PO bilayers at 25°C with small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). Using a spherical, multi-lamellar liposome model to fit the scattering spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>), we observe a gradual decrease in the bilayer thickness as the DL content is increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>); at 70% DL, the membrane is about 6 Å thinner than that with no DL. This change is consistent with published SANS measurements for POPC vs. DLPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kučerka et al., 2011</xref>) and POPG vs. DLPG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pan et al., 2014</xref>). It also approximately matches the magnitude of the defect created by the CLC-ec1 monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), indicating that the DL lipids in these mixtures might be suitable for solvating the dimerization interface.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Physical properties of 2:1 PE/PG membranes with mixed PO/DL acyl chains.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Chemical structures of lipids POPE, POPG, DLPE, and DLPG.

As the DL content is increased, the observed change in thickness in the simulations reproduce the experimental trend, despite the approximations inherent to the CG forcefield (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Further analysis indicates a high degree of cooperativity between the two lipid-chain types: for example, if the bilayer thickness is quantified by the distance between the two ester layers, there is virtually no difference when this distance is evaluated only for DL vs. PO lipids, at any % DL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). This observation indicates that as DL is added, their lipid headgroups remain aligned with those of the PO lipids so as to minimally perturb the degree of hydration of the headgroup layer. It is worth noting that the average number of contacts formed between the acyl chains in one leaflet and those in the other is also a conserved quantity, regardless of the PO/DL content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). For example, comparing the 0% and 10% DL membranes, we observe that a given DL chain can form only half of the interleaflet contacts seen for the PO chains in the absence of DL. However, to counter this destabilizing effect, PO lipids slightly increase the number of interactions they form across the membrane midplane and become more interdigitated; as a result, the number of chain contacts is, on average, unchanged, but this translates into a thinning of the bilayer. It appears, therefore, that an optimal degree of headgroup-layer hydration and interleaflet contacts dictates the thickness of the pure PO membrane; as DL lipids are added these PO/DL membranes adapt to preserve these two quantities, which requires them to become thinner. The significance of these conserved quantities will be discussed again further below.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Short-chain lipids shift CLC dimerization equilibrium without effect on protein function or global membrane changes</title><p>Following these results, we investigated whether the monomer-dimer equilibrium can be influenced by addition of DLPE/PG lipids to the POPE/PG membranes, using our previously established single-molecule subunit-capture approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chadda et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chadda and Robertson, 2016</xref>). In this method, the protein is site-specifically labeled with a Cy5-maleimide fluorophore and reconstituted into lipid bilayers that are fused into large multilamellar vesicles by freeze/thaw cycles. In this state, the membrane area is sufficiently large to permit monomer and dimer populations to equilibrate according to the association constant of the reaction and the protein to lipid mole fraction, χ<sub>protein</sub>. The oligomeric-state distribution resulting from this equilibrium condition is quantified by fragmenting the membranes into fixed liposome compartments via extrusion, and by counting the probability distribution of subunit capture by single-molecule photobleaching analysis using TIRF microscopy. The photobleaching probability distribution follows a Poisson distribution provided one considers heterogenous compartments and multiple protein species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cliff et al., 2020</xref>), and thus the population of oligomeric species can be quantified using this approach. However, it is also important to control for other factors that affect the probability distribution such as the protein labeling yield and liposome size distribution. Our site-specific labeling procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chadda et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chadda and Robertson, 2016</xref>) provides a consistent labeling yield, <italic>P<sub>Cy5</sub></italic>,<sub>WT</sub> = 0.663 ± 0.005 (mean ± sem, n = 27 independent purifications with Cy5 labeling, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata7">Figure 4—source data 7</xref>); thus, as long as we know the liposome size distribution, we can determine any changes of CLC-ec1 dimerization equilibrium in different lipid environments.</p><p>Using this approach, we set out to study the degree of CLC dimerization in a single mixed lipid condition in which we observe thinner membranes, namely 20% DL. Our first step was to examine the mixed DL/PO liposomes using cryo-electron microscopy imaging. 2:1 PE/PG membranes containing 20% DL and 80% PO were prepared, freeze-thawed into multi-lamellar vesicles, extruded through 400 nm filters and then imaged and analyzed to measure the size distribution directly. The liposomes and membranes appear similar to those in the 0% DL condition (i.e. 2:1 POPE/POPG), with comparable radius and fractional surface area distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>). There is a significant proportion of multilamellar vesicles in both compositions, 44% for 20% DL and 25% for 100% PO samples. Next, WT-Cy5 20% DL liposomes were imaged by single-molecule TIRF microscopy. Example images and raw data for the photobleaching traces for PO and 20% DL liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>) demonstrate no changes in the quality of images obtained in the different lipid conditions. While the cryo-EM imaging indicated no significant differences in liposome size distributions, we also examined the photobleaching probability distributions of two experimental controls: I201W/I422W, referred to as ‘WW’, a version of the protein with two tryptophan substitutions at the dimerization interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Robertson et al., 2010</xref>) that reports the fixed monomer probability distribution; and R230C/L249C, or ‘RCLC’, a disulfide cross-linked constitutive dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nguitragool and Miller, 2007</xref>) that reports the fixed dimer probability distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chadda et al., 2018</xref>). Photobleaching analysis of these controls in 20% DL liposomes show dependencies on the protein mole fraction comparable to those observed for the 2:1 POPE/POPG composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Thus, our analyses indicate that the 20% DL, 80% PO 2:1 PE/PG liposome population is comparable to the 100% PO condition, allowing us to attribute changes in the single-molecule photobleaching distributions to specific changes in CLC dimerization.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>CLC-ec1 dimerization in 2:1 PE/PG membranes with 20% DL and 80% PO acyl chains.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Liposome size distribution of 20% DL liposomes (orange histogram), extruded through 400 nm filters and imaged by cryo-electron microscopy (inset).

Calculation of the fraction of dimer in these protein populations, from least-squares fitting to the WW and RCLC reference distributions, shows that dimerization is significantly destabilized, that is the equilibrium is shifted toward the monomeric state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). By fitting to an equilibrium dimerization isotherm, we estimate a lower-limit of the <italic>K</italic><sub>D,Dimer</sub> &gt; 4.2 ± 1.3 x 10<sup>−6</sup> subunits/lipid, as the reaction falls out of the dynamic range for these measurements leading to an insufficient fit of the reaction. Still, the limited reaction indicates that the 20% DL condition destabilizes dimerization by at least +3 kcal/mole. To verify that this shift reflects a new equilibrium, we also examined whether the mostly dimeric population of CLC-ec1 in 2:1 POPE/POPG lipid bilayers is driven toward the monomer state when fusing the proteo-liposomes with DL-containing membranes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref> shows the resultant distribution of diluting <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>χ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> 2 x 10<sup>−6</sup> subunits/lipid proteoliposomes 1:1 via freeze-thawed fusion with either 0% DL or 40% DL (i.e. final DL proportion is 20%).

Therefore, alternative approaches consistently demonstrate that the short-chain DL lipid shifts the oligomeric distribution of CLC-ec1 toward the monomeric form. Finally, we examined whether CLC-ec1 remained functional in this new membrane environment. To do so, we carried out chloride efflux measurements from CLC-ec1 proteo-liposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Walden et al., 2007</xref>) and quantified the chloride transport activity as a function of DL in the membrane. The protein remained effective at transporting chloride in 20% DL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>), with no difference in the fraction of inactive vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>), and a modest twofold decrease in chloride efflux rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>). Therefore, CLC-ec1 is significantly destabilized toward the dissociated monomeric form in 20% DL, 80% PO 2:1 PE/PG membranes, yet remains a functionally competent chloride transporter in the new lipid composition.</p><p>Next, we examined how dimerization depends on the DL/PO ratio by carrying out a titration experiment, studying the monomer-dimer population as a function of DL, from 10<sup>−8</sup> to 80% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Note these experiments were conducted at dilute protein densities within the membrane, with 1 subunit per million lipids (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>χ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> 1 x 10<sup>−6</sup> subunits/lipid), where WT CLC-ec1 is ≈ 80% dimeric in 2:1 POPE/POPG. Based on our experiments of WW and RCLC controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chadda et al., 2018</xref>), we know a dimeric population is expected to yield comparable probabilities of single and double steps (<italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> ≈ <italic>P<sub>2</sub></italic>), while a monomeric population will exhibit mainly single steps (<italic>P<sub>1</sub></italic> &gt; <italic>P<sub>2</sub></italic>). The reason why a dimeric population includes a significant observation of single steps is because our experimental labeling yield is <italic>P<sub>Cy5</sub></italic> = 0.66, and binomial statistics predicts a nearly equal proportion of singly and doubly labeled Cy5 dimers, as demonstrated by our previous theoretical simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chadda et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chadda and Robertson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cliff et al., 2020</xref>). The raw photobleaching probability distributions show a population shift from nearly all dimers in 0% DL to all monomers at 80% DL, which resembles the distribution of WW in 2:1 POPE/POPG. Calculation of <italic>F</italic><sub>dimer</sub> from these data shows that the impact of DL on dimerization follows two phases with an inflection point around 1% DL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We also examined the dependency of CLC activity on the presence of DL in greater detail by measuring CLC dependent chloride efflux while titrating DL in the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). For samples with 10% DL or less, we observed no change in chloride transport activity; by contrast, at 40% DL there is approximately a 70% reduction in transport rate. To compare how dimerization and function relate to bilayer structure, we plotted the normalized change in the bilayer thickness from the SANS data, Δ<italic>d</italic><sub>B</sub>, with the normalized change in the dimeric population, Δ<italic>F</italic><sub>dimer</sub> and the normalized change in transport rate Δ<italic>k<sub>P</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). From this plot, we can see that &gt; 60% of the dimerization changes occur below 10% DL, that is, before there are any major changes in the macroscopic structure of the membrane. However, the change in chloride efflux rate correlates directly with the change in bilayer thickness.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>CLC-ec1 dimerization depends on DL in two phases.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Photobleaching probability distributions of χ<sub>protein</sub> = 1 x 10<sup>−6</sup> subunits CLC-ec1-Cy5 per lipid as a function of % DL (n<sub>0% DL</sub> = 9; n<sub>1E-8 to 80% DL</sub> = 3–5; n<sub>WW-Cy5, 0% DL</sub> = 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chadda et al., 2016</xref>]).

At DL &gt;1%, the complex is destabilized by 0.8 ± 0.3 kcal/mole for every addition of 10% DL in the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

This coupling describes a microscopic process effected by DL, detectable even when DL is present in minimal amounts. It also indicates the molecular mechanism, as a linear dependency of <italic>ΔΔG</italic> on the logarithm of the co-solvent activity corresponds to a thermodynamic linkage model of preferential solvation, as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tanford, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Record and Anderson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marsh, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Timasheff, 2002a</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Preferential solvation by DL at the CLC-ec1 dimerization interface</title><p>To investigate whether preferential solvation is involved in the mechanism by which DL shifts CLC-ec1 dimerization equilibrium toward monomers, we again turned to CGMD simulations. Specifically, we carried out simulations of the CLC monomer in bilayers of DLPE/DLPG/POPE/POPG lipids with a 2:1 PE/PG ratio and a DL content of either 1%, 10%, 30%, or 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Before drawing any conclusions from these simulations, we again ascertained that these complex bilayers do appropriately mix in the timescale of the trajectories, using a metric identical to that considered for the POPE/POPG simulations. Taking the 50% DL membrane as an example, we observe that by the end of the simulations, any one PO or DL lipid has been in direct contact with about 90% of all other lipid molecules in the same leaflet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>), indicating near-ideal equilibration.</p><p>We then proceeded to examine the structure of these membranes using the same descriptors as those employed above. Interestingly, the thinned-membrane defect around the dimerization interface is still observed in the mixed PO/DL simulations, even for 50% DL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), and is comparable to what we find in the 2:1 POPE/POPG simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). That is, the defect is observed even when the ‘macroscopic’ thickness of the lipid bilayer is reduced; for example, for 50% DL, the thinning is about 5.5 Å. Examination of the average lipid structure across the membrane show that both PO and DL lipids solvate the totality of the protein surface and that, as in the 100% PO condition, the thinned-membrane defect results from both types of lipids becoming increasingly tilted as they approach the dimerization interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, 3D density maps for the first lipid solvation shell indicate these two lipid types are not distributed identically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). At the two interfaces not involved in dimerization, the DL density signal weakens at the center of the membrane, revealing the DL chains are too short to solvate the hydrophobic span of the protein, which is better matched to PO lipids. Conversely, the density signal for PO is weaker than DL at the dimerization interface, and weaker than that seen in the 100% PO membrane, indicating PO is depleted here. This depletion, and the corresponding enrichment in DL lipids, becomes apparent in 2D projections of the percent difference between the observed lipid density ratio (DL/PO) and the expected bulk ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). These data show that the normalized probability of observing DL rather than PO at the dimerization interface is higher than elsewhere in the membrane, irrespective of PO/DL composition. Conversely, DL is depleted at the other two interfaces, consistent with the 3D density analysis discussed above. Quantification of the DL enrichment as a function of the distance from the protein surface reveals this effect extends for up to 30 Å from the dimerization interface and confirms that it is largely independent of the PO/DL ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Preferential DL solvation of the CLC-ec1 dimerization interface in mixed PO/DL membranes.</title><p>Data are shown for 2:1 POPE/POPG membranes with varied proportions of 2:1 DLPE:DLPG, namely 1%, 10%, 30%, and 50%.

Thus, it could be reasonably argued that this ‘macroscopic’ effect would reduce the energetic cost of the thinned-membrane defect caused by monomeric CLC-ec1, irrespective of whether one lipid type or another is preferentially enriched, and thereby cause a shift in the dimerization equilibrium. It is important to note, however, that the enrichment effect we report is discernable at 1% DL, that is, in conditions where there is virtually no change in the global thickness of the bilayer, relative to the PO condition, both in experiment and simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref>). Yet, 1% DL has a profound impact on the dimerization equilibrium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Limitations in computing speed currently preclude us from verifying this effect for even smaller quantities of DL lipids with adequate statistically significance. Nevertheless, the existing results underscore that a process distinct from a change of the global properties of the membrane is dominant in this regime, which we posit is that of preferential lipid solvation.</p><p>The observation of near complete lipid mixing in our simulations implies that the enrichment of DL at the dimerization interface is neither artifactual nor transient but rather a minimum free-energy state of the lipid-solvent structure. What are the molecular factors that explain this observation, that is, what drives the preferential residence of DL over PO in this specific region of the membrane? As mentioned above, our simulation data for the pure PO/DL bilayers indicates that the collective degree of interdigitation between opposing leaflets is a conserved quantity that dictates membrane structure. This interdigitation can be quantified by metrics such as the average number of interleaflet contacts formed by the acyl-chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,H</xref>). With this observation in mind, 2D maps of the number of interleaflet lipid contacts for the CLC-ec1 systems reveal key differences that seem to explain why DL is enriched at the dimerization interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). In the bulk, there is no difference between the 100% and 50/50 PO/DL conditions, for example, when all lipids are averaged. The number of interleaflet contacts is again a conserved quantity, as observed for the pure bilayers. At the CLC-ec1 dimerization interface, however, this conserved quantity cannot be matched by the PO lipids; whether for 100% PO or 50/50 PO/DL, PO lipids create an excessive, clearly non-native overlap between leaflets. By contrast, when at the dimerization interface, DL chains very closely reproduce the conserved bulk values. Thus, by segregating PO lipids away from this interface, and accumulating DL lipids instead, the system minimizes the negative impact of the thinned-membrane defect created by the CLC monomer, shifting the equilibrium toward the dissociated state.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>DL enrichment of membrane defect partially restores native-like properties.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Analysis of the average number of contacts formed by each of the acyl chains of a given lipid (either both PO and DL, PO only, or DL only) and any other acyl chain in the opposing leaflet. The results are mapped across the membrane plane, for either the CLC-ec1 dimer or the monomer, in either 100 PO or 50/50 PO/DL. This is the same quantity reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref> for the pure PO/DL bilayers, but here it is mapped in 2D, and is calculated with the protein present. Note the number of contacts formed by DL lipids at the defect induced by monomeric CLC-ec1 approximately matches the bulk values for 100 PO or 50/50 PO/DL (regions of map in gray); by contrast, PO lipids exceed the bulk quantity.

(<bold>C</bold>) Analysis of the extent of water penetration of the acyl-chain interior of the bilayer, for either the dimer or monomer and either the 100 PO or 50/50 PO/DL condition.

In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, for example, we quantify how the number of lipid near-neighbors varies across the membrane. The data shows that in 100% PO the CLC monomer introduces a clear lipid-density defect at the dimerization interface, particularly at the level of the headgroup and ester-linkage layers. This perturbation, in turn, leads to a marked increase in the degree of water penetration of the hydrocarbon interior of the bilayer, by almost threefold relative to the bulk-membrane values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). As noted earlier, these perturbations impact both leaflets, in a manner that reflects the internal symmetry of the CLC monomer, and very likely signify a major energetic cost. The preferential solvation of the dimerization interface by DL does not entirely eradicate these defects, but it is clear from our data that they are greatly minimized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,C</xref>). In view of these results, we can plausibly infer that in the PO/DL conditions the energetic cost of lipid solvation of the monomer is reduced, relative to the pure PO condition. This preferential solvation effect would in turn explain the shift in dimerization equilibrium observed experimentally, particularly at low DL concentrations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study demonstrates that the dimerization of a membrane protein can be driven in large part by the energetic cost of lipid solvation of the monomeric state, due to the exposure of a protein surface that deforms the membrane structure. While other factors may also contribute to the overall stability of the dimer, the significant dependency on membrane forces observed in this study implies that this oligomerization equilibrium can be regulated through variations in the chemical and physical nature of the lipid bilayer. In our studies, we observe that the monomer-dimer free-energy balance can be modulated by a mechanism of preferential solvation, that is, the enrichment of specific lipid types that are more naturally predisposed to reside in the membrane defect caused by the dissociated protomers. This is an effect that occurs with low quantities of the modulatory lipid in the membrane, before macroscopic changes in membrane thickness are apparent, and where the functionality of the protein is preserved. In contrast, when global changes in membrane thickness become significant, the dimerization equilibrium has already shifted drastically, and the physical state of the membrane is observed to degrade protein function. Thus, we find that preferential solvation is a plausible contender for a mechanism of physiological regulation of membrane protein complexes in biological membranes. In the following sections, we discuss the molecular basis and physiological implications of such findings.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Elimination of membrane defects drives CLC-ec1 dimerization</title><p>Our computational studies demonstrate that the CLC-ec1 monomer in 2:1 POPE/POPG introduces a non-native thinned defect in the surrounding membrane, due to the exposure of the shorter central helices that form the core of the dimerization interface. Experimentally, we have measured that the free energy of CLC-ec1 dimerization in 2:1 POPE/POPG lipid bilayers is −10.9 ± 0.1 kcal/mole (one subunit/lipid standard state). Given the nature of the perturbations caused by the monomer, and the fact that this free-energy value can be drastically shifted by addition of minimal amounts of DLPE/DLPG lipids, we believe it is very likely that this dimerization reaction is driven largely by the energetics of the membrane, with protein-protein interactions contributing on a smaller scale. Conclusive evaluation of this hypothesis will however require further experimental and computational investigations of the dimerization equilibrium for a range of protein constructs in different lipid bilayers and conditions, and a direct quantification of the anticipated differences in lipid solvation energetics of associated and dissociated states, in each case.</p><p>The concept that protein-induced membrane defects can translate into an effective driving force toward oligomerization presents a generalizable solution to the problem of membrane protein self-organization, while allowing for evolutionary adaptations in amino acid sequence that might be advantageous. In this perspective, association primarily depends on the overall protein architecture and the general chemical features of the protein surface. Strict conservation of specific amino acids at specific sites on the protein surface is thus not critical though not entirely inconsequential. Membrane protein complexes may thus evolve high shape-complementarity, for example to maximize the exclusion of lipids in the complexed form of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2013</xref>), and thereby achieve greater stability. Indeed, previous analysis showed that CLC-ec1 exhibits high shape-complementarity, comparable to other high-affinity antigen antibody complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Robertson et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>As noted, membrane perturbations appear to influence the association of other systems as well. Assembly of Gramicidin A peptides into functional ion-channel dimers results in a hydrophobic mismatch with the surrounding bilayer, and thus dimerization can be inhibited by increasing the global membrane thickness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goodall, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mobashery et al., 1997</xref>). FRET measurements for reconstituted Rhodopsin have indicated the formation of higher order assemblies when the membrane is thicker or thinner than a certain range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Botelho et al., 2006</xref>). Computational studies have rationalized this kind of spatial organization as resulting from anisotropic defects in membrane thickness or curvature, which become mitigated upon association in specific geometries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mondal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kahraman and Haselwandter, 2019</xref>). A striking illustration of this concept is found in the inner mitochondrial membranes, where ATP synthases, each a dimeric complex, spontaneously assemble into micrometer-scale linear arrays, priming the membrane to invaginate and form cristae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anselmi et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blum et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, there is a growing body of evidence that suggests that membrane-dependent forces are a key factor in the self-assembly and organization of membrane protein complexes. To our knowledge, however, this study is the first to probe how such forces can dictate the oligomerization equilibrium of a strongly-bound integral membrane protein complex, in the absence of global physical membrane changes, and without compromising its biological functionality.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Preferential solvation vs. site-specific binding</title><p>The notion that dissociated and associated states of a membrane protein oligomer can perturb the bilayer in distinct ways, as a result of hydrophobic mismatch, implies it is conceivable that cellular mechanisms exist through which variations in lipid composition can regulate this type of equilibria. However, different mechanisms can be envisaged. The relative energetics of solvation of the dissociated and associated states would logically be altered if there is a global change in membrane thickness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersen and Koeppe, 2007</xref>). Alternatively, a different mechanism could involve that certain lipids bind to the 'problematic’ protein-membrane surface, in a manner similar to conventional agonists or antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Song et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Neither of these mechanisms, however, explain our experimental data. The first effect that we observe is when short-chain saturated DL lipids are added to PO bilayers at extremely low DL activities, ranging from 1 DL per 10<sup>10</sup> PO up to 1% DL. In this regime, we determined that the bilayer thickness is identical to that of PO membranes, and we measure no change in protein function. Yet, upon increasing the amount of DL, we detect a gradual correlated increase in the monomeric proportion of CLC-ec1, and this effect appears to be linear with respect to the logarithm of DL over six orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–H</xref>). At first, it seems intuitive to interpret this data as a process of competitive inhibition, that is, one or more DL-specific binding sites might exist at the dimerization interface, with a lipid affinity of <italic>K<sub>D,DL</sub></italic>, the occupancy of which precludes dimerization. However, we can immediately see that our data do not agree with this type of linkage. This type of model would lead to complete saturation of the population of the monomeric state over a much narrower increase in % DL, at most thousand-fold, and centered at the hypothetical <italic>K<sub>D,DL</sub></italic>. The gradual, linear relationship of the decay of the dimeric population with the logarithm of % DL that we observe in our data, over six orders of magnitude, is simply not in agreement with a model of site-specific competitive binding.</p><p>Lipid-composition effects can be however conceptualized beyond the paradigms of bimolecular recognition or global morphological changes. If we consider lipids as solvent molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marsh, 1995</xref>), a different type of linkage model, used to examine mixed aqueous solvent systems, explains our observations. The stability of soluble proteins, both as oligomeric assemblies or folds, is known to be dependent on the relative activities of the co-solvents present, due to preferential solvation effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tanford, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Record and Anderson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schellman, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schellman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Timasheff, 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee and Timasheff, 1981</xref>). That is, one state of the protein might be ‘preferentially solvated’ by a given co-solvent, and so an increase in that co-solvent activity shifts the reaction equilibrium to that state. This is a form of linkage that describes how proteins can be stabilized or destabilized by salts, glycerol, sugar, or chaotropic denaturants. It does not involve specific binding, but rather non-specific affinities that lead to a linear dependency of the change in free energy with the log-activity of the co-solvent, that is, log(K<sub>eq</sub>) ∝ log(a<sub>DL</sub>), as we observe in our experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p><p>While preferential solvation alone, that is, without bulk-membrane changes, had not been previously experimentally demonstrated to impact the formation of obligate complexes of integral membrane proteins, the notion that the features of the protein-lipid interface can dictate the spatial distribution of different lipid types in its vicinity has been previously documented. Early Monte Carlo simulations of membrane lattice models showed that consideration of differential energetics for annular lipids, and different lipid types, accounts for lateral enrichment of lipids around proteins, introducing a potential lipid-mediated driving force for aggregation in membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marcelja, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sperotto and Mouritsen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sperotto and Mouritsen, 1993</xref>). More recently, CGMD simulations of a wide set of membrane proteins in highly complex bilayers, it was observed that each protein induces a unique lipid solvation structure, akin to a ‘lipid fingerprint’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Corradi et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly, a simulation study of the Gramicidin A dimer in a two-component bilayer with C16:1 and C24:1 acyl-chains, reported that the latter become underrepresented in the first solvation shell, as the C16:1 chains better match the hydrophobic thickness of the dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beaven et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The experiments and simulations described in our study indeed confirm that preferential solvation effects alone can dictate the energetics of oligomerization reactions for integral membrane proteins, even those that are assumed to be obligate oligomers, where the associated form appears to be derived from evolutionarily pressures, for example CLC. That the monomer causes a thinned-membrane defect that is eliminated upon dimerization is key. We observe how at this defect the distribution of PO and DL lipids diverges from what would be expected based on their bulk ratio, and the shorter DL lipids become enriched while the PO lipids are depleted. This enrichment is specific to the dimerization interface, and therefore also specific for the monomeric state that exposes this interface. And importantly, it is observed irrespective of the PO/DL content of the bilayer, as could be expected for an effect that is dictated by the protein itself. Thus, although any deviation from the bulk-membrane homogeneity does entail a free-energy penalty, the larger gains resulting from a more optimal solvation of the exposed dimerization interface ultimately translate into a strong shift in favor of the monomeric state.</p><p>As is logical, the preferential solvation effect is ultimately superseded by more global changes in the state of the membrane; according to our SANS experiments, these changes begin to take place when the DL proportion exceeds 10%, which is the kind of change in lipid composition that has been typically evaluated in previous studies of membrane-driven organization processes. In this regime, we do observe an additional depletion of the dimer population, corresponding to the second phase of our dimerization data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), because the energetic penalty of solvating the monomer is further reduced as the membrane becomes thinner. It is possible that this change in energetic relationship reflects a change in the relative lipid energetics, however, in this high-DL range we also observe a correlated decrease in CLC-ec1 transport activity. That is, while the thinner DL/PO membranes match the exposed dimerization interface better, they also compromise the functional integrity at high DL. While we do not have direct structural information about the protein under these conditions, one plausible interpretation for this functional degradation is that the structural mechanism of the protein is somehow impaired in globally thinner membranes. Preferential solvation would thus appear to be a more viable mechanism of lipid regulation of oligomerization reactions of specific species under physiological conditions where biology strives to maintain global membrane properties.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Physiological implications for lipid modulation of membrane proteins</title><p>Preferential solvation is a generalizable effect that could modulate any equilibrium whereby one or more protein states introduce a local morphological defect into the membrane. Besides oligomerization reactions, this effect likely defines the energetics of the intermediate conformational states that are encountered during membrane protein folding, as well as gating, transport, and signaling. Given the highly complex composition of real biological membranes, one can therefore envisage that each of these conformational states will have a different local lipid composition, optimized to stabilize the structure of the membrane in that state. The relative free-energies of the combined protein-membrane system in each state will therefore be dependent on the lipid types that are available, which the cell can alter through for example regulation of lipid synthesis and degradation pathways.</p><p>While membrane protein reactions can be severely influenced in laboratory conditions through drastic changes in the chemical and physical state of membrane, a critical point to note is that a plausible regulatory mechanism must be effective in the actual range that is physiologically viable. Cell membranes are known to undergo changes in lipid composition due to many external factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marr and Ingraham, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sanders and Mittendorf, 2011</xref>); yet, it is rare for a membrane to change its composition so much that its macroscopic structure is significantly altered. For instance, the membranes of <italic>E. coli</italic> cells grown at colder temperatures will primarily decrease chain saturation, with only minor changes to the amount of short-chain lipids. The resulting changes are presumed to maintain fluidity while maintaining an appropriate thickness of the membrane so that the majority of membrane proteins remain properly solvated and can still function optimally. Homeostatic adaptation of macroscopic membrane properties have been shown for mammalian cells also (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Levental et al., 2020</xref>). As far as we know, there is no situation where a cell will change the overall macroscopic thickness of its membranes due to a physiological stimulus. Therefore, when contemplating possible mechanisms of physiological regulation within the membrane, and particularly with chain-length in mind, we must consider that they should be consistent with low-level changes of these types of lipids within the membrane. Our experiments show that CLC-ec1 dimerization is sensitive to the amount of the short-chain DL lipid in the membrane; even at low levels, from 10<sup>−8</sup> to 1%, we observe a gradual and non-saturating impact, indicating that dimerization is tunable without a global change in the state of the membrane. The resulting change in the dimer population, from 80% to 50%, could certainly impart a physiological effect if it was linked to a cell signaling function. It is equally important to note that the phenomenon of preferential solvation naturally allows for this gradual tuning, as opposed to what would be expected for a process of site-specific lipid-ligand binding, which would inhibit dimerization in a switch-like manner over a much narrower range of DL-lipid concentrations. While site-specific binding mechanisms may be at play for some types of processes and specific lipid types, we anticipate that preferential solvation effects will be found to control diverse kinds of membrane protein equilibria in physiological settings.</p><p>Our examination of the impact of short-chain lipids on CLC-ec1 dimerization sheds light on a potentially ubiquitous mechanism of action by regulatory molecules within the membrane. In simulations, we observe the CLC-ec1 monomers force PO lipids to adopt non-native conformations, and many of the features of the bilayer near the dimerization interface, ranging from lipid tilt-angle to interleaflet contacts or water exclusion, are radically different from those in the bulk. When DL lipids are present, they disproportionately accumulate at this defect, spontaneously, while maintaining non-specific interactions. In doing so, DL lipids restore some of the bulk-like features to the bilayer near the dimerization interface. That is, although the defect remains, DL is a better solvent for it, and thereby stabilizes the dissociated monomeric state. A small lipid like DL could thus be considered a chemical that drives disaggregation, analogous to chaotropic denaturants stabilizing the un-folded states of proteins in aqueous solution. Many regulatory molecules in membranes are also small fatty acids; pharmacological agents like general anesthetics are small non-polar molecules as well. It is possible that these small lipoidal factors act similarly to DL in the problem examined here, and that they preferentially solvate and stabilize the membrane in states where local deformations and defects created by a protein become exposed. This may promote protein disaggregation, especially at high enough densities, and shift membrane protein equilibria to optimize activity. Altogether, our findings lead to the hypothesis that the complexity of lipid compositions found in biological cell membranes, leveraged through mechanisms such as preferential solvation, permits the cell to regulate and fine-tune the reactions of membrane proteins within – folding, oligomerization, and conformational changes – amidst the extremely variable conditions that life faces. It will be fascinating to continue to unravel the nature of these processes through further experimental and simulation studies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study provides fundamental insights into an ubiquitous process in membrane physiology, namely protein oligomerization. It also yields a novel perspective of the mechanism by which cells could regulate the stability of membrane protein complexes through subtle variations in the lipid composition of the bilayer. Specifically, we have posited that a principal driving force for the oligomerization of membrane proteins stems from differences in the lipid solvation energetics of the associated and dissociated states. Such differences arise when one of the states in equilibrium introduces a perturbation in the bilayer, for example due to hydrophobic mismatch, which would not be naturally observed otherwise, therefore implying a significant free-energy cost from the membrane standpoint. A driving force that originates in the energetics of lipid solvation is by definition highly sensitive to the composition of the membrane. In this regard, the perspective that emerges from this study differs from models that postulate site-specific binding or global changes in the state of the membrane. In our perspective, the lipid bilayer is a system of co-solvents that can alter their spatial distribution so as to preferentially solvate one or more of the states of any given reaction. A particular state might be therefore favored or disfavored, statistically speaking, depending on the energetics of the solvation structure that is achievable by a given co-solvent mixture. It follows that minimal changes in the lipid composition of the membrane can have a profound effect on specific oligomerization reactions, without any global morphological changes that might broadly compromise protein functionality, that is, what is expected for a physiologically realistic regulatory process.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations</title><p>All simulations were calculated with GROMACS 5.2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2015</xref>) using the MARTINI 2.2/ElNeDyn22 forcefield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wassenaar et al., 2015</xref>). Temperature and pressure were maintained constant at 303.15 K and 1 bar, using the velocity-rescale thermostat and the Parrinello-Rahman semi-isotropic barostat, respectively. Equations of motion were integrated using the leapfrog algorithm with a time step of 20 fs. Electrostatics were treated with the reaction field method using a cutoff of 1.2 nm. To ensure statistical significance, several independent runs were performed for each system (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref> for further details). The simulations are based on the crystal structure of wild-type CLC-ec1 dimer deposited in the Protein Data Bank, entry 1OTS (resolution 2.51 Å) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dutzler et al., 2003</xref>).

The total system charge was neutralized by addition of Na<sup>+</sup> ions, and the system buffered with NaCl to a concentration of 150 mM. The preparatory stages included an 15,000-steps energy minimization using the steepest-descent method, and a 5-ns equilibration to bring the system to desired temperature and pressure. To simplify the visualization and analysis of trajectories, the protein was not permitted to rotate around the Z-axis (i.e. the membrane perpendicular) or to diffuse away from the membrane center. Note this is strictly equivalent to re-defining the laboratory frame as the molecular frame for each snapshot, and thus these restrictions have no impact on the sampling of the internal configurational space. These orientational/translational restraints were implemented with PLUMED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonomi et al., 2009</xref>); specifically, two centers-of-mass, A and B, were defined using elements of helices H/P (residues 406–409, 411, 412, 194–196, 197, 198) and the linker regions between M/N and E/F (residues 138, 143–145, 347, 348, 351–353). In the monomer simulations, harmonic potentials were used to keep both A and B on the YZ plane and equidistant from the membrane center. In the dimer, centers A and B were combined into a single center per monomer, C, and the same restraints were applied to keep the dimer on the YZ plane. The vertical drift of the membrane was also removed prior to trajectory analysis, by re-centering each snapshot so that the midpoint of centers A and B is fixed in place. For the pure bilayer simulations, the same was accomplished by holding fixed the z-component of the membrane center. To map any given descriptor of the lipid structure onto the x-y plane, a grid consisting of square cells each with an area of 0.005 Å<sup>2</sup> was constructed. Data derived from analysis of individual lipid molecules in each simulation snapshots were mapped onto specific grid points based on the XY position of the corresponding ester beads (GL1 and GL2); specifically, data was added to all grid points contained within the van der Waals radius of the beads. The grid-point data was then averaged over the all trajectory snapshots. To ascertain which grid-points reflect statistically significant data, the frequency with which each grid point was assigned to any lipid, referred to hereafter as the occupancy number, was annotated. Grid points with less than 40% of the average occupancy were considered to be not statistically significant and excluded from graphical representations and/or global averages. Occupancy numbers were also used to quantify the enrichment of DL lipids in the mixed PO/DL systems, relative to the bulk ratio.

The chloroform was evaporated under a continuous stream of 0.22 μm filtered N<sub>2</sub> gas (Ultra High Purity Nitrogen 5.0 Grade; Airgas). The dried lipid mass, was dissolved at least once in 2:1 chloroform/methanol followed by 1–2 washes in 3:1 pentane/dichloromethane and drying while rotating, leaving a thin film of lipids along the walls and the bottom of the glass vial.

Next, after addition of 161.3 mg (21.5 mg/ml) CHAPS and 7.5 ml Dialysis Buffer (DB: 300 mM KCl, 20 mM citrate pH 4.5 (adjusted with NaOH)) sonication was performed leading to a translucent suspension of the CHAPS/POPE/POPG mixture.

Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, including Merritt Maduke as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Olaf S Andersen (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors report a careful examination of the influence of lipids on membrane-protein dimerization energetics. Using a combination of computational and experimental approaches, they examine the physical properties of mixed-lipid bilayers (containing different fractions of short-chain lipids) over a broad range of compositions, and they also examine the influence of these bilayer compositions on protein dimerization and activity. They conclude that the major influence on protein dimerization energetics is due to &quot;preferential solvation&quot; (localized bilayer deformation) rather than bulk hydrophobic mismatch. These ideas have been raised in previous literature, but this is the first time they have been tested experimentally at this exquisite level of detail, showing that very low mole-fractions of a &quot;well-matching&quot; lipid can drive the monomer-dimer equilibrium towards monomer. The extraordinary sensitivity of the method, with single-molecule resolution, is impressive. A major concern is that the authors have not done justice to describing and discussing previous studies. In addition, there are several questions concerning the computational aspects of this study. We suggest that the manuscript would benefit from substantial reorganization – emphasizing the experiments, expanding discussion of the literature, and removing, explaining and/or correcting the PMF analysis.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Introduction: The claim that &quot;the physical factors controlling membrane-protein assembly in membranes are largely unknown&quot; is an overstatement. There is a literature on membrane protein dimerization that is not quoted, including: (Lewis and Engelman, 1983), (Pearson et al., 1983), (Goforth et al., 2003) and (Rokitskaya et al., 2003). Other relevant literature should be discussed and attributed more thoroughly. See partial Reference list below. (There are many additional articles published on this topic by the labs cited.)</p><p>2. Lines 114-5: The authors should quote (Marsh, 2008), who reached a similar conclusion. See also comment relating to Lines 130-4.</p><p>3. Lines 130-4: The authors seem to assume that there is no interfacial tension between the protein's transmembrane domain and the bilayer core. This is almost certainly incorrect, cf. (Marsh, 2008).</p><p>4. Lines 137-140: This is similar to what was proposed by (Mondal et al., 2013)</p><p>5. Lines 179-180: We do not follow the logic. How do you exclude chain compression? You do address most of concerns in the following text, but this statement bothers us.</p><p>6. Paragraph beginning with Line 345: this is important, but we recommend citing similar studies done by others (Beaven et al., 2017; Sodt et al., 2017). The literature on lipid enrichment adjacent to membrane proteins is contentious, as summarized in Beaven et al.</p><p>7. The color schemes used in the figures are not color-blind friendly. This is a major problem because many of the figures cannot be interpreted if the colors cannot be seen.</p><p>8. Figure 3D, E: what are the dashed lines indicating?</p><p>9. Figure 4A,B: The &quot;fraction of inactive vesicles&quot; does not appear to provide a rigorous analysis of the number of vesicles without active protein, as the way it is measured involves adding detergent before the activity has plateaued. This analysis can be removed, so the focus can be on the chloride efflux rate as a measure of activity.</p><p>10. Lines 263 and 269: The statements concluding that there is no difference in CLC-ec1 structure/function for samples &quot;with less than 20% DL&quot; are misleading. First, the experiments measure function, not structure. Second, the only measure of function is Cl<sup>-</sup> flux. It has not been determined that there are no effects on H<sup>+</sup> flux and coupling stoichiometry. Finally, the functional data presented show results from 10% DL and 20% DL but nothing in between. For line 263, the statement should be rephrased to &quot;…for samples with 10% or less DL&quot;. For line 269, a more significant change is necessary. The authors should explain clearly why they chose to perform subsequent experiments using 20% DL, given that there is a significant effect (not &quot;no change&quot;) on Cl<sup>-</sup> flux rates at 20% DL. One explanation for the ~50% decrease in activity at 20% DL is the fact that (as determined in later experiments), 20% DL yields ~100% monomer, and it is known that the monomer has ~50% the activity of the dimer. (Related to this point – what is the physical basis of this decrease in activity? This should be discussed. It is not necessarily due to a change in the overall structure, as the structure of the WW mutant is not discernably different from WT.)</p><p>11.

Lines 322-341 and Figure 5G-I. You have not made a case for two phases. Figure 5G is misleading and does not provide evidence for two phases: even a linear relation (single exponential decay) will look &quot;steep&quot; between 1 and 100% if you start the plot at 10<sup>-8</sup>. When the same data are plotted with a linear y-axis (panel H), they seem to be well fit to a single exponential. Please report all the fitted parameters (not just the &quot;tau,&quot;) and a measure of the goodness-of-fit. Please also use a different symbol than &quot;tau&quot;. Given the above, we are confused by the steep rise in δ-δ G in panel I; please clarify.</p><p>16. Lines 489-491. &quot;Yet, upon increasing the amount of DL, we detect a gradual correlated increase in the monomeric proportion of CLC-ec1, and this effect appears to be linear over six orders of magnitude in the % DL (Figure 5F-H)&quot; This is related to point 16 and is confusing: do you mean that the amount of dimer/trimer is linear over six orders of magnitude in %DL, in which case the amount of monomer should appear exponential on a log plot? or that the free energy is linear?</p><p>17. Lines 406-8: What do you mean by &quot;hydrophobic matching&quot;? You equally well could argue that you are dealing with hydrophobic matching, but a more dynamic matching where the match is achieved by enriching the bilayer adjacent to the protein with the &quot;better fitting&quot; lipid molecules. It is unclear exactly what the difference is between the whole protein being mismatched and a piece of the protein being mismatched. From the way the manuscript is written, it appears to be that lipid rearrangement reduces the strain. But in a multicomponent bilayer this will always happen regardless of whether the whole protein is mismatched or only a piece of it (see point 19; Beaven et al). So, the distinction is not clear.</p><p>18. Line 529-533. Do you have independent evidence for the effect of membrane thickness on the structural integrity of the protein? The reduction in transport activity could be a straightforward consequence of the coupling between membrane proteins' conformational preference and bilayer thickness.

Your revised article has been evaluated by Richard Aldrich (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor and three of the original reviewers.</p><p>This revised manuscript addresses satisfactorily our concerns about the original version. There remain just a few specific comments that need to be addressed.</p><p>1. The novelty of the study resides in the experimental results, which are first-in-kind. The organization of the manuscript, where the experimental results are presented as tests of the predictions of the molecular dynamics, may well represent the actual timeline of the study, but may obscure the importance of the experimental results. Given the present organization, we request that the manuscript include a brief but comprehensive summary of earlier studies on the lateral distribution of lipids adjacent to a membrane protein, where we note the absence of citations of the pioneering studies of Ole G. Mouritsen and colleagues.</p><p>2. One thing that is not quite clear to us from the text is whether you are proposing that the energetics are a combination of a K<sub>D</sub> for lipid binding to the largest deformations around the protein plus less-specific binding as DL% increases. Both of these factors would act through the membrane deformation energy and hydrophobic mismatch. That was our understanding from reading the text but we might have misinterpreted the explanation. That is, you identify two explanations and you identify two exponentials in the fit. We can understand not wanting to definitively state the mechanism but the clarity suffers somewhat. We think this would benefit from a statement of conjecture at the end?</p><p>3. The authors conclude: &quot;In our perspective, the lipid bilayer is a system of co-solvents that can alter their spatial distribution so as to preferentially solvate one or more of the states of any given reaction.&quot; This statement we found to be so general as to be consistent with previous treatments of hydrophobic matching (e.g. Beaven et al., which found lipids redistribute to the protein). What we found especially exciting was that the deformation is so powerful that it appears some sites appear to act like strong binding sites.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63288.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Introduction: The claim that &quot;the physical factors controlling membrane-protein assembly in membranes are largely unknown&quot; is an overstatement. There is a literature on membrane protein dimerization that is not quoted, including: (Lewis and Engelman, 1983), (Pearson et al., 1983), (Goforth et al., 2003) and (Rokitskaya et al., 2003). Other relevant literature should be discussed and attributed more thoroughly. See partial Reference list below. (There are many additional articles published on this topic by the labs cited.)</p><p>2. Lines 114-5: The authors should quote (Marsh, 2008), who reached a similar conclusion. See also comment relating to Lines 130-4.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this oversight. We have rewritten this section in the introduction, removing the previous statement, and have provided more background and citations to previous work in this area, including these studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Lines 130-4: The authors seem to assume that there is no interfacial tension between the protein's transmembrane domain and the bilayer core. This is almost certainly incorrect, cf. (Marsh, 2008).</p></disp-quote><p>The hypothetical contribution of an interfacial tension is now mentioned in the revised introduction (page 4, lines 102-105). As noted, it is unclear when or if this effect will be dominant, as the interfacial tension for the acyl chains and the headgroups likely have opposite signs – as noted in Marsh, BBA 2008. A recent interesting article by Dixit and Lazaridis (JCP 2020) confirms and quantifies these as competing effects, at least for a model cylindrical geometry. In future studies it will be of interest to further evaluate these effects for more realistic geometries.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Lines 137-140: This is similar to what was proposed by (Mondal et al., 2013)</p></disp-quote><p>This study is now cited. It is important to note, however, that what we examine here is the formation of an obligate, strongly-bound membrane protein complex. The free energy of association that underlies specific complex formation of GPCRs has not been determined experimentally, to our knowledge, but it appears unlikely to approximate what is observed for CLC-ec1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Lines 179-180: We do not follow the logic. How do you exclude chain compression? You do address most of concerns in the following text, but this statement bothers us.</p></disp-quote><p>By “chain compression”, we refer to a change in the average length of the acyl chains, which we believe has been used to conceptualize membrane thickness/curvature perturbations in molecular terms. Our simulation data, however, shows that the time-averaged end-to-end distance of the acyl chains is nearly invariant (within 1 Å) across the bilayer, including in the thinned-membrane defect caused by monomeric CLC. This defect would therefore not be accurately conceptualized as resulting from spring-like compressions of the acyl chains; what we observe instead is strong chain tilt and a greater degree of interdigitation between the two monolayers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Paragraph beginning with Line 345: this is important, but we recommend citing similar studies done by others (Beaven et al., 2017; Sodt et al., 2017). The literature on lipid enrichment adjacent to membrane proteins is contentious, as summarized in Beaven et al.</p></disp-quote><p>These studies are now cited and discussed in some detail (page 19, lines 581-591).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The color schemes used in the figures are not color-blind friendly. This is a major problem because many of the figures cannot be interpreted if the colors cannot be seen.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed all problematic figures as requested; in particular the color scales of the 2D maps are now blue/white/red, which is visible by the majority of color-blind individuals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Figure 3D, E: what are the dashed lines indicating?</p></disp-quote><p>This figure has been changed and the dashed lines are now removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Figure 4A,B: The &quot;fraction of inactive vesicles&quot; does not appear to provide a rigorous analysis of the number of vesicles without active protein, as the way it is measured involves adding detergent before the activity has plateaued. This analysis can be removed, so the focus can be on the chloride efflux rate as a measure of activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We have repeated the analysis by measuring the rate as the initial slope of the transport following addition of valinomycin, and present this in Figure 4 —figure supplement 2. This method assumes constant active protein across all samples, and thus reflects changes in function. We note that while the values of the rates are about 80% of the rates from the fits to the exponential association, there is no difference in the dependency on DL. Thus, the change in transport is robust and independent of the estimation of the fitting method. In addition, in the case of the 20% DL, the plateau is visible within the transport trace and thus estimation of F0 is possible. We note, that we have measured the leak rate from the DL liposomes (Figure 4 —figure supplement 2), which allows us to constrain this component of the fit. With this, we choose to keep the F0 analysis in the updated Figure 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Lines 263 and 269: The statements concluding that there is no difference in CLC-ec1 structure/function for samples &quot;with less than 20% DL&quot; are misleading. First, the experiments measure function, not structure. Second, the only measure of function is Cl<sup>-</sup> flux. It has not been determined that there are no effects on H<sup>+</sup> flux and coupling stoichiometry. Finally, the functional data presented show results from 10% DL and 20% DL but nothing in between. For line 263, the statement should be rephrased to &quot;…for samples with 10% or less DL&quot;. For line 269, a more significant change is necessary. The authors should explain clearly why they chose to perform subsequent experiments using 20% DL, given that there is a significant effect (not &quot;no change&quot;) on Cl<sup>-</sup> flux rates at 20% DL. One explanation for the ~50% decrease in activity at 20% DL is the fact that (as determined in later experiments), 20% DL yields ~100% monomer, and it is known that the monomer has ~50% the activity of the dimer. (Related to this point – what is the physical basis of this decrease in activity? This should be discussed. It is not necessarily due to a change in the overall structure, as the structure of the WW mutant is not discernably different from WT.)</p></disp-quote><p>We have made the suggested changes to the text, and revised the figures to now include a single figure on the 20% DL results that includes the functional data. With this, we expect that it is clearer that our purpose of studying the system at 20% DL, is that it is a composition where there is a significant change in the membrane thickness, and the protein retains a comparable chloride transport activity, noting that a 2-fold change in rate is minimal.</p><p>While it is an interesting hypothesis that the monomer is the cause of the 2-fold decrease in transport rate, we have evidence that shows this is not the case. A change in transport activity that depended solely on the monomeric state would mean that we would expect to see a dependency of the transport rate saturating with the dimeric population. However, Figure 5C shows that this is not what is observed. At 1 and 10% DL, we see a significant shift to monomers, yet no change in chloride transport properties. We do not yet know why there is a small change in transport function, however, we speculate that in the case of 20% DL and higher, that it is related to the thinning of the lipid bilayer, and in the case of the WW construct, the change is related to the tryptophan mutations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. Line 286: &quot;…allows us to achieve a consistent labeling yield&quot;. This statement needs to be explained and justified</p></disp-quote><p>We have added references to our previous papers where we have described the details of site-specific labeling of C85A/H234C CLC-ec1. In addition, we report the labeling yields, P<sub>Cy5</sub>, for all of the WT constructs, and reference the corresponding tables. Note, these references were already in the methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. Line 292: &quot;slight shift towards larger liposomes&quot;.

On what basis do the authors judge it to be &quot;slight&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>We carried out a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test indicating that there is no significant shift between the 20% and 0% DL distributions, and have therefore taken this statement out.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13.

By “hydrophobic matching” we meant a change in the bulk membrane thickness i.e. a global rather than local effect. One of the key conclusions of this study is that kind of global change is not required to induce strong shifts in an oligomerization equilibrium; through preferential solvation effects, marginal variations in lipid composition can have a drastic impact on this type of process, while the membrane morphology is negligibly altered. We recognize the term “hydrophobic matching” is somewhat ambiguous as it does clearly differentiate between global and local effect, so to avoid misinterpretation we have omitted it altogether from the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18.

We also believe it would be important to have a more elaborate evaluation of its underlying assumptions, and how it compares with other theoretical approaches, e.g. those based on continuum models. Since the manuscript is as long as it is, and given that it seems uncontroversial to state the membrane perturbation caused by monomeric CLC entails some energy cost, we have decided to remove a precise quantification of this cost from the manuscript, and will discuss the methodology we propose and our results elsewhere. For the public record, however, there was no error in the information presented. The units of the PMF shown in the original version of Figure 2I were correct as shown, i.e. kcal/mol. Analysis of the trajectory data indeed leads to a free-energy density, in units of kcal/mol/area, but the PMF shown results from integration of this density over an area equivalent to the average area-per-lipid. In regard to the deformation free energies, calculated free-energy shifts derived from comparison of the 100% PO condition with data for 1-50% DL (not included in the previous version) do not, in fact, reflect “massive changes in dimerization energy”, as the reviewer speculates. The calculated values are in fact comparable in magnitude and in sign to those deduced experimentally. As mentioned, these results and the underlying methodology will be reported and discussed in detail elsewhere.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>20.

We have however re-organized the manuscript and figures substantially, to improve its clarity and conciseness:</p><p>– Figure 2 focuses on the thickness and lipid tilt changes in 100% PO</p><p>– Figure 4 shows all of the results pertaining to the 20% DL condition</p><p>– Figure 5 has been reorganized to show the titration data of DL, with the functional data included as a supplementary figure</p><p>– Figure 6 shows the computational findings of preferential solvation</p><p>– Figure 7 shows the lipid analysis focusing on the changes between the PO and DL solvation</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This revised manuscript addresses satisfactorily our concerns about the original version. There remain just a few specific comments that need to be addressed.</p><p>1. The novelty of the study resides in the experimental results, which are first-in-kind. The organization of the manuscript, where the experimental results are presented as tests of the predictions of the molecular dynamics, may well represent the actual timeline of the study, but may obscure the importance of the experimental results. Given the present organization, we request that the manuscript include a brief but comprehensive summary of earlier studies on the lateral distribution of lipids adjacent to a membrane protein, where we note the absence of citations of the pioneering studies of Ole G. Mouritsen and colleagues.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate your recognition of the novelty of these results. We also recognize that the principle of lateral organization of lipids and lipid-mediated protein aggregation has been introduced by Marčelja in 1976 and expanded on by Mouritsen and others, and have expanded the introduction and discussion to include these references.</p><p>However, we disagree that a comprehensive summary is necessary here. Our study focused on the dimerization of CLC, and was not specifically guided by Mouritsen’s previous work, though we absolutely agree that these concepts were predicted by his work and others. Still, our study was strictly guided by a detailed analysis of a physically-based model of CLC in its surrounding membrane. As such, we disagree that presentation of this computational analysis first “may obscure the importance of the experimental results”, and ask for the consideration of the reviewers that the organization of this paper has been deliberated deeply, and we have assessed that this layout represents the most logical and objective approach to investigating the CLC reaction.</p><p>Let us consider rearranging the presentation as suggested. If one looks at the structure of the CLC dimerization interface, we would see that there are shorter helices that may perturb the membrane. We would have to guess that the membrane would be thinned, and then hypothesize that a shorter chained lipid would be a better solvent for this interface. But then, without knowing any structural information about the defect, we would be forced to take a leap in logic in deciding what lipid to choose. If we pretend that we have no quantitative information about the defect structure, we hit an illogical point in our study, having to rationalize a complete guess as to why we conducted the experiments that we did. Simply put, if one hypothesizes a defect to exist, and has the ability to analyze its structure by computational modeling, then this is the most appropriate first step in the investigation. Also, it demonstrates the advantages of quantitative analyses before jumping into the guess-work of experiments. We are confident that the way we have presented the data, computational and experimental, offers the best objective investigation of the question at hand and serves as a model as to how interdisciplinary projects should be presented.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. One thing that is not quite clear to us from the text is whether you are proposing that the energetics are a combination of a K<sub>D</sub> for lipid binding to the largest deformations around the protein plus less-specific binding as DL% increases. Both of these factors would act through the membrane deformation energy and hydrophobic mismatch. That was our understanding from reading the text but we might have misinterpreted the explanation. That is, you identify two explanations and you identify two exponentials in the fit. We can understand not wanting to definitively state the mechanism but the clarity suffers somewhat. We think this would benefit from a statement of conjecture at the end?</p></disp-quote><p>We have already presented an argument on page 18, lines 524-537, outlining why our data does not correspond with lipid binding. For clarification, the mechanism that we demonstrate is one in which the protein introduces a thinned defect, presumably by hydrophobic mismatch, and that DL preferentially solvates this defect leading to a linkage of the dimer equilibrium to the co-solvent activity. We have revised the paper to make an effort to clarify this whenever possible.</p><p>The discussion paragraph on page 20, lines 579-493, already outlines several possible reasons why there may be a second phase in the dimerization relationship with respect to DL composition, thus we do not think any additional conjecture is needed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors conclude: &quot;In our perspective, the lipid bilayer is a system of co-solvents that can alter their spatial distribution so as to preferentially solvate one or more of the states of any given reaction.&quot; This statement we found to be so general as to be consistent with previous treatments of hydrophobic matching (e.g. Beaven et al., which found lipids redistribute to the protein). What we found especially exciting was that the deformation is so powerful that it appears some sites appear to act like strong binding sites.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. This is a general statement because it allows for the connection of a macroscopic model such as hydrophobic matching with a molecular model, such as preferential solvation. The wording of this sentence follows the summaries that have been used to describe the exact same phenomenon for soluble protein equilibria.</p><p>For clarification, we do not identify any lipid binding sites in this study, nor is it possible to assess from the enrichment maps alone, whether enriched regions reflect a strong binding stability. In fact, our experimental observations do not agree with strong site-specific lipid binding, as the paragraph on page 18, lines 524-537, describes. We agree that there is a preferential affinity demonstrated in the enrichment maps, but our results indicate that this is achieved by non-specific preferential solvation, which should not be grouped into the same type of affinity as a specific lipid binding “site”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
