When a cell fails to complete pyroptosis, backup pathways will initiate apoptosis. Here, we investigated the utility of apoptosis compared to pyroptosis in defense against an intracellular bacterial infection. We previously engineered <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium to persistently express flagellin, and thereby activate NLRC4 during systemic infection in mice. The resulting pyroptosis clears this flagellin-engineered strain. We now show that infection of caspase-1 or gasdermin D deficient macrophages by this flagellin-engineered <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium induces apoptosis in vitro. Additionally, we engineered <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium to translocate the pro-apoptotic BH3 domain of BID, which also triggers apoptosis in macrophages in vitro. During mouse infection, the apoptotic pathway successfully cleared these engineered <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium from the intestinal niche but failed to clear the bacteria from the myeloid niche in the spleen or lymph nodes. In contrast, the pyroptotic pathway was beneficial in defense of both niches. To clear an infection, cells may have specific tasks that they must complete before they die; different modes of cell death could initiate these ‘bucket lists’ in either convergent or divergent ways.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Although alive and healthy cells are essential for survival, in certain circumstances – such as when a cell becomes infected – it is beneficial for cells to deliberately die through a process known as regulated cell death. There are several types of regulated cell death, each with distinct pathways and mechanisms. However, if the initial pathway is blocked, cells can use an alternative one, suggesting that they can compensate for one other.</p><p>Two forms of regulated cell death – named pyroptosis and apoptosis – can be used by infected cells to limit the spread of pathogens. However, it was not clear if these two forms or additional ‘back-up’ apoptosis pathways – which are induced when pyroptosis fails – are equally efficient at clearing infections and how they might vary in different cell types.</p><p>To address this, Abele et al. investigated cell death in live mice infected with the bacterium <italic>Salmonella</italic>. Different organs in which the bacterium infects distinct cell types were examined. Experiments showed that pyroptosis could eliminate bacteria from both intestinal cells as well as immune cells found throughout the body, called macrophages. In contrast, apoptosis was only able to clear infection from intestinal cells.</p><p>The findings can be explained by prior studies showing both apoptosis and pyroptosis lead to the same outcome in intestinal cells – dead cells are expelled from the body through a process called extrusion to maintain the barrier function of the intestine. However, in macrophages, the different pathways lead to different outcomes, indicating they are not entirely interchangeable.</p><p>Overall, the findings of Abele et al. underscore the complexity of cellular responses to infection and the nuanced roles of different cell death pathways. This provides further evidence that cells might have specific tasks they need to complete before death in order to effectively clear an infection. These tasks may differ depending on cell type and the form of regulated cell death, and may not be equally efficient at clearing an infection.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pyroptosis</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd><italic>Salmonella</italic></kwd><kwd>regulated cell death</kwd><kwd>extrusion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI133236</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miao</surname><given-names>Edward A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI139304</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miao</surname><given-names>Edward A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI136920</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miao</surname><given-names>Edward A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI133236-04S1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harvest</surname><given-names>Carissa K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Research Fellowship Program DGE 2139754</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Abele</surname><given-names>Taylor J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Clearance of engineered <italic>Salmonella</italic> which trigger regulated cell death is dependent upon the cellular 'bucket list,' which is determined both by cell death signaling pathway and by cell type infected.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Regulated cell death (RCD) is essential to the survival of a species. There are many reasons why a cell may initiate death signaling, including DNA damage, disruptions to the cell cycle, or detection of an intracellular infection. Subsequently, there are several pathways through which a cell can accomplish RCD, including apoptosis and pyroptosis. These forms of RCD are essential in immune defense against a variety of intracellular pathogens. Failing to accomplish cell death could allow a pathogen to replicate unchecked in a sequestered intracellular niche. On the surface, it might seem that terminating the intracellular replication niche is the most important task for RCD to accomplish. In this case, any modality of RCD should be sufficient to counteract an intracellular infection. That said, apoptosis and pyroptosis have distinct consequences.</p><p>Apoptosis is a non-lytic form of RCD that does not inherently cause inflammation. Apoptosis can be initiated via intrinsic or extrinsic signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Czabotar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nagata and Tanaka, 2017</xref>). The intrinsic pathway is regulated by the BCL-2 family of proteins, which monitor the cell for signs of damage or stress. Cellular stress leads to the activation of the pro-apoptotic subset of this family, called BH3-only proteins (e.g. BID). When these activation signals overcome inhibition by the anti-apoptotic subset of this family (e.g. BCL-2, MCL-1), it leads to assembly of BAK and/or BAX that form pores on mitochondria. The resulting mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) leads to the release of cytochrome <italic>c</italic>. Cytochrome <italic>c</italic> initiates the formation of the apoptosome, activating caspase-9, which in turn cleaves and activates caspase-3, the prototypical executioner for apoptosis. Caspase-9 and –3 also activate caspase-7, which can cleave many of the caspase-3 target proteins that drive apoptosis, but whose unique function is to hyperactivate membrane repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nozaki et al., 2022b</xref>). Apoptosis can also be activated by cell-extrinsic pathways through death receptors (e.g. FAS, TNFR1), which in turn leads to the activation of caspase-8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Czabotar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nagata and Tanaka, 2017</xref>). These signaling pathways can reinforce each other, as caspase-8 can also cleave BID. Caspase-3 then cleaves numerous substrates that together convert a cell into apoptotic bodies.</p><p>In contrast, pyroptosis is a lytic, inherently inflammatory form of RCD typically initiated by inflammasomes, which detect signs of infection within the cytosolic compartment. Some inflammasomes directly detect microbial molecules, including proteins, LPS, or DNA; other inflammasomes indirectly detect the cytosolic perturbations caused by toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jorgensen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nozaki et al., 2022a</xref>). For example, NLRC4 can detect the activity of bacterial type III secretion systems when they aberrantly inject flagellin, rod, or needle proteins. These are directly detected via NAIP5/6, NAIP2, and NAIP1, respectively. NLRC4 can signal directly to caspase-1 to initiate pyroptosis, or indirectly via the ASC adaptor (encoded by <italic>Pycard</italic>). ASC facilitates enhanced caspase-1 activation and is necessary for caspase-1 to efficiently cleave the cytokines pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their mature forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Broz et al., 2010b</xref>). However, after NLRC4 activation, the direct activation of caspase-1 results in gasdermin D cleavage and activation without a requirement for ASC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Broz et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kovacs and Miao, 2017</xref>). Cleaved gasdermin D then forms a pore on the cell membrane, which is large enough to release mature IL-1β and IL-18 from the cell and to cause pyroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Xia et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>While apoptosis and pyroptosis are caused by distinct signaling events, there is nevertheless cross-talk between these pathways. For example, there are distinct nodes where pyroptotic signaling proteins can also initiate apoptotic signaling. If downstream pyroptotic signaling is then inhibited, the cell will undergo apoptosis instead. Herein, we refer to these pathways as backup apoptosis. The most apical node is ASC, which can recruit caspase-8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pierini et al., 2012</xref>). Below this, caspase-1 can activate two different backup apoptosis pathways – by cleaving BID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guégan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heilig et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tsuchiya et al., 2019</xref>) and by cleaving caspase-7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lamkanfi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mahib et al., 2020</xref>). Although we propose that the primary function of caspase-7 is to drive membrane repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nozaki et al., 2022b</xref>), when it is activated in the absence of pores it might result in a partial form of apoptosis. All of this raises the question: are apoptosis and pyroptosis equal and redundant by simply eliminating the intracellular niche?</p><p>Many intracellular bacteria have evolved mechanisms to evade detection by inflammasomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jorgensen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lacey and Miao, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maltez and Miao, 2016</xref>). Therefore, backup apoptosis could restore cell death in the case of bacteria that inhibit pyroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Luchetti et al., 2021</xref>). To evade detection by inflammasomes, <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium encodes two distinct T3SS apparati. The <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenicity island 1 (SPI1) T3SS is used to invade epithelial cells. However, the flagellin that is co-expressed is detected by NLRC4, as are the SPI1 rod and needle proteins, albeit less efficiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jorgensen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pereira et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). This detection is protective for the host in a mouse gastroenteritis model by reducing <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium intracellular burdens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Broz et al., 2010a</xref>). Once <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium has successfully invaded a cell and occupies the <italic>Salmonella</italic>-containing vacuole (SCV), it represses SPI1 and instead expresses SPI2. The SPI2 T3SS evades detection by NLRC4 via mutations on its rod proteins and by repressing flagellin expression. This evasion permits intracellular replication in epithelial cells and macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Broz et al., 2010a</xref>).</p><p>We previously demonstrated that during this SPI2-driven intracellular phase, <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium can be engineered to activate NLRC4. This was accomplished by expressing the NLRC4 agonist FliC under a SPI2 promoter, herein called FliC<sup>ON</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Miao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miao et al., 2010a</xref>). FliC<sup>ON</sup> <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium are detected by NLRC4 during the intracellular phase both in vitro and in vivo. This detection results in the clearance of FliC<sup>ON</sup> during systemic mouse infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jorgensen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jorgensen and Miao, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miao et al., 2010a</xref>). This illustrates that the reason why <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium normally represses flagellin is that pyroptosis is extremely detrimental to the bacterium during intracellular replication. Furthermore, FliC<sup>ON</sup> <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium is useful as an experimental tool with which to investigate the effectiveness of pyroptosis in vivo. At the time of our prior publications, the backup apoptotic pathways were not yet discovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heilig et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Motani et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tsuchiya et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we investigate whether apoptotic pathways could be useful in clearing intracellular infection. Because <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium likely evades apoptotic pathways, we again use engineering in order to create strains that will induce apoptosis. This allows us to study apoptosis in a controlled manner in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>FliC<sup>ON</sup> <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium activates apoptotic backup pathways in vitro</title><p>We first investigated the relative contribution of these backup pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) during FliC<sup>ON</sup> infection by examining in vitro infections in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) from various knockout mice. We wished to focus on the intracellular SPI2-driven phase of infection. To ensure SPI1-genes were not expressed, we grew <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium in SPI2 inducing media prior to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Miao et al., 2002</xref>). As an additional measure, we used <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium that were deficient for flagellin and SPI1 (<italic>flgC</italic> and <italic>ΔprgH-K</italic>) so that NLRC4 could only be activated by the engineered FliC<sup>ON</sup> system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As a negative control, <italic>Nlrc4</italic><sup>–/–</sup> BMMs did not activate either pyroptotic or backup apoptotic pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>). <italic>Casp1</italic><sup>–/–</sup> BMMs retain the ASC to caspase-8 pathway; and indeed, we observed weak caspase-8, BID, and caspase-3 cleavage at 4 hr post-infection (hpi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), indicating that this pathway is relatively slow. In contrast, <italic>Gsdmd</italic><sup>–/–</sup> BMMs remain competent for both the ASC to caspase-8 and the caspase-1 to BID pathways; and indeed, we observed stronger cleavage of BID, caspase-9, and caspase-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

We fused the pro-apoptotic BH3 domain of murine BID to the T3SS secretion signal of SspH1 via an HA tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This SspH1<sup>SS</sup>-HA-BID<sup>BH3</sup> protein was expressed from a SPI2 promoter; we refer to these bacteria as BID<sup>ON</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The BH3 domain of BID is sufficient to activate BAX/BAK to cause MOMP, which should lead to intrinsic apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). BID<sup>ON</sup> bacteria grew normally in LB media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In WT BMMs, BID<sup>ON</sup> caused caspase-3 cleavage, while a negative vector control without the BID<sup>BH3</sup> domain did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The weaker HA band in SspH1<sup>SS</sup>-HA-BID<sup>BH3</sup> compared to SspH1<sup>SS</sup>-HA could be due to caspase-3 cleaving after aspartates within the HA tag, which can efficiently destroy the HA epitope.

Coincidentally, SspH1<sup>SS</sup>-HA-BID<sup>BH3</sup> is similar in length to full-length endogenous BID (predicted 21 kDa and 20 kDa, respectively), and resolved as a thicker band or sometimes as a doublet at ~20 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

The difference between the kinetics of these apoptotic pathways is likely due to the efficient detection of FliC by the NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome, which has a theoretical sensitivity to detect a single flagellin protein molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>).

We hypothesized that specific inflammatory signals such as IL-1β, IL-18, or other cytosolic molecules released by pyroptosis might be required to promote bacterial clearance after RCD. These would be produced during FliC<sup>ON</sup> infection in WT mice, but should be absent during BID<sup>ON</sup> infection. To include pyroptosis-induced inflammatory signals during a BID<sup>ON</sup> infection, we created a triple competitive index model, wherein a single mouse is infected with equal ratios of vector control, FliC<sup>ON</sup>, and BID<sup>ON</sup> simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). We show that even in the presence of FliC<sup>ON</sup>, BID<sup>ON</sup> cannot be cleared from the spleen to the same degree as FliC<sup>ON</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–G</xref>). Therefore, FliC<sup>ON</sup> does not create a proinflammatory environment in the spleen that alters the failure of BID<sup>ON</sup> to be cleared. We noted a slight reduction in BID<sup>ON</sup> burdens compared to the vector control in this triple competitive index model that is likely an early manifestation of non-specific attenuation due to <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium engineering that will be described in another manuscript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abele et al., 2023</xref>).

We crossed these mice with either <italic>Lyz2-cre</italic> (also known as <italic>LysM-cre</italic>), which deletes caspase-1 from myeloid cells, or <italic>Mrp8-cre</italic>, which deletes caspase-1 efficiently from neutrophils and does not efficiently delete caspase-1 in monocytes and macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Abram et al., 2014</xref>).

Therefore, cell-intrinsic apoptotic pathways can also clear engineered <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium from the IEC compartment, but not from lymph nodes or the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>There are many, interconnected pathways which cells utilize during regulated cell death. Such backup pathways may be useful in a situation where a pathogen has evolved to inhibit the primary mode of RCD. Here, we demonstrate that pyroptosis and apoptosis are not equivalent in their ability to clear engineered <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium infection. We hypothesize that clearance after RCD is cell-type-dependent because of what happens both before and after cell death occurs. Once a cell initiates cell death signaling, it ‘knows’ that it will die (or rather, evolution has created signaling cascades that are predicated upon the initiation of RCD). However, each cell has distinct goals that it needs to complete before it loses all functional capacity, which we recently proposed to be termed ‘bucket lists’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nozaki and Miao, 2023</xref>). Successful completion of such bucket lists have beneficial effects after the cell dies. Bucket lists can be different in distinct cell types as well as in different signaling pathways in the same cell type. In the case of <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium, the bacterium targets two distinct cell types: IECs and macrophages. After an IEC dies, it must ensure that it does not leave behind a hole in the epithelial barrier. The bucket list of an IEC is relatively similar after pyroptotic or apoptotic signaling is initiated, as both pathways trigger the extrusion program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rauch et al., 2017</xref>). Regardless of the initiating signaling events, an IECs key goal of maintaining barrier integrity after death remains the same. In contrast, a macrophage is not a barrier cell and, therefore, has no such bucket list task. Instead, in macrophages pyroptosis and apoptosis result in two different bucket lists. Pyroptosis converts a cell into pore-induced intracellular traps (PITs), whereas apoptosis converts a macrophage into apoptotic bodies, which are morphologically and immunologically distinct structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Elliott and Ravichandran, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jorgensen et al., 2016b</xref>).</p><p>The bucket list of an IEC is centered around two goals: to remove the affected IEC from the body meanwhile maintaining epithelial barrier integrity. IECs accomplish both goals via a process called extrusion. After initiating either pyroptotic or apoptotic caspases, rather than immediately undergoing classic ‘pyroptosis’ or ‘apoptosis,’ an IEC first disassembles its cytoskeleton, then reassembles an actomyosin contractile ring to squeeze itself out of the monolayer. Neighboring cells simultaneously constrict beneath the dying IEC as it extrudes, maintaining barrier integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blander, 2018</xref>). The extruded IEC is thereby shed from the body. Using non-engineered WT <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium during oral infection, Sellin et al., show that NLRC4 reduces bacterial burdens in the cecum by triggering IEC extrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sellin et al., 2014</xref>). Rauch et al. showed that these IECs can extrude via either the pyroptotic or backup apoptotic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rauch et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, either pyroptotic or apoptotic signaling can reduce <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> burdens from IECs during oral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Roncaioli et al., 2023</xref>). These conclusions are identical to the conclusion we draw from the FliC<sup>ON</sup> and BID<sup>ON</sup> engineered <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium models. We propose that both pyroptotic signaling via caspase-1 and gasdermin D as well as backup apoptotic signaling via caspases-8/9/3 all converge upon similar bucket list tasks that drive similar IEC extrusion programs. It should be noted that pyroptotic signaling in IECs also induces the release of IL-18 and eicosanoids as part of the pyroptotic bucket list (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Müller et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rauch et al., 2017</xref>). In regard to <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium infection, these additional signaling molecules influence <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium dissemination only at 72 hpi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Müller et al., 2016</xref>). Overall, extrusion driven by either pyroptotic or apoptotic pathways is sufficient to reduce both engineered and non-engineered <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium burdens in the IEC compartment within 48 hpi.</p><p>More recently, Hausmann et al. showed that this IEC extrusion is not only beneficial to reduce the infected IEC compartment, but also restricts dissemination of <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium to the draining MLN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hausmann et al., 2020</xref>). This detection only occurred in IECs and not in macrophages in the MLN because non-engineered WT <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium only expresses flagellin and SPI1 rod/needle during the invasion of IECs. After dissemination to macrophages, the non-engineered bacteria have successfully repressed flagellin expression and switched from SPI1 to SPI2 T3SS, thereby evading NLRC4 detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hausmann et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, flagellin-engineered FliC<sup>ON</sup> prevents this evasion, triggering NLRC4-dependent pyroptosis. Using FliC<sup>ON</sup>, we previously showed that after pyroptosis, the dead macrophage turns into a pore-induced intracellular trap (PIT) that traps <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium in the cell corpse within which it is subsequently efferocytosed by neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jorgensen et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jorgensen et al., 2016b</xref>). Neutrophil ROS is then ultimately responsible for killing FliC<sup>ON</sup>, as mice deficient in phagocyte oxidase are no longer able to clear FliC<sup>ON</sup> after pyroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jorgensen et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miao et al., 2010a</xref>). Therefore, there are at least two tasks on the bucket list of a pyroptotic macrophage: to trap bacteria within the PIT and to recruit neutrophils for efferocytosis. Pyroptosis also has other consequences that have not yet been fully proven to be essential bucket list tasks, including damaging intracellular bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jorgensen et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Thurston et al., 2016</xref>), releasing cytosolic molecules including nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kovacs and Miao, 2017</xref>), disrupting mitochondrial membranes to produce ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Torre-Minguela et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Valenti et al., 2022</xref>), and activating NINJ1 to cause membrane rupture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kayagaki et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Apoptosis in macrophages, on the other hand, has a bucket list that is distinct from that of pyroptosis. An apoptotic macrophage packages itself into smaller apoptotic bodies which are then typically efferocytosed by other macrophages in what is classically an anti-inflammatory manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Morioka et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Poon et al., 2014</xref>). This bucket list requires careful disassembly and packaging of the internal cellular contents without losing membrane integrity, while also selectively releasing ‘find me’ and ‘eat me’ signals for the efferocytosing macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Elliott and Ravichandran, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Morioka et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ravichandran, 2011</xref>). In situations where our engineered <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium induce apoptosis, they should be trapped within these apoptotic bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Martin et al., 2012</xref>). However, the apoptotic bucket lists tasks fail to clear our engineered <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium from the macrophage compartment. This failure is not universal to all pathogens, as there is robust evidence that apoptosis successfully leads to the clearance of other intracellular bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Martin et al., 2012</xref>). For example, non-engineered WT <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> is cleared via apoptosis after cytotoxic T lymphocyte attack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McDougal and Sauer, 2018</xref>). Further, <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> that have been engineered to directly induce intrinsic apoptosis (analogous to our BID<sup>ON</sup> <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium) is also cleared in the spleen and liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Theisen and Sauer, 2017</xref>). Backup apoptosis is also successful in reducing bacterial replication in the lung during <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Akhter et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gonçalves et al., 2019</xref>). However, these apoptotic backup pathways are not successful in clearing other intracellular bacteria, similar to our results. The ASC to caspase-8 backup pathway was first reported in the context of <italic>Francisella novicida</italic> infection in caspase-1 deficient macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pierini et al., 2012</xref>). While the authors report that both pyroptosis and backup apoptosis limit bacterial replication in vitro, this did not translate to a difference in survival or bacterial burdens in a mouse infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pierini et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, <italic>C. violaceum</italic> is cleared from the spleen via pyroptosis in WT mice, but backup apoptosis fails to clear <italic>C. violaceum</italic> in pyroptotic knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harvest et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maltez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nozaki et al., 2022b</xref>).</p><p>Why did apoptosis fail to clear our engineered <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium in macrophages? We speculate that <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium has virulence strategies that prevent apoptosis from being an effective clearance mechanism within the macrophage compartment. <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium within apoptotic bodies might infect efferocytosing macrophages, preventing effective clearance analogous to the Trojan Horse from Greek mythology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Giusiano, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Poon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Saha et al., 2021</xref>). Another possibility is the slower kinetics of apoptosis compared to pyroptosis permits bacterial replication before host cell death, and in this regard the longer retention of cytosolic nutrients within the apoptotic body may be beneficial to <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium. Additionally, apoptotic cells can release specific metabolites that can be harvested by <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson et al., 2021</xref>). Adaptive immunity may change the consequences of apoptosis for <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium in the macrophage compartment. Indeed, Doerflinger et al., used Δ<italic>aroA S.</italic> Typhimurium at 3 weeks post-infection and saw the beneficial utility of apoptotic signaling in clearing the bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doerflinger et al., 2020</xref>). Our engineered system is not amenable to studying later timepoints as overexpression of translocation signals can have detrimental effects that only manifest after 48 hpi (manuscript in press). Nevertheless, our findings show that apoptotic engineering fails to drive innate immune clearance against <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium within macrophages. A final possibility is that our engineered strains are not successfully triggering apoptosis within splenic macrophages. This could be due to intrinsic differences between BMMs and splenic macrophages or could be due to bacterial virulence factors that fail to suppress apoptosis only in vitro. It is quite difficult to experimentally proves that apoptosis occurs in vivo due to rapid efferocytosis of the apoptotic cells. Any of these reasons could explain why apoptotic engineering did not result in clearance of the bacteria.</p><p>Here, we show that clearance of engineered <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium after RCD is dependent upon the cellular compartment. Pyroptotic signaling leads to rapid clearance of engineered <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium from both the intestinal and myeloid compartments, while apoptotic signaling leads to clearance only within the intestinal compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Within IECs, pyroptotic and apoptotic signaling lead to the same extrusion bucket list and, therefore, are equally sufficient in clearing both engineered and non-engineered <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rauch et al., 2017</xref>). This is likely due to the ability of extrusion to remove the infected cell and its intracellular bacteria from host tissues, forcing the bacteria to attempt invasion anew. <italic>Salmonella</italic> species are likely adapted to this invasion and re-invasion process, however, tipping the balance towards more efficient extrusion should benefit the host. Importantly, within the macrophage compartment, neither pyroptosis nor apoptosis intrinsically removes bacteria from the host tissue. Therefore, the unique bucket list during pyroptosis that recruits neutrophils to clear the bacteria is potentially superior to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jorgensen et al., 2016b</xref>). However, pyroptosis is largely evaded by non-engineered WT <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium, which successfully replicates in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hausmann et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miao et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miao et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Salcedo et al., 2001</xref>). Therefore, we propose that it is the correct cellular bucket list in the context of each specific cell type, rather than simply the type of RCD, that ultimately leads to the clearance of intracellular bacteria.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">gene (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> <italic>Bid</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NCBI</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NM_007544.4</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> AA79-102 (BH3 domain) used for plasmid construction</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">gene (<italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> <italic>SspH1</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GenBank</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ACY87967.1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> AA1-137 (secretion signal) used for plasmid construction</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">strain, strain background (<italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium, 14028s)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> WT</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> Gift from Samuel I.

However, our experiments are not powered to show that this difference is statistically significant. Nevertheless, we now make note of the trend, and cite prior papers that have observed NLRC4 and NLRP3 redundancy against non-engineered <italic>S. Typhimurium</italic> strains.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“The observation that apoptosis does not affect <italic>Salmonella</italic> systemically would be strengthened if the experiments using the BIDon strain could be taken out to a later time point, i.e. 72 or 96 h.”</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, we wanted to extend our studies to these timepoints. However, although expression of the SspH1 translocation signal is benign for 48 h, by 72 h this causes mild attenuation (regardless of whether the BID-BH3 domain is attached as cargo). We think that the degree of difficulty for SPI2 effectors to reprogram the vacuole increases over time, and that only beyond 48 h does SPI2 need to function at peak efficiency. This observation will be reported in a second manuscript that is written and will be submitted within this month. We are happy to supply this manuscript to reviewers if they would like to see the results. We also added text to the discussion to alert the reader to the caveats of engineering <italic>S. Typhimurium</italic> at later timepoints.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“Discussion: The authors claim that pyroptotic and apoptotic signaling in IEC have the same outcome and IEC only has extrusion as a task. However, upon pyroptosis, IEC also releases IL-18 and eicosanoids, which is not the case during apoptosis. While the initial extrusion makes all the difference in early infection, Mueller et al 2016 showed that lack of IL-18 has an effect on <italic>Salmonella</italic> dissemination at a 72h time point. The FlicON model can not test later time points as the bacteria will be cleared by then, but this caveat should be discussed.”</p></disp-quote><p>We revised the text in the discussion to make it clear that extrusion is not the only bucket list item for IECs, and that IL-18 and eicosanoids are included in the bucket list for IECs after caspase-1 activation, and add the citation to Muller et al.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>1. The manuscript is written in a rather colloquial style. Additional editing is recommended. ”</p></disp-quote><p>We edited the abstract to limit the use of the bucket list term and to make more clear that this is a new term that our lab has proposed in a recent review in Trends in Cell Biology. The managing editor for the current manuscript at eLife commented that the prose was lively and thoughtful. We would be happy to make edits if the reviewer has more specific suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. It is not obvious from the Results section that all mouse infections were, in fact, mixed infections. This should be stated more clearly. Additionally, there is a minor concern regarding in vivo plasmid loss over time.</p></disp-quote><p>We added text to the results to make this clearer at the beginning of each in vivo figure in the paper. Our experiments are intentionally blind to any <italic>Salmonella</italic> that have lost the plasmid. These bacteria essentially convert to a wild type phenotype, and thus are no longer representative of FliCON or BIDON bacteria. We also verify the long established equal competition between pWSK29 (amp) and pWSK129 (kan) in Figure 2—figure supplement 1A-B. Prior experiments from the laboratory of Sam Miller and others in the 1990s showed that plasmid loss occurs at a rate of less than 1%.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Results shown in Figure 4 are difficult to interpret. Essentially, the experiment is aimed at comparing the two engineered <italic>Salmonella</italic> strains (FliC-ON and BID-ON). However, these strains are very different from one another, which may have a confounding effect on the interpretation of the data.”</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer has interpreted the experiment correctly. We wanted to make clear to the reader that the two strains induce apoptosis under different kinetics. Indeed, it would be very surprising if two different engineering methods created strains that caused apoptosis with identical kinetics. We make two text edits to the results to make this clearer, concluding with “Overall, both ways of achieving apoptosis are successful in vitro, but with slightly different kinetics.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. What new insights into mechanisms of bacterial pathogenesis and host response are gained by using recombinant <italic>Salmonella</italic> (over)expressing a pro-apoptotic protein is not clearly stated.”</p></disp-quote><p>We modify the introduction to make this more clear, stating: “Here, we investigate whether apoptotic pathways could be useful in clearing intracellular infection. Because <italic>S. Typhimurium</italic> likely evades apoptotic pathways, we again use engineering in order to create strains that will induce apoptosis. This allows us to study apoptosis in a controlled manner in vivo.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The Discussion section, while provocative, seems speculative and should be revised. Concepts of &quot;backup apoptosis&quot; and crosstalk between pyroptosis and apoptosis are intriguing, but it seems implausible to this reviewer that a cell might &quot;know&quot; that it will die, might &quot;choose&quot; how to die, and might aim to complete a &quot;bucket list&quot; before it loses all functional capacity. The usage of these types of terms does not help bolster the authors' central conclusions. ”</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that cells do not “choose” pathways for regulated cell death. We had over-anthropomorphized the concepts surrounding these interconnected cell death pathways that are created by evolution. We edited the introduction and discussion to remove the “choose” term. However, we kept the second phrase using “know” in the discussion with an added clarifier: “Once a cell initiates cell death signaling, it “knows” that it will die (or rather evolution has created signaling cascades that are predicated upon the initiation of RCD).”. Sometimes anthropomorphizing scientific concepts can be a useful tool to facilitate understanding of complex scientific concepts. For example, the “Red Queen hypothesis” clearly anthropomorphizes the concept of continuous evolution to maintain an evolutionary equilibrium. We have found that scientists in the cell death field often think that modes of cell death are or should be interchangeable. We hope that the idea of the “bucket list” will help to crystalize the idea that distinct processes leading up to different types of regulated cell death can have very different consequences during infection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional Comments from the Reviewing Editor:</p><p>1. The authors show that FliC-ON is not cleared from the spleen of Casp1 KO or Gsdmd KO mice. The conclusion is that the backup apoptosis pathways that should be present in these mice are insufficient to clear the bacteria from the spleen. However, although it is shown that bone marrow macrophages undergo apoptosis in vitro, I believe it is not shown that the apoptotic pathways are actually activated in the spleen. This seems like an important caveat. Could it be shown (or has it previously been shown) that the cells infected in the spleens of Casp1 KO or Gsdmd KO are activating apoptosis? If not, it seems possible that the reason the bacteria are not cleared is due to a lack of apoptosis activation rather than an ineffectiveness of apoptosis, and the authors could consider explicitly acknowledging this.”</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, and added to the discussion “A final possibility is that our engineered strains are not successfully triggering apoptosis within splenic macrophages. This could be due to intrinsic differences between BMMs and splenic macrophages or could be due to bacterial virulence factors that fail to suppress apoptosis only in vitro. It is quite difficult to experimentally prove that apoptosis occurs in vivo due to rapid efferocytosis of the apoptotic cells.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Both reviewers were somewhat unhappy about some of the new terminology/metaphors that are introduced in the manuscript. I understand the reviewers' concerns but also feel that the writing is lively and thoughtful. It is up to the authors to decide whether to retain their new terminology, but the response of two expert reviewers might give the authors some pause. At a minimum, to address the concern about an unfamiliar term being used in the abstract, perhaps explicitly state that you are introducing &quot;bucket list&quot; as a new concept to help explain the results. The introduction of this concept may indeed be one of the novel contributions of the manuscript.”</p></disp-quote><p>We opted to keep the term, but reduce its use to once in the abstract with a specific comment on the recent coining of the term: “We recently suggested that such diverse tasks can be considered as different cellular “bucket lists” to be accomplished before a cell dies.” We recently coined this term in a review in Trends in Cell Biology, where three reviewers had quite positive comments about the concept. Time will tell whether this is a useful term for the cell death field or not.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Perhaps this is implied in the discussion already, but it might make sense to state the obvious difference between IECs and splenic macrophages which is that the death of the former results in the removal of the cell and its contents (i.e., <italic>Salmonella</italic>) from the tissue, whereas the death of the latter does not. This seems like the simplest explanation for why apoptosis restricts bacterial replication in IECs but not macrophages, and I am not sure if introducing the concept of a &quot;bucket list&quot; improves the explanation or not.”</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this narrative nicely distills the differences between these cell types. We edited the final paragraph of the discussion to include this narrative.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.
