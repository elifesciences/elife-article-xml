the CRISPR array, a genomic locus consisting of short, repeated sequences (‘repeats’) interspersed with short, variable sequences (‘spacers’). CRISPR arrays are transcribed and processed into individual CRISPR RNAs that each include a single spacer, and direct Cas proteins to complementary sequences in invading nucleic acid. Most bacterial CRISPR array transcripts are unusually long for untranslated RNA, suggesting the existence of mechanisms to prevent premature transcription termination by Rho, a conserved bacterial transcription termination factor that rapidly terminates untranslated RNA. We show that Rho can prematurely terminate transcription of bacterial CRISPR arrays, and we identify a widespread antitermination mechanism that antagonizes Rho to facilitate complete transcription of CRISPR arrays. Thus, our data highlight the importance of transcription termination and antitermination in the evolution of bacterial CRISPR-Cas systems.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CRISPR</kwd><kwd>Rho termination</kwd><kwd>Antitermination</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM122836</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wade</surname><given-names>Joseph T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21AI126416</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wade</surname><given-names>Joseph T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI127652</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Seed</surname><given-names>Kimberley D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigators in the Pathogenesis of Infectious Disease Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Seed</surname><given-names>Kimberley D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Many bacteria use the Nus factor antitermination complex to prevent premature Rho-dependent transcription termination of their CRISPR arrays.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>CRISPR-Cas systems are adaptive immune systems found in many bacteria and archaea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wright et al., 2016</xref>). The hallmark of CRISPR-Cas systems is the CRISPR array, which is composed of multiple alternating, short, identical ‘repeat’ sequences, interspersed with short, variable ‘spacer’ sequences. A critical step in CRISPR immunity is biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wright et al., 2016</xref>), which involves transcription of a CRISPR array into a single, long precursor RNA that is then processed into individual CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs), with each crRNA containing a single spacer sequence. crRNAs associate with an effector Cas protein or Cas protein complex, and direct the Cas protein(s) to an invading nucleic acid sequence that is complementary to the crRNA spacer and often includes a neighboring Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM). This leads to cleavage of the invading nucleic acid by a Cas protein nuclease, in a process known as ‘interference’.</p><p>CRISPR arrays can be expanded by acquisition of new spacer/repeat elements at one end of the array, in a process known as adaptation. The ability to become immune to newly encountered invaders is presumably a strong selective pressure that promotes adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bradde et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martynov et al., 2017</xref>), although shorter CRISPR arrays appear to be strongly favored in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Weissman et al., 2018</xref>). Little is known about factors that negatively influence CRISPR array length. It has been hypothesized that increased array length is selected against because of the potential for individual crRNAs to become less effective as the effector complex is diluted among more crRNA variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bradde et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martynov et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rao et al., 2017</xref>). The diversity of potential invaders and the mutation frequency of invaders have also been proposed to impose selective pressure on array length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martynov et al., 2017</xref>). Lastly, array length is known to be impacted by deletions caused by homologous recombination between repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gudbergsdottir et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kupczok et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Rho is a broadly conserved bacterial transcription termination factor. Rho terminates transcription only when nascent RNA is untranslated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mitra et al., 2017</xref>). Hence, the primary function of Rho is to suppress the transcription of spurious, non-coding RNAs that initiate as a result of pervasive transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lybecker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Peters et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wade and Grainger, 2014</xref>). To terminate transcription, Rho must load onto nascent RNA at a ‘Rho utilization site’ (Rut). The precise sequence and structure requirements for Rho loading are not fully understood, but Ruts typically have a high C:G ratio, limited secondary structure, and are enriched in YC dinucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mitra et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nadiras et al., 2018</xref>). However, the overall sequence/structure specificity of Ruts is believed to be low, and a large proportion of the <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium genome is predicted to be capable of functioning as a Rut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nadiras et al., 2018</xref>). Once Rho loads onto nascent RNA, it translocates along the RNA in a 5’ to 3’ direction using its helicase activity. Rho typically catches the RNA polymerase (RNAP) within 60–90 nucleotides, leading to transcription termination, with termination typically occurring at an RNAP pause site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mitra et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The activity of Rho can be inhibited by a variety of mechanisms that collectively are referred to as ‘antitermination’. Antitermination mechanisms can be grouped into two classes: targeted and processive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goodson and Winkler, 2018</xref>). Targeted antitermination affects a single site and does not otherwise alter the properties of the transcription complex. For example, targeted antitermination could involve occlusion of a single Rho loading site by an RNA-binding protein. Processive antitermination, on the other hand, involves modification of the transcription machinery such that RNAP becomes resistant to termination for the remainder of that transcription cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goodson and Winkler, 2018</xref>). This typically occurs due to association of a protein or protein complex with the elongating RNAP due to sequence-specific <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements in the DNA or nascent RNA. One of the best-studied processive antitermination mechanisms occurs on ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and involves the Nus factor complex. The Nus factor complex consists of five proteins, NusA, NusB, NusE (ribosomal protein S10), NusG, and SuhB, that bind to both nascent RNA and elongating RNAP. Nus complex formation begins with sequence-specific association of NusB/E with a short RNA element known as ‘BoxA’. Association of the Nus complex with both RNAP and the BoxA leads to formation of a loop in the nascent RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bubunenko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Singh et al., 2016</xref>). The most recently identified member of the Nus complex, SuhB, is recruited to elongating RNAP in a <italic>boxA</italic>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Singh et al., 2016</xref>), interacts with NusA, NusG, RNAP, and the nascent RNA, and is required for assembly and activity of the Nus factor complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dudenhoeffer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2007</xref>). The Nus factor complex prevents Rho termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Squires et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Torres et al., 2004</xref>) in a BoxA-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aksoy et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Squires et al., 1993</xref>), and BoxA elements are found in phylogenetically diverse copies of rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arnvig et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sen et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Like rRNA, CRISPR array transcripts are non-coding and often long, making them ideal substrates for Rho (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pougach et al., 2010</xref>). Here, we show that Rho termination provides selective pressure against increased CRISPR array length in bacteria. Moreover, we show that BoxA-mediated antitermination is a widespread mechanism by which bacteria protect their CRISPR arrays from Rho termination. Disrupting BoxA-mediated antitermination leads to premature Rho termination within CRISPR arrays that renders later spacers ineffective for CRISPR immunity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium CRISPR arrays have functional <italic>boxA</italic> sequences upstream</title><p>We identified <italic>boxA</italic>-like sequences a short distance upstream of both CRISPR arrays (CRISPR-I and CRISPR-II) in <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium, which encodes a single, type I-E CRISPR-Cas system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The putative <italic>boxA</italic> sequences are 78 and 77 bp upstream of the first repeat in the CRISPR-I and CRISPR-II arrays, respectively. To facilitate studies of the <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium CRISPR-Cas system, which is transcriptionally silenced by H-NS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Navarre et al., 2006</xref>), we introduced a strong, constitutive promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Luo et al., 2015</xref>) in place of <italic>cas3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This promoter drives transcription of the <italic>cas8e-cse2-cas7-cas5-cas6e-cas1-cas2</italic> operon, and our ChIP-qPCR data for RNAP indicate that transcription continues through the <italic>boxA</italic> into the CRISPR array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>); in wild-type <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium cells that lack the constitutive promoter upstream of <italic>cas8e</italic>, we detected little RNAP occupancy within the CRISPR array, suggesting that there is no active promoter between <italic>cas2</italic> and the start of the array. We also introduced a strong, constitutive promoter upstream of the CRISPR-II array, immediately downstream of the <italic>queE</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), reasoning that this would mimic transcriptional readthrough from <italic>queE</italic>. Transcription from this promoter also covers the putative <italic>boxA</italic>. To determine whether the putative <italic>boxA</italic> elements upstream of the CRISPR arrays are genuine, we measured association of TAP-tagged SuhB with elongating RNAP at the CRISPR-II array using ChIP-qPCR, which detects indirect association of SuhB with the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Singh et al., 2016</xref>). Our data indicate robust association of SuhB with the region immediately downstream of the putative <italic>boxA</italic>, but not with the highly transcribed <italic>rpsA</italic> gene that is not associated with a <italic>boxA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). By contrast, we detected substantially reduced SuhB association with the same genomic region in a strain containing a single base pair substitution in the <italic>boxA</italic> that is expected to abrogate NusB/E association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baniulyte et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berg et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nodwell and Greenblatt, 1993</xref>), with SuhB association being similar to that at <italic>rpsA</italic>. The level of SuhB association with <italic>rpsA</italic> was not substantially altered by the mutation in the CRISPR-II <italic>boxA</italic>. We conclude that the CRISPR-II array transcript includes a functional upstream BoxA. For almost 40 years, the Nus factor complex was believed to be a dedicated rRNA regulator, with no other known bacterial targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sen et al., 2008</xref>). We recently identified a novel function for the Nus factor complex – autoregulation of <italic>suhB</italic> – and we provided evidence for many additional targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baniulyte et al., 2017</xref>). Identification of CRISPR arrays as a novel target for the Nus factor complex further increases the number of known targets and provides new opportunities for investigating the mechanism by which Nus factors prevent Rho termination.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>boxA</italic> elements upstream of both CRISPR arrays in <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the two CRISPR arrays in <italic>S</italic>.

Typhimurium CRISPR arrays</title><p>We hypothesized that BoxA-mediated association of the Nus factor complex with RNAP at the <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium CRISPR arrays prevents premature Rho-dependent transcription termination. To test this hypothesis, we constructed <italic>lacZ</italic> transcriptional reporter fusions that contain a constitutive promoter followed by the sequence downstream of the <italic>queE</italic> gene (upstream of the CRISPR-II array), extending to either the 2nd (‘short fusion’) or the 11th (‘long fusion’) spacer of the array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We constructed equivalent fusions that contain a single base pair substitution in the <italic>boxA</italic> that is expected to abrogate NusB/E association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baniulyte et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berg et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nodwell and Greenblatt, 1993</xref>). We then measured β-galactosidase activity for each of the four fusions in cells grown with/without bicyclomycin (BCM), a specific inhibitor of Rho (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mitra et al., 2017</xref>). In the absence of BCM, expression of the long fusion but not the short fusion was substantially reduced by mutation of the <italic>boxA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). By contrast, expression of all fusions was similar for cells grown in the presence of BCM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Thus, our data are consistent with BoxA-mediated, Nus factor antitermination of the CRISPR array, with Rho termination occurring between the 2nd and 11th spacer when antitermination is disrupted. Surprisingly, expression levels of both the short and long fusions were substantially higher in cells grown with BCM, even with an intact <italic>boxA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). By contrast, expression of a control reporter fusion that includes an intrinsic terminator upstream of <italic>lacZ</italic> was not affected by BCM treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>); the intrinsic terminator substantially reduces, but does not abolish, <italic>lacZ</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stringer et al., 2014</xref>). We conclude that some Rho termination occurs upstream of the <italic>boxA</italic> in both the long and short CRISPR array reporter fusions.

Typhimurium CRISPR arrays facilitates the use of spacers throughout the arrays</title><p>Our data indicate that CRISPR arrays in <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium are protected from premature Rho termination by Nus factor association with RNAP via the BoxA sequences. However, this does not necessarily mean that CRISPR-Cas function is affected by antitermination, since low levels of crRNA may be sufficient for Cas proteins to bind target DNA. We previously investigated the specificity of the Cascade complex of Cas proteins in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Our data indicated that Cascade can bind to DNA targets with as few as 5 bp between the crRNA and the target DNA; consequently, the endogenous <italic>E. coli</italic> crRNAs direct Cascade binding to &gt;100 chromosomal sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cooper et al., 2018</xref>), with all of the binding events involving very limited base-pairing that is insufficient for DNA cleavage by the Cas3 nuclease.

Note that we used a different constitutive promoter upstream of the CRISPR-II array to that described above for ChIP of SuhB, although the promoter was inserted at the same location (see Methods). As expected, we detected association of Cas5 with a large number (236) of chromosomal regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). These binding sites are associated with five strongly enriched sequence motifs that correspond to a PAM sequence and the seed regions of spacers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 11 from the CRISPR-I array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). These enriched motifs indicate that the optimal PAM in <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium is AWG. We then attempted to identify the corresponding crRNA spacer for all 236 Cascade-binding sites (see Materials and methods). Thus, we were able to uniquely associate 152 binding sites with a single spacer from one of the two CRISPR arrays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). To test the quality of these spacer assignments, we repeated the ChIP-seq experiment in a strain where the CRISPR-I array had been deleted. Consistent with our spacer assignments, Cas5 association decreased specifically at all DNA sites assigned to spacers from the CRISPR-I array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). By comparing the ChIP-seq data from wild-type and CRISPR-I deleted cells, we were able to unambiguously associate an additional 32 Cascade-binding sites with a single spacer from one of the two CRISPR arrays (these binding sites had previously been associated with multiple possible spacers; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Extensive off-target binding of <italic>S. Typhimurium</italic> Cascade.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Relative FLAG<sub>3</sub>-Cas5 occupancy across the <italic>S</italic>.

The effect of the <italic>nusE</italic> mutation on Cascade binding was smaller than that of the <italic>boxA</italic> mutations; however, the Nus factor complex is likely to retain partial function in the <italic>nusE</italic> mutant strain.

We also constructed a control plasmid that lacks a protospacer. We pooled these plasmids and attempted to introduce them into each of the three strains by conjugation.

We conclude that the <italic>boxA</italic> sequences upstream of cyanobacterial CRISPR arrays are genuine.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Rho poses a barrier to CRISPR array transcription</title><p>Our data highlight the importance of transcription antitermination in the process of CRISPR biogenesis. Rho termination is a widely conserved, and often essential process in bacteria. Given that CRISPR arrays and the upstream leader sequences are non-coding, they represent likely substrates for Rho. Thus, Rho may be an unavoidable barrier to expression of longer CRISPR arrays, necessitating an antitermination activity. Although Rho has some specificity for sites of loading and termination, newly acquired spacers in a CRISPR array have sequences that cannot be ‘anticipated’; a ‘bad’ spacer, that is one that promotes Rho loading or termination, could inactivate a large portion of the array by causing premature Rho termination. This phenomenon is exacerbated by the fact that new spacers are added to the upstream end of the array with respect to the direction of transcription. Since spacers only impact cell fitness when the cognate invader is encountered, a bad spacer could be acquired in a CRISPR array and become fixed in the population, inactivating later spacers in the array before cells require immunity using those spacers. We speculate that Rho termination acts as a selective pressure to limit adaptation in species that lack an antitermination mechanism, perhaps explaining why most CRISPR arrays have only a few spacers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Weissman et al., 2018</xref>). The spacers most affected by Rho termination will be at the leader-distal ends of CRISPR arrays, meaning that they are the ‘older’ spacers. This may reduce the selective pressure to prevent Rho termination if the immunity provided by these older spacers is not beneficial due to a reduced likelihood of encountering the cognate invader.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>BoxA-mediated antitermination is a phylogenetically widespread mechanism to prevent premature Rho-dependent transcription termination of CRISPR arrays</title><p>We have identified a widely conserved mechanism to counteract premature Rho termination of CRISPR arrays: BoxA-mediated antitermination. The phylogenetic distribution of CRISPR arrays with an associated <italic>boxA</italic> suggests that this mechanism of CRISPR array antitermination has evolved independently on multiple occasions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Moreover, BoxA-mediated antitermination of CRISPR arrays is likely to be even more widely distributed than our analysis suggests, because <italic>boxA</italic> sequences that diverge from the <italic>E. coli</italic> consensus may have been missed. Indeed, previous studies of BoxA-mediated antitermination have shown that the <italic>boxA</italic> consensus varies across the bacterial kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arnvig et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Das et al., 2008</xref>). This is highlighted by the fact that, in a separate analysis, we identified putative <italic>boxA</italic> sequences upstream of five CRISPR arrays in <italic>Aquifex aeolicus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Prediction of these <italic>boxA</italic> sequences, which differ considerably from those in <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium, was only possible because of prior experimental work identifying the rRNA <italic>boxA</italic> in <italic>A. aeolicus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Das et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Our data suggest that even in the presence of an antitermination mechanism, Rho termination can still impact CRISPR array transcription. Specifically, we showed that inhibition of Rho led to increased use of later spacers in the two <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium CRISPR arrays even in the presence of an intact <italic>boxA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similarly, the last two spacers of the <italic>V. cholerae</italic> CRISPR array failed to elicit interference even in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), suggesting that Rho termination occurs before the end of the array. Thus, it seems likely that even with an antitermination mechanism in place, Rho termination can limit the effective length of CRISPR arrays.</p><p>Curiously, there appear to be <italic>boxA</italic> sequences upstream of CRISPR arrays in several species of the <italic>Cyanobacteria</italic> phylum (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>), despite almost all species in this phylum lacking <italic>rho</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">D'Heygère et al., 2013</xref>). We propose two possible explanations. First, there may be an alternative transcription termination mechanism in cyanobacteria that can be antagonized by the Nus factor complex. Second, Nus factor association with RNAP transcribing a CRISPR array likely generates an RNA loop, since the BoxA is tethered to RNAP by the Nus factors. Loop formation could impact crRNA processing by modulating base-pairing interactions in the nascent RNA. BoxA-mediated RNA loop formation has been proposed to facilitate folding and processing of rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bubunenko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Singh et al., 2016</xref>). Such a function need not be mutually exclusive with transcription antitermination.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Are there alternative antitermination mechanisms for CRISPR arrays?</title><p>Our search for enriched sequence motifs upstream of CRISPR arrays used arrays from 187 bacterial species. Most of these species have type I CRISPR-Cas systems, often in combination with additional types. Fifty of the 52 species with a putative <italic>boxA</italic> sequence upstream of a CRISPR array have at least one type I system, with the other two species each having only a type III system. By contrast, none of the 15 species with only a type II-C CRISPR-Cas system have <italic>boxA</italic> sequences upstream of their arrays. We reasoned that this might be because at least some species with type II-C CRISPR-Cas systems have their CRISPR arrays oriented opposite to <italic>cas2</italic>, rather than co-directionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dugar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>); when extracting sequences adjacent to CRISPR arrays for sequence analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), we assumed that <italic>cas2</italic> and CRISPR arrays are oriented co-directionally. Indeed, it is possible that <italic>boxA</italic> sequences were missed for other types of CRISPR array for the same reason. To test the possibility that there are <italic>boxA</italic> sequences on the <italic>cas2</italic>-distal side of the 15 type II-C CRISPR arrays included in our analysis, we replaced the sequences between <italic>cas2</italic> and CRISPR arrays with the 300 nt from the opposite end of the CRISPR arrays for all 15 species, and repeated the search for enriched sequence motifs; sequences used for the other 172 species remained the same. We did not detect a putative <italic>boxA</italic> adjacent to any of the type II-C arrays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>), suggesting that these species use a different mechanism to circumvent Rho termination within their CRISPR arrays. Indeed, repeat sequences in many type II-C CRISPR-Cas systems contain promoters, such that each spacer in the array is transcribed from a promoter immediately upstream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Charpentier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dugar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mir et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). We propose that this provides an alternative mechanism to avoid Rho termination, obviating the need for a <italic>boxA</italic> sequence.</p><p>Given that many bacterial CRISPR arrays lack an upstream <italic>boxA</italic>, even in species that are closely related to <italic>Salmonella</italic>, we anticipate that there are additional mechanisms of CRISPR array antitermination. These are likely to be processive antitermination mechanisms, since targeted antitermination would be incompatible with the dynamic nature of CRISPR arrays. Nonetheless, we note that targeted antitermination mechanisms may be important for preventing Rho termination in the leader sequences upstream of CRISPR arrays, which are often long and non-coding. Indeed, a targeted antitermination mechanism has been described for CRISPR array leader sequences in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lin et al., 2019</xref>). Alternatives to BoxA-mediated antitermination of CRISPR arrays could include antitermination by NusG homologues such as RfaH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goodson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goodson and Winkler, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kang et al., 2018</xref>), or inhibition of Rho activity by <italic>cis</italic>-acting RNA elements, similar to the Put element of phage HK022 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">King and Weisberg, 2003</xref>). An alternative possibility is that CRISPR array processing by Cas6 may be so efficient in some bacterial species that the CRISPR array transcript is processed downstream of Rho, preventing Rho from catching RNAP on the RNA. Lastly, there may be mechanisms to circumvent Rho termination that are independent of processive antitermination, such as the repeat-internal promoters found in type II-C CRISPR-Cas systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Charpentier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dugar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mir et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, we have identified Rho termination as an important player in CRISPR biogenesis, and we have identified a widespread mechanism to counteract premature Rho termination of CRISPR arrays. We anticipate that studies of CRISPR biogenesis in other bacterial species will reveal novel antitermination mechanisms, and that bacteriophage have evolved mechanisms to counteract antitermination as an anti-CRISPR strategy. Lastly, the potential for Rho termination should be considered for biotechnological applications that require arrays with multiple spacers.

To assign specific crRNA spacer sequences to Cascade-binding sites, we extracted 101 bp regions centered on each ChIP-seq peak for ChIP-seq data generated from AMD678. Overlapping regions were merged and the central position was used as a reference point for downstream analysis. We refer to this position as the ‘peak center’. We then searched each ChIP-seq peak region for a perfect match to positions 1–5 of each spacer from the CRISPR-I and CRISPR-II arrays, in addition to an immediately adjacent AAG or ATG sequence (the expected PAM sequence). Additionally, we searched each ChIP-seq peak region for a perfect match to positions 1–5 and positions 7–8 of each spacer from the CRISPR-I and CRISPR-II arrays without an associated PAM. Spacers were only assigned to a ChIP-seq peak if they had a unique match to a spacer sequence. This yielded 152 uniquely assigned peak-spacer combinations from the 236 ChIP-seq peaks. Enriched sequence motifs within the 236 peak regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) were identified using MEME (v5.0.1, default parameters) using 101 bp sequences surrounding peak centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bailey and Elkan, 1994</xref>).</p><p>To determine relative sequence read coverage at each ChIP-seq peak center, we used Rockhopper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McClure et al., 2013</xref>) to determine relative sequence coverage at every genomic position on both strands for each ChIP-seq dataset. We then summed the relative sequence read coverage values on both strands for each peak center position to give peak center coverage values (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). To refine the assignment of spacers to ChIP-seq peaks, we compared peak center coverage values for each peak in ChIP-seq datasets from AMD678 (CRISPR-I<sup>+</sup>) and AMD679 (ΔCRISPR-I) strains. We calculated ratio of peak center coverage values in the first replicates of AMD679:AMD678 data, and repeated this for the second replicates, generating two ratio values. Based on ratio values assigned to peak centers that were already uniquely assigned to a spacer, we conservatively assumed that peak centers with both ratios &lt; 0.2 should be assigned a CRISPR-I spacer, whereas peak centers with both ratios &gt; 1.0 should be assigned a CRISPR-II spacer. Thus, we were able to uniquely assign spacers to an additional 32 peak centers that had previously been assigned multiple spacers. For example, if a peak center had previously been assigned two spacers from CRISPR-I and one spacer from CRISPR-II, we could uniquely assign the spacer from CRISPR-II if both ratios were &gt;1.0.</p><p>For data plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, S2, S3, and S4, values for peak center coverage were normalized in one replicate (two biological replicates were performed for all ChIP-seq experiments) by summing the values at all peak centers to be analyzed (i.e. peak centers that could be uniquely assigned to a spacer) and multiplying values in the second replicate by a constant such that the summed values for each replicate were the same.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>β-Galactosidase assays</title><p><italic>S</italic>.

eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>While the mechanisms of CRISPR RNA-guided defense have been the subject of intense investigation, the regulatory mechanisms that govern the transcription of CRISPR loci remains relatively obscure. Here Stringer et al. demonstrate that Rho and Nus play opposing roles in regulating the length of CRISPR transcripts. Longer CRISPR transcripts result in more guides and may provide broad spectrum resistance, but short transcripts may result in higher concentrations of certain guides, providing higher levels of protection from fewer pathogens.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Transcription Termination and Antitermination of Bacterial CRISPR Arrays&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Joe Bondy-Denomy (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept manuscripts that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that additional experiments would make the manuscript stronger. While the reviewers have identified additional experiments that would improve this work, and you are welcome to add these to the revised manuscript if conditions allow, the only required experiments are computational in nature.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors construct a series of genetic mutants and use molecular methods to show that CRISPR transcription is terminated by Rho and that the Nus complex blocks Rho-dependent termination, resulting in longer CRISPR transcripts. The paper is well written, the results are convincing, and the work is of interest of a broad audience. However, it is not clear why the competing activities of Rho and Nus are important for regulation of these systems. When and where is the regulation of Rho and Nus relevant to the biological control of CRISPR expression? Are expression levels of Rho and Nus controlled in response to phage infection or plasmid conjugation?</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Please include data for the H-NS knockout or explain why this is not included. Explain where the natural transcriptional start sites are located relative to the engineered promoter. Leader sequences are typically AT-rich and contain the promotor. What is the relevance of a GC-rich &quot;Rut&quot; if it is upstream of the natural promoter?</p><p>The authors detect SuhB occupancy in the CRISPR-II <italic>boxA</italic> region of S. Typhimurium (Figure 1), and from that observation conclude that Nus factors are also involved. SuhB is a relatively new addition to the Nus complex and only recently found to play a role in rRNA expression (Singh et al., 2016). It is unclear whether SuhB is always associated with Nus antitermination complexes, or if it might work alone, or with other factors at different promoters. Given this uncertainty and caveats of the Nus deletion/mutation experiments presented here, it is essential that the authors either perform additional experiments to test for relevant Nus factor(s) at the putative <italic>boxA</italic> sequences of both CRISPR arrays in S. Typhimurium, or revise the text to be more clear about the role of SuhB and the inferred role of Nus.</p><p>The authors show the high conservation of NusB in bacteria (Figure 7—figure supplement 1) to support the notion that Nus-mediated antitermination is a general mechanism employed in diverse CRISPR loci. However, it was SuhB which was detected at the CRISPR-II <italic>boxA</italic> sequence. The phylogenetic analysis should be performed on SuhB. Phylogenetic comparisons of CRISPRs, BoxA, SuhB and NusB may be necessary to speculate about the widespread distribution of this mechanism.</p><p>Figure 2B: Given the large difference in BCM treatment for the long construct, which has an ~10 fold impact over the BoxA mutation (which also has a 10-fold impact), this strong effect of the drug might necessitate a control transcript/fusion to assess the uptick in <italic>lacZ</italic> from any locus? Or is this BCM effect specific to the CRISPR array and therefore there is a second (or third or fourth) equally potent/important site that the authors have not identified?</p><p>Clarify why some experiments were only performed with CRISPR-II (Figures 1 and 2), while some were only performed with CRISPR-I (Figure 3 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Observations made about one locus were assumed to apply to the other. Include data for SuhB/Nus occupancy at <italic>boxA</italic> sequences for both CRISPR loci, and the effects of bicyclomycin on expression for each loci or explain why this has been omitted.</p><p>The <italic>boxA</italic>-dependent stimulation of promoter-distal spacer activity is assumed to be through a mechanism of antitermination. However, the data might equally support the possibility that SuhB facilitates/stimulates crRNA maturation rather than promoting antitermination, much like what was discovered at the rRNA operon (Singh et al., 2016). To distinguish between the two possibilities, it is necessary to check for RNAP occupancy at promoter -proximal vs -distal spacers or test the efficiency of CRISPR RNA processing with and without SuhB. Alternatively, temper the conclusion that the mechanism is antitermination SuhB dependent antitermination.</p><p>Clarify the statistical methods used in the ChIP-seq experiments. For example, in Figure 4A, it appears as though the purple data points indeed cluster away from the orange, but in Figure 4—figure supplement 2A, it is less clear which of the blue data points cluster away from the orange data points in a statistically significant manner.</p><p>Throughout the manuscript, it is implied that the proposed antitermination mechanism occurs in all CRISPR-Cas types, while experimental data was collected for only two Type I systems. It is important to explicitly state which CRISPR Type(s) were found to harbor <italic>boxA</italic> sequences (Figure 7A) to support the possibility that a general mechanism has been discovered and to clarify how this conclusion relates to the work presented by Lin et al., 2019.</p><p>Figure 7 was generated while working under the assumption that CRISPR arrays appear downstream of <italic>cas2</italic>. While this may be true for some CRISPR-Cas systems, this approach excludes many systems with slightly different genomic architectures. For a more unbiased approach, search for <italic>boxA</italic> sequences directly upstream of the first repeat in a CRISPR array. This approach is anticipated to provide more reliable evidence to support the general prevalence of <italic>boxA</italic> sequences upstream of CRISPR arrays.</p><p>The authors speculate that &quot;Rho termination acts as a selective pressure to limit adaptation in species that lack an antitermination mechanism&quot;. However, the possible role of Rho in limiting adaption seems indirect at best. If Rho-dependent termination limits the number of different spacers that can be expressed from a single locus then this will limit selective pressures that maintain &quot;older spacers&quot;, but the advantage this afford the host is unclear. Furthermore, role of Nus would be expected to have an opposing impact on CRISPR length, so it is unclear how this explains an abundance of short CRISPRs and the authors do not clarify how these observations fit with the numerous genomes that do have long CRISPRs.</p><p>Results first paragraph, specify what CRISPR-Cas Type and subtype you are working with.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Transcription Termination and Antitermination of Bacterial CRISPR Arrays&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Gisela Storz (Senior Editor) and Blake Wiedenheft (Reviewing Editor).</p><p>We have reviewed the rebuttal and the revised manuscript. The revision sufficiently addresses the reviewer's concerns, with one important exception.</p><p>The authors provide convincing experimental evidence for the competing roles of Rho and Nus in CRISPR transcription, but I am still not convinced by the arguments about the how these factors impact CRISPR length.</p><p>One of the reviewers raised this concern during the review. They pointed to the following statement: &quot;Rho termination acts as a selective pressure to limit adaptation in species that lack an antitermination mechanism&quot;. However, as the reviewer pointed out, &quot;the possible role of Rho in limiting adaption seems indirect at best.&quot; In the rebuttal, the authors address the comment by stating that &quot;Our data are insufficient to conclude that the presence of Rho causes many CRISPR arrays to be short, but we think this is likely in cases where there isn't an antitermination mechanism, and hence we discuss this, clearly framed as speculation.&quot; I agree that it is appropriate to speculate in the Discussion, but the third sentence of the Abstract states &quot;We show that Rho termination functionally limits the length of bacterial CRISPR arrays&quot;. Data presented by the authors, clearly demonstrates that Rho limits the length of CRISPR transcripts and Nus antagonizes Rho-dependent termination, but as the reviewer points out, &quot;the possible role of Rho in limiting adaption (i.e., length of the CRISPR locus) seems indirect at best&quot;.</p><p>Please clarify statements connecting the role of Rho to CRISPR length. Speculation should be omitted form the Abstract. In addition, please clarify the following statement &quot;type II-C CRISPR-Cas systems have their CRISPR arrays oriented opposite to <italic>cas3</italic>&quot;. I suspect that the context of this statement is important, but I have read this several times and it still seems to me like the authors are suggestion that type-II systems have a <italic>cas3</italic>. Please clarify.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58182.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors construct a series of genetic mutants and use molecular methods to show that CRISPR transcription is terminated by Rho and that the Nus complex blocks Rho-dependent termination, resulting in longer CRISPR transcripts.

We believe that Rho termination, a highly conserved and often essential activity in bacteria, inevitably poses a barrier to the expression of longer CRISPR arrays, necessitating an antitermination mechanism. Whether antitermination is subject to regulation in response to environmental cues such as invading phage/plasmids is unknown, but we include this possibility as speculation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Please include data for the H-NS knockout or explain why this is not included.

Hence, we are forced to rely on mutant strains to study the <italic>Salmonella</italic> CRISPR-Cas system. We chose to introduce promoters in the chromosome. For the CRISPR-I array, we inserted the promoter upstream of <italic>cas8e</italic>, and for the CRISPR-II array we inserted the promoter immediately downstream of <italic>queE</italic>. Thus, these promoters mimic transcription read-through from the <italic>cas</italic> operon and <italic>queE</italic> mRNAs, respectively. Given the requirement that a Rut be located in untranslated RNA, we presume that the Rut for CRISPR-I is downstream of <italic>cas2</italic>, and the Rut for CRISPR-I is downstream of <italic>queE</italic>. We note that a previous study of the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> CRISPR-Cas system identified a promoter within the leader of the CRISPR-I array. However, our ChIP-qPCR data for RNA polymerase (Figure 1—figure supplement 1) clearly indicate that the majority of CRISPR array transcription in our engineered strain of <italic>Salmonella</italic> comes from read-through of the <italic>cas</italic> gene mRNA. Hence, in situations where the <italic>cas</italic> genes are transcribed, we would expect considerable read-through into the CRISPR array. We have expanded the description of the first supplementary figure to highlight the significance of this result.</p><p>Deleting <italic>hns</italic> would presumably induce expression of both CRISPR arrays, but there are several reasons to avoid this strategy. First, <italic>hns</italic> is essential in <italic>Salmonella</italic>, so deleting <italic>hns</italic> would require a secondary mutation. Second, even with a secondary mutation, deleting <italic>hns</italic> causes a large growth defect, and likely has pleiotropic effects. Third, we have shown previously that H-NS silences many cryptic promoters within genes in <italic>E. coli</italic>, so deleting <italic>hns</italic> might result in transcription from promoters within the <italic>cas</italic> genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors detect SuhB occupancy in the CRISPR-II boxA region of S.

SuhB is an inositol monophosphatase. A phylogenetic comparison of <italic>suhB</italic> could be misleading, since SuhB could be conserved due to its function as an inositol monophosphatase. We now explain in the text why we chose to only look at conservation of <italic>nusB</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2B: Given the large difference in BCM treatment for the long construct, which has an ~10 fold impact over the BoxA mutation (which also has a 10-fold impact), this strong effect of the drug might necessitate a control transcript/fusion to assess the uptick in lacZ from any locus? Or is this BCM effect specific to the CRISPR array and therefore there is a second (or third or fourth) equally potent/important site that the authors have not identified?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this concern and we have assayed an additional <italic>lacZ</italic> fusion where the CRISPR array sequence (including the upstream region) has been replaced with an intrinsic terminator from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. We have previously shown that this terminator substantially reduces, but does not abolish, expression of the reporter gene. We chose to include an intrinsic terminator because it sensitizes the reporter to increases in expression. The control reporter showed no change in expression upon addition of BCM. These data are now included in Figure 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Clarify why some experiments were only performed with CRISPR-II (Figures 1 and 2), while some were only performed with CRISPR-I (Figure 3 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Observations made about one locus were assumed to apply to the other. Include data for SuhB/Nus occupancy at boxA sequences for both CRISPR loci, and the effects of bicyclomycin on expression for each loci or explain why this has been omitted.</p></disp-quote><p>We only looked at SuhB occupancy at one locus for the sake of simplicity. The strains required for these experiments are not trivial to make – they require multiple rounds of recombineering – and we reasoned that the result from one array could likely be extrapolated to the other, especially in light of the multiple, independent lines of evidence linking the Nus factor complex to both CRISPR arrays.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The boxA-dependent stimulation of promoter-distal spacer activity is assumed to be through a mechanism of antitermination. However, the data might equally support the possibility that SuhB facilitates/stimulates crRNA maturation rather than promoting antitermination, much like what was discovered at the rRNA operon (Singh et al., 2016). To distinguish between the two possibilities, it is necessary to check for RNAP occupancy at promoter -proximal vs -distal spacers or test the efficiency of CRISPR RNA processing with and without SuhB. Alternatively, temper the conclusion that the mechanism is antitermination SuhB dependent antitermination.</p></disp-quote><p>We looked at RNAP occupancy using ChIP-qPCR (data not in the manuscript), but the absolute occupancy numbers are too low to confidently conclude anything from these data. Hence, we chose to use reporter assays, which are more sensitive. We believe the reporter assays make a strong case that it is the antitermination function that is required for activity of the leader-distal spacers. Two additional lines of evidence support an antitermination function for <italic>boxA</italic> sequences. First, the patterns of spacer usage in the <italic>boxA</italic> mutants of both <italic>Salmonella</italic> and <italic>Vibrio</italic> are consistent with premature transcription termination. Second, the apparent termination within the CRISPR array of the <italic>SalmonellaboxA</italic> mutants is reversed by bicyclomycin, a Rho inhibitor. Nonetheless, we have added some text to leave open the possibility that the Nus factor complex might affect crRNA maturation either instead of, or in addition to antitermination. This is particularly relevant in light of an observation we made when revisiting the conservation of <italic>boxA</italic> sequences upstream of CRISPR arrays. Many cyanobacterial species appear to have a <italic>boxA</italic> upstream of their CRISPR arrays, but these species also lack <italic>rho</italic>, a point that had previously escaped our attention. We were concerned that the sequences upstream of cyanobacterial CRISPR arrays might not be genuine <italic>boxA</italic> sequences, especially since these sequences differ at key positions from the consensus <italic>boxA</italic> sequence derived from <italic>E. coli</italic>. To more thoroughly assess whether the cyanobacterial sequences are genuine <italic>boxA</italic> sequences, we searched for conserved sequences upstream of ribosomal RNA loci in the same set of species, based on the assumption that each ribosomal RNA upstream region would likely contain one <italic>boxA</italic> sequence. The most enriched sequence from cyanobacterial ribosomal RNA upstream regions is a very close match to the putative <italic>boxA</italic> sequences upstream of the cyanobacterial CRISPR arrays, and there are no enriched sequences that more closely resemble the <italic>E. coliboxA</italic> consensus; hence, we are confident that the cyanobacterial <italic>boxA</italic> sequences upstream of CRISPR arrays are genuine. These data are included in a new supplementary figure. Given that cyanobacterial species lack <italic>rho</italic>, we conclude that the BoxA elements in cyanobacterial CRISPR array RNAs have a function that is distinct from antagonizing Rho. We propose two possible functions. First, there may be an unknown transcription termination mechanism in cyanobacteria that the Nus factor complex can inhibit. Second, the Nus factor complex may be required to loop the RNA between the BoxA sequence and the transcribing RNA polymerase, perhaps to promote crRNA processing. This latter possibility could also apply in species that have <italic>rho</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Clarify the statistical methods used in the ChIP-seq experiments. For example, in Figure 4A, it appears as though the purple data points indeed cluster away from the orange, but in Figure 4—figure supplement 2A, it is less clear which of the blue data points cluster away from the orange data points in a statistically significant manner.</p></disp-quote><p>We considered using a statistical test to determine which datapoints in Figures 4, 5, Figure 3—figure supplement 1 and Figure 4—figure supplement 2 have significantly lower Cas5 occupancy than expected by chance. However, this is not a straightforward analysis, largely because we did not define a null hypothesis before doing the experiment. We think the magnitude of the effects observed, and the trends as they relate to spacer position within the two arrays, are more important than <italic>p</italic>-values, and we hope the data speak for themselves in that regard. We note that the ratios of Cas5 binding in <italic>boxA</italic> mutant vs wild-type strains are shown in Figures 4B and Figure 4—figure supplement 2B. We do not show these ratios in Figure 5 because there is nothing to normalize to. Lastly, we have reworded three instances where we previously described differences as “significant”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Throughout the manuscript, it is implied that the proposed antitermination mechanism occurs in all CRISPR-Cas types, while experimental data was collected for only two Type I systems. It is important to explicitly state which CRISPR Type(s) were found to harbor boxA sequences (Figure 7A) to support the possibility that a general mechanism has been discovered and to clarify how this conclusion relates to the work presented by Lin et al., 2019.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting point, and one we had not considered. We have modified Supplementary file 4 to show the different types of CRISPR-Cas system associated with each species listed. Of the 187 species tested, only 17 lack a type I CRISPR-Cas system (many have multiple types). 15 of these 17 species have only a type II-C system, and none of these 15 species have an identified <italic>boxA</italic> sequence between <italic>cas2</italic> and their CRISPR arrays. Thus, their appears to be a mutually exclusive relationship between type II-C systems and the presence of <italic>boxA</italic> sequences between <italic>cas2</italic> and CRISPR arrays. Beyond this, it is difficult to conclude much. There are two species with only a type III system that have a putative <italic>boxA</italic>, suggesting that <italic>boxA</italic>-mediated antitermination is not exclusive to type I systems.</p><p>We wondered why type II-C systems might lack <italic>boxA</italic> sequences. For the two well-characterized type II-C systems, the CRISPR array is adjacent to <italic>cas2</italic>, but is unusual in that it is transcribed in the opposite orientation to <italic>cas2</italic>. Hence, the sequences we used to search for <italic>boxA</italic> sequences may be from the wrong side of the type II-C CRISPR arrays. To test this possibility, we repeated the search for enriched sequence motifs using 300 nt sequences from the other side of the 15 type II-C arrays (sequences from other 172 species were unchanged). We did not identify a <italic>boxA</italic> sequence adjacent to any of the 15 type II-C arrays. Previous work on type II-C systems has shown that some type II-C repeats contain a promoter, such that each spacer has its own promoter immediately upstream. Not many type II-C systems have been studied, but it has been suggested that this phenomenon is true for most type II-C repeats. We suspect that this provides an alternative way to avoid Rho termination. We now raise this possibility in the Discussion.</p><p>While there are clearly parallels between our work and that of Lin <italic>et al.</italic>, we have identified a processive antitermination mechanism (i.e. a mechanism that modifies the RNA polymerase to make it resistant to Rho throughout the transcription unit) that applies to entire CRISPR arrays and is phylogenetically widespread, whereas Lin <italic>et al.</italic> identified a targeted antitermination mechanism (i.e. a mechanism that prevents one instance of Rho loading) that applies to leader sequences in a narrow range of species. A processive antitermination mechanism rather than a targeted antitermination mechanism is important because the sequences of newly acquired spacers cannot be anticipated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 7 was generated while working under the assumption that CRISPR arrays appear downstream of cas2. While this may be true for some CRISPR-Cas systems, this approach excludes many systems with slightly different genomic architectures. For a more unbiased approach, search for boxA sequences directly upstream of the first repeat in a CRISPR array. This approach is anticipated to provide more reliable evidence to support the general prevalence of boxA sequences upstream of CRISPR arrays.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this would be an interesting analysis, but it is technically a lot more challenging than the analysis focused on <italic>cas2</italic>. For example, we would need to determine the orientation of every CRISPR array, and we would need to define an upstream window to search within. We actually tried to do this analysis, but struggled to find a way to extract sequences upstream of all CRISPR arrays in batch, and to get the correct orientation. Aligning the CRISPR array relative to <italic>cas2</italic> likely identifies the correct orientation in most cases, with the exception of type II-C systems described above. Moreover, <italic>cas2</italic> provides a natural upstream barrier. We believe that the existing analysis makes a strong enough case that BoxA-mediated antitermination is phylogenetically widespread.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors speculate that &quot;Rho termination acts as a selective pressure to limit adaptation in species that lack an antitermination mechanism&quot;. However, the possible role of Rho in limiting adaption seems indirect at best. If Rho-dependent termination limits the number of different spacers that can be expressed from a single locus then this will limit selective pressures that maintain &quot;older spacers&quot;, but the advantage this afford the host is unclear. Furthermore, role of Nus would be expected to have an opposing impact on CRISPR length, so it is unclear how this explains an abundance of short CRISPRs and the authors do not clarify how these observations fit with the numerous genomes that do have long CRISPRs.</p></disp-quote><p>Our data are insufficient to conclude that the presence of Rho causes many CRISPR arrays to be short, but we think this is likely in cases where there isn’t an antitermination mechanism, and hence we discuss this, clearly framed as speculation. Of note, we show that in <italic>Salmonella</italic>, mutating the <italic>boxA</italic> can impact spacers as early as spacer 9 (relative to the leader), and potentially further upstream than that (we have no data for spacers 3-8 in the CRISPR-II array). We also cannot say with any degree of certainty that other antitermination mechanisms exist, but we suspect they do, and that would explain how some species with <italic>rho</italic> have long CRISPR arrays. We think it is possible that many species lack any antitermination mechanism for their CRISPR arrays, which would be consistent with them having short arrays. Again, we are careful to frame this as speculation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results first paragraph, specify what CRISPR-Cas Type and subtype you are working with.</p></disp-quote><p>Fixed.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors provide convincing experimental evidence for the competing roles of Rho and Nus in CRISPR transcription, but I am still not convinced by the arguments about the how these factors impact CRISPR length.</p><p>One of the reviewers raised this concern during the review.
