together with BRCA1 regulate selection of DNA double-strand break repair mechanisms. Localization of DNA repair factors to sites of DNA damage by 53BP1 is controlled by its oligomerization domain (OD) and binding to LC8, a hub protein that functions to dimerize &gt;100 clients. Here, we show that 53BP1 OD is a trimer, an unusual finding for LC8 clients which are all dimers or tetramers. As a trimer, 53BP1 forms a heterogeneous mixture of complexes when bound to dimeric LC8, with the largest mass corresponding to a dimer-of-trimers bridged by 3 LC8 dimers. Analytical ultracentrifugation and isothermal titration calorimetry demonstrate that only the second of the three LC8 recognition motifs is necessary for a stable bridged complex. The stability of the bridged complex is tuned by multivalency, binding specificity of the second LC8 site, and the length of the linker separating the LC8 binding domain and OD. 53BP1 mutants deficient in bridged species fail to impact 53BP1 focus formation in human cell culture studies, suggesting that the primary role of LC8 is to bridge 53BP1 trimers, which in turn promotes recruitment of 53BP1 at sites of DNA damage. We propose that the formation of higher-order oligomers of 53BP1 explains how LC8 elicits an improvement in 53BP1 foci and affects the structure and functions of 53BP1.</p></abstract><kwd-group

200 kDa protein involved in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Iwabuchi et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rappold et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mirza-Aghazadeh-Attari et al., 2019</xref>). Together, breast cancer type 1 susceptibility gene (BRCA1) and 53BP1 regulate pathway selection for DNA double-strand break repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gupta et al., 2014</xref>). 53BP1 binds and protects DNA ends formed by double-strand breaks, limiting end resection and promoting use of nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) for DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rappold et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ward et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Becker et al., 2018</xref>). BRCA1 is necessary for the eviction of 53BP1 from chromatin, allowing for end resection factors to initiate homology-directed repair (HDR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bouwman et al., 2010</xref>). In the absence of functional BRCA1, the HDR pathway is nonfunctional, and error-prone NHEJ dominates double-strand break repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bunting et al., 2010</xref>). Aberrant NHEJ results in genome instability such as chromosomal rearrangements and radial chromosome formation. Chemotherapy drugs such as PARPi and platinum-based drugs are effective against BRCA-negative cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rappold et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Becker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Ejeh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">West et al., 2019</xref>). However, in BRCA-negative cells, inactivation of 53BP1 once again activates HDR, resulting in loss of efficacy of PARPi and other chemotherapy agents. Understanding the functional states of 53BP1 is therefore critical to creating effective drugs and treatment strategies for cancer patients.</p><p>In response to DNA damage, 53BP1 forms nuclear bodies which mark sites of DNA double-strand breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Becker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schultz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kilic et al., 2019</xref>). Upon induction of DNA damage, 53BP1 is recruited to sites of DNA double-strand break and is retained on chromatin through interactions between modified histones and the tudor domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zgheib et al., 2009</xref>), ubiquitin-dependent recognition domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fradet-Turcotte et al., 2013</xref>), and oligomerization domain (OD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kelliher et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The long N-terminal disordered domain of 53BP1 (residues 1â1230), which contains 28 putative ATM kinase recognition (S/TQ) motifs, is phosphorylated by ATM kinase at multiple sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zgheib et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jowsey et al., 2007</xref>), which results in recruitment of downstream effectors active in protection of DNA ends (e.g. RIF1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zimmermann et al., 2013</xref>], Rev7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ghezraoui et al., 2018</xref>], and Shieldin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Noordermeer et al., 2018</xref>]) or in NHEJ (e.g. PTIP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wu et al., 2009</xref>]). The recruitment of 53BP1 to nuclear bodies is critical to its function in DNA repair.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Domain architecture of 53BP1 and preliminary characterization.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Map of 53BP1 domain architecture showing LC8 binding sites (QT1-3) in blue and the oligomerization domain (OD) in magenta.

LC8 is a hub protein that binds &gt;100 client proteins at their disordered regions in its two symmetric binding grooves, facilitating the dimerization of the client proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jespersen et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benison et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barbar and Nyarko, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Interplay between the OD and LC8 binding domain (LBD) is crucial to the function of 53BP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Becker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">West et al., 2019</xref>). Either the OD mutant (ODm) or LC8 binding mutant (LC8m) reduces 53BP1 nuclear bodies, and a construct containing both mutations reduces nuclear bodies to levels similar to the control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Becker et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, the LC8m shows reduced DNA repair activity, while the ODm is inactive in DNA repair, and the LC8m/ODm construct is not even efficiently recruited to nuclear bodies. The functional synergy between the OD and LC8 binding in the formation of 53BP1 nuclear bodies supports a model in which LC8 either stabilizes dimeric 53BP1 to increase affinity for bivalent interaction with chromatin as proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Becker et al., 2018</xref>) or that LC8 stimulates higher-order oligomerization in 53BP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lou et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>LC8 binds a highly variable short linear recognition motif in disordered regions of client proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jespersen et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benison et al., 2007</xref>). A well-conserved triad, TQT, most frequently occupies the anchor of this motif, but the entire sequence is variable. Due to the strong preference for binding to QT motifs, we refer to LC8 binding sites as QT sites (or QTs). Both the OD of 53BP1 and the binding of the three QTs to dimeric LC8 are expected to contribute to oligomerization of 53BP1. Intriguing about our work here is the discovery that 53BP1 is a trimeric LC8 client (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), leading to the question of how dimeric LC8 binds a trimeric client and the functional role of this binding. The well-described mechanisms through which LC8 regulates oligomeric clients include regulation of the affinity of self-association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kidane et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barbar and Nyarko, 2014</xref>), structuring of the disordered region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nyarko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gaik et al., 2015</xref>), and alignment of domains by restriction of the conformational ensemble of the client (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jespersen et al., 2019b</xref>). Here, we show a novel binding mode for LC8, bridging of trimeric client subcomplexes, and propose that LC8 improves 53BP1 focus formation through heterogeneous bridging of 53BP1 subcomplexes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structural characterization of LBD-OD</title><p>The OD of 53BP1 spans residues 1231â1279 based on truncation studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zgheib et al., 2009</xref>). Disorder prediction by IUPred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">ErdÅs et al., 2021</xref>) suggests that residues 1240â1270 are ordered. Since coiled-coils are the most common type of OD in LC8 binding clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barbar and Nyarko, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benison et al., 2008</xref>), we ran predictions for coiled-coil propensity. Neither Waggawagga (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kollmar and Simm, 2019</xref>) nor Marcoil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Delorenzi and Speed, 2002</xref>) predicts any coiled-coils in this region. Circular dichroism (CD) of a construct of the OD spanning residues 1200â1290 shows a single minimum near 218 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) consistent with a primarily beta-sheet structure. Fitting this data with BeStSel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Micsonai et al., 2015</xref>) estimates a primarily beta-sheet structure with some propensity for an alpha-helical structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Structure prediction algorithms are in general agreement in the structured regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). AlphaFold2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>) and PsiPred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McGuffin et al., 2000</xref>) predict an entirely beta-sheet structure, while JPred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Drozdetskiy et al., 2015</xref>) predicts a mixture of alpha-helices and beta-strands. Since the BeStSel CD-based structure analysis estimates a higher percentage of structure than the sequence-based predictions, we conclude that the increased structure is due to some folding upon oligomerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>The LBD remains disordered in the context of the OD, as shown by a sharp peak near 200 nm and a smaller minimum around 218 nm in the CD spectrum, consistent with a primarily disordered structure containing some beta-sheet structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).

Interestingly, both QT1 and QT3 binding give non-sigmoidal isotherms that we attribute to multistep binding. One model that explains the data is that two chains of the trimer bind to LC8, leaving the third chain available to bridge the available chain from another trimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). To test this model, we reversed the direction of titration, resulting in an excess of LC8 in early titration points, which we hypothesized would push the reaction such that each QT3-OD binding site was fully bound at every injection. Titrating QT3-OD into LC8 produced a perfectly sigmoidal isotherm, indicating that no intermediate is formed in line with our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p><p>The resulting thermodynamic parameters as calculated by the OSS model are based on a convolution of the stronger intratrimeric binding and the weaker intertrimeric (bridging) LC8 binding and therefore are a weighted average of the two events. The sigmoidal isotherm observed when titrating LC8 into QT2-OD can be explained as due to the intermediate being only briefly occupied, suggesting that the bridging interaction has a stronger binding affinity similar to that of the intratrimeric LC8 binding than with the other single site mutants. We modeled our system as a hexamer with three binding events (two intratrimer events and one bridging event) using a subsequent binding sites (SBS) model in Origin 7.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L</xref>), which enables extracting thermodynamics of multiple binding events. Using this model, we identify two clearly different binding affinities in the one-site LBD-OD variants. We assign the lower affinity binding event to the bridging of 53BP1 trimers and the higher affinity to the intratrimer interactions. For the intratrimer interactions, the difference in affinity for each variant is very small (K<sub>d</sub> between 0.3 and 0.6 ÂµM), while the difference between affinities for bridging interactions is larger (K<sub>d</sub> between 1 and 5 ÂµM). The variant with the smallest difference between bridging affinity and intratrimer interactions is QT2-OD (intratrimer K<sub>d</sub> = 0.3 ÂµM, intertrimer K<sub>d</sub> = 1.1 ÂµM). This small difference explains the absence of intermediates in ITC isotherms for LBD-OD containing intact QT2. Additionally, the fact that QT2-OD has the strongest affinity for the bridging interaction provides a mechanistic explanation for our observation that QT2 is essential for a strongly bridged dimer-of-trimers complex. Overall, the SBS fitting of LBD-OD one-site mutant isotherms clearly shows that there are multiple complexes formed with different populations, that the binding at the three recognition motifs is different, and that binding at QT2 is the only binding with a low energy barrier between the different complexes.</p><p>To better understand the interplay between multiple LC8 sites in 53BP1, we performed ITC on two-site mutants of LBD-OD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5FâI</xref>). All interactions have affinities around 0.5 Î¼M, but QT13-OD, the only two-site mutant not containing QT2, gives a non-sigmoidal isotherm. Again, when we reverse the direction of titration (QT13-OD into LC8), the isotherm becomes sigmoidal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H and I</xref>). Since all LBD-ODm containing QT2 have sigmoidal isotherms, we attribute the non-sigmoidal isotherms to the formation of a trimeric intermediate and suggest that QT2 binding may pay the entropic penalty for bridging 53BP1 trimers.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Reducing linker length between LBD and OD stabilizes dimer-of-trimers</title><p>For ASCIZ, which binds LC8 multivalently to regulate transcription, linker length contributes to both compositional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Walker et al., 2023</xref>) and conformational (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reardon et al., 2020</xref>) heterogeneity. To determine a possible similar effect for linker length on 53BP1 heterogeneity, we focused on the linker between 53BP1 LBD and OD, hypothesizing that the LBD-OD linker would regulate the bridging interaction.

The similarity of the phosphodeficient mutant to the WT and the strong loss of foci in the phosphomimetic show that QT2 is not phosphorylated in response to ionizing radiation and argues against the importance of phosphorylation at this site in nuclear repair foci. Constructs with QT2 binding removed by AAA mutation (QT3 and QT13) fail to show a significant improvement in focus formation over the LC8 binding null mutant, while the mutant containing only QT2 does provide an enhancement. All of this together suggest a role for QT2 in regulating the enhancement from LC8 in focus formation of 53BP1, which we propose to be mediated through heterogeneous bridging of 53BP1 trimers.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>53BP1 is a key player in the regulation of DNA damage repair, entering DNA repair foci upon induction of DNA damage and orchestrating selection of double-strand break repair pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bunting et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schultz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lottersberger et al., 2013</xref>).

Mutation of LC8 binding sites results in DNA repair-deficient 53BP1 and reduces the number of nuclear bodies formed upon induction of DNA damage, suggesting synergistic function between the 53BP1 OD and LC8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Becker et al., 2018</xref>). Since LC8 functions as a dimerization hub, often regulating the dimerization of client proteins or contributing to higher-order oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kidane et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barbar and Nyarko, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barbar, 2008</xref>), it was proposed that LC8 rescues 53BP1 foci by dimerizing 53BP1 in the absence of the OD. Here, we provide the first evidence that 53BP1 is a trimer, not a dimer, that its interaction with LC8 forms a heterogeneous mixture containing bridged complexes, and that this bridging of two trimers by LC8 is what regulates 53BP1 foci formation.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>53BP1 is a trimer and forms a dimer-of-trimers with LC8</title><p>While clients of LC8 are often dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barbar and Nyarko, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gaik et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jespersen et al., 2019b</xref>), and occasionally tetramers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">SzaniszlÃ³ et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rodriguez Galvan et al., 2021</xref>), there are no reports of trimeric clients. Interestingly, we find that 53BP1 is a trimer and that LC8 can stimulate higher-order oligomerization by bridging two trimers of 53BP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and D</xref>). The trimer association state is confirmed by peak and mass similarity in SEC-MALS over a 10-fold difference in concentration. It is also confirmed by using two constructs containing the OD but of different lengths and both giving a mass for a trimer, indicating that self-association is not dependent on the construct used.</p><p>How does the 53BP1 trimer bind to the dimeric LC8 is a complicated question and requires rigorous investigation. A titration of 53BP1 LBD-OD analyzed by <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC shows uniform peak loss at the three LC8 binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), suggesting that LC8 binds 53BP1 cooperatively and that there is no preference for any QT to be filled before other QTs. Results from AUC show heterogeneous complexes, while SEC-MALS identifies the multiple complexes that survived dissociation on the column. Multiple peaks from both measurements are assigned to species with masses corresponding to LBD-OD bound to LC8 in trimer, bridged dimer-of-trimers, and intermediate species that could be dimeric, trimeric, or tetrameric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The difference in complexes observed by SEC-MALS and AUC indicates that while all QTs can generate multiple complexes, only QT2 is effective at forming the larger presumably bridged species stable enough to remain bound upon dilution during SEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>).</p><p>ITC supports a model in which QT2 is the primary motif that LC8 uses to form the larger complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). When titrating LC8 into LBD-ODm that retain a single LC8 site, QT2 is the one-site mutant that has the highest favorable enthalpy for LC8 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>); this is observed with both LBD and LBD-OD, indicating it is a property of the motif. Additionally, all LBD-ODm with QT2 binding removed show isotherms consistent with two-step binding. These isotherm shapes are not seen in titrations of LBD alone. For example, QT13-OD would first form a stable trimer bound to 2 LC8 dimers, leaving one of the LBD chains completely unoccupied, which upon further addition of LC8 will form a bridged trimer. When the titration is reversed (QT13-OD into LC8), there is no intermediate detected because the trimer complex is not stable in excess LC8, providing support for our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). SBS fits of ITC data of one-site LBD-ODm show a small difference in affinity between bridging and intratrimer interactions only for QT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L</xref>), which explains the absence of an intermediate species in constructs containing QT2.</p><p>Together, these data suggest a complex structure in which the 53BP1 OD trimers are bridged by LC8 and stabilized through interaction with QT2.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>LC8 binding forms heterogeneous 53BP1 complexes</title><p>LC8 is a hub protein involved in binding &gt;100 client proteins at disordered regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jespersen et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barbar and Nyarko, 2015</xref>), facilitating their dimerization and regulating their physiological functions. While it is clearly established that binding to LC8 results in dimerization of the client (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barbar, 2008</xref>), the structural and physiological consequences of LC8 binding can be more complex. Rigidification of the disordered strand (Nup159) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nyarko et al., 2013</xref>), restriction of conformational ensemble (RavP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jespersen et al., 2019b</xref>), regulation of self-association (Swa) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kidane et al., 2013</xref>), higher-order oligomerization (LCA5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">SzaniszlÃ³ et al., 2022</xref>), and client regulation through cooperative binding (ASCIZ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rapali et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clark et al., 2018</xref>) are all mechanisms by which LC8 regulates its clientsâ functions. Here, we identify higher-order assembly of trimeric 53BP1 as a novel binding mode for LC8.</p><p>The outcome of the interaction between 53BP1 and LC8 is higher-order oligomerization of 53BP1, but there is an upper boundary to the size of the complex formed. Once 53BP1 forms the bridged dimer-of-trimers complex, there are no LBD chains available to bind (trimer 53BP1 leaves one free chain after LC8 binds) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). A similar mechanism is seen in the interaction between LCA5 and LC8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">SzaniszlÃ³ et al., 2022</xref>). LCA5 has two LC8 binding sites and tetrameric coiled-coils; however, the arrangement of these domains is unique for LC8 clients. The two coiled-coils are located on either side of the LC8 binding sites, and as a result, each LC8 site is capable of bridging to a different LCA5 tetramer. Since there is always a free LC8 site to bridge to another LCA5 subcomplex, the higher-order oligomerization is unbounded, resulting in large assemblies of LCA5-LC8 that appear as beads-on-a-string by electron microscopy. While LCA5 and 53BP1 both form higher-order assemblies bridged by LC8 dimers, they form drastically different complexes, presumably due to their difference in native oligomeric state. The trimeric OD of 53BP1 results in bounded bridging with an upper limit of a dimer-of-trimers, while LCA5 exhibits unbounded bridging in complex with LC8.</p><p>Given that all LC8 sites are filled simultaneously and that QT2 appears to be sufficient for bridging, what is then the reason for multivalent sites in 53BP1-LC8 interactions? The binding enhancement from multivalent LC8 interactions is minimal in this case, contrary to what is observed with ASCIZ QT2-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Walker et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reardon et al., 2020</xref>) and Nup159, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nyarko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gaik et al., 2015</xref>) for example. WT LBD-OD has a K<sub>d</sub> of 0.4 Î¼M, while two-site mutants have K<sub>d</sub> between 0.4 and 0.7 Î¼M. Either QT1 or QT3 could be absent and make almost no change to the overall affinity of the interaction (QT23-OD K<sub>d</sub> = 0.4 Î¼M QT12=OD K<sub>d</sub> = 0.5 Î¼M). A model in which LC8 binding stabilizes bivalent contacts between 53BP1 and modified histones due to the restriction of the conformational ensemble of 53BP1 has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Becker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, 53BP1 dimer). Such a binding mode is seen in the dimeric LC8 binding client, RavP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), where LC8 binding restricts its conformational ensemble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jespersen et al., 2019b</xref>). While there certainly is some binding enhancement of LBD-OD compared to QT2-OD and could possibly be some ordering of the 53BP1 LBD upon binding LC8 multivalently, we propose a different reason for multivalency in 53BP1-LC8 interactions. While QT2 is both necessary and sufficient for bridging, deletion of part of the linker separating LBD and OD results in a primarily bridged complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This implies that the location of the motif relative to the OD contributes to the bridging interaction. We propose that the motif specificity of QT2 and the position of QT1 and QT3 contribute to tuning the affinity of the bridging interaction, optimizing the relative population of trimer and bridged complexes.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Mechanism of LC8 enhancement of 53BP1 focus formation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon showing roles of LC8 in an interaction with RavP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jespersen et al., 2019b</xref>) (left), published mechanisms for LC8 with 53BP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Becker et al., 2018</xref>) (center), and revised mechanism based on this work (right). In RavP, the N-termini are aligned with LC8, but when LC8 binding is removed, the termini occupy a larger conformational ensemble. In the dimeric 53BP1 oligomerization domain (OD) model, 53BP1 is a dimer as long as either the OD or LC8 binding is intact. This model does not fully capture the effect of OD and LC8 mutation of 53BP1 focus formation and cannot be correct because 53BP1 is a trimer, not a dimer. An alternative model is the trimeric 53BP1 OD, which results in higher-order oligomerization of 53BP1 with LC8. Mutation of the OD or LC8 binding would then be expected to produce the observed differences in reductions in focus formation in the OD mutant (ODm) and LC8 binding mutant (LC8m).

Based on nuclear focus formation and chromatin association of 53BP1 OD and LC8 mutants, loss of LC8 binding results in only a modest reduction in chromatin association compared to the WT, while loss of the OD generates 53BP1 that is dimerized only by LC8 but has a significant reduction in chromatin association. Loss of both the OD and QTs abolishes 53BP1 foci almost completely. This model does not explain why the loss of LC8 is not the same as the loss of the OD. Our alternative model proposed in this work includes trimer and bridged 53BP1 oligomers to account for the change in 53BP1 chromatin association because of the higher affinity for histones due to increased avidity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, 53BP1 trimer). In this model, the LC8 binding deletion mutant is a trimer, and the OD deletion mutant is a dimer, also explaining the modest and large reduction in 53BP1 foci for these constructs, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Becker et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, our trimer and dimer-of-trimers model fully accounts for changes in 53BP1 function resulting from loss of LC8 binding and should provide a more accurate representation of 53BP1-LC8 interactions.</p><p>Given that QT2 is essential for bridging, the mutants were designed for testing the specific contribution of the bridged complex. Variants that reduced LC8 binding in QT2 (T1171E, QT3, QT1,3, Null) had the lowest number of foci formation. Important to note is that in our model, bridging improves focus formation, and, therefore, we are looking at small differences, a tuning effect rather than an on/off switch. With QT2 alone, foci formation is restored almost to the level of WT, compared to the Null, givng confidence that this difference is real. The T1171I mutant that does not reduce binding shows foci formation like WT. Taken together, these data support the contribution of bridging to enhancing foci formation and that QT2 binding is critical for this process, either through its specific motif binding or through its location relative to the OD as inferred from the linker deletion mutants, or both. In fact, previous experiments have shown that mutation of only T1171 to alanine results in loss of OD-independent foci formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Becker et al., 2018</xref>). The importance of T1171 in QT2 for bridging of 53BP1 trimers provides a possible explanation for the large impact of a single site mutation in 53BP1 foci formation. It is possible that bridging of 53BP1 trimers by LC8 is an important mechanism for regulating 53BP1 oligomeric state and function, but further research is necessary to determine whether this mechanism is physiologically relevant in 53BP1 foci formation. Current data suggest that 53BP1 is a dimer which forms higher-order assemblies under conditions of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lou et al., 2020</xref>). Future work will determine how the heterogeneous assemblies formed by 53BP1 are linked to its physiological functions.</p><p>In summary, we show for the first time that 53BP1 OD is a homogeneous trimer. Binding to LC8 results in a heterogeneous mixture of complexes with masses consistent with the formation of both trimer and bridged complexes of 53BP1, and possibly others. We speculate that heterogeneity in 53BP1-LC8 complexes may allow for improved recruitment of 53BP1 into nuclear repair foci, and the bridged complex stabilizes interactions with chromatin by allowing for more bivalent interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Both the trimer and bridged complexes can bind multiple histones, but the dimer-of-trimers could bind up to three histones (blue) bivalently, resulting in high avidity and retention in DNA repair foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Indeed, mutants deficient in bridging 53BP1 trimers in vitro failed to elicit an improvement in 53BP1 focus formation, while even the weakly bridging QT2 construct improved focus formation significantly compared to an LC8 binding null mutant, providing support for the physiological relevance of LC8 in bridging 53BP1 trimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>). Our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) explains previous data involving 53BP1-chromatin interactions and offers a new role for LC8 in the enhancement of 53BP1 foci.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning and site-directed mutagenesis</title><p>Studies were carried out using human 53BP1 (Uniprot: Q12888) and human LC8-2 (Uniprot: Q96FJ2).

The binding buffer contained 50 mM sodium phosphate and 150 mM sodium chloride (pH 7.2). LC8 at a concentration of 250â400 Î¼M was titrated into an LBD-OD construct. Cell concentrations were between 10 and 35 Î¼M for each LBD-ODm. For experiments where LBD-ODm was titrated into LC8, LBD-OD at a concentration of 300 Î¼M was titrated into LC8 mutant at a concentration of 10â15 Î¼M. Peak areas were integrated, and the data were fit into a one-site binding model in Origin 7.0 (OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA, USA). From this, stoichiometry (N), dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>), change in enthalpy (ÎH), and entropy (ÎS) were determined. Reported data are the average of triplicate runs. Error reported is the standard deviation of the data acquired.</p><p>Each isotherm of the one-site mutants of LBD-OD was additionally analyzed using the SBS models found within Origin for VP-ITC. We model that the hexamer binds 3 LC8 dimers, 2 of which bind with identical conditions (intratrimer; between two LBD chains within the same trimer) and 1 binds in a different condition (bridging; linking two 53BP1 trimers together). For SBS, the following constraints were applied: k1=k2; h1=h2; k1&gt;k3; h1&lt;h3. This fitting strategy was followed for every experimental replicate of each one-site mutant, and inverse-variance weighting (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1 equ2">Equations 1 and 2</xref>) was used to aggregate the measured values and their associated errors for each replicate.

The authors determine that (1) the oligomerization domain (OD) of 53BP1 exists as a trimer, which is unusual for LC8 clients, which typically form dimers or tetramers. They note that LC8 promotes the assembly of a complex consisting of a dimer-of-trimers, thereby enhancing the localization of 53BP1 at DNA damage sites. (2) The second of the three LC8 recognition motifs in 53BP1 is crucial for stable complex formation, Overall, these results challenge the current view of 53BP1 as exclusively dimeric, emphasizing the importance of trimerization and heterogeneous bridging in the formation of 53BP1 foci.</p><p>Strengths/weaknesses/limitations â focusing on main messages:</p><p>1. Proposed trimeric model for 53BP1 oligomers â There is still limited evidence to substantiate the proposed trimeric form of 53BP1. The authors' hypothesis of this unusual oligomeric state is based on SEC-MALS experiments. Notably, the proteins 53BP1 LBD and LBD-OD do not exhibit globular structures; instead, they have disordered and elongated shapes. Additionally, as noted by Omar Zgheib et al., higher oligomeric states of 53BP1, such as tetramers, coexist with dimers and quickly interconvert in solution, which can lead to mass heterogeneity in SEC peaks, as evidenced in figures 1F and 1H showing slopes across the peaks. In such cases, the trimeric form of 53BP1 might represent an intermediate state during the transition from dimer to tetramer.</p><p>2. Proposed model of LC8-dependent bridging of 53BP1 oligomers â There is a lack of direct evidence supporting its classification as a &quot;dimer of trimers&quot;, given that the SEC-MALS peaks are very close to the void volume, leading to inaccurate molecular weight estimates. Since 53BP1 is known to form higher-order oligomers, it is plausible that dimer-of-dimers with six LC8 dimers (MW 188 kDa) or trimer-of-dimers (hexamer) with an MW of 282 kDa could also align with the estimated molecular weights from SEC-MALS in this study.</p><p>Although the isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments in Figure 5A suggest that LC8 dimers interact with the 53BP1 LBD-OD at a 3:1 stoichiometry, this could also supports an alternative model where three LC8s bind to a 53BP1 LBD-OD dimer.</p><p>3. Relevance of proposed LC8-dependent bridging of 53BP1 â a weakness is the work does not go far enough to establish and/or test the physiological relevance of the hypothesized 53BP1 trimer bridging, or the function of 53BP1-LC8 interplay, beyond what was already known. LC8-enforced 53BP1 dynamics within foci at DNA damage sites was already experimentally demonstrated in the literature, using more precise measurements in living cells where more information could be gleaned.</p><p>Points to consider and/or address:</p><p>1) Figure 3 â 3B Again the SEC peak was over interpreted. It is too close to the void, hence the mass result was influenced by the aggregates.</p><p>2) Figure 4 â The AUC data need to process further â calculate approximate MW of the complex</p><p>3) The X axis labels in panel C do not align very well. The peak with intermedium MW in LBD-OB, between the &quot;bridge&quot; complex and &quot;intramolecular&quot; complex has not been assigned to any model.</p><p>4) Figure 5. Panel L: A sequential binding model may not be suitable to fit the data in LBD and mutants except QT3 and QT13 which showed obvious biphasic binding curves.</p><p>5) Figure 6. Panel B the peak assigned to &quot;bridge complex&quot; seems to have a ~400kDa mass. Addition information/evidence is necessary to demonstrate the bridge complex exists.</p><p>6) Figure 7. Panel D and its respective quantification in F, do not seem to correlate. The thresholding scoring '% cells with &gt;10 foci' is also not appropriate for this assay, since the defect is unlikely be numeric (i.e. affect foci number), given that the LC8 motifs are not essential for recruitment into DNA damage foci in the context of such a minimal protein fragment. Focal intensity, and protein dynamics/mobility in foci, however, are much more likely be affected by loss of LC8 bridging: e.g. altered dynamics/residence time of QT mutant 53BP1 was previously demonstrated by FRAP in Ref 6. The data in 7D-E do not capture such altered behavior, and conversely offer less useful insight than the previous work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors characterize mixed oligomers formed by the DNA repair factor 53BP1 and the scaffold protein LC8 (dynein light chain 8). Using biochemistry and biophysical experiments they show that various mixed heterooligomers can form, involving OD trimers and LC8 dimers with varying stoichiometries, depending on specific interaction LC8 binding motifs present in an 53BP1 IDR.</p><p>The manuscript presents interesting and significant findings on the 53BP1/LC8 interactions, supported by strong biochemical and biophysical evidence, which is linked to the formation of 53BP1 foci in cells.</p><p>The authors study the formation of mixed oligomers involving the oligomerization domain (OD) of the DNA repair factor 53BP1 and the scaffold protein LC8 (dynein light chain 8). Using biochemistry and biophysical experiments they show that various mixed heterooligomers are formed involving OD trimers and LC8 dimers with varying stoichiometries, depending on specific interaction motifs (3 LC8 binding motifs &quot;QT&quot;) in an 53BP1 IDR and affinities. By mutational analysis in vitro and in cell experiments an important role for the formation of heterooligomers is found for the second motif, QT2. The authors propose that a novel binding mode for LC8, i.e. bridging of trimeric client complexes may play a role for 53BP1 foci formation.</p><p>The manuscript presents a careful and interesting analysis of molecular features that contribute to the formation of specific higher order complexes from 53BP1 trimers and LC8 dimers, which bridge two 53BP1 trimers, mainly depending on QT2 in the 53BP1 binding region for LC8.</p><p>This is interesting study will be useful to dissect the specific roles and mechanisms of LC8 oligomers with 53BP1 and link them with biological function. The work is technically sound and well written, considering the complexity of the systems. Structural details and mechanisms for the proposed oligomerization states are not provided, but obtaining these will also be highly challenging and laborious. Nevertheless, the study sheds new light onto mechanisms of LC8 mediated oligomerization with unique features with 53BP1 and a specific role in DNA repair.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>â The role of the oligomerization for foci information is an interesting aspect. However, the cellular data are more complex than the binary in vitro analysis with just the two proteins. This should be clarified. E.g. what is required for foci formation in cells, are the additional factors that could bind to either of the proteins that need to be considered?</p><p>â Can the authors reconstitute droplets in vitro from mixing the two proteins with additional components, i.e. full-length proteins and/or DNA?</p><p>â For the condensate formation one would expect multivalent interactions to play a role. While this is clearly possible given the oligomerization of the two components a defined 2:3 heteroligomer would not necessarily enable the formation of large networks in a condensate state. Can this be explored with the QT mutants using in vitro condensate assays?</p><p>â Figure 2A: the authors should comment on the lack of signals seen for the OD. Have they tried to observe signals for the OD at higher temperature and using deuterated protein?</p><p>â Figure 1 panel labels/explanations are not correct, i.e. for (F).</p><p>â Please provide in each figure legend, which constructs have been used (residue numbers and domains included) for the respective data shown for LC8 and 53BP1. This seems not always consistent, e.g. in Figure 1E 1200-1290 is used, which in Figure 1A LBD-OD is indicated as 1140-1290, in Figure 2, OD signals are apparently missing, make a comment on this in the legend.</p><p>â How can the ITC data be rationalized, e.g. the different titration curves and the different contributions of enthalpy/entropy for QT motifs. Can this be rationalized with structural models of the QT2 motifs binding to LC8? Why does QT2 have unfavourable binding entropy distinct from QT1 and QT3? And why is the QT13-OD non sigmoidal?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.102179.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) Provide additional evidence for the trimeric model of 53BP1 oligomers:</p><p>The current conclusion that 53BP1 forms stable trimers is primarily based on SEC-MALS data, which are limited by protein heterogeneity and elongated shapes.

The use of SEC coupled to MALS is to separate components of heterogeneous systems to be measured separately. Our mass measurement by MALS is therefore affected by peak overlap, but not elongated shape. We are careful to measure mass by MALS near the center of peaks, where most of the sample is available to scatter and there is minimal peak overlap. It is our understanding that this is common practice for MALS measurements.</p><p>We would like to emphasize the large loading concentration range (75-750 Î¼M) in which the mass measurement of the OD is constant, suggesting a lack of concentration-dependent exchange between oligomeric states (i.e. Absence of dimer/tetramer exchange). The Figure 1 legend was missing this description, and this is possibly why the reviewers missed it.</p><p>Another evidence that strongly supports the trimer is that we have done SEC-MALS on a smaller construct containing the OD, and that also showed a mass for a trimer (Figure 1). Having two different size constructs showing masses for a trimer gives more confidence in the reproducibility of the results.</p><p>Alternative experiments for measuring the mass of 53BP1 OD accurately were attempted. AUC sedimentation equilibrium experiments were run several times, but the extended length of the experiment resulted in significant degradation of the sample and inaccurate mass estimates. Native mass spectrometry experiments were attempted and showed primarily a monomer peak as expected because a monomer is more easily observed in the gas phase. It also showed a minor peak for a trimer and a hexamer and therefore while inconclusive, are consistent with a trimeric structure over a dimeric or tetrameric.</p><p>We have included in the Discussion (see tracked version) a summary of all the evidence for a trimer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Reassess the &quot;dimer-of-trimers&quot; model for LC8-mediated bridging:</p><p>The SEC-MALS data near the void volume result in imprecise molecular weight estimates, leaving open the possibility of alternative stoichiometries (e.g., dimers or higher-order assemblies).

Variants that reduced LC8 binding in QT2 (T1171E, QT3, QT1,3, Null) had the lowest number of foci formation. Important to note is that in our model, bridging improves focus formation and therefore we are looking at small differences, a tuning effect rather than an on/off switch. With QT2 alone restoring foci formation almost to the level of WT, compared to the Null, gives confidence that this difference is real. The T1171I mutant that does not reduce binding show similar foci formation like WT. Taken together, these data support contribution of bridging to enhancing foci formation, and that QT2 binding is critical for this process, either through its specific motif binding or through its location relative to the OD as inferred from the linker deletion mutants, or both.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This study presents a useful investigation into how 53BP1 protein oligomers may be organised upon engaging chromatin at sites of DNA damage.

No major aggregation peaks were observed in the AUC chromatograms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure 4 â The AUC data need to process further â calculate approximate MW of the complex.</p></disp-quote><p>From the sedimentation velocity we cannot accurately determined the MW of the complex because of the disorder.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The X axis labels in panel C do not align very well. The peak with intermedium MW in LBD-OB, between the &quot;bridge&quot; complex and &quot;intramolecular&quot; complex has not been assigned to any model.</p></disp-quote><p>The peak with intermediate MW is for an intermediate that can be partially occupied with LC8 as shown in Figure 3D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 5. Panel L: A sequential binding model may not be suitable to fit the data in LBD and mutants except QT3 and QT13 which showed obvious biphasic binding curves.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct, a sequential model is not suitable and thatâs why did analysis with both methods for all binding interactions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 6. Panel B the peak assigned to &quot;bridge complex&quot; seems to have a ~400kDa mass. Addition information/evidence is necessary to demonstrate the bridge complex exists.</p></disp-quote><p>The mass starting with about 300 is the same as that of Figure 3B. What is important in this data is that there is a major shift to a higher complex, by changing the length of the linker one obvious explanation is an effect on bridging, rather than binding and this data support the bridged complex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 7. Panel D and its respective quantification in F, do not seem to correlate. The thresholding scoring '% cells with &gt;10 foci' is also not appropriate for this assay, since the defect is unlikely be numeric (i.e. affect foci number), given that the LC8 motifs are not essential for recruitment into DNA damage foci in the context of such a minimal protein fragment. Focal intensity, and protein dynamics/mobility in foci, however, are much more likely be affected by loss of LC8 bridging: e.g. altered dynamics/residence time of QT mutant 53BP1 was previously demonstrated by FRAP in Ref 6. The data in 7D-E do not capture such altered behavior, and conversely offer less useful insight than the previous work.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that FRAP would have been a better experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors characterize mixed oligomers formed by the DNA repair factor 53BP1 and the scaffold protein LC8 (dynein light chain 8). Using biochemistry and biophysical experiments they show that various mixed heterooligomers can form, involving OD trimers and LC8 dimers with varying stoichiometries, depending on specific interaction LC8 binding motifs present in an 53BP1 IDR.</p><p>The manuscript presents interesting and significant findings on the 53BP1/LC8 interactions, supported by strong biochemical and biophysical evidence, which is linked to the formation of 53BP1 foci in cells.</p><p>The authors study the formation of mixed oligomers involving the oligomerization domain (OD) of the DNA repair factor 53BP1 and the scaffold protein LC8 (dynein light chain 8). Using biochemistry and biophysical experiments they show that various mixed heterooligomers are formed involving OD trimers and LC8 dimers with varying stoichiometries, depending on specific interaction motifs (3 LC8 binding motifs &quot;QT&quot;) in an 53BP1 IDR and affinities. By mutational analysis in vitro and in cell experiments an important role for the formation of heterooligomers is found for the second motif, QT2. The authors propose that a novel binding mode for LC8, i.e. bridging of trimeric client complexes may play a role for 53BP1 foci formation.</p><p>The manuscript presents a careful and interesting analysis of molecular features that contribute to the formation of specific higher order complexes from 53BP1 trimers and LC8 dimers, which bridge two 53BP1 trimers, mainly depending on QT2 in the 53BP1 binding region for LC8.</p><p>This is interesting study will be useful to dissect the specific roles and mechanisms of LC8 oligomers with 53BP1 and link them with biological function. The work is technically sound and well written, considering the complexity of the systems. Structural details and mechanisms for the proposed oligomerization states are not provided, but obtaining these will also be highly challenging and laborious. Nevertheless, the study sheds new light onto mechanisms of LC8 mediated oligomerization with unique features with 53BP1 and a specific role in DNA repair.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>â The role of the oligomerization for foci information is an interesting aspect. However, the cellular data are more complex than the binary in vitro analysis with just the two proteins. This should be clarified. E.g. what is required for foci formation in cells, are the additional factors that could bind to either of the proteins that need to be considered?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the cellular data are much more complex and there are many other players as nicely explained in the introduction. However, this is the best we can do as a footnote in this largely biophysical study and the results we see while do not tell the whole story, show the small difference that is consistent with our model developed from in vitro studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â Can the authors reconstitute droplets in vitro from mixing the two proteins with additional components, i.e. full-length proteins and/or DNA?</p></disp-quote><p>This experiment is a good idea but it is way beyond the scope of this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â For the condensate formation one would expect multivalent interactions to play a role. While this is clearly possible given the oligomerization of the two components a defined 2:3 heteroligomer would not necessarily enable the formation of large networks in a condensate state. Can this be explored with the QT mutants using in vitro condensate assays?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good idea, but we did not see any evidence for it, and finding conditions is beyond the scope of this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â Figure 2A: the authors should comment on the lack of signals seen for the OD. Have they tried to observe signals for the OD at higher temperature and using deuterated protein?</p></disp-quote><p>We have tried changing the temperature up to 40C, but we did not try deuteration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â Figure 1 panel labels/explanations are not correct, i.e. for (F).</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected, thank you</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â Please provide in each figure legend, which constructs have been used (residue numbers and domains included) for the respective data shown for LC8 and 53BP1. This seems not always consistent, e.g. in Figure 1E 1200-1290 is used, which in Figure 1A LBD-OD is indicated as 1140-1290, in Figure 2, OD signals are apparently missing, make a comment on this in the legend.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment, we have included this information in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â How can the ITC data be rationalized, e.g. the different titration curves and the different contributions of enthalpy/entropy for QT motifs. Can this be rationalized with structural models of the QT2 motifs binding to LC8? Why does QT2 have unfavourable binding entropy distinct from QT1 and QT3? And why is the QT13-OD non sigmoidal?</p></disp-quote><p>We can only speculate, QT2 is the only site with an unfavorable entropy and very high enthalpic contribution. Also the placement of QT2 in the correct position relative to the OD is a factor, as suggested by the increase in bridging observed in the linker mutants. Additionally, the fact that QT2-OD has the strongest affinity for the bridging interaction provides a mechanistic explanation for our observation that QT2 is essential for a strongly bridged dimer-of-trimers complex.</p><p>We have added the following:</p><p>âSince all LBD-OD mutants containing QT2 have sigmoidal isotherms, we attribute the non-sigmoidal isotherms to the formation of a trimeric intermediate and suggest that QT2 binding may pay the entropic penalty for bridging 53BP1 trimers.â</p></body></sub-article></article>
