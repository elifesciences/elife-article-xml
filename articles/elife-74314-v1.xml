Analyses of naturalistic behaviors are often performed by hand or with expensive, inflexible commercial software. Recently, machine learning methods for markerless pose estimation enabled automated tracking of freely moving animals, including in labs with limited coding expertise. However, classifying specific behaviors based on pose data requires additional computational analyses and remains a significant challenge for many groups. We developed BehaviorDEPOT (DEcoding behavior based on POsitional Tracking), a simple, flexible software program that can detect behavior from video timeseries and can analyze the results of experimental assays. BehaviorDEPOT calculates kinematic and postural statistics from keypoint tracking data and creates heuristics that reliably detect behaviors. It requires no programming experience and is applicable to a wide range of behaviors and experimental designs. We provide several hard-coded heuristics. Our freezing detection heuristic achieves above 90% accuracy in videos of mice and rats, including those wearing tethered head-mounts. BehaviorDEPOT also helps researchers develop their own heuristics and incorporate them into the softwareâs graphical interface. Behavioral data is stored framewise for easy alignment with neural data. We demonstrate the immediate utility and flexibility of BehaviorDEPOT using popular assays including fear conditioning, decision-making in a T-maze, open field, elevated plus maze, and novel object exploration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>automated behavioral

relationships between neural activity and behavior. Discrete behaviors represent outward manifestations of cognitive and emotional processes. Popular laboratory assays for memory, decision-making, anxiety and novelty exploration typically require examination of behaviors occurring in particular locations in space or instances in time. However, it remains a major challenge to quantify naturalistic behaviors in the laboratory in a rapid, reliable, and spatiotemporally precise manner. In most labs, this work is done manually, a time-consuming process that is rife with inconsistency.</p><p>Automated detection of freely moving animal behaviors is faster and expands the parameter space that can be explored. Automated detection can also eliminate errors associated with manual annotation such as inter-rater inconsistency due to insufficient rater training and rater fatigue. The standardization promised by such methods enhances the rigor and reproducibility of results across research groups, which is a major concern in behavioral neuroscience. Commercially available software for automated behavior analysis is expensive and the underlying algorithms are hidden, which prevents customization or interrogation to determine why a particular result is reported. Moreover, commercially available behavior detectors are prone to failure when animals are wearing head-mounted hardware for manipulating or recording brain activity. As open-source hardware for recording and manipulating neural activity become increasingly available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Luo et al., 2018</xref>), more labs are integrating optogenetics, miniscopes, fiber photometry and electrophysiological recordings into their behavioral experiments. This expansion of the research space includes labs without established computational expertise to quantify complex behaviors or align them with precisely timed manipulations or biological signals. Flexible, easy-to-use, open-source software is needed to automate analysis of freely moving behaviors and facilitate subsequent analyses.</p><p>To label behaviors automatically, animals must first be segmented from their environment and tracked through space and time. Previously established methods use techniques including background subtraction and pattern classifiers to estimate animal positions in video timeseries and then abstract animal movement to a center of mass or an ellipse for analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ohayon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Branson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Noldus et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Geuther et al., 2021</xref>). After segmentation and tracking, the challenge then is to use data about animal movements to classify discrete behaviors that represent useful information about the cognitive or emotional state of the animal. JAABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kabra et al., 2013</xref>) uses machine learning to classify behaviors based on the outputs of tracking systems such as MotionTracker (MoTr) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ohayon et al., 2013</xref>) and Ctrax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Branson et al., 2009</xref>), which fit ellipses to track animal movements. JAABA requires no coding expertise and has been widely used in the fly community to report complex behaviors including social interactions and various kinds of locomotion. However, only a few rodent studies have employed JAABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sangiamo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Neunuebel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Phillips et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nomoto and Lima, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van den Boom et al., 2017</xref>). One limitation is that ellipses cannot resolve the detailed spatiotemporal relationships between individual body parts that characterize many complex behaviors. Moreover, many methods that rely on background subtraction or similar approaches are not robust to environmental complexity and require behavioral assays that can be performed in an empty arena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Geuther et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Newer pose estimation algorithms that are based on machine learning can accurately track individual âkeypointsâ on an animalâs body (e.g. nose, ears, joints) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mathis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pereira et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Graving et al., 2019</xref>). Keypoint tracking is robust to environmental changes in behavioral arenas and the relationships between the locations of keypoints allow researchers to resolve temporal pose sequences with fine detail. Recently developed open-source software packages such as MARS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Segalin et al., 2021</xref>) and SimBA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nilsson et al., 2020</xref>) use supervised machine learning to classify behaviors based on the positions of keypoints on an animalâs body. These methods are excellent solutions for classifying complex behaviors that are challenging for humans to label reliably, including multi-animal social behaviors or self-grooming. However, additional rounds of machine learning are computationally-intensive and require significant amounts of human-labeled video data. This level of complexity is unnecessary to classify many widely studied behaviors and implementing these approaches may present an insurmountable challenge for labs with limited expertise in coding and machine learning.</p><p>Here we describe BehaviorDEPOT, which provides an easy way to convert keypoint tracking into meaningful behavioral data in a wide variety of experimental configurations. BehaviorDEPOT not only detects behaviors in video timeseries but can analyze the results of widely used assays such as fear conditioning, open field test, elevated plus maze, novel object exploration, and T-mazes, and can accommodate varied designs including optogenetic manipulations. In these assays, behaviors of interest are typically defined based on criteria set by individual researchers. Definitions often include both the pose of the animal and a physical location in the behavioral arena. For example, in novel object exploration, bouts of exploration are typically defined as times when the animalâs head is oriented towards the object and the animal is within 2 cm of the object. Keypoint tracking is ideally suited for these types of behaviors because it can track the spatial location of animals while also resolving fine-scale movements.</p><p>BehaviorDEPOT detects behaviors using heuristics â simple, efficient rules â that are based on human definitions. These heuristics operate by applying thresholds to metrics calculated from keypoint tracking data (e.g. velocity, angular velocity), and can also incorporate spatial and temporal cues of the experimentersâ choosing. BehaviorDEPOT heuristics have low error rates and, in contrast to classifiers built through additional rounds of machine learning, can be developed based on small numbers of manually annotated video frames and can be easily tweaked to fit out-of-sample videos. Our freezing heuristic has excellent performance even in animals wearing tethered patch cords for optogenetics or Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, thereby overcoming a major point of failure in commercially available freezing algorithms. BehaviorDEPOT organizes and saves behavioral data in structures that facilitate subsequent analyses, including alignment with neural recordings. It also helps users develop their own heuristics and incorporate them into the graphical interface. The automated, intuitive, and flexible way in which BehaviorDEPOT quantifies behavior will propel new discoveries by allowing even inexperienced coders to capitalize on the richness of their data.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>BehaviorDEPOT comprises six independent modules that form a flexible, multifunctional pipeline that can run experiments, detect behaviors in video timeseries, and analyze behavioral data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Its graphical interface accommodates users with no prior coding experience. The Analysis Module imports keypoint tracking data, calculates postural and kinematic metrics (e.g. body length, head velocity), uses these data as the basis of heuristic behavior detectors, and analyzes the results of experiments (e.g. report the effects of an optogenetic manipulation during cued fear conditioning). We provide hard-coded heuristics for detecting freezing, jumping, rearing, escape, locomotion, and novel object exploration. We also provide analysis functions for the open field test, elevated plus maze, T-maze, and three chamber assays. The Analysis Module generates rich data structures containing spatial tracking data, postural and kinematic data, behavioral timeseries, and experimental parameters. All data is stored framewise for easy alignment with neural signals. We developed the Experiment Module as a companion to our heuristic for detecting freezing. The Experiment Module can run fear conditioning experiments by using Arduinos to control shockers, arenas, and lasers for optogenetics. Finally, to maximize the utility and flexibility of BehaviorDEPOT, we created the Inter-Rater, Data Exploration, Optimization and Validation Modules to guide users through developing their own heuristics and integrating them into the Analysis Module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Here, we describe how each module works and demonstrate BehaviorDEPOTâs utility in fear conditioning, learned avoidance, open field, elevated plus maze, novel object exploration assays, and in an effort-based decision task in a T-maze.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>BehaviorDEPOT is a general-purpose behavioral analysis software comprising six modules.</title><p>The Experiment Module is a MATLAB application with a graphical interface that allows users to design and run fear conditioning experiments.

These human definitions serve as reference data for behavioral detection heuristics.

The Analysis Module imports videos and accompanying keypoint tracking data and smooths the tracking data. It can accommodate previously recorded videos since keypoint tracking models can be trained posthoc. Users can track any keypoints they choose. We used DeepLabCut (DLC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mathis et al., 2018</xref>) for keypoint tracking. DLC produces a list of comma-separated values that contains framewise estimates of the X-Y coordinates for designated body parts as well as a likelihood statistic for each estimated point. The Analysis Module applies a threshold based on DLC likelihood and performs a Hampel transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hampel, 1974</xref>) to remove outliers. Then, a local regression smoothing method (LOWESS) is applied to the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cleveland, 1981</xref>), and sub-threshold tracking values are estimated using surrounding data and spline interpolation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The module then performs a feature expansion step, calculating additional keypoint positions based on the originally tracked set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We designed a set of postural and kinematic metrics that are calculated automatically for each keypoint (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). These metrics serve as the inputs for BehaviorDEPOTâs heuristics.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The Analysis Module.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The Analysis Module workflow.

From the graphical interface of the Analysis Module, users can select a heuristic and indicate if they want to analyze behaviors during particular time windows or within regions of interest (ROI) and whether they plan to do batched analyses. The Analysis Module also includes spatial functions for analyzing the open field test, elevated plus maze, T-maze and three chamber assays. By allowing users to perform integrated spatial-temporal-behavioral analyses, BehaviorDEPOTâs utility extends beyond existing open-source behavioral classification software, which typically just report which behaviors occur in each video frame. Later in the manuscript, we describe how users can create their own heuristics and incorporate them into the graphical interface.</p><p>The Analysis Module exports all relevant data in a set of MATLAB structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) so that users can easily perform additional analyses if needs arise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). For instance, users may want to align the data to neural signals, a process we discuss in upcoming sections. A structure called âTrackingâ stores raw and smoothed keypoint tracking data. âParamsâ stores the parameters of video recordings, smoothing functions, heuristics used, and arena metrics (e.g. ROI size and location). âMetricsâ stores kinematic and postural statistics calculated from keypoint positions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). âBehaviorâ stores bout-wise and vectorized representations of identified behaviors across the entire video, or with respect to user-defined spatiotemporal filters.</p><p>The Analysis Module also generates a series of graphical data representations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). For instance, trajectory maps show when an animal was in a particular location and where behaviors occurred. Bout maps indicate when behaviors occurred and for how long. These visual representations help users understand behavioral phenotypes in great spatiotemporal detail and can inform further custom analyses using the data structures that the Analysis Module generates. In the following sections, we describe the development and validation of BehaviorDEPOTâs heuristics and demonstrate its utility in numerous behavioral assays.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Development and validation of the BehaviorDEPOT freezing detection heuristics</title><p>Freezing behavior, defined as the absence of movement except for respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grossen and Kelley, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fanselow and Bolles, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fanselow, 1984</xref>), is widely studied as a proxy for both learned and innate fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anagnostaras et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anagnostaras et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Perusini and Fanselow, 2015</xref>). In many laboratory assays, rodents freeze in response to perceived environmental threats including conditioned cues, predator odor, or looming disks that mimic a predator approaching from above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Perusini and Fanselow, 2015</xref>). Despite the heavy study of freezing behavior, most labs still score freezing manually or using expensive commercially available software programs that often fail when animals have tethered headmounts. Here, we describe the development and validation of the BehaviorDEPOT freezing detection heuristic and demonstrate its accurate performance across a range of experimental setups, including in mice wearing head-mounts for optogenetics and Miniscopes.</p><p>The BehaviorDEPOT freezing detection heuristic combines a convolution-based smoothing operation with a low-pass velocity filter and then applies a minimum duration threshold to identify periods of freezing. To develop the freezing heuristic, we began by training a deep neural network in DLC on videos recorded with a high resolution and high frame rate camera (Chameleon3 USB3, FLIR) at 50 frames per second (fps). The network tracked 8 points on the body and BehaviorDEPOT smoothed the raw tracking data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). An expert rater annotated freezing in three randomly selected videos (27,000 total frames). This served as a reference set for heuristic development. We reasoned that freezing could be reliably detected based on periods of low keypoint velocity. After exploring the predictive value of different keypoints using the Data Exploration Module (described below), we determined that thresholding the velocity of a midpoint on the back and the angular velocity of the head produced the most accurate freezing detection heuristic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We smoothed the heuristic output by applying a sliding window to produce a convolved freezing vector in which each value represented the number of freezing frames visible when the window is centered at a given frame. We then applied an adjustable count threshold to convert the convolved freezing vector into the final binary freezing vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p>To validate heuristic performance, we manually annotated a different, randomly selected set of videos that were never referenced while setting the parameters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). These videos were recorded in several different behavioral chambers under varied lighting conditions. BehaviorDEPOT freezing detection was highly consistent with human annotations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Accuracy of the freezing heuristic was estimated based on precision, recall, F1 score, and specificity. Precision and recall quantify the positive predictive value against the tendency to produce false positive or false negative errors, respectively. The F1 score, the harmonic mean of the precision and recall, is useful as a summary statistic of overall performance. Specificity quantifies the ability to accurately label true negative values and helps ensure that the heuristic is capturing data from only a single annotated behavior. Our heuristic had very low error rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p><p>We also assessed how good the DLC tracking needed to be for the freezing heuristic to work well. We trained ten different DLC networks with mean tracking errors ranging from 1 to 8 pixels. We used each network to analyze a set of six videos and then used BehaviorDEPOT to automatically detect freezing in each video. A linear regression analysis revealed that tracking error had a significant effect on precision and on the F1 score without affecting recall or specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>), with tracking errors &lt;4 pixels producing the highest F1 scores in our analysis.</p><p>To ensure that our heuristic would generalize to other camera types and DLC networks, we trained a second network based on videos recorded with a standard webcam at 30fps. On the webcam, lower sensor quality and lower frame rate produces more blur in the recorded images, so we tracked 4 body parts that are easy to see (nose, ears, tail base; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). When compared to human annotations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>), the webcam videos also scored highly for precision, recall, F1 score, and specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), indicating that our freezing heuristic can indeed generalize across camera types and DLC networks.</p><p>Since the same rules may not necessarily generalize to all settings, we developed a second freezing heuristic that uses a changepoint function to find frames at which the mean velocity changes most significantly and then separates frames into groups that minimize the sum of the residual error from the local mean. Binarized freezing vectors are then processed using a convolution algorithm and minimum duration threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This heuristic was also highly accurate, performing similarly to the velocity-based heuristic on videos recorded with a webcam (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Users can tune the heuristic by adjusting a minimum residual threshold for the changepoint function. We termed this the âjitterâ heuristic since the minimum residual threshold will be determined by the pixel error in keypoint position estimates. In other words, the threshold will be determined by how much frame-to-frame âjitterâ there is in DLCâs estimate of the keypoint location. Keypoint tracking âjitterâ may arise as a function of video resolution, framerate, and number of frames used to train a keypoint tracking model. As such, the âjitterâ heuristic may accommodate a wider range of video qualities and keypoint tracking models. Also, in videos recorded from the side, the velocity-based freezing heuristic may be slightly affected by distortions in velocity calculations caused by the angle (e.g. when the mouse is moving towards/away from the camera).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The experiment module</title><p>As a companion to the heuristic for freezing, we also developed the âExperiment Moduleâ, a MATLAB app that allows users to design and run fear conditioning experiments. This extends the utility of BehaviorDEPOT by providing a fully open-source software pipeline that takes users from data collection to data analysis. The Experiment Module controls commercially available shockers, lasers for optogenetics, and sound generators via a set of Arduinos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Users can download the âFear Conditioning Experiment Designerâ app from our Github repository and install it with a single button click. From a graphical interface, users can design experimental protocols for contextual or cued fear conditioning, with or without optogenetics. All experimental parameters (e.g. timestamps for laser, tones, shocks) are saved in MATLAB structures that can be referenced by the BehaviorDEPOT analysis pipeline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Use Case 1: Optogenetics</title><p>In commercial freezing detection software, algorithms often fail when a rodent is wearing a patch cord for routine optogenetics experiments.

We trained an optogenetics-specific DLC network that tracks 9 points on the animal, including the fiber-optic cannula (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Our rationale for creating a separate keypoint tracking network was twofold. First, while you can train one âmasterâ DLC network that can track mice in many different arenas, we find that DLC tracking errors are lowest when you have dedicated networks for particular camera heights, arenas, and types of head-mounted hardware. DLC networks are easy to train and to make it even easier for new users, we provide links to download our DLC models in our <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/DeNardoLab/BehaviorDEPOT/wiki/Pretrained-DLC-Models">GitHub repository</ext-link>. Second, this was another opportunity to test how well the BehaviorDEPOT freezing heuristic generalizes to a different DLC network with a different number of keypoints. For a randomly selected set of videos with different floors and lighting conditions, we compared heuristic performance to expert human raters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Even with the patch cord attached, the freezing heuristic had excellent scores for precision, recall, F1 and specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p>Having confirmed the accuracy of the freezing heuristic, we then used BehaviorDEPOT to quantify freezing behavior and compared the results to the annotations of an expert human rater. As expected, fear conditioned mice readily froze following shocks during CFC, while non-shocked controls did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). During retrieval sessions, silencing mPFC in previously shocked animals significantly enhanced freezing in the novel context but did not affect freezing in the fear conditioned context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>). mPFC silencing thereby produced a significant decrease in the discrimination index in fear conditioned mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), indicating that mPFC plays a key role in the specificity of recent fear memories. In all analyses, BehaviorDEPOT freezing estimates were comparable to a highly trained human rater (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3FâH</xref>). By maintaining performance levels even in videos with visual distractors like a patch cord, the BehaviorDEPOT freezing heuristic overcomes a major point of failure in commercially available freezing detection software.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Use Case 2: Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging with Miniscopes during signaled avoidance</title><p>As new open-source tools for neurophysiology become available, more labs are performing simultaneous neurophysiological and behavioral recordings.

PMA is an mPFC-dependent task in which a fear conditioned tone prompts mice to navigate to a safety platform that protects them from receiving a footshock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bravo-Rivera et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diehl et al., 2020</xref>).

The MiniCAM is an open-source behavioral imaging platform that natively integrates and synchronizes with open-source UCLA Miniscope hardware and software (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). It is composed of an M12 optical lens mount, a custom printed circuit board housing a CMOS image senor and supporting electronics, an LED illumination ring, and a 3D printed case. The MiniCAM is powered and communicates over a single coaxial cable that can be up to 15 m long. The coaxial cable connects to a Miniscope data acquisition board (DAQ) which then connects over USB3 to a host computer. A range of commercial M12 lenses can be used to select the view angle of the camera system. The image sensor used is a 5MP CMOS image sensor (MT9P031I12STM-DP, ON Semiconductor) with 2592x1944 pixel resolution and a full resolution frame rate of approximately 14FPS. For this application, the MiniCAMâs pixels were binned and cropped to achieve 1024x768 pixels at approximately 50FPS.

We identified numerous neurons that were modulated by freezing and avoidance on the safety platform. These neurons were organized in a salt and pepper manner in mPFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>). Nearly half of all neurons that exhibited task relevant behavior and were specific for either freezing or threat avoidance, or their combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>). These experiments demonstrate that the BehaviorDEPOT heuristic for detecting freezing is robust across a wide variety of experimental setups with different camera types, keypoint tracking networks, arenas and headmounts. Further, this suite of open-source hardware and software will enable a broader user base to combine Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging with high resolution behavioral analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Use Cases 3â6: open field, elevated plus maze, novel object exploration, and decision-making</title><p>BehaviorDEPOT also supports behavioral analyses beyond the realm of conditioned fear. In a number of commonly used assays, behaviors are defined based on animal location or the intersection of location and specific movements (e.g. head turns in a choice zone, described below). Such assays, including elevated plus maze (EPM), open field test (OFT), novel object exploration (NOE), object location memory, social preference/memory, decision-making assays (T-maze), and working memory assays (Y-mazes), examinenumerous cognitive and emotional processes including anxiety, memory, and decision-making and are published in tens of thousands of studies each year. To extend the utility of BehaviorDEPOT to this broad user base, the Analysis Module includes functions that quantify time spent in user defined ROIs. We demonstrate the utility of these functions in four representative assays: EPM, OFT, NOE, and a T-maze. However, the same functions could be used to analyze numerous assays including Y-mazes, real-time or conditioned place preference, as well as social preference and social memory tests.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Elevated plus maze, open field test, and novel objection exploration</title><p>EPM and OFT are used to measure anxiety-related behaviors in the laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">La-Vu et al., 2020</xref>), but these assays are often scored manually or with expensive software such as Ethovision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Noldus et al., 2001</xref>). In the EPM, rodents navigate through an elevated (~1 foot off the ground) plus-shaped maze consisting of two open arms without walls and two enclosed arms with walls. Animals that spend more time in the closed arms are interpreted to have higher anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">La-Vu et al., 2020</xref>). In the OFT, rodents are placed in an empty arena without a ceiling for 10â15 minutes. Experimenters measure the fraction of time spent in the perimeter of the box vs. the center. Increased time in the perimeter zone is interpreted as higher anxiety. OFT is also commonly used to measure locomotion in rodents. We trained a DLC network to track animals in an EPM or OFT. We used the BehaviorDEPOT functions to indicate the closed arms, open arms, and center zone for EPM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and the center zone for OFT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

Many labs study contingency-based, cost-benefit decision-making in mazes that involve choice points. For example, effort-based decision-making involves weighing whether it is worth exerting greater effort for a more valuable outcome. A common rodent assay for effort-based decision-making is the barrier T-maze task in which animals choose whether to climb over a barrier for a large reward (high effort, high value reward; HE/HVR) vs. taking an unimpeded path for a smaller reward (low effort, low value reward; LE/LVR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bailey et al., 2016</xref>). Well trained animals typically prefer HE/HVR choices, taking a direct route over the barrier with stereotyped trajectories. However, when reward or effort contingencies are adjusted, animals demonstrate vicarious trial and error (VTE), thought to be a marker of deliberative (rather than habitual) decision-making. During VTE trials, animals may pause, look back-and-forth, or reverse an initial choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Redish, 2016</xref>). Several groups have identified neural signatures of VTE in hippocampus, striatum, and prefrontal cortex suggesting that animals may be playing out potential choices (i.e. vicariously) based on an internal model of maze contingencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Redish, 2016</xref>). Simple, flexible, and automated analysis tools for detecting VTE and aligning this behavior with neural data would significantly enhance our understanding of deliberative decision-making.</p><p>We used BehaviorDEPOT to automatically detect VTE in a barrier T-maze task and to report the ultimate choice animals made during each effort-based decision-making trial. First, we trained a new DLC network to track mice as they navigated the T-maze. In one version of the task, mice decided whether to turn left to collect a small reward or to turn right and climb a wire mesh barrier for a large reward. We then changed the effort contingency by adding a second barrier to equalize effort across choices. We used the BehaviorDEPOT Analysis Module to perform automated analysis of the task. We defined 8 regions of interest (Approach, Choice, Left Effort, Left Reward, Left Food Cup, Right Effort, Right Reward, and Right Food Cup, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We then used the stored tracking data to automatically detect trials, which we defined as the first frame when the animal entered the approach zone until the first frame when the animal entered the reward zone, and to report the outcome of each trial (left choice or right choice) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6BâD</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Use Case 6: Automated analysis of an effort-based decision-making T-maze task.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Screen shots showing DLC tracking in a one-barrier (top) and two-barrier (bottom) T-maze and ROIs used for analysis in BehaviorDEPOT.

For each trial, we analyzed the head angles when the mouse was in the choice zone and used these values to determine the number of head turns per trial. Manually annotated VTE trials tended to have 1 or more head turns, while non-VTE trials tended to have 0 head turns, so we defined VTE trials as having 1 or more head turns in the choice zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). We then used our BehaviorDEPOT VTE heuristic to detect the fraction of trials with VTE in T-maze sessions with 1 vs 2 barriers, finding a significant increase in the occurrence of VTE trials when a second barrier was added.

Indeed, BehaviorDEPOT can be tailored to meet individual needs. In the following sections, we describe additional modules that help users develop custom heuristics and integrate them into the Analysis Module.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Developing and optimizing heuristics for behavior detection</title><p>To broaden the utility of BehaviorDEPOT, we created four additional modules that guide users through the process of developing their own heuristics.

This module imports multiple human annotations and users can select a reference dataset (e.g. the most highly trained expert rater, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B1 and C1</xref>). The module compares each set of annotations to the reference, scoring the annotations frame-by-frame as true positive, true negative, false positive, or false negative for each rater. These values are first used to calculate percent overlap and percent error between all raters. Precision, recall, specificity, and F1 score are calculated and reported for each rater relative to the chosen reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B2 and C2</xref>). Additionally, visualizations of frame-by-frame percent agreement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B3 and C3</xref>) and user-by-user disagreement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B4 and C4</xref>) are automatically generated to assist identifying areas of conflict between users. The automated features of the Inter-Rater Module make it fast and easy to perform iterative comparisons of manual annotations, interleaved with human updates, until a satisfactory level of agreement is achieved. The Inter-Rater Module can function as an independent unit and can thus support heuristic development with any application.</p></sec><sec id="s2-11"><title>The Data Exploration Module</title><p>For users who want to develop new heuristics, the Data Exploration Module helps to identify combinations of keypoint metrics that have high predictive value for behaviors of interest. Users can choose between two different exploration modes: broad or focused. In focused mode, researchers use their intuition about behaviors to select the metrics to examine. The user chooses two metrics at a time and the Data Exploration Module compares values between frames where behavior is present or absent and provides summary data. A generalized linear model (GLM) also estimates the likelihood that the behavior is present in a frame across a range of threshold values for the two selected metrics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), allowing users to optimize parameters in combination. Focused mode is fast and easy to use and users can iteratively test as many combinations of metrics as they like.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>The Data Exploration Module.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The Data Exploration Module takes in metrics from the Analysis Module along with reference annotations.

Poorly predictive metrics are removed from the model if their weight is sufficiently small. Users also have the option to manually remove individual metrics from the model. Once suitable metrics and thresholds have been identified using either mode, users can plug any number and combination of metrics into a heuristics template script that we provide and incorporate their new heuristics into the Analysis Module. Detailed instructions for integrating new heuristics are available in our <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/DeNardoLab/BehaviorDEPOT/wiki/Customizing-BehaviorDEPOT">GitHub repository</ext-link>.</p><p>We used focused mode to create our freezing heuristic. First, the Data Exploration Module imports the âMetricsâ and âBehaviorâ data structures we produced using the Analysis Module along with reference annotations for the same videos. We used the annotations of an expert human rater for reference. In focused mode, users iteratively select combinations of two keypoint metrics (e.g. head velocity, tail angular velocity, etc.) and a behavior label from the human annotations file (e.g. âFreezingâ). We reasoned that low velocity of certain bodyparts would correlate with freezing and thus examined the predictive value of several keypoint velocities. The module creates two data distributions: one containing video frames labeled with the chosen behavior and a second containing the remaining video frames. The larger set is randomly downsampled to ensure that each distribution contains equal numbers of frames and then a series of analyses quantify how reliably chosen metrics align with the behavior of interest. Boxplots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>) and histograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>) identify features that reliably segregate with frames containing a behavior of interest. Indeed, we discovered that the linear velocity of the back and angular velocity of the head tracked particularly well with freezing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B and C</xref>). The GLM revealed the combinations of threshold values that best predicted freezing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>).</p><p>In general, we found that metrics that are well-suited for behavior detection contrast with metrics on frames that do not contain the behavior and have a low standard deviation within the behavior set. Distributions of useful metrics also tend to differ substantially from the total set of frames, especially when compared to frames that do not contain the behavior. The GLM predictions are useful for determining which of the selected metrics best predict the behavior and whether they enhance the predictive value when combined. This module will broaden the utility of BehaviorDEPOT, allowing researchers to tailor its automated functions to fit their needs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-12"><title>The Optimization Module</title><p>A major advantage of using heuristics to detect behaviors is that parameters can be quickly and easily tuned to optimize behavioral detection in out-of-sample data. Some users of the Optimization Module may have just developed a new heuristic in the Data Exploration Module. Others may want to optimize an existing heuristic for their experimental setup since camera position, framerate and resolution and lighting conditions may influence behavior detection thresholds. To use the module, researchers provide reference annotations and the outputs from the Analysis Module (âParamsâ, âBehaviorâ, and âMetricsâ). By sweeping through the parameter space for chosen metrics, the Optimization Module identifies the set of thresholds that maximize detection accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Through the graphical interface, users can then update the heuristic threshold values and save the settings for future use. Commercially available freezing classifiers also allow users to adjust the thresholds for freezing detection to ensure that accurate classification can be achieved in a variety of experimental conditions. However, their algorithms are hidden and there is no way to precisely measure error rates. Our Optimization Module adds a level of rigor to the optimization step by reporting heuristic performance as F1 score, precision, recall, and specificity values.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Analysis of External Data using Optimization and Validation Modules.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Optimization Module workflow.

Like BehaviorDEPOT, JAABA is geared toward a non-coding audience and its classifiers are based on an intuitive understanding of what defines behaviors. JAABA uses supervised machine learning to detect behaviors and has been widely adopted by the <italic>Drosophila</italic> community with great success. However, fewer studies have used JAABA to study rodents, suggesting there may be some challenges associated with using JAABA for rodent behavioral assays. The rodent studies that used JAABA typically examined social behaviors or gross locomotion, usually in an open field or homecage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sangiamo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Neunuebel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Phillips et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nomoto and Lima, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van den Boom et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>As the basis for its classifiers, JAABA uses a large feature set that it calculates based on animal poses.

We used MoTr and Ctrax to track animals in fear conditioning videos we had recorded previously.

Briefly, we used the nose-to-tail distance to calculate the long axis and the hip-to-hip distance to calculate the short axis and used a MATLAB function to generate well-fit ellipses for each video frame. We then imported the ellipse features (animal position (centroid), semi-axis lengths, and orientation) into JAABA. We first trained a freezing classifier using JAABA. Even when we gave JAABA more training data than we used to develop BehaviorDEPOT heuristics (6 videos vs. 3 videos), the BehaviorDEPOT heuristic for freezing had significantly higher recall and F1 scores when tested on a separate set of videos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>). We also trained a VTE classifier with JAABA. When we tested its performance on a separate set of videos, JAABA could not distinguish VTE vs. non-VTE trials. It labeled every trial as containing VTE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref>), suggesting a well-fit ellipse is not sufficient to detect these fine angular head movements.</p><p>Another strength of BehaviorDEPOT relative to JAABA is that BehaviorDEPOT can quantify behaviors with reference to spatial or temporal cues of interest. JAABA does allow users to draw spatial ROIs but uses this information as the basis of behavioral classification in ways that cannot be detected or controlled by the user. These direct comparisons highlight the need for new behavioral analysis software targeted towards a noncoding audience, particularly in the rodent domain. BehaviorDEPOT can now fill this role.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Keypoint tracking algorithms and in vivo methods including optogenetics, fiber photometry, and miniscope recordings have become increasingly accessible and widely adopted. Because many labs with limited programming expertise want to employ these methods, we need user-friendly software programs that can automate analysis of naturalistic behaviors and facilitate precise alignment of neural and behavioral data.</p><p>BehaviorDEPOT is a general utility behavioral analysis software package based on keypoint tracking. Its graphical interface allows even inexperienced coders to run experiments, automatically detect behaviors, and analyze the results of popular assays including those run in operant chambers (e.g. fear conditioning) or spatial mazes (e.g. T-mazes or elevated plus mazes). Our built-in heuristic freezing detector has low error rates across a range of video recording setups, including videos of both mice and rats wearing tethered headmounts. BehaviorDEPOTâs flexible interface accommodates varied experimental designs including conditioned tones, optogenetics, and spatial ROIs. It also builds rich data structures that facilitate alignment of neural and behavioral data, and we provide additional code in our GitHub repository for this purpose. The experiment module and the UCLA MiniCAM extend the utility of BehaviorDEPOT, together forming a fully open-source pipeline from data collection to analysis. While the Analysis Module supports many behavioral analyses âout of the boxâ, we created four independent modules so that researchers can create, test, and optimize new behavioral detection heuristics and then integrate them into the Analysis Module.</p><p>BehaviorDEPOT employs heuristics to measure human-defined behaviors based on keypoint tracking data. Keypoints can be used to simultaneously track location and classify fine-scale behaviors. As such, keypoint tracking is well suited for analysis of widely-used assays in which researchers have carefully defined behaviors based on the pose of the animal and its location in an arena. Assays including fear conditioning, avoidance, T-mazes, and elevated plus mazes are published in tens of thousands of studies each year. Yet most still rely on laborious manual annotation, expensive commercial software packages, or open-source software packages that can fail to detect fine movements and are error prone, especially in visually complex arenas. With BehaviorDEPOT, we were able to quickly and intuitively design heuristics that combine spatial tracking with detection of fine movements.</p><p>In contrast to methods that use supervised machine learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nilsson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Segalin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bohnslav et al., 2021</xref>), BehaviorDEPOTâs heuristics are easier to interpret and can be easily tweaked to fit out-of-sample videos. Like any supervised method, BehaviorDEPOT heuristics are based on human definitions, so human bias is not completely absent from the analyses. However, the automation serves to standardize human-expert definitions and can enhance rigor and reproducibility. Moreover, when behaviors are clearly defined, developing reliable BehaviorDEPOT heuristics may require less human-labeled data compared to a supervised machine learning approach. Other methods use unsupervised approaches to classify behavior based on keypoint tracking. While relatively free of human biases, programs like B-SOiD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hsu and Yttri, 2021</xref>) and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DLCutils/tree/master/DLC_2_MotionMapper">MotionMapper</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mathis, 2022</xref>) are geared toward analysis of even more subtle behaviors that are more challenging for humans to reliably label and may be out of reach technically for researchers that lack computational expertise. The graphical interface and intuitive design of BehaviorDEPOT heuristics ensure it will serve a broad audience.</p><p>BehaviorDEPOT does require users to first train keypoint tracking models. However, the accuracy, precision, and flexibility achieved by these methods will make BehaviorDEPOT more broadly useful than classifiers based on more coarse detection methods (e.g. background subtraction) that are not robust to environmental complexity or subject appearance. Some freezing detectors use pixel change functions to detect periods of no movement and can operate in complex arenas like fear conditioning chambers. However, they often fail to detect freezing when animals are wearing head-mounts for optogenetics or neural recordings because tethered patch cords can move even when the animal is immobile. To circumvent this problem, ezTrack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pennington et al., 2019</xref>), VideoFreeze (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anagnostaras et al., 2010</xref>), and ANYmaze allow researchers to crop the tether out of the video, but this requires side-view videos and thereby constrains concurrent spatial analyses. In contrast, keypoint tracking algorithms can be trained to detect animals in any experimental condition, so users can analyze videos they have already recorded. With keypoint tracking, researchers can track body parts that best fit their experimental design and can detect fine movements of individual body parts, allowing researchers to detect a wider array of behaviors and discover subtle phenotypes arising from manipulations.</p><p>To enhance the utility of BehaviorDEPOT, the Inter-Rater, Data Exploration, Optimization, and Validation Modules help users develop new heuristics or optimize existing ones for their experimental setups. An important step in supervised behavior classification is establishing a ground truth definition of behavior. This is typically achieved by training multiple human raters and through discussion, refining their annotations until they converge maximally. These reference annotations are then used to create classifiers. MARS includes a large dataset of human annotations for social behaviors and provides detailed quantitative descriptions of similarity and divergence between human raters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Segalin et al., 2021</xref>). While the MARS BENTO feature can import human annotations for visualization alongside behavior videos or automated annotations, our Inter-Rater Module has added functions to automatically calculate performance statistics with the click of a button. This makes it fast and easy to train novice manual raters or establish new ground truth definitions. Human annotations or ratings from another classifier program can be imported into the Data Exploration, Optimization, and Validation Modules and are compared to BehaviorDEPOT metrics or heuristic outputs for development and evaluation of heuristic performance.</p><p>Our heuristic for freezing detection operates on similar principles to commercial software that apply a motion threshold and a minimum duration threshold to detect bouts of freezing. However, BehaviorDEPOT has added functionality in that freezing detection can be integrated with spatial analyses so researchers can determine not only when an animal is freezing, but also where it is freezing. Another major limitation of commercial algorithms is that they are not well validated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anagnostaras et al., 2000</xref>). Researchers typically use their intuition to set thresholds for freezing. BehaviorDEPOTâs Optimization Module allows users to adjust parameters and determine the combination of thresholds that produce the lowest error rates. We envision that new users will manually annotate a set of videos from their lab, analyze them with BehaviorDEPOT using the default heuristic settings, and then test the error rates using the Validation Module. If error rates are high, they can adjust threshold values with the Optimization Module. This process can be done for any behavior of interest. By making the optimization and validation process easy â it can be done with a few button clicks in the graphical interface â BehaviorDEPOT will enhance the rigor of behavior classification and increase reproducibility across labs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Female and male C57B1/6 J mice (JAX Stock No. 000664) aged 10â16 weeks were group housed (2â5 per cage) and kept on a 12 hr light cycle.

First, adult WT mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and secured to a stereotaxic frame (Kopf, 963). Mice were placed on a heating blanket and artificial tears kept their eyes moist throughout the surgery. After exposing the skull, a burr hole was drilled above PL in the left hemisphere (+1.85, â0.4, â2.3 mm from bregma). A Hamilton syringe containing AAV1-Syn-jGCaMP7f-WPRE was lowered into the burr hole and 400 nL of AAV was pressure injected using a microinjector (WPI, UMP3T-1). The syringe was left in place for 10 min to ensure the AAV did not spill out of the target region and then the skin was sutured. After recovery, animals were housed in a regular 12 hr light/dark cycle with food and water ad libitum. Carprofen (5 mg/kg) was administered both during surgery and for 2 days after surgery together with amoxicillin (0.25 mg/mL) for 7 days after surgery. Two weeks later, mice underwent a GRIN lens implantation surgery. After anesthetizing the animals with isoflurane (1â3%) and securing them to the stereotaxic frame, the cortical tissue above the targeted implant site was carefully aspirated using 27-gauge and 30-gauge blunt needles. Buffered ACSF was constantly applied throughout the aspiration to prevent tissue desiccation. The aspiration ceased after full termination of bleeding, at which point a GRIN lens (1 mm diameter, 4 mm length, Inscopix 1050â002176) was stereotaxically lowered to the targeted implant site (â2.0 mm dorsoventral from skull surface relative to bregma). Cyanoacrylate glue was used to affix the lens to the skull. Then, dental cement sealed and covered the exposed skull, and Kwik-Sil covered the exposed GRIN lens. Carprofen (5 mg/kg) and dexamethasone (0.2 mg/kg) were administered during surgery and for 7 days after surgery together with amoxicillin (0.25 mg/mL) in the drinking water. Two weeks after implantation, animals were anesthetized again with isoflurane (1â3%) and a Miniscope attached to an aluminum baseplate was placed on top of the GRIN lens. After searching the field of view for in-focus cells, the baseplate was cemented into place, and the Miniscope was detached from the baseplate. A plastic cap was locked into the baseplate to protect the implant from debris.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Miniscope recordings</title><p>Mice were handled and habituated to the weight of the microscope for 4 days before behavioral acquisition. On the recording day, a V4 Miniscope was secured to the baseplate with a set screw and the mice were allowed to acclimate in their home cage for 5 min.

Behavior was simultaneously recorded with a UCLA MiniCAM.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Miniscope data processing and analysis</title><p>Frames in which animals were freezing and/or on the safety platform were determined using BehaviorDEPOT. Cell footprints and Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluorescence timeseries were extracted from Miniscope recordings using MIN1PIPE. We identified 513 neurons across three mice. Custom MATLAB software was used to align data from the behavior camera and the Miniscope camera. To identify neurons that were active during freezing or when the animal was on the safety platform, we plotted receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) for individual neurons and measured the area under the curve (AUC). ROCs plot the true positive rate (true positive/(true positive +false negative)) against the false positive rate (false positive/(false positive +true negative)) over a range of probability thresholds. Neurons with high AUC values therefore predict the behavioral variable of interest with a high true positive rate and low false positive rates over a large range of thresholds. To determine if a neuron significantly encoded a particular behavioral event, we generated a null distribution of AUCs by circularly shuffling event timing and recalculating the AUC over 1000 permutations. Neurons were considered significantly activated during a behavior if their AUC was greater than 97.5% of AUCs in the null distributions and significantly suppressed if their AUC value was in the lowest 2.5% of all AUCs in the null distribution.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Histology</title><p>Mice were transcardially perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS.

Dividing up the dataset by video rather than by frame ensures that highly correlated temporally adjacent frames are not sorted into training and test sets, which can cause overestimation of accuracy. Since the videos in the test set were separate from those used to develop the heuristics, our validation data reflects the accuracy levels users can expect from BehaviorDEPOT. Heuristic performance was assessed using precision (true positive frames / true positive frames + false positive frames), recall (true positive frames / true positive frames + false negative frames), F1 score (2*(precision*recall / precision + recall)) and specificity (true negative frames / true negative frames + false positive frames).</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Heuristic development</title><p>Heuristic parameters for freezing, NOE, and VTE were chosen based on human definitions of these behaviors and examined in a test dataset of videos. For freezing, we explored linear and angular velocity metrics for various keypoints, finding that angular velocity of the head and linear velocity of a back point tracked best with freezing. Common errors in our heuristics were identified as short sequences of frames at the beginning or end of a behavior bout. This may reflect failures in human detection. Other common errors were sequences of false positive or false negative frames that were shorter than a typical behavior bout. We included the convolution algorithm to correct these short error sequences, finding empirically that window widths that are the length of the smallest bout of ârealâ behavior and count thresholds approximately one third of the window width yielded the best results.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed in MATLAB or GraphPad Prism.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>The BehaviorDEPOT Pipeline</title><sec id="s4-20-1"><title>Overview of functions</title><p>The Analysis Module imports video recordings of behavior and accompanying DLC keypoint tracking data and exports four data structures (Tracking, Params, Metrics, Behavior) as well as trajectory maps.

It is easy to train keypoint tracking models and worth the initial time investment. To expedite this process for others, our models are available for download from GitHub via a link embedded in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/DeNardoLab/BehaviorDEPOT/wiki/Pretrained-DLC-Models">BehaviorDEPOT Wiki</ext-link> page. Depending on the userâs setup, our models may be used âout of the boxâ or may require some additional training. For high resolution, high framerate cameras (Chameleon-3 camera or MiniCAM), we trained models to track 8 or 9 keypoints (nose, ears, hips, midback, tailbase, mid-tail, and head implant when present). Our webcam videos and the videos we acquired from outside labs had lower resolution and lower framerates, so we trained models to detect 4 or 5 keypoints that were easiest to detect by eye (nose, ears, tailbase, and head implant when present). We trained models in DeepLabCut for 1â1.65 million iterations on sets of ~400 video frames. In our DLC training sets, frame rates ranged from 30â75fps and resolution ranged from 7-32pixels/cm. DLC training errors ranged from 0.74 to 2.76 pixels and DLC test error rates ranged from 1.44 to 5.93 pixels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>).

If it meets these requirements, a frame will be labeled as âfreezingâ. To smooth over falsely non-contiguous freezing bouts, a sliding window of a specified width produces a convolved freezing vector in which each value represents the number of freezing frames visible in the window at a given frame. An adjustable count threshold then converts the convolved freezing vector into the final binary freezing vector. Finally, the heuristic rejects freezing bouts that are shorter than a user-defined minimum duration. The default value is 0.9 s, a definition that draws on published literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anagnostaras et al., 2000</xref>) and was tested empirically to give the most cohesiveness with human raters. Freezing data is saved framewise as a binarized vector that is the length of the video (Behavior.Freezing.Vector) and boutwise, indicating the start and stop frames of each freezing bout (Behavior.Freezing.Bouts), the length of each bout (Behavior.Freezing.Length), and the total number of bouts (Behavior.Freezing.Count).</p></sec><sec id="s4-21-2"><title>Jitter-based freezing detection Heuristic</title><p>To ensure that BehaviorDEPOT will be able to detect freezing for a wide variety of videos and DLC networks, we generated a second freezing heuristic with a different design. As an alternative to the heuristic based on velocity thresholds, we generated a second freezing heuristic that uses a MATLAB changepoint function to find frames at which the mean of the data changes most significantly and then separates frames into groups that minimize the sum of the residual (squared) error from the local mean. The heuristic imports the velocities of the head, nose, and tail from the Metrics structure. Users set the error term, which is calculated based on the estimated max linear velocity for freezing. This minimum residual threshold is ultimately determined by the DLC tracking error, or the âjitterâ of keypoint estimates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21-3"><title>Novel object exploration heuristic</title><p>The object exploration heuristic was developed to automate quantification of object investigation. Animal pose and behavior criteria corresponding to object investigation were developed from multiple sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ennaceur and Delacour, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vogel-Ciernia and Wood, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zeidler et al., 2020</xref>). Key features of behavioral criteria were replicated in the heuristic: (A) nose within an extended boundary from the object (customizable but tested here with 2 cm radius), (B) head oriented directly toward the object (as determined by a line from between the ears extending out past the nose), (C) an exclusionary criteria for climbing on or over the object, created by establishing a smaller boundary within the original object perimeter (customizable but tested at 2 cm from object edge) that rejects any instance in which the nose, ears, or tailbase is within the boundary. To achieve these features, tracking of the ears, nose, and tailbase is required. The object exploration heuristic was manually fit to two different exploration sessions using two different objects: a rectangular, blue plastic object with a flat top that encouraged climbing (6.5x5.5 x 8.5 cm); and a round, dark, glass bottle with a curved top that discouraged climbing (5.5 cm diameter, 13 cm height). The heuristic was validated using BehaviorDEPOT Inter-Rater and Validation modules, comparing the precision, recall, specificity, and F1 scores between heuristic output to an expert human rater across four new videos that were not used to develop the heuristic.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21-4"><title>EPM analysis function</title><p>The Elevated Plus Maze analysis function prompts users to define task-relevant ROIs (open arms, closed arms, and center), then calculates the number of entries, total time spent, and percentage time spent in each ROI. The heuristic outputs boutwise and framewise information about when the subject was in each ROI, as well as a report summarizing the results of the session.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21-5"><title>Open field test analysis function</title><p>This function prompts the user to define the arena perimeter and the center region. It then calculates the number of entries, total time spent, and percentage time spent in each ROI along with a summary report.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21-6"><title>T-maze analysis function</title><p>To analyze T-maze data, we first analyzed the behavior videos using the Analysis Module, drawing 8 ROIs (approach, choice, effortR, effortL, rewardR, rewardL, foodCupL and foodCupR). The VTE heuristic imports data structures produced by the Analysis Module (Params, Metrics, Behavior) and extracts trials. Trial start is defined as when the midback point enters the approach zone, and trial end is defined as when the midback point enters the reward zone. For each trial, the heuristic determines the choice the animal made based on whether it entered the left reward or the right reward zone.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21-7"><title>VTE heuristic</title><p>Instances of vicarious trial and error are characterized by sweeps of the head and longer times in the choice zone. The VTE heuristic identifies sequences of frames in the choice zone when the head angles span 180 degrees. It imports outputs from the Analysis Module (Metrics, Params, and Behavior) and uses the intersection of Metrics.degHeadAngle and the choice zone ROI to detect ranges of head angles when the animal was in the choice zone. If the opposing head angles are detected within the choice zone in a single trial, this is counted as a head turn. Trials in which the animal spends at least 0.6 s in the choice zone and has at least 1 head turn aligned best with human annotations of VTE, so the heuristic uses those values and the minimum criterion for VTE detection. This code is available for download from our GitHub repository.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>Heuristic development modules</title><sec id="s4-22-1"><title>The Inter-Rater Module</title><p>This module compares annotations from any number of raters. Human annotations can be generated using any software of the experimenters choosing and organized in a three-column csv file (column 1: bout start, column 2: bout stop, column 3: behavior label). The csv file can be converted to a BehaviorDEPOT-friendly MATLAB table using the helper function âConvert Human Annotationsâ which is accessible via BehaviorDEPOTâs graphical interface. The Inter-Rater Module imports the resulting âhBehavior.matâ files and provides visual summaries of rater agreement and disagreement, and reports precision, recall, F1 score, and specificity in both heatmap and tabular (IR_Results.mat) formats.</p></sec><sec id="s4-22-2"><title>The Data Exploration Module</title><p>The Data Exploration Module imports the data structures produced by the Analysis Module (Tracking, Params, Metrics, Behavior) and accompanying references annotations as a âhBehavior.matâ table, which can be generated using the helper function from the graphical interface. Although this function is called âconvertHumanAnnotationsâ, it can be used to convert boutwise annotations from any source into a MATLAB table that can be imported by BehaviorDEPOT. In focused mode, researchers can use their intuition or established definitions of behavior to select pairs of metrics to explore. The module reports metric values in behavior containing and behavior-lacking frames in the form of histograms and box plots and a text file (Results.txt) containing descriptive statistics for the plots. A GLM model is also produced which reports the predictive value of combinations of threshold levels for the two metrics. Users can iteratively examine as many metrics as they please. Once they have settled on features and threshold values, users can use our template script to incorporate the new heuristic into the analysis module.</p><p>The broad exploration mode allows researchers to explore the predictive quality of different metrics in an unbiased way. It incorporates all metrics into a GLM and then rejects those with very low predictive value. The resulting refined GLM can be incorporated into the Analysis Module using our heuristic template file.</p></sec><sec id="s4-22-3"><title>Optimization and validation modules</title><p>The optimization and validation modules import the data structures produced by the Analysis Module and reference annotations in âhBehavior.matâ format. They output heatmaps and results tables reporting precision, recall, F1 score, and specificity values.</p></sec><sec id="s4-22-4"><title>The experiment module</title><p>The Fear Conditioning Experiment Designer is a MATLAB-based GUI to design and execute cued fear conditioning experiments. It uses an Arduino interface to control commercially available, transistor-transistor logic (TTL)-based equipment. Stimuli are designed to be either auditory or visual. Auditory stimuli can be pure tones or frequency modulated (FM) sweeps. The FM sweeps can be customized for start frequency, end frequency, and sweep duration. Both pure tones and FM sweeps are generated via sine waves in MATLAB, then played through the computer or attached speaker using the sound function. Visual stimuli are generated by sending a timed TTL pulse corresponding to the light pattern. Pure light turns on the TTL for length of the stimulus; pulsed light turns on and off the TTL at a user specific frequency with a user specified duty cycle.</p><p>The user builds an experiment in event blocks. Each event can include any permutation of the conditioned stimuli (CS+ or CS-), the shock, and the laser. If a shock is triggered, it is designed to co-terminate with the conditioned stimulus (CS). If a laser is triggered, it occurs for the duration of the CS. Inter-block intervals are randomly chosen between the minimum and maximum values input by the user.</p><p>Once the user sets up the event blocks and launches the experiment, a baseline period prior to starting the events begins (if instructed). Afterward, the first event is implemented. This is handled by cycling through a matrix of the events. Each event combination is given a unique identifier, and each identifier has its own implementation function. Within each function, the event is triggered (sound generation or TTL-adjusting), and the timestamp is logged. Timestamps record the system block to the millisecond. For blocks with multiple events (e.g. laser-TTL plus tone plus shock), these are handled sequentially. The pause function is used to time the period between event-on and event-off times.</p><p>A countdown of events is shown on screen as each event is being done and completed. Once all events have completed, a file is saved (as âNAME_YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SSâ) containing the complete set of experimental information, including identities and parameters of the stimuli, the events and their associated timestamps, and a log of the events delivered in that session.</p></sec><sec id="s4-22-5"><title>MiniCAM instructions and Installation</title><p>Descriptions of fabrication and use of MinCAMs can be found on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Aharoni-Lab/MiniCAM">GitHub</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aharoni, 2022</xref>.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing â original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Software, Validation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing â original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Writing â original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Supervision, Investigation, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Software, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All of the animals were handed according to the approved institutional animal care and use committee protocols of the University of California, Los Angeles.

as an open-source classifier in service of standard lab-based behavioral assays. The key arguments the authors make are that (1) the open-source code allows for freely available access, (2) the code doesn't require any coding knowledge to build new classifiers, (3) it is generalizable to other behaviors than freezing and other species (although this latter point is not shown), (4) that it uses posture-based tracking that allows for higher resolution than centroid-based methods, and (5) that it is possible to isolate features used in the classifiers. These aims are laudable, the software is indeed relatively easy to use, and it will likely be used widely in the community.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74314.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Berman</surname><given-names>Gordon J</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03czfpz43</institution-id><institution>Emory University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.06.20.449150">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.20.449150v2">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

The authors claim that part of the goal is to remove &quot;human biases&quot; using automated detection. I would push back on this a little. At the end of the day, humans are still choosing which behaviors to classify â there is no representation learning or other similar feature described here. Thus, the aim isn't to eliminate biases, it's really to make those biases more consistent (precision vs. accuracy).</p><p>2) Line 108. I'm not entirely sure what a &quot;machine-learning quality camera&quot; is. I would just call it a higher resolution and frame-rate camera.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I had the following notes about the paper:</p><p>No machine learning model is going to generalize well across all possible settings, and it is important for this paper to make clear from the onset what is required for the system to work. Two example points that come to mind are framerate and camera angle. Freezing is described as being detected across frames, which seems like it would be sensitive to changes in video framerate. Does the classifier need to be manually re-adjusted if a different video framerate is used? Also, are there lower bounds on the framerate or resolution of input videos that can be used? Regarding camera angle, all of the example videos shown in this paper are using a camera positioned directly above the animal. Will BehaviorDEPOT work if the mouse is filmed from the side, from below, or from an angle? While it's fine if a given classifier doesn't work in every condition, I do think the authors need to be more explicit in stating the scope of their system.</p><p>I like the idea behind the Data Exploration Module, however I was unsure where the explored metrics were coming from. Are these fully hard-coded, or can the user define their own metrics to look at? If metrics are hard-coded, it would be helpful for the authors to provide a complete list of metrics and their definitions within the manuscript (a few lists of example metrics are given, eg lines 84, 121, 146, and 155, but I don't know if these lists are complete.)</p><p>Different labs use different software for manual annotation. What annotation file formats are supported by BehaviorDEPOT's Inter-Rater Module? Can it be run on output of commonly used annotation software, like Noldus Observer?</p><p>The Methods section is nicely detailed with respect to experimental information, but it needs more information about the data analyses performed. Some examples:</p><p>â The &quot;DeepLabCut Training and Model Availability&quot; section of the Methods could use more detail, such as how many frames were trained for each camera, and precise error rates per body part for each video format used. Also despite the heading, there is no information about model availability in this section.</p><p>â What software was used for manual annotation of behavior?</p><p>â In Use Case 2 (Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging), were the computed ROC curves for imaged neurons generated using BehaviorDEPOT, or was this done post-hoc?</p><p>The claim that BehaviorDEPOT is &quot;indistinguishable from a highly trained human&quot; is made in reference to an ANOVA comparison of fraction time freezing according to BehaviorDEPOT vs manual annotations. While the authors can use this analysis to claim that BehaviorDEPOT is consistent with human annotations at the level of the entire trial, calling BehaviorDEPOT &quot;indistinguishable from a human&quot; is a much stronger claim, and needs to either be toned down or backed up by additional comparisons. For example, the authors would have to also address BehaviorDEPOT's frame-wise annotations, eg by showing that BehaviorDEPOT's precision, recall, F1 score, and specificity with respect to manual labels are comparable to that of another human.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>There are several competing themes in this manuscript: is it meant to be an easy-to-use detector for simple behaviors once one has DLC data in hand? Or a simplified way to run a few types of popular behavioral experiments? Or a tool for exploring behavior data and performing statistical analyses? Overall a better demarcation of what the software does and doesn't do would be useful.</p><p>64: 'The Analysis Module processes pose tracking data from DLC or similar'.. does this mean the specific format, or that any keypoint data can be used? Would this easily generalize to 3D keypoint data or some other type of feature vector to be classified? The ability to take in different data types would add functionality and encourage users.</p><p>Different use cases are explored but they each appear to have different types of outputs and I could not find them in the GitHub. Code installation is easy but the guide could use a simpler demo.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;BehaviorDEPOT is a simple, flexible tool for automated behavioral classification based on markerless pose tracking&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Laura Colgin (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved, but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed. We ask you to respond to each of the comments below from the reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>I thank the authors for their effort in revising this manuscript- the additional detail makes the approach much easier to follow.</p><p>Thinking about the project as a whole, I think the authors' description of their freezing/VTE/etc detectors as &quot;classifiers&quot; is setting up false expectations in the reader, as evidenced by all the reviewers asking questions about the choice of algorithm and comparison to tools like SimBA, JAABA, MARS, B-SOiD, etc. The revised text is much clearer about how these detectors are created, and given this description, I think it may make more sense to refer to them as &quot;heuristics&quot;, and not as &quot;classifiers&quot; or &quot;algorithmic classifiers&quot;: BehaviorDEPOT is for creating human-crafted functions, whereas &quot;algorithmic&quot; and &quot;classifiers&quot; are terms used exclusively to refer to machine learning models that are fit to training data via optimization methods.</p><p>Overall, I think BehaviorDEPOT could be a useful tool. The &quot;no coding experience required&quot; claim is somewhat weakened by the fact that it requires users to first train a DeepLabCut model- this is definitely a task that requires a fair amount of coding experience. One could argue that once the pose model is trained, BehaviorDEPOT can be used by a non-coding user to create any number of behavior classifiers; the only shortcoming I see to that argument is that changes to the experimental setup that degrade pose estimator performance (lighting, frame rate, camera type, camera position, objects in the environment) may require periodic pose model retraining even after the initial setup process.</p><p>Other aspects of the authors' response to the review were more troubling, and would still need to be addressed. I outline these below.</p><p>1) I appreciate the authors' effort in comparing BehaviorDEPOT to JAABA, including processing all of their data with MoTr and Ctrax. I agree that providing more software tools to the rodent community is a respectable aim, and the authors are correct in noting that the additional data post-processing features of BehaviorDEPOT are not provided by JAABA. The authors' analysis satisfactorily addresses Reviewer 1's question about VTE detection.</p><p>However, I feel that the performance comparison between BehaviorDEPOT and JAABA in the text and in Figure 10 is inappropriate and misleading. The authors state that they were only able to train JAABA using either (a) the location of the animal's centroid or (b) fit ellipses produced by MoTr and Ctrax, which were of poor quality (as stated by the authors.) It is obvious that a classifier (JAABA) given just the (x,y) coordinate of a mouse's centroid or a poorly fit ellipse is going to be worse for freezing and VTE detection than a classifier (BehaviorDEPOT) given the full pose of the animal-but this undoubtedly because of the quality of the pose representation (MoTr or Ctrax vs DLC), not the quality of the classifier. Unless you can evaluate the two systems on equal footing, i.e. using the same pose representation, you should not present this comparison.</p><p>2) Similarly, the authors' response to Reviewer 1's question 3 is focused on the contrast between keypoint-based tracking to earlier classical computer vision methods, which is not what was asked (and is not relevant here, as neither BehaviorDEPOT nor JAABA is a pose estimation tool.) Rather, the key aspect of JAABA's success, as indicated by Reviewer 1, is its use of an optimized version of the GentleBoost algorithm, which takes in a large set of features and selects the small subset that is best suited to classification. I agree with Reviewer 1 that allowing a classifier to select the most informative features is a strong approach that is tough to beat. The authors do make the potentially valid point that classifiers using small sets of hand-crafted features may require less training data, although I don't think enough is shown for them to concretely state that BehaviorDEPOT is more efficient to set up than an appropriately regularized supervised classifier. (For example, how long does it take to annotate training data for a supervised classifier, vs how long did it take to create the new object-investigation detector from scratch?)</p><p>3) One last minor point on the subject of classifiers, I'd like to push back on the author's claim that supervised classification tools like SimBA and MARS are for detecting behaviors that are &quot;difficult to see by eye&quot;-this claim doesn't make any sense given that these tools require human annotations to train in the first place.</p><p>4) While supplementary Table 4 is helpful, it doesn't answer the question asked, which is &quot;how good does my pose estimation need to be for the classifier to work well&quot;- to do so, you would need to train pose models with different amounts of training data, to see how classifier performance depends on either training set size or mean DLC error, within a given dataset. This would help users figure out whether adding more DLC training data can be expected to improve the performance of the classifier.</p><p>5) In response to Reviewer 2's question about camera position, the authors present a new &quot;jitter&quot;-based freezing classifier. They write in the text &quot;in videos recorded from the side, the velocity-based freezing classifier may be slightly affected by distortions in velocity calculations caused by the angle (e.g. when the mouse is moving towards/away from the camera). On the other hand, the 'jitter classifier' should work equally well with any viewing angle as long as tracked points remain generally unobscured.&quot; However, in the response to the reviewer, they write &quot;We did not explicitly test our freezing classifier in videos recorded from the side or other angles, but there is no reason to think it wouldn't work since keypoints can be tracked from any angle.&quot; It is simply not reasonable to assume a method designed exclusively in one condition will work in another very different condition, let alone work &quot;equally well.&quot; This claim is purely speculative and should be removed.</p><p>6) The authors also seem to misinterpret Reviewers 2 and 3 questions about annotation and pose data formats. For example, the authors write &quot;BehaviorDEPOT can process pose tracking data in CSV and H5 file formats. Keypoint data collected by any software is fundamentally compatible with BehDEPOT&quot;. DeepLabCut data is saved in CSV or H5 formats, but there is additional file structure that must be known to be able to parse those files to extract the data (eg which variables to read, which columns are x vs y coordinates). A different pose estimation tool like SLEAP might still save pose data in an H5 format, but because it uses different file structure conventions, code written to unpack DLC pose data would return an error when run on SLEAP data. While any software is &quot;fundamentally compatible&quot; with BehaviorDEPOT, software other than DLC would require the creation of a conversion script to make sure keypoint data is in the expected format. (As the authors experienced with APT, this is easier said than done, as keypoint storage formats can change with the software version.) The authors should instead perhaps state whether they commit to providing support for new pose formats when requested by users.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors have responded to the points from the initial review, including added descriptions of how the classifier works as well as a comparison to JAABA.</p><p>While testing the demo for ease of use, I found that it does not simply run as downloaded.

The authors claim that part of the goal is to remove &quot;human biases&quot; using automated detection. I would push back on this a little. At the end of the day, humans are still choosing which behaviors to classify â there is no representation learning or other similar feature described here. Thus, the aim isn't to eliminate biases, it's really to make those biases more consistent (precision vs. accuracy).</p></disp-quote><p>Good point. We edited this paragraph accordingly (now lines 558â560).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I had the following notes about the paper:</p><p>No machine learning model is going to generalize well across all possible settings, and it is important for this paper to make clear from the onset what is required for the system to work. Two example points that come to mind are framerate and camera angle. Freezing is described as being detected across frames, which seems like it would be sensitive to changes in video framerate. Does the classifier need to be manually re-adjusted if a different video framerate is used? Also, are there lower bounds on the framerate or resolution of input videos that can be used? Regarding camera angle, all of the example videos shown in this paper are using a camera positioned directly above the animal. Will BehaviorDEPOT work if the mouse is filmed from the side, from below, or from an angle? While it's fine if a given classifier doesn't work in every condition, I do think the authors need to be more explicit in stating the scope of their system.</p></disp-quote><p>Like many currently available freezing classifiers (VideoFreeze, ezTrack, FreezeFrame), BehaviorDEPOT allows users to tweak threshold values to best suit their experimental setup. This ensures the classifier will be widely useful. We show that our freezing classifier works across videos that ranged from 7â32 pixels/cm, 30â75fps, mice and rats wearing different tethered headmounts, and videos recorded using 5 different cameras across 3 labs. We included more detailed information in the main text (e.g. line 232â244) and discussion (lines 574â582) along with a table containing all the video recording parameters used for easy reference (Table 4).</p><p>We focused on videos filmed from above because we envision that many BehaviorDEPOT users will be interested in integrating spatial tracking with behavioral classification. In videos recorded from the side, much of the spatial information can be lost. We did not explicitly test our freezing classifier in videos recorded from the side or other angles, but there is no reason to think it wouldnât work since keypoints can be tracked from any angle. We also created a âjitterâ based classifier that uses a changepoint function to identify bouts of freezing and works as well as our velocity-based classifier in our videos (Supp Figure 2), but may accommodate a wider range of camera angles, camera qualities, and keypoint tracking errors. We added this paragraph to the manuscript beginning on line 187:</p><p>âSince algorithms do not necessarily generalize to all settings, we developed a second freezing classifier that uses a changepoint function to find frames at which the mean velocity changes most significantly and then separates frames into groups that minimize the sum of the residual error from the local mean. Binarized freezing vectors are then processed using the same convolution algorithm and minimum duration threshold as the velocity-based classifier (Figure 2E). This classifier also has high precision and recall scores, performing similarly to the first (Supp. Figure 2). Users can tune the classifier by adjusting a minimum residual threshold for the changepoint function. We termed this the âjitterâ classifier since the minimum residual threshold will be determined by the pixel error (aka âjitter) in keypoint position estimates. In other words, the threshold will be determined by how much frame-to-frame âjitterâ there is in DLCâs estimate of the keypoint location. Keypoint tracking âjitterâ may arise as a function of video resolution, framerate, and number of frames used to train a keypoint tracking model. As such, the âjitterâ classifier may accommodate a wider range of video qualities and keypoint tracking models. Also, in videos recorded from the side, the velocity-based freezing classifier may be slightly affected by distortions in velocity calculations caused by the angle (e.g. when the mouse is moving towards/away from the camera). On the other hand, the âjitter classifierâ should work equally well with any viewing angle as long as tracked points remain generally unobscured.â</p><p>In contrast, the ezTrack and VideoFreeze freezing classifiers work well in videos recorded from the side but may not always perform well on videos recorded at other angles. When animals are wearing tethered patch cables, ezTrack users must crop out the cable from the image so that it does not disrupt the freezing detection algorithm. Since it is not possible to crop out the patch cables in videos recorded from above or other angles, the ezTrack classifier may fail in these scenarios. Moreover, there is no straightforward way to validate the freezing classifiers using these methods. BehaviorDEPOT provides the optimization and validation modules so that new users can easily tune and validate our classifiers to suit their experimental setups. Because of this, the BehaviorDEPOT freezing classifier will likely serve a larger audience and yield more reproducible results. We included a paragraph about this in the discussion (lines 596â608).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I like the idea behind the Data Exploration Module, however I was unsure where the explored metrics were coming from.

We changed the terminology as suggested. All changes noted with blue text in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, I think BehaviorDEPOT could be a useful tool. The &quot;no coding experience required&quot; claim is somewhat weakened by the fact that it requires users to first train a DeepLabCut model- this is definitely a task that requires a fair amount of coding experience. One could argue that once the pose model is trained, BehaviorDEPOT can be used by a non-coding user to create any number of behavior classifiers; the only shortcoming I see to that argument is that changes to the experimental setup that degrade pose estimator performance (lighting, frame rate, camera type, camera position, objects in the environment) may require periodic pose model retraining even after the initial setup process.</p></disp-quote><p>In our experience DeepLabCut is simple and easy to use for training models. It has a graphical user interface, so no manipulation of the underlying code is required to use it (one reason it is so widely implemented). The underlying code itself is well managed and continuously updated (e.g., June 2022 support for a plugin to increase labeling efficiency). In our lab, undergraduate students with no coding experience routinely use DLC to train reliable keypoint tracking networks. It is true that changes in experimental setup may require retraining networks, but we have not found this to be difficult or to require coding experience.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other aspects of the authors' response to the review were more troubling, and would still need to be addressed. I outline these below.</p><p>1) I appreciate the authors' effort in comparing BehaviorDEPOT to JAABA, including processing all of their data with MoTr and Ctrax. I agree that providing more software tools to the rodent community is a respectable aim, and the authors are correct in noting that the additional data post-processing features of BehaviorDEPOT are not provided by JAABA. The authors' analysis satisfactorily addresses Reviewer 1's question about VTE detection.</p><p>However, I feel that the performance comparison between BehaviorDEPOT and JAABA in the text and in Figure 10 is inappropriate and misleading. The authors state that they were only able to train JAABA using either (a) the location of the animal's centroid or (b) fit ellipses produced by MoTr and Ctrax, which were of poor quality (as stated by the authors.) It is obvious that a classifier (JAABA) given just the (x,y) coordinate of a mouse's centroid or a poorly fit ellipse is going to be worse for freezing and VTE detection than a classifier (BehaviorDEPOT) given the full pose of the animal-but this undoubtedly because of the quality of the pose representation (MoTr or Ctrax vs DLC), not the quality of the classifier. Unless you can evaluate the two systems on equal footing, i.e. using the same pose representation, you should not present this comparison.</p></disp-quote><p>We regret that we made an error in the text. The text said âcentroidâ, but we actually fit ellipses calculated from our keypoint tracking data. JAABA is built around tracking algorithms that fit ellipses to animals in video timeseries. In its âtracks fileâ, JAABA expects the animalâs X-Y coordinate, orientation, and major and minor axis lengths to generate its feature list (http://jaaba.sourceforge.net/DataFormatting.html#PrepareJAABADataInputFiles), so we agree that using a centroid would not be a fair comparison. We apologize for the confusion generated by this error. In an updated version of our manuscript we have corrected this typo and provided additional details about this comparison (lines 520â529), including a representative image showing the well-fit ellipse (Figure 10C). Since this is the way in which JAABA is intended to work, it is the best comparison possible for this type of data. Considering that we allowed JAABA additional videos for its machine learning classifier, this seems like a fair comparison against which to benchmark BehaviorDEPOT. This clearly demonstrates that for this specific application, BehaviorDEPOT is superior to JABAA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Similarly, the authors' response to Reviewer 1's question 3 is focused on the contrast between keypoint-based tracking to earlier classical computer vision methods, which is not what was asked (and is not relevant here, as neither BehaviorDEPOT nor JAABA is a pose estimation tool.)

We do not intend to imply that BehaviorDEPOTâs heuristic method is necessarily more efficient to set up than an appropriately regularized supervised classifier. We have carefully gone over the text to ensure we do not unintentionally suggest this and feel the revised version is clear on this point. For instance, we removed the phrase in the paragraphs spanning lines 555Â­Â­â575 that suggested that BehaviorDEPOT is more efficient to setup than a regularized supervised classifier and toned down the point about how much human-labeled data is required for BehaviorDEPOT vs. supervised machine learning. While we do show that BehaviorDEPOT is superior to JABAA for this specific freezing application, that does not mean that our approach is always better than a supervised classifier. Instead, we emphasize that BehaviorDEPOTâs heuristics can accurately detect many widely studied behaviors in a way that is easy to use, understand and interpret. The efficiency of using one method over the other likely depends on the specific application and the userâs skill and level of comfort with machine learning. We think that BehaviorDEPOT will be useful for many labs studying the kinds of behaviors we highlight in our manuscript, but undoubtedly there will continue to be many instances where supervised machine learning is the preferred method.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) While supplementary Table 4 is helpful, it doesn't answer the question asked, which is &quot;how good does my pose estimation need to be for the classifier to work well&quot;- to do so, you would need to train pose models with different amounts of training data, to see how classifier performance depends on either training set size or mean DLC error, within a given dataset.

We trained 10 separate DLC networks with mean tracking errors that ranged from 1.52â8.65 pixels. We used each network to estimate poses from the same set of 6 videos. We plotted Precision, Recall, Specificity and F1 scores of the freezing classifier against mean DLC error. A linear regression analysis revealed that precision was the most sensitive to DLC tracking errors. This led to a smaller but significant impact on the F1 score as well. This experiment is now described in the main text (lines 184â189) and the plots are included in Figure 2 â Supplementary Figure 1 and descriptions of each model are included in Supplementary File 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In response to Reviewer 2's question about camera position, the authors present a new &quot;jitter&quot;-based freezing classifier.
