the underlying timing mechanisms are not well understood. <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> undergoes four molts at regular 8 to 10 hour intervals. The pace of the cycle is governed by PERIOD/<italic>lin-42</italic> and other as-yet unknown factors. Cessation of the cycle in young adults is controlled by the <italic>let-7</italic> family of microRNAs and downstream transcription factors in the heterochronic pathway. Here, we characterize a negative feedback loop between NHR-23, the worm homolog of mammalian <underline>r</underline>etinoid-related <underline>o</underline>rphan <underline>r</underline>eceptors (RORs), and the <italic>let-7</italic> family of microRNAs that regulates both the frequency and finite number of molts. The molting cycle is decelerated in <italic>nhr-23</italic> knockdowns and accelerated in <italic>let-7(−)</italic> mutants, but timed similarly in <italic>let-7(−) nhr-23(−)</italic> double mutants and wild-type animals. NHR-23 binds response elements (ROREs) in the <italic>let-7</italic> promoter and activates transcription. In turn, <italic>let-</italic>7 dampens <italic>nhr-23</italic> expression across development via a complementary <italic>let-7</italic>-binding site (LCS) in the <italic>nhr-23</italic> 3′ UTR. The molecular interactions between NHR-23 and <italic>let-7</italic> hold true for other <italic>let-7</italic> family microRNAs. Either derepression of <italic>nhr-23</italic> transcripts by LCS deletion or high gene dosage of <italic>nhr-23</italic> leads to protracted behavioral quiescence and extra molts in adults. NHR-23 and <italic>let-7</italic> also coregulate scores of genes required for execution of the molts, including <italic>lin-42</italic>. In addition, ROREs and LCSs isolated from mammalian <italic>ROR</italic> and <italic>let-7</italic> genes function in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, suggesting conservation of this feedback mechanism. We propose that this feedback loop unites the molting timer and the heterochronic gene regulatory network, possibly by functioning as a cycle counter.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>molting cycle</kwd><kwd>genetic oscillators</kwd><kwd>heterochronic pathway</kwd><kwd>developmental timers</kwd><kwd>circadian clock</kwd><kwd>biological rhythms</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RSG-12-149-01-DDC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frand</surname><given-names>Alison R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS1258218</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frand</surname><given-names>Alison R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM129301</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>John K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A genetic oscillator composed of NHR-23 and <italic>let-7</italic> family of microRNAs links the molting cycle timer and the heterochronic pathway to regulate the pace of molting in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and ensure that worms molt only four times.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Timekeeping is a critical component of animal development. Developmental timers are a subset of biological clocks that govern the frequency of cyclic processes such as the formation of vertebrate somites and insect body segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Diaz-Cuadros et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Keyte and Smith, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Uriu, 2016</xref>). Heterochronic gene pathways, like the microRNA–mRNA networks in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and other organisms, regulate sequential events and orchestrate the timing of development across tissue types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ambros and Ruvkun, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Galagali and Kim, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Holguera and Desplan, 2018</xref>). The mechanisms by which developmental clocks and heterochronic pathways interact to coordinate repeated developmental processes with cell fate transitions remain unknown.</p><p>Studies of circadian rhythm have provided a framework for understanding how biological clocks schedule rhythmic processes. The circadian clock is a physiologic clock that governs daily feeding–fasting and sleep–wake cycles, as well as diurnal, organ-specific metabolic cycles. Entrainment of the circadian clock coordinates the cellular and molecular processes with predictable 24 hour (h) changes in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Takahashi, 2016</xref>). The period of developmental clocks, unlike physiologic clocks, may vary in response to external conditions, such as temperature, nutrition, and growth factors. Many developmental clocks that regulate morphogenic processes also stop after a finite number of iterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Konopka and Benzer, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rensing et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tsiairis and Großhans, 2021</xref>).</p><p>The mechanistic basis for both developmental and physiological clocks are molecular-genetic oscillators. Cyclic expression of the core components of oscillators and their target genes together underlie biological rhythms. Molecular-genetic oscillators are comprised of interconnected feedback loops among the core components. Experimental and theoretical studies indicate that negative feedback loops with intrinsic time delays or interdependent positive and negative feedback loops with intrinsic time delays set up most self-sustaining genetic oscillators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Johnson and Day, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Novák and Tyson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tsiairis and Großhans, 2021</xref>). In both cases, time delays are caused in part by unequal rates of RNA versus protein synthesis and degradation. For example, during somitogenesis, the Hes7 transcription factor represses its own transcription, producing a self-sustaining oscillator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bessho et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The key components of the circadian clock in mammals also consist of transcriptional activators and repressors interacting through interlocked feedback loops. During the day, CLOCK and BMAL1 activate the transcription of <italic>PERIOD/PER</italic> and other genes. During the night, PER proteins interact with CLOCK and BMAL1 and repress their own transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Partch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Takahashi, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Takahashi, 2017</xref>). The short half-life of the PER protein, in combination with the continued transcriptional repression of <italic>PER</italic>, results in decrease of PER proteins late in the night. The decrease in the levels of PER is accompanied by increase in the levels of CLOCK and BMAL1 early in the morning. CLOCK and BMAL1 also activate transcription of <italic>REV-ERBα</italic> and <italic>REV-ERBβ</italic>. The competition between the transcriptional repressors, REV-ERBs, and the transcriptional activators, the Retinoid-related Orphan Receptors (RORs), for the same binding sites in the <italic>BMAL1</italic> promoter regulates rhythmic expression of <italic>BMAL1</italic> in peripheral organs and the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cook et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The components of the circadian clock are also subject to post-transcriptional and post-translational regulation. The <italic>bantam</italic> microRNAs regulate the temporal expression of <italic>Drosophila clock</italic> by directly binding the <italic>clock</italic> 3′ UTR and repressing translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kadener et al., 2009</xref>). In mice, the microRNAs miR-24 and miR-30 regulate stability of <italic>Per2</italic> mRNAs and repress their translation by interacting with the <italic>Per2</italic> 3′ UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yoo et al., 2017</xref>). A few other microRNAs regulate the expression of core clock components. However, the prevalence of microRNA-mediated post-transcriptional feedback loops among developmental clocks is not yet known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvarez-Saavedra et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Du et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Molting in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is a reiterated and periodic developmental process. Under favorable conditions, <italic>C. elegans</italic> develop through four larval stages, L1 to L4. Larvae molt from one stage to the next at regular 8- to 10-h intervals and then emerge as adults. <italic>C. elegans</italic> enter and exit a state of behavioral quiescence, termed lethargus, during each molt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Across lethargus, epithelia detach from the old cuticle and synthesize the new larger cuticle for the upcoming life stage. The animal then escapes from the old cuticle at ecdysis. Newly emerged larvae forage and feed during the intermolt. We previously identified PER/LIN-42 as a key component of the underlying molting cycle timer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Monsalve et al., 2011</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Animal development requires coordination between reiterated processes and successive transitions in cell fate.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Stages of the molting cycle of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, emphasizing the regular intervals of lethargus (yellow), ecdysis (orange), and physical activity (blue).

Transcript levels of these genes oscillate with the same frequency as the molting cycle, and the waveforms have a phase-locked peak once per larval stage, that is, the genes peak at the same relative timepoint within each larval stage. Computational models suggest that a single genetic oscillator governs the reiterative expression of all 3700 genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Meeuse et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tsiairis and Großhans, 2021</xref>). It is not known whether the PER-based molting cycle timer and this theoretical genetic oscillator represent the same timekeeping mechanism.</p><p>The heterochronic gene pathway regulates the timing of unidirectional cell fate transitions during the development of <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Key heterochronic genes include the conserved <italic>let-7</italic> microRNA, its paralogs, and stage-specific targets of the <italic>let-7</italic> family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ambros and Ruvkun, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Reinhart et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

The <italic>let-7</italic> paralogs <italic>mir-48</italic>, <italic>mir-84</italic>, and <italic>mir-241</italic> specify the L2 fate of the seam cells, wherein the seam cells undergo one symmetric and one asymmetric division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott et al., 2005</xref>). The <italic>let-7</italic> microRNA specifies later L3 and L4 fates, which include homotypic fusion of the seam cells into lateral syncytia and secretion of three long ridges on the adult-stage cuticle called alae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ambros, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Reinhart et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vadla et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>NHR-23, the only <italic>C. elegans</italic> homolog of mammalian ROR transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Antebi, 2015</xref>), is expressed in the larval epidermis during each larval stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frand et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kostrouchova et al., 1998</xref>). Predicted targets of NHR-23 are enriched for genes associated with molting, including cuticle collagens and enzymes necessary for synthesis and degradation of the cuticle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kouns et al., 2011</xref>). LIN-42, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> homolog of the core circadian clock protein and tumor suppressor PERIOD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jeon et al., 1999</xref>), sustains the 8 h intervals between molts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Monsalve et al., 2011</xref>). LIN-42 and the <italic>let-7</italic> family mutually inhibit one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McCulloch and Rougvie, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Perales et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Reinhart et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Van Wynsberghe et al., 2014</xref>).

However, the transcriptional activator(s) responsible for the oscillatory expression of <italic>let-7s</italic> remains unknown.</p><p>Here, we show that both NHR-23 and the <italic>let-</italic>7 family of microRNAs (the <italic>let-</italic>7s) are key components of a simple regulatory circuit that operates within the molecular-genetic oscillator underlying the molting cycle and also within the heterochronic gene regulatory network. Using longitudinal studies of the biorhythm of molting in relevant genetic backgrounds, molecular and cell biological analyses, and bioinformatic approaches, we show that NHR-23 transcriptionally activates the <italic>let-7s</italic> and, in turn, the <italic>let-7s</italic> post-transcriptionally repress <italic>nhr-23</italic> mRNA. In addition, NHR-23 positively autoregulates its own transcription. Together, NHR-23/ROR and the <italic>let-7s</italic> establish a transcriptional–post-transcriptional feedback loop that governs the pace and extinction of the molting cycle after four iterations. As both the key components and <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements comprising this feedback loop are conserved from nematodes to mammals, our findings may apply to some developmental and tissue-specific circadian clocks of humans, and help elucidate related pathologies, including birth defects, cancers, sleep disorders, and metabolic syndromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Oyama et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Patke et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Puram et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Roenneberg and Merrow, 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Larval molting cycles lengthen in <italic>nhr-23</italic> knockdowns and shorten in <italic>let-7</italic> family mutants</title><p>To determine the role of <italic>nhr-23</italic> and <italic>let-7</italic> in timing the molting cycle, we measured and compared the length of molting cycles in <italic>nhr-23</italic> knockdowns, <italic>let-7</italic> mutants, and control larvae through a series of longitudinal studies.

To circumvent L2 arrest and determine how knockdown of <italic>nhr-23</italic> affects the timing of the L3 and L4 stages, we maintained worms, starting at the L1 stage on control bacteria for 6 h and 14 h, respectively, and then moved them to <italic>nhr-23(RNAi)</italic> bacteria. This strategy ensured that all test subjects emerged in the target stage superficially normal, but none of the test subjects fully shed the cuticle from the ensuing molt, signifying complete penetrance of the molting-defective (Mlt) phenotype associated with <italic>nhr-23(RNAi)</italic>. Age-matched, wild-type larvae fed the same bacterial strain transformed with an empty vector served as controls.</p><p>The actograms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> display the results of these longitudinal studies. Each actogram corresponds to an isogenic cohort of animals. Therein, each column represents a single animal that emerged in the target stage (L4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and L3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), developed, and underwent the ensuing molt. Each animal was isolated during the preceding molt to achieve stringent synchronization at the outset. After it emerged, the worm was observed for approximately 1 min at regular 1 h intervals. At each timepoint, the worm was ‘active’ if both pharyngeal muscle contractions (pumps) and sinusoidal locomotion were observed. Conversely, the worm was ‘lethargic’ if neither pharyngeal pumps nor sinusoidal locomotion were observed, and its body posture resembled a hockey stick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Iwanir et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Raizen et al., 2008</xref>). Separation of the preexisting cuticle from the body and detection of the shed cuticle on the culture plate signified the commencement and completion of ecdysis, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Singh and Sulston, 1978</xref>).</p><p>As expected, the cohort of wild-type (control) animals first emerged as L4s, then entered and exited lethargus, shed the larval cuticle (ecdysed), and emerged as young adults almost synchronously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Approximately 50% (8 out 17 animals) of the cohort of <italic>nhr-23(RNAi)</italic> animals entered lethargus 9–10 h after emerging as L4s as compared with 19% of the control cohort (3 out of 16 animals). Strikingly, the cohort of <italic>nhr-23(RNAi)</italic> animals remained lethargic for twice as long as the control cohort. All of the <italic>nhr-23(RNAi)</italic> animals began to pump and locomote once again, but oftentimes at lower rates than wild-type adults. In principle, this intermittent sluggishness might result from incomplete arousal or hindrance by unshed parts of the L4-stage cuticle. Regardless, the wake-to-wake interval of the L4-stage <italic>nhr-23(RNAi)</italic> cohort was 13 ± 1.1 h as compared with 10.3 ± 0.4 h for the control cohort (p ≤ 0.0001). Following this trend, the L3-stage cohort of <italic>nhr-23(RNAi)</italic> larvae entered lethargus 1.4 ± 0.8 h later and remained in lethargus twice as long as the age-matched wild-type cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Similarly, the cohort of <italic>nhr-23(RNAi)</italic> larvae molting from L2 to L3 were in lethargus three times longer than the age-matched controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Thus, <italic>nhr-23(RNAi)</italic> animals developing through three larval stages entered lethargus slightly later and remained lethargic for much longer than wild-type animals.</p><p>To evaluate the role of the <italic>let-7s</italic>, we tracked cohorts of <italic>let-7(n2853)</italic>, <italic>let-7(mg279)</italic>, and <italic>let-7(mg279); mir-84(tm1304)</italic> double mutants across late larval stages. Both <italic>n2853</italic> and <italic>mg279</italic> are associated with lower levels of mature <italic>let-7</italic>, relative to wild-type animals. However, <italic>n2853</italic> is a substitution in the seed sequence, whereas <italic>mg279</italic> is a 27-bp deletion upstream of the mature microRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bracht et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Reinhart et al., 2000</xref>). The null allele of <italic>mir-84</italic> enhances relevant phenotypes associated with <italic>let-7(mg279)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hayes and Ruvkun, 2006</xref>). We also tracked <italic>mir-48 mir-241(nDf51); mir-84(n4037)</italic> triple mutants across L2, when the corresponding microRNAs are expressed but mature <italic>let-7</italic> is not yet detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McCulloch and Rougvie, 2014</xref>). In contrast to animals subjected to <italic>nhr-23(RNAi)</italic>, <italic>let-7(n2853)</italic> mutants both entered and exited lethargus more quickly than wild-type animals. For example, the wake-to-wake interval for the <italic>let-7(n2853)</italic> cohort developing from L4s into adults was only 7.9 ± 0.6 h, an acceleration of 2.9 ± 0.7 h relative to the wild-type cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). All of the <italic>let-7(n2853)</italic> animals subsequently ruptured at the vulva, a hallmark of this strong loss-of-function allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Reinhart et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ecsedi et al., 2015</xref>). In complementary studies, L4-stage cohorts of both <italic>let-7(mg279)</italic> single and <italic>let-7(mg279); mir-84(tm1304)</italic> double mutants also entered lethargus ahead of wild-type L4s (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Moreover, the cohort of <italic>let-7(n2853)</italic> mutants observed from emergence in L3 onward passed through two consecutive lethargic phases and emerged as young adults ahead of the entire wild-type cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). As such, repetition of the L3 stage, a retarded heterochronic phenotype, cannot explain the acceleration of the L4 stage observed in <italic>let-7(n2853)</italic> mutants, because both the L3 and L4 stages of the mutants were shorter than those of wild-type larvae. Thus, lethargus was advanced and larval development was accelerated in three distinct mutants of the <italic>let-7</italic> family.</p><p>The altered pace of molting exhibited by either <italic>nhr-23(RNAi)</italic> or the <italic>let-7(n2853)</italic> mutant was partially suppressed in the <italic>nhr-23(RNAi) let-7(n2853)</italic> double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Strikingly, none of the <italic>let-7(n2853)</italic> mutants ruptured on <italic>nhr-23(RNAi)</italic>, suggesting that the <italic>let-7</italic>-mediated suppression of <italic>nhr-23</italic> regulates both lethargus and the morphogenesis of the vulva (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Approximately 70% of the L4-stage cohort of <italic>nhr-23(RNAi) let-7(n2853)</italic> double mutants entered lethargus 7–8h after the L3-to-L4 molt, while the rest entered lethargus 5–6 h after the L3-to-L4 molt. In contrast, only a third of the L4-stage <italic>let-7(n2853)</italic> mutants entered lethargus 7 h after the L3-to-L4 molt; the rest did so after only 6 h. Thus, a majority of the <italic>nhr-23(RNAi) let-7(n2853)</italic> double mutants became lethargic 1 h after the majority of the <italic>let-7(n2853)</italic> single mutants. The double mutants also emerged from lethargus earlier than <italic>nhr-23(RNAi)</italic> single mutants (p &lt; 0.01, ordinary one-way analysis of variance [ANOVA] with Bonferroni’s correction for multiple comparisons). As a result, the wake-to-wake interval of the L4-stage cohort of <italic>nhr-23(RNAi) let-7(n2853)</italic> double mutants was 10.6 ± 0.8 h, similar to the value of the wild-type cohort (p ≥ 0.9). Notably, <italic>nhr-23(RNAi) let-7(n2853)</italic> double mutants underwent aberrant ecdysis, indicating that the role of <italic>nhr-23</italic> in lethargus and ecdysis is genetically separable.</p><p>Suppression of the altered pace of molting in the <italic>nhr-23(RNAi) let-7(n2853)</italic> double mutants was also apparent during the L2 and L3 stages. The wake-to-wake interval of the <italic>nhr-23(RNAi) let-7(n2853)</italic> double mutants during the L3 stage was 1.4 ± 1.4 h shorter than <italic>nhr-23(RNAi)</italic> alone (p = 0.0002). Moreover, the triple knockout of the <italic>let-7</italic> sisters, <italic>mir-48 mir-241(nDf51); mir-84(n4037)</italic>, partially suppressed the prolonged lethargy associated with <italic>nhr-23(RNAi)</italic> across the L2/L3 molt, shortening the lethargic interval by 0.9 ± 1.0 h (p = 0.002, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) to that of wild-type animals.</p><p>Taken together, the mutual suppression of the behavioral phenotypes of <italic>nhr-23(RNAi)</italic> or the <italic>let-7(n2853)</italic> mutant in the <italic>nhr-23(RNAi) let-7(n2853)</italic> double mutant suggests that NHR-23 and <italic>let-7s</italic> act in the same genetic pathway. Based on these results, we propose a model whereby NHR-23 accelerates the molting cycle in part by regulating the expression of the <italic>let-</italic>7 family of microRNAs and the <italic>let-7s</italic> decelerate the cycle in part by regulating the expression of <italic>nhr-23</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>NHR-23 promotes oscillatory expression of primary <italic>let-7</italic> and its paralogs</title><p>RNA polymerase II transcribes microRNA genes to generate primary microRNAs (pri-miRNAs). The microprocessor complex, consisting of Drosha and Pasha, processes pri-miRNAs into precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs). Pre-microRNAs are exported into the cytoplasm and processed further by Dicer. The resulting microRNA duplex is unwound and the mature microRNA strand is loaded into the effector Argonaute protein. Cofactors can regulate the biogenesis of microRNAs at each of these levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ambros and Ruvkun, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Galagali and Kim, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Based on the longitudinal studies described above, we hypothesized that the transcription factor NHR-23 may directly regulate transcription of <italic>let-7</italic>. Consistent with this hypothesis, a binding peak for NHR-23 was reported within ~300 bp upstream of primary <italic>let-7</italic> from the modENCODE Consortium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Celniker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gerstein et al., 2010</xref>). Nuclear hormone receptors typically bind DNA response elements as homotypic or heterotypic dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Evans and Mangelsdorf, 2014</xref>). NHR-23 and its mammalian counterpart RORα are among the few that bind the consensus sequence 5′-(A/G)GGTCA-3′ as monomers to activate transcription of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Giguère et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kouns et al., 2011</xref>). We identified three occurrences of this sequence, called the ROR response element (RORE), within the reported NHR-23-binding peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Additionally, the 300 bp region containing the ROREs is contained within a previously characterized enhancer element required for <italic>let-7</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Johnson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kai et al., 2013</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>NHR-23 promotes transcription of primary <italic>let-7</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the <italic>let-7</italic> locus in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (top) and corresponding NHR-23 ChIP-seq peaks (bottom).

The L2-stage expression curves detected in both mutants were at least 3-fold steeper than those detected in wild-type larvae. Additionally, the amplitude of <italic>nhr-23</italic> expression was 2.3-fold higher in <italic>nhr-23(∆LCS)</italic> mutants than in control animals.</p><p>In complementary studies, we tracked the abundance of NHR-23 protein expression in epidermal nuclei as indicated by the signal associated with the NHR-23::GFP fusion protein. Protein levels also cycled from the L2 through the L4 stage. For example, the signal peaked 2 h after emergence in the L4 stage but was not detected 3 h later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>). Both the extent and kinetics of protein increase and decrease corresponded well with the expression curves for <italic>nhr-23</italic> transcripts detected in wild-type larvae. We next asked if the <italic>let-7s</italic> regulate the abundance of NHR-23 proteins by comparing the abundance of the NHR-23::GFP fusion protein in the <italic>let-7(mg279); mir-84(tm1304)</italic> double mutant and wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>). GFP was detected in the epidermal nuclei of the <italic>let-7(mg279); mir-84(tm1304)</italic> mutant molting from L4s to adults but was not readily detected in wild-type molting animals. The signal from NHR-23::GFP became bright in the <italic>let-7(mg279); mir-84(tm1304)</italic> mutant that had emerged as adults but remained dim in wild-type adults. Interestingly, the corresponding 3.4-fold increase in fluorescence intensity matched the 3.4-fold increase in abundance of <italic>nhr-23</italic> transcripts detected in <italic>let-7(n2853)</italic> versus wild-type samples collected at a comparable timepoint. Of note, the native 3′ UTR of <italic>nhr-23</italic> was fused to <italic>nhr-23::gfp</italic> in the genetic reagent used in our study, whereas the ectopic 3′ UTR of <italic>unc-54</italic>, which is not a target of the <italic>let-7s</italic>, was fused to <italic>nhr-23::gfp</italic> in a distinct reagent used in previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hayes et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kostrouchova et al., 1998</xref>). Thus, the current study is the first to report that the <italic>let-7s</italic> likely directly repress <italic>nhr-23</italic> through association with the LCS in the <italic>nhr-23</italic> 3′ UTR to prevent the accumulation of <italic>nhr-23</italic> transcripts and proteins in wild-type adults.</p><p>To study how the LCS, and by extension, <italic>let-7</italic>-mediated repression of <italic>nhr-23</italic>, affects the biorhythm of molting, we tracked cohorts of <italic>nhr-23(∆LCS)</italic> larvae across both the L3 and L4 stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B, C</xref>). As a complementary approach, we also tracked larvae that expressed multiple copies of <italic>nhr-23</italic> from an integrated, tandem array (<italic>wgIs43[nhr-23<sup>++</sup>]</italic>) across the same life stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Celniker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gerstein et al., 2010</xref>). The majority of <italic>nhr-23(∆LCS)</italic> L3 larvae entered lethargus and emerged as L4 larvae before most wild-type L3 larvae began to molt. The wake-to-wake interval of the <italic>nhr-23(∆LCS)</italic> L3-stage cohort was 1.5 ± 0.9 h shorter than that of wild-type L3s. Likewise, the majority of <italic>wgIs43[nhr-23<sup>++</sup>]</italic> larvae, which overexpress <italic>nhr-23</italic>, entered lethargus and emerged in the next life stage faster than age-matched, wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B, C</xref>). The wake-to-wake interval was 6.9 ± 0.6 h for the <italic>wgIs43[nhr-23<sup>++</sup>]</italic> cohort developing from L3 to L4, compared with 7.8 ± 0.6 h for the wild-type cohort (p ≤ 0.01). Combining <italic>wgIs43[nhr-23<sup>++</sup>]</italic> with <italic>let-7(n2853)</italic> led to larval lethality and prohibited a similar analysis. Thus, both derepression and increased dosage of <italic>nhr-23</italic> were associated with advanced lethargus and faster cycles, similar to our findings with the <italic>let-7(lf)</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>Together, these findings show that the endogenous LCS in the <italic>nhr-23</italic> 3′ UTR is indeed a <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory, repressive element, and strongly suggest that <italic>let-7</italic> and its paralogs bind this functional LCS and negatively regulate the expression of <italic>nhr-23</italic> transcripts and proteins, while larvae transit the molts and emerge in the subsequent life stage. Therefore, these data are consistent with a model whereby NHR-23 and the <italic>let-7s</italic> form a transcriptional–post transcriptional feedback loop that regulates the duration of the molt. Immediately following the molt, NHR-23 activates transcription of the <italic>let-7</italic>s early during the larval stage. The post transcriptional repression of <italic>nhr-23</italic> by the <italic>let-7s</italic> keeps the levels of <italic>nhr-23</italic> below a particular threshold, preventing early entry into the next molt.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Forced expression of <italic>nhr-23</italic> is sufficient to trigger supernumerary molts</title><p>As described above, there was no detectable dampening of <italic>nhr-23</italic> transcript levels in <italic>let-7(n2853)</italic> mutants, whereas the phenomenon was obvious in wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Mutations in <italic>let-7</italic> were originally characterized as retarded heterochronic mutants that underwent supernumerary molts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hayes et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Reinhart et al., 2000</xref>). Considering this, we hypothesized that <italic>let-7</italic>-dependent dampening of the oscillatory expression of <italic>nhr-23</italic> effectively counts down the number of molts and ultimately extinguishes the molting cycle.</p><p>To test this idea, we tracked and compared instances of molting-associated behaviors and animal viability between wild-type adults and age-matched gain-of-function (<italic>gf</italic>) mutants where <italic>nhr-23</italic> is overexpressed: <italic>nhr-23(ΔLCS)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and <italic>wgIs43[nhr-23<sup>++</sup>]</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Celniker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gerstein et al., 2010</xref>). First, we inspected partially synchronized populations at regular timepoints 2–5 days after the emergence of adults. Behavioral quiescence, defined by a lack of detectable pharyngeal pumping or locomotion, was more common among both <italic>nhr-23(ΔLCS)</italic> and <italic>wgIs43[nhr-23<sup>++</sup>]</italic> adults than wild-type animals across this time interval. Moreover, the percentage of quiescent <italic>nhr-23(gf)</italic> adults peaked and significantly exceeded the percentage of quiescent wild-type adults during three to four successive time samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). We next asked whether quiescent <italic>nhr-23(ΔLCS)</italic> and <italic>wgIs43[nhr-23<sup>++</sup>]</italic> adults observed at those particular timepoints were in fact undergoing lethargi associated with supernumerary molts rather than transient, satiety-induced quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">You et al., 2008</xref>). To distinguish between these two possibilities, we singled quiescent adults into three respective cohorts per genotype and tracked the animals within each cohort for an additional 12 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). In parallel, we singled and tracked quiescent wild-type adults. The overwhelming majority of singled <italic>nhr-23(gf)</italic> adults were quiescent for several hours and then attempted to ecdyse, a sequence of events indicative of a supernumerary molt. Most animals shed entire cuticles or parts thereof, but nonetheless died (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video2 fig7video3">Figure 7—videos 2 and 3</xref>). The <italic>nhr-23(ΔLCS</italic>) adult shown in <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video3">Figure 7—video 3</xref> is one such example. The animal was quiescent for 6 h, then exhibited intermittent twitches of the grinder, a behavior that accompanies ecdysis, and ultimately bagged, likely because unshed cuticle occluded the vulva. In contrast, all quiescent wild-type adults regained activity and only one animal died during the period of observation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video1">Figure 7—video 1</xref>). By the abovementioned criteria, 97% (<italic>n</italic> = 34) of singled <italic>nhr-23(∆LCS)</italic> adults and 91% (<italic>n</italic> = 33) of singled <italic>wgIs43[nhr-23<sup>++</sup>]</italic> adults underwent supernumerary molts whereas none (<italic>n</italic> = 11) of the wild-type adults did so (p &lt; 0.0001, chi-square test). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> shows one example each of an <italic>nhr-23(∆LCS)</italic> and a <italic>wgIs43[nhr-23<sup>++</sup>]</italic> adult that underwent aberrant molts and became trapped in partly shed cuticles. Both animals had eggs in the uterus. However, the <italic>nhr-23(∆LCS)</italic> animal had an old cuticle attached to its tail. Also, alae were visible on both the lateral surface of the extant cuticle and the partly shed cuticle, implying that the epidermis had terminally differentiated prior to the attempted molt. These results show that forced expression of <italic>nhr-23</italic> is sufficient to initiate a supernumerary molt but not sufficient to properly complete the molt. Taken together, these data suggest that artificially increasing the abundance of NHR-23 relative to the <italic>let-7s</italic> drives additional iterations of the molting cycle.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Both derepression and ectopic overexpression of <italic>nhr-23</italic> trigger additional molts in reproductively mature animals.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The percentage of adults in wild-type, <italic>nhr-23</italic>(<italic>∆LCS)</italic>, and the <italic>nhr-23</italic> overexpression strain (<italic>wgIs43[nhr-23++]</italic>) that appeared quiescent at regular timepoints 54–120 h after release from diapause and cultivation with food.

A CCG classified as a direct target of NHR-23 met at least two of the following criteria: (1) NHR-23 occupied the 5′ regulatory region of the gene in vivo, as annotated in a modENCODE ChIP-seq dataset of NHR-23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Celniker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gerstein et al., 2010</xref>); (2) the same regulatory region contained more ROREs than expected by chance; and (3) knockdown of <italic>nhr-23</italic> resulted in lower transcript levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kouns et al., 2011</xref>). A CCG classified as a target of the <italic>let-7s</italic> met two criteria: (1) ALG-1 bound the 3′ UTR of the respective mRNA in vivo, as reported in an ALG-1 iCLIP dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Broughton et al., 2016</xref>) and (2) the 3′ UTR contained more LCSs than expected by chance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rehmsmeier et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>By these criteria, 35 of 67 CCGs (57%) were classified as shared targets of both NHR-23 and the <italic>let-7s</italic> (including <italic>fbn-1</italic> and <italic>mlt-10</italic>), 16 CCGs (24%) as targets of only NHR-23, 7 CCGs (10%) as targets of only <italic>let-7s</italic>, and 9 CCGs (13%) as targets of neither factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Notably, multiple response elements for NHR-23 were identified in the promoters of almost all CCGs classified as <italic>let-7</italic> targets and vice versa, even though NHR-23 or ALG-1 were not enriched at those genomic locations in the abovementioned ChIP-seq or iCLIP datasets, respectively. Therefore, 57% of CCGs as shared targets may be an underestimate and more outputs of the molting timer may ultimately be recognized as targets of both NHR-23 and the <italic>let-7s</italic>. Only 10% of twenty randomly selected genes that are not known to cycle in expression were classified as shared targets of both NHR-23 and <italic>let-7s,</italic> suggesting that NHR-23 and the <italic>let-7s</italic> together may specifically regulate the expression of oscillatory genes that drive molting. These findings suggest that partly interdependent waves in the abundance of NHR-23 and the <italic>let-7s</italic> sculpt the temporal expression profiles of <italic>fbn-1</italic>, <italic>mlt-10</italic>, and possibly many additional effectors of the molting timer.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>NHR-23 and <italic>let-7s</italic> govern the temporal expression profile of other key clock genes</title><p>The bioinformatics analysis described above provided more evidence for regulatory interactions among other key components of the oscillator.

Three major spliced isoforms of <italic>lin-42</italic> are recognized to encode regulators of the molting cycle and components of the heterochronic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Edelman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jeon et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Monsalve et al., 2011</xref>).

The ROREs in both promoters correspond to sites of NHR-23 enrichment detected in a ChIP-seq dataset from the modENCODE Consortium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Celniker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gerstein et al., 2010</xref>).

To characterize further the extent to which NHR-23 activates the pulsatile expression of <italic>lin-42</italic>, we measured and compared the levels of <italic>lin-42</italic> transcripts across the L4 stage in attenuated <italic>nhr-23</italic> knockdowns and control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). As expected, levels of <italic>lin-42</italic> in control samples peaked in L3 and once again in L4. No such peak was detected in <italic>nhr-23(RNAi)</italic> at the L4 stage. The transcript levels of <italic>lin-42</italic> detected in <italic>nhr-23</italic> knockdowns at the L4 stage (42 h) were 2.6-fold lower than the peak value detected in age-matched, control larvae. Likewise, the slope of <italic>lin-42</italic> expression was 6-fold lower in L4-stage <italic>nhr-23(RNAi)</italic> larvae, relative to age-matched controls.

In this assay, the dsRNAs used to downregulate <italic>nhr-23</italic> expression specifically target the last two and half exons and thus, in theory, should affect expression of only endogenous <italic>nhr-23</italic> and not the <italic>nhr-23∷gfp∷unc-54</italic> transgenic reporter.

During the adult stage, the level of inappropriately expressed <italic>nhr-23</italic> in <italic>let-7(n2853)</italic> was higher than the level of <italic>nhr-23</italic> in the <italic>nhr-23(ΔLCS)</italic> strain, suggesting the involvement of more than one pathway in the repression of <italic>nhr-23</italic> by <italic>let-7</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). During the juvenile-to-adult transition, <italic>let-7</italic> represses <italic>lin-41</italic>, which encodes an RNA-binding protein, and this allows the translation of the LIN-41 target, <italic>lin-29</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Reinhart et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Slack et al., 2000</xref>).

Therefore, the <italic>lin-29</italic>-mediated inhibition may be the 3′ UTR-independent pathway by which <italic>let-7</italic> represses <italic>nhr-23</italic>.</p><p>Thus, NHR-23 and <italic>let-7</italic> form a transcriptional–post-transcriptional negative feedback loop.

We propose that the NHR-23–<italic>let-7</italic> feedback loop acts within the LIN-42/PER-based molting cycle timer, alongside other as-yet unidentified components.</p><p>Based on our findings, we propose a model to explain how the feedback loop between NHR-23 and the <italic>let-7s</italic> controls the speed of the molting cycle. Early in each larval stage, as animals commit to a forthcoming molt, NHR-23 first reaches a functional concentration at the promoters of genes with relatively higher numbers of ROREs, such as <italic>fbn-1</italic> and <italic>noah-1</italic>, and initiates the gene expression programs leading to the biogenesis of the sheath (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>). The sheath is a temporary exoskeleton that encapsulates molting animals and is thought to protect the body of the worm from rupturing while the old cuticle is released and a new one is synthesized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Katz et al., 2021</xref>). At the same time, NHR-23 also promotes accumulation of the <italic>let-7</italic> family of microRNAs. As NHR-23 continues to accumulate, it begins to activate the expression of genes with relatively fewer ROREs such as <italic>mlt-10</italic> and <italic>osm-11</italic>, which, respectively, encode components of the cuticle and lethargus-promoting peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Meli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Singh et al., 2011</xref>). At this time, NHR-23 might also promote the expression of another core clock component, <italic>lin-42</italic>. In this manner, NHR-23 might schedule the start of cuticle biogenesis and onset of lethargus. Then, <italic>let-7</italic>-mediated repression of the same CCGs and <italic>lin-42</italic> likely governs both the end of cuticle remodeling and lethargus. Repression of <italic>nhr-23</italic> delays accumulation of the NHR-23 protein in the next life stage and the onset of any subsequent molt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

L4s and older worms were observed at 300-fold magnification; L3s and younger worms, at 600-fold magnification. At each time sample, each subject was classified as active or lethargic based on the observation of defined target behaviors.

Later, the number of pharyngeal contractions (pumps) in a 15 s recorded interval was counted while the video recording was viewed at 4-fold reduced speed using iMovie version 10.11.2. Pumping rates (Hz) determined by three independent counts of selected video recordings fell within 95% of the mean, validating this method. High, medium, and low levels of activity were then graded post hoc on a one-way standard scale defined by the SDs and mean pumping rate of all age-matched, wild-type time samples. As an example, wild-type young adults pumped at 3.9 ± 1.1 Hz (mean ± SD). The activity levels of nearly all worms that reawakened from lethargi associated with the L4-to-adult molt were therefore graded as high, medium, or low if the worm pumped at greater than, or equal to, 2.8 Hz, between 2.8 and 1.7 Hz, or less than 1.7 Hz, respectively. A reasonable exception to this system was made if sinusoidal locomotion was obvious but no pharyngeal pumps were captured on video. In this scenario, the worm was scored as active at a low level. This exception applied to only 8 out of 56 time samples of <italic>nhr-23</italic> single knockdowns and 14 out of 84 time samples of <italic>nhr-23(RNAi) let-7(n2853</italic>) double mutants.

For each strain of interest, six distinct clutches were plated at 12 h intervals, facilitating the later evaluation of time samples covering a 72 h interval. As described, worms were observed by light microscopy and scored as quiescent or active at regular 3 h intervals, 54 to 120 h post-release from diapause. For related longitudinal studies, quiescent adults were selected and singled in 12-well NGM plates seeded with thin lawns of bacteria. Each cohort of animals was then either observed at regular 2 h intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), or video-recorded for 15–30 s, at regular 2 h intervals, with a Nikon D500 camera. All the previously described scoring rubrics were applied. In addition, ecdysis was recognized by the execution of one or more of the following idiosyncratic movements: rotation on the long axis (flipping), bilateral contraction and relaxation on the long axis, and elevation plus semicircular rotation of the head. Aberrant molts were scored based on the observation of puckered sections of cuticle along the body, or the adherence of partly shed cuticle fragments to the body. If a particular animal had passed through lethargus, then the following behaviors were also considered evidence of an aberrant molt: pharyngeal spasms, incomplete pumps wherein the grinder failed to close, and incomplete flips that resulted in twists or kinks along the body. Detection of a shed cuticle, or parts thereof, on the culture plate was recorded separately. The latter categories were not mutually exclusive. The absence of a supernumerary molt was inferred if the animal was active and superficially normal at the endpoint.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Construction of fusion genes and transgenic strains</title><p>The sequences of all oligonucleotides used in this study are specified in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>.

The upstream sequences extracted from WormBase included all nucleotides between the transcriptional start site of the gene of interest and the nearest protein-coding gene. Particular sequences were extended or shortened based on gene models, ESTs, and transcriptional start sites archived in WS264. If the gene of interest lacked an annotated 3′ UTR, then we initially retrieved 1 kb of sequence downstream of the stop codon.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Feedback among a retinoid-related nuclear receptor and <italic>let-7</italic> miRNAs controls the pace and number of molts in <italic>C. elegans</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>There has been a lot of enthusiasm about the overall problem addressed in your paper, but as you will see detailed in the reviews below, there has been some substantial concern about whether the intriguing claims are really completely supported by the data. Without such explicit support, the advance relative to previous studies was deemed insufficient (even though it was much appreciated that your results confirm and extend previous insights). As you will also see, the reviewers have made suggestions for how to improve the manuscript. If you decided to undertake the substantial revisions suggested, we would be interested in considering such a manuscript, but this would then count as a new submission.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In the manuscript &quot;Feedback among a retinoid-related nuclear receptor and let-7 miRNAs controls the pace and number of molts in <italic>C. elegans</italic>&quot;, Patel et al. aim to demonstrate a feedback network between retinoid-related nuclear receptor nhr-23 and let-7 miRNA family in the control of the pace/number of molts in C.elegans. First, they perform a quantitative and detailed characterization of the molting pattern throughout development in a number of different genetic manipulations of nhr-23 and/or let-7 family miRNAs and demonstrate that they affect the length/number of the molting cycle. Then, they go on to demonstrate direct regulation between nhr-23 and let-7 family miRNAs. The authors offer too simplistic of a feedback model for something much more complex and what the data suggest (elaborated in more detail below). Much of what the authors convincingly demonstrate in this manuscript, although done in a more detailed/quantitative manner and sometimes using novel reagents, has been previously shown/implicated (Kostrouchova et al., 2001; Frand et al., 2005; Hayes et al., 2006; Celniker et al., 2009). The portion of the manuscript that could be potentially interesting and novel (the mechanisms by which nhr-23/let-7 alter molting cycle length/number, conservation of this regulation in other systems, etc), the authors offer very little insight and experimental support. In its current form, without further experiments/analysis as suggested below, this manuscript does not significantly advance beyond the current understanding on the topic.</p><p>1) While the authors convincingly demonstrate that individual genetic manipulations of let-7 and nhr-23 oppositely regulate the pace of the molting cycle, it is not clear how feedback/molecular regulation between let-7 and nhr-23 regulate the pace. Further exploration of the mechanism will greatly enhance the novelty and significance of the manuscript.</p><p>a. Genetically, the authors demonstrate that reducing nhr-23 levels delay the pace of larval development/molting cycle while reducing let-7 levels accelerate the pace of larval development/molting cycle. At the molecular level, nhr-23 transcript level is oscillatory, reaching its peak level in the middle of the interval between molts and reaching its lowest level right before a molt (Kostrouchova et al., 2001; current manuscript). In nhr-23 (aaa20-deltaLCS) or let-7 mutant animals, the authors report elevated peak nhr-23 transcripts level, steeper slopes of rise and wider troughs compared to control. How do (which of) these characteristics contribute to a faster pace? Are there uncharacterized features (ie when in the cycle the peak is reached, time in between peaks, etc) that could help explain its effect on the pace? It seems that the slope of the fall is also steeper in the mutant animals compared to control. If so after quantification, how can the faster degradation of nhr-23 be explained in let-7 mutant animals?</p><p>b. More optimally, the questions raised above could be addressed by examining downstream molting-related genes. The authors examine 1 such genes (mlt-10) only in mutant animals with elevated nhr-23 levels. The authors should examine additional genes important in each phase of the molting cycle as outlined by the authors in Figure 9D in genetic manipulation of both increased/decreased nhr-23 levels. Similar examination should be done with lin-42. Together, these could provide a satisfactory answer as to the mechanism by which the pace of the developmental/molting cycle are regulated by genetic manipulation of nhr-23 and let-7. Additionally, some of these molting genes should be examined in supernumerary molts in the adult. These could further strengthen any conclusion made about these genes in the regulation of molt timing.</p><p>2) Based upon previous reports and the data presented in this manuscript, they suggest a much more complex regulation than the simple model proposed. Further experimentation and discussion are necessary in the manuscript to address these additional relevant/related regulations not incorporated in the current model.</p><p>a. Based upon previous reports (Hayes et al., 2006, Hada et al., 2010) that both nhr-23 and nhr-25 are downstream of let-7 family miRNA regulation of molts, it is important to also examine the role of nhr-25 in the study and how it fits into the model.</p><p>b. Based on a previous report (Hayes et al., 2006), nhr-23 GFP reporter without 3'UTR also showed de-repression in let-7 mutant. This suggests that regulation of nhr-23 by let-7 is not simply direct at the level of the 3'UTR. The author should consider experiments examining the effect of known downstream heterochronic regulators of let-7 (ie lin-41, lin-29 etc) on nhr-23 or at least address this point in the discussion of the proposed model.</p><p>c. In Fig3F, nhr-23 RNAi does not significantly (statistics?) dampen mature let-7 expression until L4/adult stage. Is there stage specificity in terms of nhr-23 regulation of let-7? Additionally, lin-42 (statistics?) also seems to be only significantly regulated by nhr-23 in L4 (Supp Figure 5B). Does this hold any significance? Further discussion of this should be included.</p><p>3) In some cases, there are suggestions of some conclusion but these were not explicitly demonstrated. The authors should provide more experimental evidence in these cases.</p><p>a. It is suggested that elevated/continuous cyclic expression of nhr-23 beyond the L4/YA molt is responsible for the supernumerary molts, however this correlation was not explicitly demonstrated. At the very least, the authors should take the nhr-23::GFP overexpression strain (wgIs43) and demonstrate that there is cycling of GFP signal that precedes each supernumerary molt.</p><p>b Conservation of the cross regulation between nhr-23 and let-7 is suggested by the author through bioinformatics analysis. This is optimally tested in the respective system if technical capabilities allow, but at the very least, the authors should demonstrate that these promoters/3' UTR sequences from other systems can be regulated in the predictive manner in <italic>C. elegans</italic> when transgenically expressed. Such demonstration would add to the novelty of the manuscript.</p><p>c. They authors demonstrate nhr-23 binding at the promoter of other let-7 family miRNA (mir-48, 84, 241). Are their levels regulated by nhr-23?</p><p>d. It is suggested that nhr-23 auto-regulates itself due to the presence of ROR binding site in its promoter. This should be tested by the in vivo deletion of this site via CRISPR/Cas-9 and examine the resulting nhr-23 expression.</p><p>(4) Statistics are not provided in many places in the manuscript/figures. Sometimes even error bars are not apparently in figures. Is there only a single replicate in these cases? The below is not an exhaustive list, the author should go through to make sure every numerical figures have been properly analyzed and provide detail statistical information for other figures as they have done in Supplementary Table 1: Figure 3E/F, Figure 5A, Supp Figure 3, Figure 7B, Supp Figure 5b.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Patel et al., describe a regulatory loop between a Retinoid-Related Orphan Receptor (ROR) in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, NHR-23, and the let-7 microRNA family. The authors examine lethargus and molting behavior in worms with reduced activity or increased activity of NHR-23 along with worms that have reduced activity of the let-7 family (let-7, mir-48, mir-84, and mir-241). They provide compelling evidence that NHR-23 binds to the let-7 (and other family members to a lesser degree) promoter to promote let-7 transcription and activity. Additionally, they provide evidence that let-7 then functions to act through the nhr-23 3' UTR to repress nhr-23 activity and protein accumulation. In the absence of negative regulation by let-7, nhr-23 transcript and protein levels are misregulated showing elevated levels and a temporal shift in its oscillations. In the absence of let-7 negative regulation or in the presence of overexpression nhr-23, worms show aberrant molting behavior. This is also associated with a shift in mlt-10 expression, which is known regulator of molting, and is a predicted shared target of let-7 and NHR-23. Sequence analysis suggests that this feedback mechanism may be conserved in higher organisms.</p><p>Overall, the expression data supports a model whereby the feedback loops between nhr-23, let-7, and lin-42/PER can drive the cyclic lethargus and molting behavior. The data and experimental approach are strong and rigorous. However, the authors interpretation and model go beyond what the data can directly support. There are issues throughout the manuscript with the clarity of the writing with instances of vague and confusing language and inconsistent use of terms. For example, at different points in the manuscript, the authors refer to lethargus, sleep phase, and sleep-like phase. The manuscript should be extensively revised to improve the accuracy and clarity of the writing.</p><p>1. The authors perform qRT-PCR for nhr-23 and mlt-10 transcripts at specific time points in larval development to track the oscillations in expression. While the oscillations are clear as are the changes in the dynamics/shape of the oscillations in mutant backgrounds, the calculation of amplitude and &quot;rising slope&quot; is not well supported. While such numbers seem helpful in generally describing the overall dynamics, it seems misleading to provide such seemingly precise quantification of the comparisons of expression at different time points. It appears that the data shown is from one biological replicate performed with technical duplicate data points (at least this is my interpretation of what was done as described in the figure legend). qRT-PCR is typically a very sensitive assay with a degree of variability between biological replicates. Thus, the calculated amplitude and rising slope may vary significantly between experiments. This is observed in the authors' data (Figure 5 and Supplemental Figure 3). If there are references to support such calculation of amplitude and rising slope, then these should be provided. It is my opinion that more general, qualitative descriptions of the oscillations in transcript levels would be more appropriate.</p><p>2. The description of how CCGs were identified and selected should be described more clearly (line 526). In this section, the sentences in lines 546-548 and line 550-551 are also very unclear.</p><p>3. In the Discussion, the authors describe a detailed model of sequential activation of genes involved in cuticle biogenesis and lethargus as regulated by NHR-23 and let-7. While this is a compelling model, the details, including that NHR-23 &quot;schedules&quot; the start of cuticle biogenesis and that the sequential activation is driven by the number of ROREs and the amount of NHR-23 remain quite speculative. The authors should more clearly write this section as a theoretical model. The description of NHR-23 and let-7 controlling the rate of transcript accumulation and decay along with the &quot;evidently short half-life of NHR-23 protein is not sufficiently supported by their data. The authors should also explain what is meant by the biogenesis of the 'sheath'.</p><p>4. The observations that ROREs were found upstream of let-7 genes in other organisms and that LCSs were found in other nhr-23/ROR homologs is compelling but doesn't seem sufficient to propose that this regulation is conserved in human tissues (lines 634-636).</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Feedback between a retinoid-related nuclear receptor and the <italic>let-7</italic> microRNAs controls the pace and number of molting cycles in <italic>C. elegans.</italic>&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

No further experimentation is required. You will see all the requested detailed below by the reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Patel et al. have significantly improved the manuscript over the last 2 years. They have convincingly demonstrated the cross regulation between nhr-23 and let-7 using a combination of biochemical and functional approaches. They have further strengthened their claims of a possible conservation of the let-7/nhr-23 cross regulation in other species (mouse and human) with additional experiments. However, the paper as presented currently, still contains the following major weaknesses:</p><p>(1) Many claims made in the manuscript were broad and generalized when they were only supported in specific instances or often contrary to data presented. A non-exhaustive list is included below. The authors should go through the manuscript to make sure all of their claims are specific/precise and are supported by the data presented, and adjust conclusions accordingly:</p><p>a. Line 215-216: &quot;the cohort of nhr-23(RNAi) animals that emerged as L4 entered lethargus later&quot;. This is unsupported in Figure 2B as well as Supplementary Table 1. The mean times to enter lethargy were 8.1 and 8.4 hours for control and nhr-23(RNAi) animals respectively, and are not statistically different from one another.</p><p>b. Line 225-226: &quot;delayed and protracted lethargi were associated with nhr-23 across three larval stages.&quot; According to Figure 2 and Supplementary table 3, while the time spent in lethargy was prolonged across all three stages, the delayed lethargi (time in active) was only statistically different in L3.</p><p>c. Line 319-321: &quot;the level of other members of the let-7 family, mir-48, mir-84, mir-241 were similarly reduced in nhr-23 (RNAi) larvae developing across the L3 stage.&quot; The levels of mature mir-84 and mir-241 were not significantly altered according to Figure 3 supplement 2D</p><p>d. Line 449-450: The authors claimed that nhr-23 levels in L2 peaked at higher levels in mir-48, mir-241, mir-84 triple mutant compared to wild type controls. This statement was not supported by data in Figure 6 supplement 1B/B': mir-48, mir-241, mir-84 triple mutant only exhibited higher nhr-23 level in L3 but not L2.</p><p>e. Line 556: The authors claimed similar slope of fbn-1 waveform between nhr-23 RNAi and mock-treated larvae, but this was not supported by data in Supplementary Table 3.</p><p>(2) I applaud the authors for including replication of their experiment. However, as related to point 1, the authors often claimed that the results of the second replicates supported those of the first replicates when they did not (Some specific examples included below). The authors should address this in their manuscript why these replicates yielded inconsistent results and how to interpret their conclusions in light of this.</p><p>a. As opposed to what the authors claimed in line 564-566, independent replicates of fbn-1 and mlt-10 transcripts in mock vs nhr-23 (RNAi) animals were not reproducible across all developmental stages (see Figure 8A vs Figure 8 Supplement 1A, Figure 8C vs Figure 8 F).</p><p>b. Similarly, as opposed to what the authors claimed in line 648-649, independent replicates of lin-42 transcript levels in nhr-23 (LCS deletion) and let-7(n2853) animals did not yield the same results (see Figure 9B vs Figure 9 Supplement 1C). It seems that for the second replicate, the stages were not aligned as they were in the first replicate. If they were aligned in phase as they were for the first replicate, there were be no significant difference between the three experimental groups.</p><p>(3) The mechanism by which let-7 and nhr-23 control the pacing of the molting cycle is still under-addressed in the paper. The authors have addressed this partially by some additional data (regulation of lin-42 and fbn-1) as well as discussion of additional complexities beyond let-7/nhr-23. While some aspects of the mechanisms might be outside the scope of the current manuscript and not possible to address experimentally, one key aspect that is not currently addressed in the paper is how different manipulation of let-7 and nhr-23 affects different phases of the molting cycle. As one example, nhr-23 RNAi increases time spent in lethargy but does not affect other parts of the molting cycle, while increasing nhr-23 levels (overexpression or deletion of let-7 LCS sites) decreases time spent in active cycle but does not affect time spent in lethargy. Inclusion of the discussion of these points would be important to help the readers think about the complexity of the regulation, and important to consider in future studies to understand the mechanisms by which these regulators control molting cycle pacing.</p><p>On a related note, and as alluded by Reviewer 2 previously, the authors use inconsistent terms throughout the manuscript to refer to different aspects of the molting cycle in the manuscript. Standardization of the terms throughout the manuscript would help to increase clarity.</p><p>(4) In supplementary Table 1, only statistics for comparisons to control groups were presented. It would be helpful for the readers to present statistics for comparisons between experimental groups as well.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Patel et al. present data that provide new and substantive understanding of the roles of heterochronic genes and the NHR-23 nuclear receptor transcription factor in the regulation of the temporal dynamics of molting behavior in <italic>C. elegans</italic> larval development. The findings provide a solid basis for the proposal that direct regulatory feedback between let-7 family microRNAs and nhr-23 contributes to the regulation of developmental pace. Novel findings include that NHR-23 promotes the oscillatory transcription of let-7s genes at each larval stage – likely by direct binding to their promotors – and that let-7s microRNAs inhibit NHR-23 expression via complementary LCE sequences in the nhr-23 3' UTR. Key supportive evidence includes the finding nhr-23(gf) mutations accelerate the pace of the L4, as do let-7s(lf) mutations, supporting a dosage-dependent role for NHR-23 in promoting larval stage progression, downstream of let-7s microRNAs. Intriguing evidence is presented for possible conservation in vertebrates of the mutual regulation of ROR/NHR-23 and let-7 family microRNAs.</p><p>Overall, the data robustly support novel findings that merit publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, some of the conclusions and data interpretations, as stated in the current manuscript, are not supported, and therefore revisions are recommended, according to the comments below.</p><p>(1) Lines 164-166: &quot;The cyclical expression profile of primary let-7 family transcripts is consistent with temporally reiterated, as well as stage-specific, function(s).&quot; Do the authors mean to propose here that the let-7 family primary transcripts are functional, aside from being processed into mature let-7 microRNAs? (See points #7 – #10 below).</p><p>(2) Line 215: &quot;The cohort of nhr-23(RNAi) animals that emerged as L4s entered lethargus later and remained lethargic for twice as long as the control cohort.&quot; It appears that nhr-23 RNAi animals entered L4 lethargus only very slightly later than wt. If the authors wish to argue that the length of the active phase of the larval stage is lengthened in the nhr-23(RNAi) animals, statistical analysis of the length measurements should be shown, to demonstrate significant differences.</p><p>(3) Line 248: &quot;When we combined stage-specific nhr-23(RNAi) with let-7(n2853), the altered pace of molting associated with each single mutant was partially co-suppressed (Figure 2B, C and Supplemental Table 1).&quot; I think that a simpler interpretation of the data would be co-expressed phenotypes (rather than co-suppressed). The active phase of the L4 stage (panel B) and L3 stage (panel C) of let7(lf) and let-7(lf);nhr-23(RNAi) are shorter than the wild type; this would correspond to the let-7(lf) phenotype expressed in both cases. At the same time, the lethargus is lengthened in let-7(lf);nhr-23(RNAi); which would appear to be the nhr-23(RNAi) phenotype. Co-suppression would be an apt interpretation if, in the let-7(lf);nhr-23(RNAi) animals the active phases were (statistically) significantly longer than for let-7(lf) alone, and the length of lethargus were (statistically) significantly shorter than for nhr-23(RNAi) alone (see also point #2 above).</p><p>(4) Line 265: &quot;Taken together, these longitudinal data suggest a model whereby NHR-23 accelerates the molting cycle, partly by directly activating the expression of the let-7s, and the let-7s decelerate the cycle, partly by directly repressing the expression of nhr-23.&quot; At this point in the narrative, it seems premature to propose a specific molecular model, because the data presented so far do not address mechanism. More appropriate at this stage would be a straightforward interpretation of what the phenotypes suggest about how nhr-23 and let-7 microRNAs impact the molting cycle (independent of underlying mechanism): nhr-23 activity negatively regulates the length of lethargus (and perhaps the active phase as well, pending statistical significance, see , points #2 and #3 above), and let-7 family microRNAs negatively regulate the length of the wake-to-wake interval. From the phenotypes alone, there is no reason to necessarily suggest that nhr-23 and let-7 microRNAs regulate each other. Figure 3 addresses mechanism, so this molecular model should be presented after discussion of the Figure 3 results.</p><p>(5) Line 270: &quot;Based on the findings of the longitudinal studies described above, we hypothesized that NHR-23 may directly activate transcription of let-7.&quot; The problem with this hypothesis is that it does not seem to logically follow from the longitudinal studies presented in Figure 2; nhr-23 and let-7 microRNAs seem to impact molting cycle in opposite ways (accelerating vs decelerating, respectively), so the simplest hypothesis for a regulation of let-7s by nhr-23 would be repression of let-7s by nhr-23. It would be better to propose (broadly) that let-7s and nhr-23 might mutually regulate each other, and then ask, how? The authors could suggest that the simplest expectation could be mutual negative regulation, and then when the data indicate the opposite -- that nhr-23 positively regulates let-7s – deal with the unexpected by modifying the model.</p><p>(6) Line 369: &quot;Therefore, scrambling the ROREs is sufficient to increase the speed of development, consistent with our model that NHR-23-mediated activation of the let-7s normally slows the pace of molting.&quot; Here is where the issue discussed in point #5 above, comes to a head. In this scenario, where NHR-23 is required for full expression of let-7, one would have expected the nhr-23(lf) phenotype to correspond to that of reduced let-7s – i.e., accelerated development. So, it is apparent that the wild type function of nhr-23 in accelerating the molting cycle cannot be simply via promoting expression of let-7s microRNAs (which themselves seem to decelerate the molting cycle). The authors present data regarding potential regulation of lin-42 by nhr-23, and also potential autoregulation by nhr-23, which should be brought into play in formulating a final model (see point # 10 below).</p><p>Note: Points #7, #8, and #9 below relate to problematic issues surrounding the proposal that the oscillation of let-7s microRNAs is a mechanistic component of a hypothetical oscillator driving the molting cycle. Point #10 offers comments regarding a modified model to accommodate these and other issues.</p><p>(7) Line 611: &quot;These findings suggest that partly interdependent waves in the abundance of NHR-23 and the let-7s sculpt the temporal expression profiles of fbn-1, mlt-10 and possibly many additional effectors of the molting timer.&quot; Does the model require that the mature microRNAs oscillate? At the core of the authors' model is the idea that the steepness of accumulation of NHR-23 in each stage sets the timing of the onset and completion of lethargus, and hence the pace of the molting cycle. let-7s, through their LCSs in nhr-23 mRNA, can inhibit the rate of nhr-23 accumulation in each cycle, and thereby regulate pace. let-7s mature microRNAs do not need to oscillate to perform this proposed function in shaping the NHR-23 pulse</p><p>(8) Line 732: &quot;NHR-23 transcriptionally activates let-7 and let-7 post-transcriptionally represses nhr-23 to form a molecular-genetic oscillator.&quot; Has it been shown that let-7 mature microRNA oscillates? Figure 3G suggests not. In the authors' model, is it required that mature let-7s microRNAs oscillate?</p><p>(9) Line 784: &quot;Thus, NHR-23 and let-7 form a transcriptional-post-transcriptional negative feedback loop. Within a given larval stage, NHR-23 promotes the expression of the let-7s and the let-7s repress nhr-23. The expression levels of let-7 peak ~1.6 hours after nhr-23, resulting in an intrinsic delay between the accumulation of nhr-23 and that of let-7 (Figure 3D, 3F, 6A). Across development, the let-7s dampen the relative amplitude of nhr-23 expression from one larval stage to the next (Figure 6A, Figure 6 —figure supplement 1A). Furthermore, NHR-23 autoregulates its own expression (Figure 9A, 9D-F). Together, these interconnected feedback loops set up a self-sustained molecular-genetic oscillator that is extinguished in adulthood.&quot; The problem is that mature let-7s do not seem to oscillate (e.g., Figure 3G). So, if let-7 and nhr-23 are proposed to be oscillating components of an oscillator, the functional let-7 transcript would need to be the pri-let-7s (not mature let-7s!) How would that work? Could perhaps pri-let-7 bind to nhr-23 protein and somehow influence its transcriptional regulatory activity? This would be an exceedingly interesting scenario, if true, but highly theoretical and arguably beyond the scope of the present paper. Moreover, genetic evidence suggests that the molting cycle proceeds independently of let-7-family function, as animals quadruple-mutant for mir-84, mir-48, mir-241, and let-7 still undergo multiple larval stages (Vadla et al., 2012). [BTW, it is not possible to compare Figure 3D and 3F to 6A and make an assessment of the relative timing of pri-let-7 and nhr-23 accumulation.]</p><p>(10) A graphic depiction of a revised model consistent with the data would help enormously. (The diagram in Figure 1C is not adequate, as the particular phenotypic consequences are not indicated.) Elements of the model could include the following:</p><p>(10A) Nhr-23 is oscillatory, and levels of NHR-23 matter, there being successive thresholds for initiation and completion of lethargus, respectively.</p><p>(10B) NHR-23 controls oscillatory transcription of many genes, including let-7s, and lin-42, and itself (by positive autoregulation), and could be a component of an oscillator driving molting cycles. [Current evidence does not support a role for let-7s microRNAs as clock drivers.]</p><p>(10C) let-7s microRNAs accumulate progressively across the L2-L4 stages and dampen nhr-23 expression in two ways:</p><p>(i) At each stage, repression by let-7s slows the rise of NHR-23, and hence the let-7s microRNAs exert a slowing effect on larval stage pace by affecting how rapidly NHR-23 levels cross the thresholds referred to in (A) above.</p><p>(ii) After the L4 stage, repression by let-7s puts NHR-23 levels below the threshold for initiation of molting, satisfying one of the conditions for cessation of molting (the other being expression of LIN-29.)</p><p>Other notes regarding the model:</p><p>(10D) The authors propose that the termination of molting after the L4 is a consequence of the progressive dampening of NHR-23 expression across the final larval stages. This is a plausible model, but it is incomplete, as it does not account for previous findings that lin-29 is required for cessation of molting. The authors' finding that nhr-23 LCE mutations result in apparent molting behavior of adults (Figure 7A) suggests that nhr-23 activity could be sufficient for supernumerary molting. That novel finding motivates a model wherein cessation of molting requires two conditions to be filled: upregulation of lin-29 (an indirect consequence of let-7 activity in the L4), and dampening of nhr-23 expression (also via let-7).</p><p>(10E) As the authors data suggest (e.g., Figure 8) let-7s microRNAs could be shaping the dynamics of oscillations of many genes – but not because mature let-7s microRNAs are themselves oscillating, but because, as repressors, these microRNAs can affect the relationship between mRNA dynamics and protein dynamics for their targets.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80010.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration. What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In the manuscript &quot;Feedback among a retinoid-related nuclear receptor and let-7 miRNAs controls the pace and number of molts in <italic>C. elegans</italic>&quot;, Patel et al. aim to demonstrate a feedback network between retinoid-related nuclear receptor nhr-23 and let-7 miRNA family in the control of the pace/number of molts in C.elegans. First, they perform a quantitative and detailed characterization of the molting pattern throughout development in a number of different genetic manipulations of nhr-23 and/or let-7 family miRNAs and demonstrate that they affect the length/number of the molting cycle. Then, they go on to demonstrate direct regulation between nhr-23 and let-7 family miRNAs. The authors offer too simplistic of a feedback model for something much more complex and what the data suggest (elaborated in more detail below). Much of what the authors convincingly demonstrate in this manuscript, although done in a more detailed/quantitative manner and sometimes using novel reagents, has been previously shown/implicated (Kostrouchova et al., 2001; Frand et al., 2005; Hayes et al., 2006; Celniker et al., 2009). The portion of the manuscript that could be potentially interesting and novel (the mechanisms by which nhr-23/let-7 alter molting cycle length/number, conservation of this regulation in other systems, etc), the authors offer very little insight and experimental support. In its current form, without further experiments/analysis as suggested below, this manuscript does not significantly advance beyond the current understanding on the topic.</p><p>1) While the authors convincingly demonstrate that individual genetic manipulations of let-7 and nhr-23 oppositely regulate the pace of the molting cycle, it is not clear how feedback/molecular regulation between let-7 and nhr-23 regulate the pace. Further exploration of the mechanism will greatly enhance the novelty and significance of the manuscript.</p><p>a. Genetically, the authors demonstrate that reducing nhr-23 levels delay the pace of larval development/molting cycle while reducing let-7 levels accelerate the pace of larval development/molting cycle. At the molecular level, nhr-23 transcript level is oscillatory, reaching its peak level in the middle of the interval between molts and reaching its lowest level right before a molt (Kostrouchova et al., 2001; current manuscript). In nhr-23 (aaa20-deltaLCS) or let-7 mutant animals, the authors report elevated peak nhr-23 transcripts level, steeper slopes of rise and wider troughs compared to control. How do (which of) these characteristics contribute to a faster pace? Are there uncharacterized features (ie when in the cycle the peak is reached, time in between peaks, etc) that could help explain its effect on the pace?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer brings up an interesting point. The amplitudes, rising slopes and peak values of the <italic>nhr-23</italic> waveforms in <italic>nhr-23(aaa20)</italic> and <italic>let-7(n2853)</italic> mutants are consistently higher across the two stages that are sped up and across both replicates, relative to wild-type animals. To determine which aspects of the <italic>nhr-23</italic> curve is responsible for the faster pace of development of <italic>nhr-23(aaa20)</italic> and <italic>let-7(n2853)</italic> mutants, relative to wild type, we would have to develop a system wherein we could alter one parameter (e.g. amplitude) without changing the other two parameters. Such a system is beyond the scope of the current manuscript and has yet to be developed even in the much more mature field of chronobiology. Moreover, our approach is consistent with approaches used in the field of chronobiology. Studies of the role of core clock genes on rhythms such as sleep-wake and feeding-fasting cycles are routinely conducted by knockdown or deletion of individual genes or <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements and documentation of ensuing behaviors (For example, Brown et al., 2005; Konopka and Benzer, 1971; Zheng et al., 1999).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It seems that the slope of the fall is also steeper in the mutant animals compared to control. If so after quantification, how can the faster degradation of nhr-23 be explained in let-7 mutant animals?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. As suggested, we have now quantified the slope of decay of <italic>nhr-23</italic> transcripts. The slope of decay of <italic>nhr-23</italic> transcripts is consistently higher in <italic>let-7(n2853)</italic> mutants than wild type, across both life stages and both biological replicates (p&lt;0.05, one tailed paired t test) (Supplemental Table 3). However, the trend is not clear in <italic>nhr-23(aaa20)</italic> mutants, relative to wild type. The faster decay of <italic>nhr-23</italic> transcripts in <italic>let-7(n2853)</italic> mutants suggests that a different LCS independent mechanism regulates <italic>nhr-23</italic> levels. A different target of <italic>let-7, ­</italic>like <italic>nhr-25</italic> or <italic>lin-42,</italic> may also drive expression and maintain levels of <italic>nhr-23</italic>. Thus, we suggest that the negative side of the feedback loop in this paper prevents faster rise or higher expression of <italic>nhr-23</italic> in the next life stage, rather than the rate of decay in the current life stage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. More optimally, the questions raised above could be addressed by examining downstream molting-related genes. The authors examine 1 such genes (mlt-10) only in mutant animals with elevated nhr-23 levels. The authors should examine additional genes important in each phase of the molting cycle as outlined by the authors in Figure 9D in genetic manipulation of both increased/decreased nhr-23 levels. Similar examination should be done with lin-42. Together, these could provide a satisfactory answer as to the mechanism by which the pace of the developmental/molting cycle are regulated by genetic manipulation of nhr-23 and let-7. Additionally, some of these molting genes should be examined in supernumerary molts in the adult. These could further strengthen any conclusion made about these genes in the regulation of molt timing.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and thank the reviewer for these comments. We have now measured the levels of <italic>fbn-1</italic> (Figure 8B and Figure 8 —figure supplement 1A) and <italic>lin-42</italic> (Figure 9C and Figure 9 —figure supplement 1C) transcripts in <italic>nhr-23(aaa20)</italic> and <italic>let-7(n2853)</italic> mutants and age-matched wild-type animals. We have also measured the levels of the same transcripts in <italic>nhr-23(RNAi)</italic> and mock-treated animals (Figure 8A, Figure 9B). We tried to measure the levels of <italic>osm-11</italic> by Taqman RT-qPCR, but we did not detect cyclical expression of <italic>osm-11</italic> as has been reported in past RNA-Seq data sets. This may be because <italic>osm-11</italic> is expressed at relatively low levels and the assay is not sensitive enough to detect the variations. Additionally, we have revised our manuscript to remove what used to be Figure 9D, since we have little data to support the model at this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Based upon previous reports and the data presented in this manuscript, they suggest a much more complex regulation than the simple model proposed. Further experimentation and discussion are necessary in the manuscript to address these additional relevant/related regulations not incorporated in the current model.</p><p>a. Based upon previous reports (Hayes et al., 2006, Hada et al., 2010) that both nhr-23 and nhr-25 are downstream of let-7 family miRNA regulation of molts, it is important to also examine the role of nhr-25 in the study and how it fits into the model.</p></disp-quote><p>While both <italic>nhr-23</italic> and <italic>nhr-25</italic> regulate the molting cycle, we chose to investigate the interaction between NHR-23 and <italic>let-7</italic> in great detail. However, to answer the reviewer’s question, there is no binding peak (Celniker et al., 2009) or consensus binding site for NHR-25/FTF (TCAAGGTCA) (Galarneau et al., 1996) in the minimal promoter element of <italic>let-7</italic>. Therefore, it is unlikely that NHR-25 binds upstream of <italic>let-7</italic>. There are 3 NHR-25 binding peaks upstream of <italic>nhr-23</italic> (Celniker et al., 2009)<italic>,</italic> but only one peak contains a single NHR-25/FTF consensus binding site. NHR-25, could therefore, have some role in activating <italic>nhr-23</italic> gene expression.</p><p>As per our analysis in Figure 8 and Supplemental Table 4, <italic>nhr-25</italic> may be a shared target of NHR-23 and <italic>let-7</italic> microRNAs. The promoter of <italic>nhr-25</italic> has 3 RORE sites (Supplemental Table 4) and is enriched in the modENCODE NHR-23 ChIP-seq (Celniker et al., 2009). The 3’ UTR of <italic>nhr-25</italic> harbors a LCS in its 3’UTR and is sensitive to levels of <italic>let-7</italic> (Hayes et al., 2006)<italic>.</italic> We have included a new discussion of the above in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Based on a previous report (Hayes et al., 2006), nhr-23 GFP reporter without 3'UTR also showed de-repression in let-7 mutant. This suggests that regulation of nhr-23 by let-7 is not simply direct at the level of the 3'UTR. The author should consider experiments examining the effect of known downstream heterochronic regulators of let-7 (ie lin-41, lin-29 etc) on nhr-23 or at least address this point in the discussion of the proposed model.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up this point. In the Results section of the previous submission, we had mentioned that the <italic>wgIs43[nhr-23::GFP]</italic> reporter that we use includes the <italic>nhr-23</italic> 3’ UTR, unlike the reporter used in Hayes <italic>et al.,</italic> 2006. In this submission, we have included a new paragraph in the Discussion section elaborating on both the 3’ UTR dependent and 3’ UTR independent regulation of <italic>nhr-23</italic> by <italic>let-7</italic>. Notably, as shown in Figure 6A and Figure 6 —figure supplement 1A, the levels of <italic>nhr-23</italic> at adulthood in <italic>let-7(n2853)</italic> is more elevated than in <italic>nhr-23(aaa20-∆LCS).</italic> This suggests that <italic>let-7</italic> may be regulating <italic>nhr-23</italic> by more than one pathway. <italic>let-7</italic> represses the expression of the RNA binding protein <italic>lin-41,</italic> and this promotes the translation of the LIN-41 target, <italic>lin-29</italic> (Reinhart et al., 2000; Slack et al., 2000)<italic>. nhr-23</italic> expression is elevated in <italic>lin-29</italic> adults and it has been suggested that LIN-29 represses the transcription of <italic>nhr-23</italic> (Harris and Horvitz, 2011). Therefore, the LIN-29 mediated repression of <italic>nhr-23</italic> could represent the 3’ UTR independent mechanism by which <italic>let-7</italic> regulates <italic>nhr-23</italic>. However, the elucidation of these additional pathways are beyond the scope of this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. In Fig3F, nhr-23 RNAi does not significantly (statistics?) dampen mature let-7 expression until L4/adult stage. Is there stage specificity in terms of nhr-23 regulation of let-7? Additionally, lin-42 (statistics?) also seems to be only significantly regulated by nhr-23 in L4 (Supp Figure 5B). Does this hold any significance? Further discussion of this should be included.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer for this observation. We now provide evidence that <italic>nhr-23(RNAi)</italic> is associated with significantly lower levels of mature <italic>let-7</italic> in both the L3 and L4 stages, i.e., in all stages that mature <italic>let-7</italic> is detectable (Figure 3D-G). We also show evidence that <italic>lin-42</italic> is significantly downregulated in <italic>nhr-23(RNAi)</italic> L3 and L4 stage larvae, relative to mock-treated animals (Figure 9B and Figure 9 —figure supplement 1C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In some cases, there are suggestions of some conclusion but these were not explicitly demonstrated. The authors should provide more experimental evidence in these cases.</p><p>a. It is suggested that elevated/continuous cyclic expression of nhr-23 beyond the L4/YA molt is responsible for the supernumerary molts, however this correlation was not explicitly demonstrated. At the very least, the authors should take the nhr-23::GFP overexpression strain (wgIs43) and demonstrate that there is cycling of GFP signal that precedes each supernumerary molt.</p></disp-quote><p>We show the following data in support of the hypothesis that continued expression of <italic>nhr-23</italic> is associated with supernumerary molts: (1) We have found evidence that <italic>nhr-23</italic> transcripts peak again in <italic>nhr-23(aaa20-∆LCS)</italic> adults, but not in wild-type adults (Figure 6A). (2) We show that <italic>nhr-23(aaa20-∆LCS)</italic> adults go through extra molts (Figure 7C). We did not track the expression of NHR-23::GFP in <italic>nhr-23(wgIs43)</italic> as it is hard to predict exactly when adults undergo supernumerary molts and this makes reproducible meaningful comparisons very challenging. Additionally, as mutants that undergo aberrant supernumerary molts die, analysis of cycling of NHR-23::GFP is not feasible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b Conservation of the cross regulation between nhr-23 and let-7 is suggested by the author through bioinformatics analysis. This is optimally tested in the respective system if technical capabilities allow, but at the very least, the authors should demonstrate that these promoters/3' UTR sequences from other systems can be regulated in the predictive manner in <italic>C. elegans</italic> when transgenically expressed. Such demonstration would add to the novelty of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We have added new data to show potential conservation of the cross regulation. Specifically, we use heterologous expression systems to show that the <italic>M. musculus</italic> let-7a promoter is downregulated in <italic>nhr-23(RNAi)</italic> larvae, relative to control larvae. Additionally, we show that fragments of the 3' UTRs of <italic>H. sapiens RORB</italic> and <italic>M. musculus</italic> RORA to downregulate the expression of TdTomato in the bicistronic reporter system, in an LCS-dependent manner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. They authors demonstrate nhr-23 binding at the promoter of other let-7 family miRNA (mir-48, 84, 241). Are their levels regulated by nhr-23?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We performed RT-qPCR to measure the levels of the primary transcripts of <italic>mir-48, mir-84</italic> and <italic>mir-241</italic> (Figure 3 —figure supplement 2C) during the L3 stage in control and <italic>nhr-23(RNAi)</italic> animals. As expected, the levels of <italic>pri-mir-48, pri-mir-84</italic> and <italic>pri-mir-241</italic> exhibit one peak during the L3 stage in the control sample. The peak for all 3 microRNAs were attenuated in the <italic>nhr-23(RNAi)</italic> sample, suggesting that NHR-23 promotes transcription of <italic>pri-mir-48, pri-mir-84</italic> and <italic>pri-mir-241</italic>. We also measured the levels of mature <italic>mir-48, mir-84</italic> and <italic>mir-241</italic> during the same stage (Figure 3 —figure supplement 2D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d. It is suggested that nhr-23 auto-regulates itself due to the presence of ROR binding site in its promoter. This should be tested by the in vivo deletion of this site via CRISPR/Cas-9 and examine the resulting nhr-23 expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that experimental evidence for the autoregulation of <italic>nhr-23</italic> was required. However, the in vivo deletion of the 8 RORE sites upstream of <italic>nhr-23</italic> (Figure 9 —figure supplement 1C) by CRISPR/Cas9 is experimentally challenging. Therefore, we devised two alternate strategies to test the autoregulation of <italic>nhr-23</italic>. We performed ChIP-qPCR during L3 and validated that the <italic>nhr-23</italic> promoter was enriched in NHR-23::3xFLAG IPs (Figure 9A). We also measured the fluorescence in the hyp and seam cell nuclei of transgenic <italic>nhr-23::gfp::unc-54 3’ UTR</italic> reporter line in control and <italic>nhr-23(RNAi)</italic> conditions (Figure 9D-F). The <italic>nhr-23::gfp::unc-54 3’ UTR</italic> reporter does not contain the last two and half exons of endogenous <italic>nhr-23,</italic> and hence should be unresponsive to the RNAi clone. The NHR-23::GFP fluorescence was reduced in both hyp and seam cell nuclei under <italic>nhr-23</italic> RNAi conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Statistics are not provided in many places in the manuscript/figures. Sometimes even error bars are not apparently in figures. Is there only a single replicate in these cases? The below is not an exhaustive list, the author should go through to make sure every numerical figures have been properly analyzed and provide detail statistical information for other figures as they have done in Supplementary Table 1: Figure 3E/F, Figure 5A, Supp Figure 3, Figure 7B, Supp Figure 5b.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this reviewer for pointing this out. We now provide statistics for all pairwise or multiple comparisons that were performed in our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In this manuscript, Patel et al., describe a regulatory loop between a Retinoid-Related Orphan Receptor (ROR) in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, NHR-23, and the let-7 microRNA family. The authors examine lethargus and molting behavior in worms with reduced activity or increased activity of NHR-23 along with worms that have reduced activity of the let-7 family (let-7, mir-48, mir-84, and mir-241). They provide compelling evidence that NHR-23 binds to the let-7 (and other family members to a lesser degree) promoter to promote let-7 transcription and activity. Additionally, they provide evidence that let-7 then functions to act through the nhr-23 3' UTR to repress nhr-23 activity and protein accumulation. In the absence of negative regulation by let-7, nhr-23 transcript and protein levels are misregulated showing elevated levels and a temporal shift in its oscillations. In the absence of let-7 negative regulation or in the presence of overexpression nhr-23, worms show aberrant molting behavior. This is also associated with a shift in mlt-10 expression, which is known regulator of molting, and is a predicted shared target of let-7 and NHR-23. Sequence analysis suggests that this feedback mechanism may be conserved in higher organisms.</p><p>Overall, the expression data supports a model whereby the feedback loops between nhr-23, let-7, and lin-42/PER can drive the cyclic lethargus and molting behavior. The data and experimental approach are strong and rigorous. However, the authors interpretation and model go beyond what the data can directly support. There are issues throughout the manuscript with the clarity of the writing with instances of vague and confusing language and inconsistent use of terms. For example, at different points in the manuscript, the authors refer to lethargus, sleep phase, and sleep-like phase. The manuscript should be extensively revised to improve the accuracy and clarity of the writing.</p><p>1. The authors perform qRT-PCR for nhr-23 and mlt-10 transcripts at specific time points in larval development to track the oscillations in expression. While the oscillations are clear as are the changes in the dynamics/shape of the oscillations in mutant backgrounds, the calculation of amplitude and &quot;rising slope&quot; is not well supported. While such numbers seem helpful in generally describing the overall dynamics, it seems misleading to provide such seemingly precise quantification of the comparisons of expression at different time points. It appears that the data shown is from one biological replicate performed with technical duplicate data points (at least this is my interpretation of what was done as described in the figure legend). qRT-PCR is typically a very sensitive assay with a degree of variability between biological replicates. Thus, the calculated amplitude and rising slope may vary significantly between experiments. This is observed in the authors' data (Figure 5 and Supplemental Figure 3). If there are references to support such calculation of amplitude and rising slope, then these should be provided. It is my opinion that more general, qualitative descriptions of the oscillations in transcript levels would be more appropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>Studying oscillatory gene expression systems that regulate developmental rhythms poses a great challenge. We have shown that genetic manipulations of <italic>let-7</italic> and <italic>nhr-23</italic> change the pace of development. While RT-qPCR provides enough sensitivity to detect the differences in the levels of gene expression, comparing the values across genotypes in a meaningful way is not trivial (Tsiairis and Großhans, 2021). Metacycle allows us to calculate the following metrics that are directly comparable: slopes of accumulation and decay, peak values, amplitude, and phase of expression of the transcripts in each life stage. Such metrics are routinely calculated in studies of biological oscillators and associated rhythms and thus, we include them in the paper (Novák and Tyson, 2008). We have also edited the Results sections to include qualitative descriptions, as suggested by the reviewer.</p><p>In the RT-qPCR charts shown in Figures 6, 8 and 9, the symbols and error bars represent the mean and range from three technical replicates in one biological replicate. The related figure supplements show similar charts for an independent biological replicate. These details are described in the associated figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The description of how CCGs were identified and selected should be described more clearly (line 526). In this section, the sentences in lines 546-548 and line 550-551 are also very unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment, and we have made appropriate changes to the above mentioned sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In the Discussion, the authors describe a detailed model of sequential activation of genes involved in cuticle biogenesis and lethargus as regulated by NHR-23 and let-7. While this is a compelling model, the details, including that NHR-23 &quot;schedules&quot; the start of cuticle biogenesis and that the sequential activation is driven by the number of ROREs and the amount of NHR-23 remain quite speculative. The authors should more clearly write this section as a theoretical model. The description of NHR-23 and let-7 controlling the rate of transcript accumulation and decay along with the &quot;evidently short half-life of NHR-23 protein is not sufficiently supported by their data. The authors should also explain what is meant by the biogenesis of the 'sheath'.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We have updated the manuscript with a description of the sheath. We have also revised the Discussion section to more clearly state that the current model is theoretical and have called out sections of the model that are supported by data in this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The observations that ROREs were found upstream of let-7 genes in other organisms and that LCSs were found in other nhr-23/ROR homologs is compelling but doesn't seem sufficient to propose that this regulation is conserved in human tissues (lines 634-636).</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we now show in Figure 10 that the GFP reporter driven by the <italic>M. musculus</italic> let-7a promoter is downregulated in <italic>nhr-23(RNAi)</italic> larvae, relative to control larvae. Additionally, we now show that fragments of the 3' UTRs of <italic>H. sapiens RORB</italic> and <italic>M. musculus</italic> RORA downregulate the expression of TdTomato in the bicistronic reporter system, in an LCS-dependent manner. This strengthens the argument that the feedback loop may be conserved in mammals.</p><p>References:</p><p>Brown, S.A., Ripperger, J., Kadener, S., Fleury-Olela, F., Vilbois, F., Rosbash, M., and Schibler, U.

The mean times to enter lethargy were 8.1 and 8.4 hours for control and nhr-23(RNAi) animals respectively, and are not statistically different from one another.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and have made appropriate changes to the text. The relatively delayed entry of the <italic>nhr-23(RNAi)</italic> cohort, as compared with the control cohort, is more obvious when comparing the times that individual worms within each cohort entered lethargus, rather than comparing the average time differences between the active intervals of <italic>nhr-23(RNAi)</italic> and wild-type larvae. Thus, we now more precisely state these results as follows in the text:</p><p>“Approximately 50% (8 out 17 animals) of the cohort of <italic>nhr-23(RNAi)</italic> animals entered lethargus 9–10 h after emerging as L4s as compared with 19% of the control cohort (3 out of 16 animals). Strikingly, the cohort of <italic>nhr-23(RNAi)</italic> animals remained lethargic for twice as long as the control cohort.” (lines 222-225)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Line 225-226: &quot;delayed and protracted lethargi were associated with nhr-23 across three larval stages.&quot; According to Figure 2 and Supplementary table 3, while the time spent in lethargy was prolonged across all three stages, the delayed lethargi (time in active) was only statistically different in L3.</p></disp-quote><p>We have also changed the concluding remarks in this section to emphasize the protracted lethargus and de-emphasize the delay in lethargus. However, we would like to point out again that, although the differences in the mean times to enter lethargy are not significantly different between the <italic>nhr-23(RNAi)</italic> and control cohorts for stages besides the L3 stage, we did observe differences when comparing the proportion of individual larvae that enter lethargus at a particular time (see response to comment 1a above). Accordingly, we have modified the text to read as follows:</p><p>“Thus, <italic>nhr-23(RNAi)</italic> animals developing through three larval stages entered lethargus slightly later and remained lethargic for much longer than wild-type animals.” (lines 233-235)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. Line 319-321: &quot;the level of other members of the let-7 family, mir-48, mir-84, mir-241 were similarly reduced in nhr-23 (RNAi) larvae developing across the L3 stage.&quot; The levels of mature mir-84 and mir-241 were not significantly altered according to Figure 3 supplement 2D</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We have made textual changes (line 343) to emphasize that only the primary transcripts of miR-48, miR-84 and miR-241 were significantly reduced in the developing <italic>nhr-23(RNAi)</italic> larvae. However, the observation that mature levels of miR-48, miR-84 and miR-241 did not show significant change, despite changes in primary transcript levels, is accurate and may be explained by the precedent that only a fraction of primary and precursor <italic>let-7</italic> is processed to form mature <italic>let-7</italic> (Bracht et al., 2004). Similarly, it is possible that the reduced levels of primary miR-48, miR-84 and miR-241 under <italic>nhr-23(RNAi)</italic> conditions is still sufficient to produce wild type levels of mature microRNAs<italic>.</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d.

However, as related to point 1, the authors often claimed that the results of the second replicates supported those of the first replicates when they did not (Some specific examples included below). The authors should address this in their manuscript why these replicates yielded inconsistent results and how to interpret their conclusions in light of this.</p><p>a. As opposed to what the authors claimed in line 564-566, independent replicates of fbn-1 and mlt-10 transcripts in mock vs nhr-23 (RNAi) animals were not reproducible across all developmental stages (see Figure 8A vs Figure 8 Supplement 1A, Figure 8C vs Figure 8 F).</p></disp-quote><p>The charts showing the levels of <italic>fbn-1</italic> and <italic>mlt-10</italic> transcripts in <italic>nhr-23(RNAi)</italic> and mock-treated animals (Figures 8A and 8C) include data from two independent replicates. The dots and error bars represent the mean and range from two biological replicates.</p><p>If the reviewer is referring to the independent replicates of <italic>fbn-1</italic> and <italic>mlt-10</italic> transcripts in wild type, <italic>let-7(n2853)</italic> and <italic>nhr-23(aaa20)</italic> mutants (Figure 8B vs Figure 8 Supplement 1A and Figure 8C vs Figure 8 Supplement 1B), then we have changed the text to be precise about the metrics that were reproducible in both stages and both biological replicates. Specifically, we now refer to the time at which the peak values of <italic>fbn-1</italic> expression and <italic>mlt-10</italic> expression were reached in the respective strains. While the value for the phase of gene expression calculated by Metacycle (Supplemental Table 3) may not have been the same across biological replicates, the trends remain the same. Accordingly the text now reads as follows:</p><p>“Peak values of <italic>fbn-1</italic> expression were detected slightly earlier in both <italic>nhr-23(∆LCS)</italic> and <italic>let-7(n2853)</italic> mutants developing through the L4 stage, relative to control animals (Figure 8B); this finding was replicated in a second, independent trial (Figure 8 —figure supplement 1A).” (lines 592-595)</p><p>“Again, peaks in <italic>mlt-10</italic> expression were detected slightly earlier during the L4 stage, in both mutants relative to wild-type animals, in two independent trials (Figure 8D and Figure 8 —figure supplement 1B).” (lines 603-605)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Similarly, as opposed to what the authors claimed in line 648-649, independent replicates of lin-42 transcript levels in nhr-23 (LCS deletion) and let-7(n2853) animals did not yield the same results (see Figure 9B vs Figure 9 Supplement 1C). It seems that for the second replicate, the stages were not aligned as they were in the first replicate. If they were aligned in phase as they were for the first replicate, there were be no significant difference between the three experimental groups.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now specifically stated the differences that were observed in both biological replicates in the text. Additionally, we made an error in the placement of the box indicating the L3-to-L4 and L4-to-Adult lethargi for the wild-type samples in the second biological replicate (in Figure 9 Supplement 1C). We have fixed the error and it can now be seen that the developmental stages of the different genotypes are aligned. Regardless, as above, we are now more specific about the metrics that are reproducible across biological replicates. We also emphasize the time at which the peak value of gene expression is achieved, rather than looking at the absolute value of the phase calculated by Metacycle. The text has been changed as follows:</p><p>“The peak levels of <italic>lin-42</italic> expression were 1.5-fold higher in both <italic>let-7(n2853)</italic> and <italic>nhr-23(∆LCS)</italic> mutants, in the L3 stage, relative to the age-matched control animals (Figure 9C). We also detected earlier peaks in <italic>lin-42</italic> expression in both <italic>nhr­-23(∆LCS)</italic> and <italic>let-7(n2853)</italic> mutants developing through the L4 stage, across two independent replicates (Figure 9C, Figure 9 —figure supplement 1C, Supplemental Table 3).” (lines 674-679)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The mechanism by which let-7 and nhr-23 control the pacing of the molting cycle is still under-addressed in the paper. The authors have addressed this partially by some additional data (regulation of lin-42 and fbn-1) as well as discussion of additional complexities beyond let-7/nhr-23. While some aspects of the mechanisms might be outside the scope of the current manuscript and not possible to address experimentally, one key aspect that is not currently addressed in the paper is how different manipulation of let-7 and nhr-23 affects different phases of the molting cycle. As one example, nhr-23 RNAi increases time spent in lethargy but does not affect other parts of the molting cycle, while increasing nhr-23 levels (overexpression or deletion of let-7 LCS sites) decreases time spent in active cycle but does not affect time spent in lethargy. Inclusion of the discussion of these points would be important to help the readers think about the complexity of the regulation, and important to consider in future studies to understand the mechanisms by which these regulators control molting cycle pacing.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. However, <italic>nhr-23(RNAi)</italic> and <italic>let-7</italic> mutations do alter the time spent in the active and lethargic intervals, respectively. As stated earlier in our responses to comments 1a and 1b, the prolonged active interval of <italic>nhr-23(RNAi)</italic> larvae in the L4 stage is more obvious when comparing the time that individual <italic>nhr-23(RNAi)</italic> and mock-treated larvae entered the L4-to-Adult lethargus (Figure 2A and lines 222-225). The average active interval of the L3 stage <italic>nhr-23(RNAi)</italic> cohort is significantly longer than the mock-treated cohort (Supplemental Table 1). The average time that <italic>let-7(n2853)</italic> mutants spend in the L4 lethargus is significantly lower than wild type (Supplemental Table 1). Additionally, 72% of <italic>let-7(n2853)</italic> spent only 1 h in the L3-to-L4 lethargus, as opposed to 40% of the control cohort (Figure 2C). Importantly, these phenotypes were mutually suppressed in the <italic>nhr-23(RNAi) let-7(n2853)</italic> double mutant (Figure 2B and 2C and lines 252-272). Our new figure (Figure 11) and lines 835-873 in the Discussion section both summarize our current model of the mechanism by which <italic>nhr-23</italic> and the <italic>let-7s</italic> control the speed of the molting cycle. As suggested by the reviewer, we have also included the following section section describing future experiments that could address the mechanism by which NHR-23 and let-7s regulate specific aspects of the molting cycle:</p><p>“Future experiments such as comprehensive analysis of new RNA-seq datasets generated from <italic>nhr-23(∆LCS)</italic>, <italic>let-7(scRORE)</italic>, and <italic>let-7</italic> family mutants employing the bioinformatic strategies presented in this study would be exciting, as it would allow for the identification of specific clock-controlled genes that drive the transitions between different phases of molting among the ~3700 genes that cycle in expression throughout larval development (Hendriks et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2013; Meeuse et al., 2020).” (lines 878-883).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On a related note, and as alluded by Reviewer 2 previously, the authors use inconsistent terms throughout the manuscript to refer to different aspects of the molting cycle in the manuscript.

authors):</p><p>Patel et al. present data that provide new and substantive understanding of the roles of heterochronic genes and the NHR-23 nuclear receptor transcription factor in the regulation of the temporal dynamics of molting behavior in <italic>C. elegans</italic> larval development. The findings provide a solid basis for the proposal that direct regulatory feedback between let-7 family microRNAs and nhr-23 contributes to the regulation of developmental pace. Novel findings include that NHR-23 promotes the oscillatory transcription of let-7s genes at each larval stage – likely by direct binding to their promotors – and that let-7s microRNAs inhibit NHR-23 expression via complementary LCE sequences in the nhr-23 3' UTR. Key supportive evidence includes the finding nhr-23(gf) mutations accelerate the pace of the L4, as do let-7s(lf) mutations, supporting a dosage-dependent role for NHR-23 in promoting larval stage progression, downstream of let-7s microRNAs. Intriguing evidence is presented for possible conservation in vertebrates of the mutual regulation of ROR/NHR-23 and let-7 family microRNAs.</p><p>Overall, the data robustly support novel findings that merit publication in eLife. However, some of the conclusions and data interpretations, as stated in the current manuscript, are not supported, and therefore revisions are recommended, according to the comments below.</p><p>1) Lines 164-166: &quot;The cyclical expression profile of primary let-7 family transcripts is consistent with temporally reiterated, as well as stage-specific, function(s).&quot; Do the authors mean to propose here that the let-7 family primary transcripts are functional, aside from being processed into mature let-7 microRNAs? (See points #7 – #10 below).</p></disp-quote><p>We did mean to suggest that primary <italic>let-7</italic> transcripts might have a function besides being processed into mature microRNAs.

If the authors wish to argue that the length of the active phase of the larval stage is lengthened in the nhr-23(RNAi) animals, statistical analysis of the length measurements should be shown, to demonstrate significant differences.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. As stated in our response to Reviewer #3 comment 1a, the relatively delayed entry of the <italic>nhr-23(RNAi)</italic> cohort, as compared with the control cohort, is more obvious when comparing the times that individual worms of each cohort entered lethargus, rather than comparing the average time differences between the active intervals of <italic>nhr-23(RNAi)</italic> and wild-type larvae (lines 222-225).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Line 248: &quot;When we combined stage-specific nhr-23(RNAi) with let-7(n2853), the altered pace of molting associated with each single mutant was partially co-suppressed (Figure 2B, C and Supplemental Table 1).&quot; I think that a simpler interpretation of the data would be co-expressed phenotypes (rather than co-suppressed). The active phase of the L4 stage (panel B) and L3 stage (panel C) of let7(lf) and let-7(lf);nhr-23(RNAi) are shorter than the wild type; this would correspond to the let-7(lf) phenotype expressed in both cases. At the same time, the lethargus is lengthened in let-7(lf);nhr-23(RNAi); which would appear to be the nhr-23(RNAi) phenotype. Co-suppression would be an apt interpretation if, in the let-7(lf);nhr-23(RNAi) animals the active phases were (statistically) significantly longer than for let-7(lf) alone, and the length of lethargus were (statistically) significantly shorter than for nhr-23(RNAi) alone (see also point #2 above).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment and agree that “cosuppression” is not the appropriate term. We now simply state that the phenotypes of single mutants are suppressed in the <italic>let-7(lf);nhr-23(RNAi)</italic> double mutant.</p><p>Additionally, some of the behavioral phenotypes, as well as their suppression in the double mutant, become more obvious when comparing the times that individual worms of each cohort entered and exited lethargus, rather than comparing the average active and lethargic intervals. As stated in our response above to Reviewer #3, comment 3, <italic>nhr-23(RNAi)</italic> and <italic>let-7</italic> mutations alter the time spent in the active and lethargic intervals, respectively. The prolonged active interval of <italic>nhr-23(RNAi)</italic> larvae in the L4 stage is more obvious when comparing the time that individual <italic>nhr-23(RNAi)</italic> and mock-treated larvae entered the L4-to-adult lethargus (lines 222-225). Also, the average active interval of the L3 stage <italic>nhr-23(RNAi)</italic> cohort is significantly longer than the mock-treated cohort (Supplemental Table 1). Similarly, the average time that <italic>let-7(n2853)</italic> mutants spend in the L4 lethargus is significantly lower than wild type (Supplemental Table 1). Furthermore, 72% of <italic>let-7(n2853)</italic> spent only 1 h in the L3-to-L4 lethargus, as opposed to 40% of the control cohort (Figure 2C).

More appropriate at this stage would be a straightforward interpretation of what the phenotypes suggest about how nhr-23 and let-7 microRNAs impact the molting cycle (independent of underlying mechanism): nhr-23 activity negatively regulates the length of lethargus (and perhaps the active phase as well, pending statistical significance, see , points #2 and #3 above), and let-7 family microRNAs negatively regulate the length of the wake-to-wake interval. From the phenotypes alone, there is no reason to necessarily suggest that nhr-23 and let-7 microRNAs regulate each other. Figure 3 addresses mechanism, so this molecular model should be presented after discussion of the Figure 3 results.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and we have made textual edits to present the logic of our conclusions (lines 280-284).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Line 270: &quot;Based on the findings of the longitudinal studies described above, we hypothesized that NHR-23 may directly activate transcription of let-7.&quot; The problem with this hypothesis is that it does not seem to logically follow from the longitudinal studies presented in Figure 2; nhr-23 and let-7 microRNAs seem to impact molting cycle in opposite ways (accelerating vs decelerating, respectively), so the simplest hypothesis for a regulation of let-7s by nhr-23 would be repression of let-7s by nhr-23. It would be better to propose (broadly) that let-7s and nhr-23 might mutually regulate each other, and then ask, how? The authors could suggest that the simplest expectation could be mutual negative regulation, and then when the data indicate the opposite -- that nhr-23 positively regulates let-7s – deal with the unexpected by modifying the model.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment.

In this scenario, where NHR-23 is required for full expression of let-7, one would have expected the nhr-23(lf) phenotype to correspond to that of reduced let-7s – i.e., accelerated development. So, it is apparent that the wild type function of nhr-23 in accelerating the molting cycle cannot be simply via promoting expression of let-7s microRNAs (which themselves seem to decelerate the molting cycle). The authors present data regarding potential regulation of lin-42 by nhr-23, and also potential autoregulation by nhr-23, which should be brought into play in formulating a final model (see point # 10 below).</p><p>Note: Points #7, #8, and #9 below relate to problematic issues surrounding the proposal that the oscillation of let-7s microRNAs is a mechanistic component of a hypothetical oscillator driving the molting cycle. Point #10 offers comments regarding a modified model to accommodate these and other issues.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the thorough analysis of our model of how NHR-23 and <italic>let-7s</italic> regulate the pace of the molting cycle. We visualize the effect of NHR-23 and <italic>let-7s</italic> on the speed of the molting cycle, keeping in mind that the two molecules act in a feedback loop, rather than in a linear genetic pathway. Additionally, both molecules likely regulate several shared target genes in opposing ways; many shared target genes are probably linked to the molting cycle. Thus, although the levels of <italic>let-7</italic> transcripts would be lower in <italic>nhr-23(RNAi)</italic> animals, so would the levels of several shared target genes because of the decrease in the levels of the transcriptional activator, NHR-23. As such, several processes associated with molting (lethargus, cuticle remodeling, arousal, and ecdysis) are either delayed or might not occur.</p><p>On the other hand, in <italic>let-7(n2853)</italic> mutants, the expression of <italic>nhr-23</italic> and shared target genes would be higher than wild-type, possibly because of both increased levels of the NHR-23 transcriptional activator and decreased levels of the <italic>let-7</italic> repressor. As such, the molting cycle is accelerated in <italic>let-7(n2853)</italic> mutants relative to wild-type animals. When <italic>nhr-23(RNAi)</italic> is combined <italic>let-7(n2853)</italic>, one would predict that the expression of <italic>nhr-23</italic> would be lower than in <italic>let-7(n2853)</italic> mutants, but higher than in <italic>nhr-23(RNAi)</italic> single mutants (because of absence of the repressor <italic>let-7</italic>) and as such the expression of shared target genes would also be at an intermediate level between the two single mutants. The pace of the molting cycle of the <italic>nhr-23(RNAi) let-7(n2853)</italic> double mutants would be somewhere in between each single mutant.</p><p>We also thank the reviewer for the suggestion to incorporate our data on the regulation of <italic>lin-42</italic> by NHR-23 and <italic>let-7s</italic>, as well as the autoregulation of NHR-23 into the model.

At the core of the authors' model is the idea that the steepness of accumulation of NHR-23 in each stage sets the timing of the onset and completion of lethargus, and hence the pace of the molting cycle. let-7s, through their LCSs in nhr-23 mRNA, can inhibit the rate of nhr-23 accumulation in each cycle, and thereby regulate pace. let-7s mature microRNAs do not need to oscillate to perform this proposed function in shaping the NHR-23 pulse</p><p>8) Line 732: &quot;NHR-23 transcriptionally activates let-7 and let-7 post-transcriptionally represses nhr-23 to form a molecular-genetic oscillator.&quot; Has it been shown that let-7 mature microRNA oscillates? Figure 3G suggests not. In the authors' model, is it required that mature let-7s microRNAs oscillate?</p><p>9) Line 784: &quot;Thus, NHR-23 and let-7 form a transcriptional-post-transcriptional negative feedback loop. Within a given larval stage, NHR-23 promotes the expression of the let-7s and the let-7s repress nhr-23. The expression levels of let-7 peak ~1.6 hours after nhr-23, resulting in an intrinsic delay between the accumulation of nhr-23 and that of let-7 (Figure 3D, 3F, 6A). Across development, the let-7s dampen the relative amplitude of nhr-23 expression from one larval stage to the next (Figure 6A, Figure 6 —figure supplement 1A). Furthermore, NHR-23 autoregulates its own expression (Figure 9A, 9D-F). Together, these interconnected feedback loops set up a self-sustained molecular-genetic oscillator that is extinguished in adulthood.&quot; The problem is that mature let-7s do not seem to oscillate (e.g., Figure 3G). So, if let-7 and nhr-23 are proposed to be oscillating components of an oscillator, the functional let-7 transcript would need to be the pri-let-7s (not mature let-7s!) How would that work? Could perhaps pri-let-7 bind to nhr-23 protein and somehow influence its transcriptional regulatory activity? This would be an exceedingly interesting scenario, if true, but highly theoretical and arguably beyond the scope of the present paper. Moreover, genetic evidence suggests that the molting cycle proceeds independently of let-7-family function, as animals quadruple-mutant for mir-84, mir-48, mir-241, and let-7 still undergo multiple larval stages (Vadla et al., 2012). [BTW, it is not possible to compare Figure 3D and 3F to 6A and make an assessment of the relative timing of pri-let-7 and nhr-23 accumulation.]</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these very astute observations #7–#9. Consistent with previous reports (McCulloch and Rougvie, 2014; Van Wynsberghe et al., 2011), we did not found significant oscillations in the levels of mature <italic>let-7</italic>. Mature <italic>let-7</italic> accumulates starting at early L3 and, most likely, associates with the Argonaute ALG-1.

The authors' finding that nhr-23 LCE mutations result in apparent molting behavior of adults (Figure 7A) suggests that nhr-23 activity could be sufficient for supernumerary molting. That novel finding motivates a model wherein cessation of molting requires two conditions to be filled: upregulation of lin-29 (an indirect consequence of let-7 activity in the L4), and dampening of nhr-23 expression (also via let-7).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and have made the suggested change (lines 899-901).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10E) As the authors data suggest (e.g., Figure 8) let-7s microRNAs could be shaping the dynamics of oscillations of many genes – but not because mature let-7s microRNAs are themselves oscillating, but because, as repressors, these microRNAs can affect the relationship between mRNA dynamics and protein dynamics for their targets.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated in our response to comment 9 above, and as the reviewer points out, mature <italic>let-7</italic> levels need not oscillate to function as an oscillator.
