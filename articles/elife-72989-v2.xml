unexpectedly common in complex traits, including metabolic and neurological traits. Parent-of-origin effects can be modified by the environment, but the architecture of these gene-by-environmental effects on phenotypes remains to be unraveled. Previously, quantitative trait loci (QTL) showing context-specific parent-of-origin effects on metabolic traits were mapped in the F<sub>16</sub> generation of an advanced intercross between LG/J and SM/J inbred mice. However, these QTL were not enriched for known imprinted genes, suggesting another mechanism is needed to explain these parent-of-origin effects phenomena. We propose that non-imprinted genes can generate complex parent-of-origin effects on metabolic traits through interactions with imprinted genes. Here, we employ data from mouse populations at different levels of intercrossing (F<sub>0</sub>, F<sub>1</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>, F<sub>16</sub>) of the LG/J and SM/J inbred mouse lines to test this hypothesis. Using multiple populations and incorporating genetic, genomic, and physiological data, we leverage orthogonal evidence to identify networks of genes through which parent-of-origin effects propagate. We identify a network comprised of three imprinted and six non-imprinted genes that show parent-of-origin effects. This epistatic network forms a nutritional responsive pathway and the genes comprising it jointly serve cellular functions associated with growth. We focus on two genes, <italic>Nnat</italic> and <italic>F2r</italic>, whose interaction associates with serum glucose levels across generations in high-fat-fed females. Single-cell RNAseq reveals that <italic>Nnat</italic> expression increases and <italic>F2r</italic> expression decreases in pre-adipocytes along an adipogenic trajectory, a result that is consistent with our observations in bulk white adipose tissue.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>parent-of-origin effect</kwd><kwd>epistasis</kwd><kwd>adipose</kwd><kwd>RNA sequencing</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>complex traits</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007878</institution-id><institution>Diabetes Research Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Semenkovich</surname><given-names>Clay F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008116</institution-id><institution>Diabetes Research Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lawson</surname><given-names>Heather A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Non-imprinted genes can contribute to parent-of-origin effects on phenotype through interactions with imprinted genes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Parent-of-origin effects, where the phenotypic effect of an allele depends on whether the allele is inherited maternally or paternally, are epigenetic phenomena associated with a wide range of complex traits and diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lawson et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, the functional impact of a specific genetic variant can depend on its parental origin. The best characterized parent-of-origin effect is genomic imprinting, an epigenetic process in which either the maternally or paternally inherited allele is silenced, typically through DNA methylation. In humans, there are 107 verified imprinted genes and in mice there are 124, of which ~ 70% overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jirtle, 2012</xref>). Despite the rarity of imprinted genes, parent-of-origin effects on complex traits and diseases are relatively common, suggesting that canonical imprinting mechanisms are not sufficient to account for these phenomena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mozaffari et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zeng et al., 2019</xref>). With so few imprinted genes, what mechanisms underlie these parent-of-origin effects? We hypothesize that a small number of imprinted genes can generate a large number of parent-of-origin effects through interactions with non-imprinted genes.</p><p>In this study, we use four populations at different levels of intercrossing of the LG/J and SM/J inbred mouse lines to test the hypothesis that non-imprinted genes can contribute to parent-of-origin effects on metabolic phenotypes through epistatic interactions with imprinted genes. Multiple populations (F<sub>0</sub>, F<sub>1</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>, F<sub>16</sub>) allow us to refine our search space and provide orthogonal evidence supporting putative networks of interacting genes. Metabolic traits were previously mapped in a F<sub>16</sub> generation of an advanced intercross between LG/J and SM/J (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheverud et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lawson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lawson et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lawson et al., 2011b</xref>). We generated visceral white adipose tissue gene expression profiles from 20 week-old F<sub>1</sub> animals in order to match the age of the F<sub>16</sub> LG/J x SM/J advanced intercross population. F<sub>1</sub> reciprocal cross (LxS and SxL) mice were subjected to the same high and low-fat diets and phenotyping protocols as the previously-studied F<sub>16</sub> mice to keep environmental contexts consistent. We identified genes showing parent-of-origin-dependent allele-specific expression (ASE), characterized interactions among these genes and biallelic genes that are differentially expressed by reciprocal cross (DE), and correlated interacting ASE and DE gene pairs with metabolic phenotypes in the F<sub>1</sub> population. Pairs that significantly associated with phenotypic variation were tested for epistasis on correlated traits in the F<sub>16</sub> population.</p><p>We identified an epistatic network that forms a nutritional environment responsive pathway mediated through calcium signaling. This network contributes to metabolic variation by balancing proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis in adipocytes. The genes comprising this network jointly serve functions associated with growth in multiple tissues, which is consistent with the evolutionary hypothesis that sexual conflict underlies some parent-of-origin effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mochizuki et al., 1996</xref>). We focus on two key interacting genes: <italic>Nnat</italic> (neuronatin), a canonically imprinted gene, and <italic>F2r</italic> (coagulation factor II receptor), a biallelic gene showing significant DE by cross in F<sub>1</sub> high-fat-fed female animals. Co-expression of these two genes associates with variation in basal glucose levels, and this association persists across generations. Further, single-cell RNAseq reveals that <italic>Nnat</italic> expression increases and <italic>F2r</italic> expression decreases in pre-adipocytes along an adipogenic trajectory, a pattern consistent both with their expression in bulk white adipose tissue and with their respective roles in adipogenesis. Our results demonstrate that incorporating orthogonal lines of evidence including genotype, allele specific expression, total gene expression, single-cell expression, and phenotype from different populations varying in their degree of intercrossing is a powerful way to identify putative mechanisms and test hypotheses underlying parent-of-origin effects on phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Non-imprinted genes interact with imprinted genes and effect metabolic phenotypes</title><p>We test the hypothesis that non-imprinted genes can mediate complex parent-of-origin effects on phenotypes through genetic interactions with imprinted genes using a F<sub>1</sub> reciprocal cross model of the LG/J and SM/J inbred mice (LxS and SxL). In this model the effects of parental origin on an allele can be tested directly and isolated from sequence dependent <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory differences. We validated our findings in LG/J and SM/J parentals (F<sub>0</sub>) as well as in F<sub>2</sub> and F<sub>16</sub> intercrosses of LGxSM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The parental F<sub>0</sub> animals serve to anchor variation in allele-specific expression that is a function of allelic identity (L or S). Incorporating the F<sub>2</sub> and F<sub>16</sub> populations into our validations ensures that the interactions we observe are not solely a function of linkage in the F<sub>1</sub> animals. We generated mRNA expression profiles in white adipose tissue from 20-week-old F<sub>1</sub> reciprocal cross animals. These animals were subjected to the same high and low-fat diets and phenotyping protocols as the previously studied F<sub>16</sub> animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheverud et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lawson et al., 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lawson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Miranda et al., 2020</xref>). We identified two classes of genes: (1) imprinted genes and (2) non-imprinted genes with parent-of-origin effects on total expression.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Proposed model for propagation of parent-of-origin effects through gene-gene interactions.</title><p>Parent-of-origin effects should be partitioned into <italic>cis</italic> mechanisms and <italic>trans</italic> mechanisms (<bold>A</bold>) An example of a <italic>cis</italic> parent-of-origin effect is a system with three regulatory elements: promoter, insulator, and enhancer. Activation of transcription requires the enhancer to act upon the promoter. Enhancer activity is blocked by the insulator when it has been bound by CTCF. CTCF cannot be bound when methylated. In this system, the insulator is selectively methylated when inherited maternally, so methylation of the maternally inherited insulator blocks CTCF binding, allowing the enhancer to activate transcription. Because the paternally inherited insulator is not methylated, it is bound by CTCF which blocks enhancer activity, silencing transcription. This canonical genomic imprinting mechanism interacts with genetic variation in the three regulatory features. For example, if one allele produces stronger enhancer activity (Alt) than the other, individuals inheriting the Alt allele maternally would have elevated expression compared to those that inherit the same allele paternally. These <italic>cis</italic> genetic effects do not occur in isolation. Due to the highly interconnected nature of biological systems, there are downstream effects. We refer to these as <italic>trans</italic> parent-of-origin effects. (<bold>B</bold>) An example of a <italic>trans</italic> parent-of-origin effect is a system with two genes each having its own promoter. The first gene is canonically imprinted, and the activity of the gene promoter is blocked by DNA methylation. The imprinted gene’s promoter is methylated when inherited maternally. Consequently, the paternally inherited allele is almost exclusively expressed. As before, when genetic variation in a regulatory feature interacts with these epigenetic mechanisms, we see parent-of-origin effects on expression of the imprinted gene. In this example, the imprinted gene regulates expression of a non-imprinted gene. Despite the non-imprinted gene being agnostic to parental origin, its expression nonetheless depends on the parental origin of alleles at the imprinted locus. (<bold>C</bold>) Summary of our experimental design. Expression patterns of genes showing allele-specific expression (ASE) such as imprinted genes are shaped by parental genotypes and environment (e.g. nutrition). Downstream gene expression is a function of their genotype and the expression of upstream ASE genes. Altered parent-of-origin dependent total gene expression of ASE genes leads to differential expression of downstream genes varying only in allelic parent-of-origin (DE). Phenotype is most directly affected by expression of DE genes. Variation in DE gene expression leads to corresponding variation in phenotype. Mouse populations used to probe parts of this model are labeled F<sub>0</sub> (inbred lines), F<sub>1</sub> (reciprocal cross of inbred lines), F<sub>2</sub> (intercross of F<sub>1</sub> mice), and F<sub>16</sub> (advanced intercross of inbred lines).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-72989-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>To test our model, we identified genes showing parent-of-origin dependent allele specific expression (ASE). We identified 23 genes showing significant ASE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Of these 23 genes, 17 are canonically imprinted genes, two are not reported as imprinted genes but are located in known imprinted domains, and four are novel. Next, we identified genes showing differential total expression between individuals varying only in allelic parent-of-origin (DE between reciprocal crosses, SxL vs LxS). We identified 33 genes that are significantly DE in at least one sex or dietary context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). A larger set of genes show signatures of parent-of-origin effects at the total gene expression level, but do not meet the statistical rigor demanded by the massive multiple tests burden incurred by a genome-wide scan accounting for sex, diet, and parent-of-origin (see Materials and methods).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Genes showing parent-of-origin effects at the allele specific and/or total expression levels covary with each other and with metabolic traits.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mean parent-of-origin effect score across contexts.

This pattern is consistent with the negative correlation we observe between Nnat and F2r in the bulk white adipose tissue. Because available scRNAseq data do not match the exact sex/ diet/ genetic background contexts of the LGxSM mice, there will be unaccounted for differences between the data sets.

Here, we examined epistatic interactions associated with parent-of-origin effects on dietary-obesity traits in white adipose using a simple yet powerful F<sub>1</sub> reciprocal cross mouse model. Although these parent-of-origin dependent allele-specific expression biases are consistent with imprinting mechanisms, we cannot rule out that maternal and/or paternal effects also contribute to the phenomena we observe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hager et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Interactions between imprinted and non-imprinted genes have previously been shown to contribute to variation in metabolic phenotypes. For example, the maternally expressed transcription factor KLF14 (kruppel-like factor 14) regulates biallelic gene expression related to adiposity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Parker-Katiraee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Small et al., 2011</xref>). Mapping studies have identified two SNPs (rs4731702, rs972283) upstream of KLF14 associated with type II diabetes and cholesterol levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Voight et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Teslovich et al., 2010</xref>). Both variants have maternally restricted <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory associations with KLF14 expression in adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kong et al., 2009</xref>). eQTL analysis found that rs4731702 is also enriched for <italic>trans</italic>-associations with KLF family transcription factor binding sites in subcutaneous white adipose tissue, suggesting that KLF14 may be a master transcriptional regulator in adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Small et al., 2011</xref>). Whether additional pairs of imprinted and biallelic genes are similarly co-expressed and associate with phenotypic variation remains an open question that has not been thoroughly investigated in large landmark functional genomics studies including ENCODE, GTEx, and GWAS, leaving a significant gap in our knowledge. Interactions between imprinted and biallelic genes could explain some of the observed parent-of-origin effect patterns associated with regions lacking obvious candidate genes, as described in a recent survey of 97 complex traits measured in outbred mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mott et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our model asserts that parent-of-origin effects start at ASE genes and are transduced through DE genes onto phenotype. This is illustrated in the interaction between <italic>Nnat</italic> and <italic>F2r</italic>. If a <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory effect interacts with epigenetic modifications (i.e. imprinting) at <italic>Nnat</italic>, then <italic>Nnat</italic> expression of genotypic classes are affected by paternal allele identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lawson et al., 2013</xref>). Between the LG/J and SM/J alleles at <italic>Nnat</italic>, the LG/J allele is more highly expressed. If our model is correct, the downstream DE gene should show a corresponding pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In the case of <italic>Nnat</italic> and <italic>F2r</italic>, which have strong negative correlated expression, when the LG/J allele is inherited paternally at <italic>Nnat</italic>, the higher expression of <italic>Nnat</italic> should correspond with lower expression of <italic>F2r</italic>. This is what we observe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). If this relationship is true, we should see persistent co-expression of <italic>Nnat</italic> and <italic>F2r</italic> across genetic backgrounds (F<sub>0</sub>, F<sub>1</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>), which we do (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This supports a biologically meaningful relationship between <italic>Nnat</italic> and <italic>F2r</italic>. Our model further predicts that the DE genes should more closely affect phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pierce et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lutz and Hokanson, 2015</xref>). In the case of <italic>Nnat</italic> and <italic>F2r</italic>, we expect <italic>F2r</italic> to more strongly associate with basal glucose levels than <italic>Nnat</italic>, which we observe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>There is a clear relationship between <italic>Nnat</italic> and <italic>F2r</italic> in adipogenesis, but the specifics of how this relationship extends to glucose homeostasis are unclear. One possibility is that by altering SERCA function, <italic>Nnat</italic> affects not only the formation of new adipocytes, but also the beiging of adipocytes. The SERCA channel is uncoupled in beige adipocytes as part of a UCP1-independent form of non-shivering thermogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ikeda and Yamada, 2020</xref>). Non-shivering thermogenesis consumes a significant amount of energy, thereby altering glucose homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carson et al., 2020</xref>). This hypothesis links these genes to physiological processes that are consistent with evolutionary hypotheses about the prevalence of parent-of-origin effects. <italic>Nnat</italic> and <italic>F2r</italic> are members of a putative network we identified that is coordinated by interactions between ASE and DE genes. From the literature, we found that the genes in this epistatic network function in key steps in a pathway regulating differentiation and survival of adipocytes in response to nutritional environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Specifically, there is evidence that it plays a critical role in the induction of adipogenesis. This alone demonstrates how parent-of-origin effects can move through networks along molecular pathways. Beyond proof-of-principle this network provides a clue to the puzzle of the prevalence of parent-of-origin effects.</p><p>The constituents of this single network appear to play vastly different physiological roles depending on the tissue. In white adipose the network appears to play some role in balancing proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis as we describe above. In pancreatic ß-cells, members of this network affect insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Millership et al., 2018</xref>). In bone, members of this network affect the balance of cartilage/bone growth and reabsorption. These three physiological processes may at first seem unrelated, but they share one key commonality – they are jointly critical to growth. This is consistent with the sexual conflict hypothesis attributed to parent-of-origin effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Patten et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Babak et al., 2015</xref>). The of size of progeny in placental mammals can have opposing fitness consequences for mothers/ maternal relatives and fathers/ paternal relatives. The fitness of fathers and paternal relatives, particularly in the case of multi-paternity litters, is improved with larger progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mochizuki et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Babak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fowden and Moore, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Patten et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wilkins and Haig, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haig, 1997</xref>). This comes at a fitness disadvantage to the mother. The fitness of mothers is improved by progeny of a manageable size, allowing her to produce multiple litters.</p><p>According to this model, imprinting evolved in part to allow one parental lineage to hijack parts of a nutritional environment response pathway driving growth in a direction favorable to maximize the fitness of that lineage. Key processes in such a pathway driving growth would include the secretion of growth factors, construction of cartilage and bone, and the accumulation of energy stores. We present a network that appears to play a role in all three processes. If the sexual conflict hypothesis is true, then the most parsimonious place for imprinting to evolve would be in key regulatory points that affect as many aspects of growth as possible. This is consistent with the network we identified, a single pathway affecting many aspects of growth. This hints at the possibility that parent-of-origin effects are common because of the multi-purpose nature of the pathways in which genomic imprinting manifests and parent-of-origin effects propagate.</p><p>By leveraging the reciprocal F<sub>1</sub> hybrids, we are able to integrate parent-of-origin-dependent allele specific expression and parent-of-origin-dependent differential expression with F<sub>16</sub> phenotypes. By doing so, we identify plausible candidates for functional validation and describe discrete molecular networks that may contribute to the observed parent-of-origin effects on metabolic phenotypes. The genes and interactions we present here represent a set of actionable interacting candidates that can be probed to further identify the machinery driving these phenomena and make predictions informed by genomic sequence. The frameworks we have developed account for the genetic, epigenetic, and environmental components underlying these parent-of-origin effects, thereby improving our ability to predict complex phenotypes from genomic sequence. We focused on metabolic phenotypes in this study, but the patterns we identified may translate to other complex traits where parent-of-origin effects have been implicated.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

challenging for two reasons: (1) the complexity of the many environmental contexts and (2) the correlation of allelic bias within and between imprinted domains breaks assumptions of independence. A permutation approach is an effective way to overcome these challenges. The context data was randomly shuffled for each gene independently and analyses were rerun to generate a stable null distribution of p-values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). False discovery rates were estimated for a given significance threshold as the proportion of significant tests under the permutated null model relative to significant tests under the real data model.

Co-expression was determined by fitting a general linear model and estimating significance using the Wald test approximation of the LR test.

Pearson’s correlation coefficients were calculated for each gene with basal glucose. To test whether patterns in these correlations was significantly different between F<sub>0</sub>/F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>2</sub> populations, bootstrapping was used to calculate 90% confidence intervals for the Pearson’s correlation coefficients. 5,000 iterations were run with 10 individuals randomly selected with replacement. scRNA analysis of Nnat and F2r scRNAseq data was downloaded from SRA: SRP145475 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burl et al., 2018</xref>). Data were processed and aligned to the C57BL/6 J reference (mm10) using Cell Ranger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>).

Cell quality was controlled using three metrics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Luecken and Theis, 2019</xref>): (1) number of features, (2) number of counts, (3) covariation of features and counts. High quality cells were required to have between 500 and 3000 features and read counts between 1000 and 30,000. As sequencing is a process of random sampling, the number of features and the number of counts should covary. This relationship was fit to a generalized additive model. Deviation from this relationship (residuals) were computed for each cell. High-quality cells were required to have a residual within 3 standard deviations of the mean residual of all cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Seurat normalization with a scale factor of 10,000 was performed.

A range of resolutions from 0.06 to 0.18 were tested, and the highest resolution with stable clustering was chosen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). Cell type markers were identified by differential expression analysis using the ‘MAST’ hurdle-model test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Finak et al., 2015</xref>).

Mendelian traits. But we also all know that the world is so much richer and more complex than this. The current article explores some of that complexity, opening rich insights into intergenerational effects, offering the opportunity for mathematical thinking and further hypothesis testing, and opening up exciting new hypotheses to test. As Professor Stephen Stearns wrote, &quot;Many of us do not do science only, or even primarily, to achieve practical results. We do it because we are fascinated with neat ideas. Evolutionary medicine is full of them, including parent-of-origin pattern.&quot; Let us enjoy the wonder.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72989.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Allison</surname><given-names>David B</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01kg8sb98</institution-id><institution>Indiana University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Haig</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03vek6s52</institution-id><institution>Harvard University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.08.10.455860">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.10.455860v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Matthias Barton as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: David Haig (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, the reviewers are first and foremost requesting substantial modifications to clarify what exactly was done. Methodologic transparency will allow both the reviewers and the eventual readers to better understand what was done and its implications. Please respond to all of the reviewers' requests for more information and/or clarifications.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The model in which some parent-of-origin effects in crosses are mediated by effects of imprinted genes on the expression of unimprinted genes is probably the 'null hypothesis' for most workers in the field but it is good to have it spelled out.</p><p>Some evolutionary implications are briefly considered in the Discussion. The authors suggest that the various effects of Nnat in white adipose tissue, pancreatic β-cells, and bone are jointly critical for growth, consistent with the 'sexual conflict hypothesis' for the evolution of genomic imprinting.</p><p>I will make a minor technical comment on the authors' presentation of this hypothesis before considering the possible involvement of Nnat in thermogenesis. The hypothesis is presented as a conflict between the fitness of mothers and fathers. This is not quite correct, rather the relevant conflict arises from different 'inclusive' fitness’s of genes derived from mothers and genes derived from fathers (see Proc. R. Soc B 264: 1657). These two formulations are not the same because an offspring inherits only one of the two alleles present in a parent. Matrilineal and patrilineal inclusive fitness’s can differ when gene expression in one individual (the focal individual) has fitness consequences for other individuals with different probabilities of carrying the focal individual's maternal and paternal allele (call these other individuals 'asymmetric kin'). The category of asymmetric kin includes the mother of the focal individual, and this is where the conflict overgrowth discussed by the authors arises, but it also includes half-sibs, cousins, etc.</p><p>Thermogenesis and growth are, of course, not independent processes: fuels consumed to keep warm are unavailable for anabolic processes. Imprinting evolves for traits that mediate trade-offs between the fitness’s of self and others. Metabolism is likely to be central to these trade-offs.</p><p>&quot;Imprinting-by-imprinting epistasis&quot; is used in the main text but not defined. Its meaning is tucked away in the Methods section</p><p>&quot;Nnat and F2r are negatively correlated along an adipogenic trajectory&quot;. &quot;Nnat increases and F2r decreases along an adipogenic trajectory&quot; would be more informative.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) P-values are repeated in the text and in figures.

We have added text to clarify that the size of progeny in placental mammals can have opposing fitness consequences for mothers/ maternal relatives and fathers/ paternal relatives. We have also added references to the point that imprinting could have evolved in part to allow one parent to hijack parts of a nutritional environmental response pathway driving growth in a direction favorable to maximize the fitness of individuals sharing a parental line.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Thermogenesis and growth are, of course, not independent processes: fuels consumed to keep warm are unavailable for anabolic processes.
