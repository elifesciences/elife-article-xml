However, non-toxic chemical tools that modulate sumoylation in cells are lacking. Here, to identify small molecule sumoylation inhibitors we developed a cell-based screen that focused on the well-sumoylated substrate, human Liver Receptor Homolog-1 (hLRH-1, NR5A2). Our primary gene-expression screen assayed two SUMO-sensitive transcripts, <italic>APOC3</italic> and <italic>MUC1</italic>, that are upregulated by SUMO-less hLRH-1 or by siUBC9 knockdown, respectively. A polyphenol, tannic acid (TA) emerged as a potent sumoylation inhibitor in vitro (IC<sub>50</sub> = 12.8 µM) and in cells. TA also increased hLRH-1 occupancy on SUMO-sensitive transcripts. Most significantly, when tested in humanized mouse primary hepatocytes, TA inhibits hLRH-1 sumoylation and induces SUMO-sensitive genes, thereby recapitulating the effects of expressing SUMO-less hLRH-1 in mouse liver. Our findings underscore the benefits of phenotypic screening for targeting post-translational modifications, and illustrate the potential utility of TA for probing the cellular consequences of sumoylation.</p> <p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09003.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09003.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09003.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins in cells carry out diverse tasks. One way in which this diversity is achieved by proteins is through the attachment of molecular tags. SUMO is one such tag that can reversibly attach to proteins and alter their activity. The modification of proteins by SUMO is known as sumoylation, and it regulates many processes that are essential for living cells. In particular, transcription factors—the proteins that bind to DNA to switch genes on or off—are highly modified by SUMO. However, the consequences of sumoylation are not fully understood, and current research into this area has been hindered by a lack of effective and non-toxic chemicals that stop or slow down sumoylation.</p> <p>Suzawa, Miranda, Ramos et al. have now screened a large collection of compounds, which had already been approved for medical use, to find one that could inhibit sumoylation without toxic effects. The compounds were tested for their ability to alter the activity of a transcription factor called human Liver Receptor Homolog-1. This protein, which is referred to as LRH-1 for short, is an ideal candidate to test SUMO inhibitors because it is highly modified by multiple SUMO tags.</p> <p>This screen identified a compound from plants called tannic acid as a non-toxic and potent inhibitor of sumoylation. Further experiments confirmed that tannic acid prevented the modification of LHR-1 as well a number of different proteins that also commonly modified by SUMO. Inhibiting the sumoylation of LRH-1 led to an increase in the expression of genes that are normally silenced by SUMO-modified LRH-1. Similar results were obtained when tannic acid was tested using human cells and “humanized” liver cells from mice that had been engineered to express human LRH-1. The next big challenge is to find new chemical probes that can be used to specifically promote or inhibit SUMO modification of just one particular protein.</p> <p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link

Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier (SUMO) is a prevalent post-translational modification of many transcription factors and is generally associated with transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gill, 2005</xref>). Similar to other ubiquitin-like modifications, the sumoylation cycle is multi-stepped, as reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gareau and Lima (2010</xref>), and is initiated by E1 (SAE1), which forms a thioester bond with either SUMO-1, 2, or 3. The single E2 (UBC9) facilitates the hand-off and covalent conjugation of SUMO on a given protein substrate. Although E3s are believed to guide substrate selectivity in cells, only E1 and E2 are required for in vitro sumoylation (IVS). Sumoylation is then reversed by sentrin-specific proteases (SENPs).</p><p>Genetic manipulations that either eliminate the sumoylation machinery or permanently disrupt the normal sumoylation cycle of a substrate can result in embryonic lethality or impaired organogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Flotho and Melchior, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nacerddine et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Our lab and others find that sumoylation represents an important, ligand-independent mode to regulate the NR5A nuclear receptor subfamily that includes Steroidogenic Factor 1 (NR5A1/SF-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Campbell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2005</xref>) and Liver Receptor Homolog 1 (NR5A2/LRH-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chalkiadaki and Talianidis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stein et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Venteclef et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ward et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang et al., 2009</xref>). For instance, knocking-in an unsumoylatable or SUMO-less mutant SF-1 allele leads to profound changes in endocrine physiology and tissue development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2011a</xref>). Importantly, even in the presence of one wild-type (WT) allele, the phenotypic effects of SUMO-less SF-1 dominate. Mechanistically, we find that SUMO-less SF-1 can regulate select downstream targets, which we refer to as SUMO-sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Campbell et al., 2008</xref>). Indeed, sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling is ectopically activated after expressing SUMO-less SF-1 in both cells and tissues. This gain-of-function or dominance of the SUMO-less SF-1 mutant leads to expansion of select cell types and hormone imbalance, illustrating how disrupting the normal cycle of substrate sumoylation results in disease states. Consistent with our findings, gain-of-function heterozygous missense mutations in the sumoylation site of the transcription factor microphthalmia-associated transcription factor are tightly linked with some forms of human melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertolotto et al., 2011</xref>). SUMO-less variants of the androgen (AR) and glucocorticoid hormone (GR) receptors are also reported to activate new transcriptional programs linked to cellular proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Paakinaho et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sutinen et al., 2014</xref>). These studies suggest that successful efforts to chemically target substrate sumoylation could be used to alter transcription factor activity, to either promote or attenuate SUMO-sensitive genetic programs.</p> <p>Thus far, efforts to drug sumoylation using in vitro target-based assays and in silico screens have identified different classes of SUMO inhibitors with IC<sub>50</sub>s in the micromolar range (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). In vitro target-based screens rely exclusively on defined components (E1, UBC9 and a test substrate), and as such, exclude the contributions by E3s and other unidentified obligate cofactors on substrate sumoylation. An in situ cell-based screen in permeabilized, fixed cells partially overcomes this limitation but still requires the addition of exogenous SUMO components for the assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hirohama et al., 2013</xref>). Currently, inhibitors that target E1 include ginkgolic acid (GA), davidiin, and kerriamycin B. Inhibitors of UBC9 include 2-D08, GSK145A, and spectomycin B1. While GA remains the most widely used and commercially available chemical probe targeting general sumoylation, its efficacy as an inhibitor can vary greatly depending on the assay and substrate being tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bogachek et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tossidou et al., 2014</xref>).<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09003.003</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>List of sumoylation inhibitors identified by screen type and reported IC<sub>50</sub> values.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09003.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09003.003</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Compound</th><th>Class</th><th>Screen</th><th>Library</th><th>Assay</th><th>Substrate</th><th colspan="2">Target</th><th>IC<sub>50</sub> (µM)</th><th>Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2-D08</td><td>Flavonoid</td><td>Target</td><td>500 Flavones</td><td>IVS</td><td colspan="2">AR Peptide</td><td>UBC9</td><td>6.0</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2013</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td>Davidiin</td><td>Ellagitannin</td><td>Target</td><td>750 Extracts</td><td>In Situ</td><td colspan="2">RanGap1</td><td>E1</td><td>0.15</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Takemoto et al., 2014</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td>Ginkgolic acid</td><td>Alkylphenol</td><td>Target</td><td>500 Extracts</td><td>In Situ</td><td colspan="2">RanGap1</td><td>E1</td><td>3.0</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fukuda et al., 2009a</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td>GSK145A</td><td>Diamino-pyrimidine</td><td>Target</td><td>GSK Library</td><td>IVS</td><td colspan="2">TRPS1 Peptide</td><td>UBC9</td><td>12.5</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brandt et al., 2013</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td>Kerriamycin B</td><td>Antibiotic</td><td>Target</td><td>1800 Broths</td><td>In Situ</td><td colspan="2">RanGap1</td><td>E1</td><td>11.7</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fukuda et al., 2009b</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td>Spectomycin B1</td><td>Antibiotic</td><td>Target</td><td>Chemical Library</td><td>In Situ</td><td colspan="2">RanGap1</td><td>UBC9</td><td>4.4</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hirohama et al., 2013</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td>C#21</td><td>Phenyl Urea</td><td>Virtual</td><td>Maybridge</td><td>Docking</td><td colspan="2">RanGap1</td><td>E1</td><td>14.4</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kumar et al., 2013</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td>Tannic acid</td><td>Gallotannin</td><td>Phenotypic</td><td>Pharmakon</td><td>qPCR</td><td colspan="2">hLRH-1</td><td>E1</td><td>12.8</td><td>(This Study)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>Phenotypic cell-based screens offer an alternative approach to in vitro target-based screens for finding new molecular entities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Swinney and Anthony, 2011</xref>). Here, we set out to identify nontoxic chemical probes that would modulate substrate sumoylation using a cell-based gene-expression screen, which assayed two human LRH-1 (hLRH-1) SUMO-sensitive transcripts as the primary readout. hLRH-1 is an ideal test substrate for evaluating any potential hits because one has the ability to test how candidate hits affect hLRH-1 activity in both immortalized hepatocellular carcinoma cells and in primary mouse hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mataki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oosterveer et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, as shown in this study, hLRH-1 is well-sumoylated in vitro, in cells, and in vivo. From the initial phenotypic screen of the FDA- and European-approved Pharmakon 1600 drug library, the commercial plant extract, tannic acid (TA) was identified as a nontoxic general sumoylation inhibitor, which was effective in multiple platforms, including primary mouse hepatocytes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A phenotypic screen assaying SUMO-sensitive genes identifies TA as the top hit</title><p>Sumoylation of hLRH-1 occurs primarily in the flexible hinge domain on two major conserved acceptor lysines K192 and K270, with a minor site located in the N-terminal region at K44 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Similar to our prior results obtained with SF-1, hLRH-1 is efficiently sumoylated (~30%) in human placental choriocarcinoma JEG3 and hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells expressing Flag-hLRH-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Importantly, multiple sumoylated hLRH-1 species are readily detected with only the endogenous SUMOylation machinery and without the need to add exogenous SUMO or UBC9. Substituting lysines K192 and K270 with arginines (K192R/K270R or 2KR) eliminates nearly all sumoylated LRH-1 species, as previously noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chalkiadaki and Talianidis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang et al., 2009</xref>) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. In vivo sumoylation of hLRH-1 is also equally robust, as observed in mouse liver humanized to express wild-type hLRH-1 (WT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), following viral-mediated infection with recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 8 (AAV8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cotugno et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ill et al., 1997</xref>) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1C,D—figure supplement 2</xref>. Impressively, the extent and pattern of hLRH-1 sumoylation in mouse liver are identical to those found in cultured cell lines, demonstrating for the first time that hLRH-1 is efficiently sumoylated at multiple lysines in vivo. By contrast, expressing SUMO-less hLRH-1 (2KR) eliminates nearly all hLRH-1 sumoylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These collective data establish that hLRH-1 is robustly sumoylated in several platforms, making it an excellent test substrate for assessing both the biochemical and functional effects of small molecule inhibitors of sumoylation.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09003.004</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Human LRH-1 is efficiently sumoylated in cells and in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of hLRH-1 protein (NR5A2 isoform 1) showing the location of major sumoylation sites at K192 and K270, and the minor K44 site (top panel).

The JEG3 cell line was initially chosen because it performed well in all steps of the primary screen and has been used previously to study NR5A activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Campbell et al., 2008</xref>). Profiling was carried out on JEG3 cells stably expressing hLRH-1 or the SUMO-less hLRH-1 mutant, or after siRNA knock down of UBC9 (siUBC9) to identify the most robust SUMO-sensitive genes. To ensure that minor sumoylation on hLRH-1 was eliminated we used the 3KR mutant that disrupts K44, as well as the two major acceptor lysines in the hinge region. Two genes, <italic>APOC3</italic> and <italic>MUC1</italic>,were identified by microarray as the readout transcripts for the screen. These genes are highly induced by either SUMO-less LRH-1 or siUBC9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and were chosen as two SUMO-sensitive genes in the primary screen assay.

Both siUBC9 and TA inhibit global sumoylation, but in this setting, siUBC9 is slightly more effective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). As expected, neither TA nor siUBC9 changes the pool of ubiquitinated proteins. Lastly, we wanted to know if TA similarly modulates sumoylation of endogenously expressed LRH-1. Unfortunately, our ability to cleanly detect or efficiently pulldown endogenous sumoylated LRH-1 species in cells/tissues is difficult with available anti-LRH-1 antibodies, including both commercial and non-commercial sources. Instead, we used human adrenal carcinoma H295R cells that express high levels of endogenous hSF-1 and found that similar to exogenously expressed hLRH-1, TA decreases levels of sumoylated hSF-1 in H295S cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Similar results were also obtained for endogenous RanGap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).

In vitro assays confirm that TA impairs substrate sumoylation. When tested n several cellular model systems, an acute, nontoxic dose of TA treatment markedly reduces levels of sumoylated hLRH-1, as well as hSF-1, and modulates expression of hLRH-1 target genes. Impressively, in primary cultures of mouse hepatocytes, TA inhibits hLRH-1 sumoylation and is able to mimic the transcriptional output of the SUMO-less LRH-1 mutant by switching on genes that have been associated with hepatic injury.</p><p>Our gene-expression-based screen was designed to sample the transcriptional output of substrate sumoylation, which has not been possible with in vitro target-based screens. We reasoned that assessing transcriptional endpoints makes it possible to integrate other mechanisms that promote substrate-specific sumoylation or desumoylation, including possible synergistic effects of multiple transcription factor sumoylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Holmstrom et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Komatsu et al., 2004</xref>). Several factors make hLRH-1 an excellent test substrate in initial and follow-up assays. First, our earlier work established that blocking the NR5A sumoylation cycle results in robust transcriptional changes that could be leveraged in a phenotypic screen. Second, hLRH-1 is well-sumoylated with a stereotypic pattern of multiple sumoylated species requiring only the endogenous sumoylation machinery when it is expressed in HEK293S, JEG3, and HepG2 cells, in primary hepatocytes and in liver tissue. These findings differ from the need for exogenous SUMO1/2 and E3s required to detect 1x-sumoylated V5-tagged mLRH-1 in HEK293 cells or primary hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stein et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, when compared to hFXR, another sumoylated hepatic NR, the number and intensity of hLRH-1 sumoylated species far exceed the faint, single FXR sumoylated band detected when hFXR is expressed in mouse liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). Finally, the pattern of hLRH-1 sumoylation is readily duplicated in vitro, allowing one to also test candidate sumoylation modulators in a defined cocktail. We posit that NR5As might be particularly good substrates for sumoylation because their major acceptor lysines reside in the flexible hinge domain, possibly promoting strong protein–protein interactions previously observed between Ubc9 and both SF-1 and LRH-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2005</xref>). Indeed, the residual UBC9 protein following siUBC9 knockdown likely accounts for the persistent levels of 1x SU-LRH-1 and suggests that once UBC9 is charged with SUMO1/2, sumoylation of hLRH-1 proceeds efficiently. Interestingly, as with siUBC9, inhibiting E2 by 2-D08 is also ineffective at blocking hLRH-1 sumoylation. Regardless of the underlying mechanisms that confer relatively high basal levels of NR5A sumoylation in cells and in tissues, the consistent and robust sumoylation observed for hLRH-1 were instrumental in facilitating follow-up studies on candidate small molecule hits from our primary screen.</p><p>While polyphenols such as TA are easily dismissed as promiscuous inhibitors and false positives in high-throughput screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feng and Shoichet, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pohjala and Tammela, 2012</xref>), the effects of TA in our sumoylation assays are extremely reproducible in multiple cell lines and in primary hepatocytes. Interestingly, although other colloid-forming pehnolic compounds, such as bergapten and coumarin 153 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pohjala and Tammela, 2012</xref>), are present in the Pharmakon library, both failed to emerge as hits in the primary screen. When compared to other sumoylation inhibitors TA performs well. Indeed, in our IVS assay conditions, TA is more effective than either 2-D08 or GA and can inhibit sumoylation of multiple substrates in vitro, including the hinge-LBD of SF-1, an androgen receptor peptide, and full-length IκBα. The fact that 2-D08 fails to inhibit hLRH-1 sumoylation but is effective on other substrates (AR peptide and FL-IκBα) might reflect the fact that 2-D08 fails to block the strong interactions between Ubc9 and NR5As, as mentioned above. These data imply that mechanistically distinct sumoylation inhibitors act on different classes of substrates. We also find that unlike GA, which decreases cell viability as shown here and reported by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu and Zeng, 2009</xref>), TA appears to be well-tolerated in both immortalized and primary cell cultures. Hence, while GA might decrease sumoylation as an adaptive response to cell death, the utility of GA in assessing the transcriptional responses of substrate sumoylation is potentially quite limiting.</p><p>Our data suggest strongly that TA blocks substrate sumoylation by inhibiting E1 thioesterization, as found for the ellagitannin, Davidiin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Takemoto et al., 2014</xref>). The known aggregate formation and antioxidant properties of TA appear to be less important in inhibiting substrate sumoylation. Indeed, TA inhibits FL-hLRH-1 sumoylation even in the presence of detergent. Polyphenols, including TA, are also antioxidants and can scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) during oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yazawa et al., 2006</xref>), which might also directly affect the equilibrium between sumoylation-desumoylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bossis and Melchior, 2006</xref>). In this regard, we find that two other antioxidants, ellagic acid and EGCG, are ineffective at inhibiting hLRH-1 sumoylation (data not shown). Furthermore, conditions in our IVS assays are highly reducing making it unlikely that TA inhibits LRH-1 sumoylation via its antioxidant properties in this setting.</p><p>That TA is effective at blocking hLRH-1 sumoylation in humanized primary hepatocytes greatly strengthens the validity of TA as a useful chemical tool to assess the cellular effects of sumoylation. Interestingly, TA is more effective at blocking hLRH-1 sumoylation in primary hepatocytes as compared to HepG2 cells where 1x SUMO-hLRH-1 persists even at the highest dose of TA; a similar trend was noted for endogenous hSF-1 in H295R cells. The lower efficacy of TA in immortalized cell lines may reflect an increase in the general sumoylation machinery in immortalized versus primary cells, as noted by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bellail et al., 2014</xref>). The use of humanized mouse hepatocytes and the dramatic changes we observed in <italic>adiponectin</italic> and <italic>sonic hedgehog</italic> transcripts may begin to provide new insights into the in vivo function of LRH-1 sumoylation. The ectopic activation of SHH signaling observed here in primary hepatocytes after overexpressing SUMO-less hLRH-1 and after TA treatment confirms our earlier work showing that elimination of SF-1 sumoylation activates hedgehog signaling in endocrine tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2011a</xref>). Others have noted that hyperactivation of hedgehog signaling in liver is associated with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) progression and responses to liver injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grzelak et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hirsova and Gores, 2015</xref>). Adiponectin is an adipocyte-derived protein that reduces fatty liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xu et al., 2003</xref>) and appears protective against NASH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asano et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, while <italic>adiponectin</italic> is normally never expressed in liver, hepatic <italic>adiponectin</italic> transcripts are observed in rats after chemically induced hepatotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yoda-Murakami et al., 2001</xref>) and in patients with fatty liver or fully progressed NASH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Uribe et al., 2008</xref>). The finding that SUMO-less hLRH-1 and TA switch on hepatic <italic>adiponectin</italic> and hedgehog signaling leads us to speculate that tipping the balance of the hLRH-1 sumoylation cycle toward desumoylation might initiate adaptive responses to liver injury, and eventually a pro-inflammatory response, as suggested by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Venteclef et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, a global knock-in of a single SUMO mutation (K289R) in mouse LRH-1, which is equivalent to K270R in hLRH-1, has no strong phenotype on its own, but mitigates aortic plaque formation in <italic>Ldlr</italic><sup>-/-</sup> arteriosclerosis-prone mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stein et al., 2014</xref>). Hence, revealing the full physiological consequences of LRH-1 sumoylation could require the elimination of both major sumoylation sites in the flexible hinge domain and the use of conditional knock-in strategies that are specific for the adult liver.</p><p>In summary, using a novel cell-based assay, we report that the commercially derived, plant extract TA is a useful, nontoxic chemical tool for assessing the transcriptional and cellular effects of sumoylation in both immortalized and primary cell cultures. Based on our collective studies that have focused on the sumoylation of NR5As, we propose that the ratio of sumoylated to desumoylated substrate can be chemically manipulated to switch on and off sumo-sensitive transcriptional programs. Clearly, continued efforts are needed to determine whether more selective chemical tools can be found that promote or block sumoylation of a given substrate.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines and transfections</title><p>To generate tetracycline (TET)-inducible Flp-In T-REx stable JEG3 cells, 3x Flag-tagged WT and 3KR (K44R/K192R/K270R) hLRH-1 were cloned into pcDNA5/FRT/TO expression vectors (Life technologies, South San Francisco, CA), followed by selection with 100 or 125 μg/ml Hygromycin B (Gemini Bio-Products, Sacramento, CA).

Does tannic acid inhibit the SUMOylation of endogenous LRH-1 and modulate gene expression regulated by endogenous LRH-1?</italic> </p><p>We agree for a need to show that TA inhibits sumoylation of endogenous LRH-1, as was shown for Flag-hLRH-1 in multiple platforms (in vitro, in cells and in primary hepatocytes). However, despite repeated efforts, available anti-LRH-1 antibodies (commercial and non-commercial) fail to cleanly detect sumoylated and unmodified LRH-1 in either tissues or cell lines – this is best observed by the multiple, non-specific bands shown in the Western blot for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>. They are suitable for detecting recombinant hLRH-1, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. We also find that immunoprecipitation of endogenous mLRH-1 or hLRH-1 is also quite inefficient (1-5%) when compared with pull-downs of tagged-hLRH-1 using anti-Flag.</p><p>To overcome this issue, we asked if TA would inhibit sumoylation of <italic>endogenous</italic> SF-1 using the human adrenal carcinoma H295R cell line – in this instance the Upstate anti-SF-1 antibody will detect sumoylated SF-1 in embryonic and adult tissues (Lee, Dev Cell. 2011). In H295R cells, we find that TA decreases <italic>endogenous</italic> sumoylated SF-1 (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). We also show that TA decreases endogenous sumoylated RanGap (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5 —figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>As for endogenous genes, it should be noted that in primary hepatocytes treated with TA, we use uninfected hepatocytes that do not express hLRH-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Responses shown in this panel are those obtained after adding TA alone (no infection of AAV-hLRH-1). This has been clarified by labeling the X-axis with “Uninfected Hepatocytes + TA”.</p><p><italic>2) Effects on other SUMO-dependent pathways. More data is needed to address whether TA affects the modification and activity of other SUMOylated proteins. This is important to assess whether the inhibitor has widespread utility. The global effect of siUBC9 is clearly better than TA treatment (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>) but this is the opposite way around for effects on LRH-1 SUMOylation. This suggests that TA might be a more specific LRH-1 regulator rather than a more generic SUMOylation inhibitor. How many and which other TA/SUMO-sensitive genes were identified in the HepG2 microarrays that are not regulated by LRH-1, but by other proteins/TFs?</italic> </p><p>We provide several lines of evidence showing that TA will inhibit sumoylation of other proteins, both in vitro and in cells:</p><p>A) As shown previously, TA inhibits in vitro sumoylation of SF-1, IκBα and an androgen receptor peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4 —figure supplement 2</xref>);</p><p>B) We repeated experiments to ask if TA will decrease general protein sumoylation in HepG2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Levels of sumoylated proteins, as detected by anti-SUMO1 and anti-SUMO2, decrease following TA treatment. In fact, for specific sumoylated proteins, TA is actually more effective than siUBC9, as we report for both hLRH-1 and RanGap. For other proteins, siUBC9 appears to be more effective.;</p><p>C) As mentioned above, we were pleased to find that TA diminishes sumoylation of endogenous SF-1 in human adenocarcinoma H295R cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>);</p><p>D) We also find that sumoylation of endogenous RanGap, which is considered the most robust sumoylated substrate, decreases in HEPG2 cells treated with TA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5 —figure supplement 2</xref>);</p><p>E) Finally,in our screening assay, we used <italic>MUC1</italic> that is markedly upregulated by siUbc9 (30-fold by siUBC9), but is a poor LRH-1 target. We speculate that upregulation of <italic>MUC1</italic> by TA (10-fold) results from another sumoylated regulator being targeted by TA.</p><p>As for the comparison between TA and siUBC9, we found that LRH-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5 —figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2</xref>) and RanGap remain sumoylated in the face of a substantial knockdown of Ubc9. SiRNA-mediated knockdown over 72 h resulted in a 95% loss of <italic>UBC9</italic> transcripts, with a 60% decrease in UBC9 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5 —figure supplement 1</xref>). This residual UBC9 protein likely accounts for the persistent levels of 1xSU-LRH-1 and SU-RanGap. Further, for both SF-1/LRH-1, UBC9 was one of the strongest interacting protein partners (Lee, Mol Cell Biol. 2005). Thus, it is likely that once UBC9 is charged with SUMO1/2, sumoylation of LRH-1 proceeds efficiently. Interestingly, targeting E2 by 2-D08 or by siUBC9 appears to be ineffective at eliminating sumoylation of LRH-1, whereas targeting E1 through TA is much more effective. We also found that depleting 1x-SU-LRH- in HepG2 and JEG3 cells is much more difficult than in primary hepatocytes – this may reflect inherent differences in the extent of sumoylation between immortalized and primary cells, as suggested by Ballail et al., Nat Comm 2014. Nonetheless, as correctly suggested by the reviewers, and as we discussed in the text, the efficacy of any given sumo-inhibitor is likely substrate-dependent.</p><p><italic>3) Relative toxicity of TA. TA seems less effective than ginkgolic acid (GA) in reducing LRH-1 SUMOylation (in particular mono-). The authors conclude that TA is an effective non-toxic SUMO inhibitor in cells. As an alternative explanation, could it be that TA is more tolerated by cells than GA because it is less effective in inhibiting SUMOylation of substrates required for cell viability? Assuming that an effective inhibitor would shut down most SUMOylation events in cells, a toxic effect is not surprising and is compatible with the lethality of SUMO1 ko mice. The authors should provide some more information about the properties of TA. At which concentrations and time points does TA become cytotoxic in cell lines versus primary hepatocytes (expand on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, longer time treatments than 5 hours)? Presumably TA as polyphenol cannot be delivered to mice in vivo; if so, this should be pointed out to the reader.</italic> </p><p>To address this important issue, cellular toxicity of TA or GA was assayed in HepG2, JEG3 and primary cells following 24 h post-treatment. As expected GA was significantly more toxic than TA in JEG3 cells at both 5 and 24 h beginning at 15 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3 —figure supplement 2</xref>), and in HepG2 cells at 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). By contrast, little toxicity is observed at the highest dose of TA (50-75 µM) when LRH-1 sumoylation is greatly diminished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Importantly, at lower non-toxic doses, GA (1 and 10 µM) is far less effective than TA at inhibiting LRH-1 sumoylation (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). TA shows little toxicity in primary hepatocytes, even at higher doses. A similar trend was noted for GA when comparing HepG2 cells and primary hepatocytes (Ma et al., Oncotarget 2015) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7 —figure supplement 1</xref>). TA appears more effective at inhibiting LRH-1 sumoylation in primary hepatocytes compared to HepG2 and JEG3 cells. In reference to the discussion below, this observation appears to uncouple the degree of toxicity and the extent of desumoylation.</p><p>It was suggested that the increased toxicity observed with GA might result from more effective shut-down of SUMOylation as compared to TA. However, we do not favor this hypothesis given our findings in primary hepatocytes (see above) and results in IVS assays showing that TA is a more effective inhibitor than GA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Moreover, it is debatable whether one can directly compare the embryonic lethal SUMO1 KO mouse model with GA toxicity and a shut-down of sumoylation. One could easily argue that the embryonic lethality in the developmental SUMO1 KO reflects altered functions of key proteins rather than general toxicity. Furthermore, for our purposes, the confounding toxic effects at doses of GA needed to inhibit sumoylation make it difficult to assess cellular readouts, such as gene expression.</p><p><italic>4) Specificity of TA for SUMO-dependent gene expression. The authors could provide more information on the degree to which TA actually mimics the effects of LRH-1 deSUMOYlation. The numbers of genes presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> is very small and within this small group, the correlations between siUbc9 and TA treatment are essentially random. In the examples selected, they do appear to do the same thing but one would expect to see a high degree of concordance. The common effects of TA, siUbc9 and the LRH1 SUMO mutant should be better correlated across the various genome-wide datasets. Generally for the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, statistics are needed.</italic> </p><p>As noted here, it would be instructive to know how ChIP-Seq data sets overlap between TA + WT LRH-1 versus 2KR LRH-1. This information would be useful in determining how effectively TA mimics the transcriptional effects of LRH-1 desumoylation. This is an excellent point and one that we have earnestly tried to address. Unfortunately, we have failed repeatedly to maintain stable SUMOless LRH-1 cell lines that express equivalent protein levels as WT LRH-1. This same issue was encountered when we tried repeatedly to maintain stable SUMOless SF-1 cell lines in anything other than HEK293S cells.</p><p>Unlike immortalized cell lines, SUMOless SF-1 and SUMOless LRH-1 are stably expressed in tissues, as evidenced by our earlier study (Lee Dev Cell 2011) and this study, respectively. Obtaining ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq datasets from primary hepatocytes expressing endogenous levels of both Flag-WT and SUMOless hLRH-1 with TA treatment will certainly be of interest, but begins to address a more specific biological question that is outside the scope of this current study. Understanding why SUMOless NR5As are stable in tissues but not in immortalized cell lines is also quite interesting, but again is beyond the scope of this study.</p><p>We have simplified <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> (old <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and removed associated heat maps from supplemental figures, in part, because these data sets are not robust and limited by the use of microarrays rather than RNA-Seq. A subset of 42 genes was obtained after sorting by three parameters: 1) Genes upregulated by LRH-1; 2) LRH-1 targets by Chip-Seq and; 3) Genes up or downregulated by TA versus DMSO. While transcriptional effects of TA were observed for many of the 42 genes, we chose the top 3 target genes that contained a strong LRH-1 binding site (peak intensity) and yielded reproducible ChIP-qPCR data; both their expression and occupancy by LRH-1 were changed by TA. We have modified the text so as not to overstate these data. As requested, we have added the number of genes changed by siUbc9 versus TA (Figure 5 —figure supplement 3), which shows an overlapping subset of genes.</p></body></sub-article> </article>
