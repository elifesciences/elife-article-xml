Combining conserved antigens that induce cross-protective antibody responses with epitopes that activate cross-protective T cell responses might be an attractive strategy for developing a universal vaccine. In this study, we constructed a recombinant protein named NMHC that consists of influenza viral conserved epitopes and a superantigen fragment. NMHC promoted the maturation of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells and induced CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to differentiate into Th1, Th2, and Th17 subtypes. Mice vaccinated with NMHC produced high levels of immunoglobulins that cross-bound to HA fragments from six influenza virus subtypes with high antibody titers. Anti-NMHC serum showed potent hemagglutinin inhibition effects to highly divergent group 1 (H1 subtype) and group 2 (H3 subtype) influenza virus strains. Furthermore, purified anti-NMHC antibodies bound to multiple HAs with high affinities. NMHC vaccination effectively protected mice from infection and lung damage when exposed to two subtypes of H1N1 influenza virus. Moreover, NMHC vaccination elicited CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses that cleared the virus from infected tissues and prevented virus spread. In conclusion, this study provides proof of concept that NMHC vaccination triggers B and T cell immune responses against multiple influenza virus infections. Therefore, NMHC might be a candidate universal broad-spectrum vaccine for the prevention and treatment of multiple influenza viruses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hemagglutinin stalk</kwd><kwd>superantigen</kwd><kwd>cross-protection</kwd><kwd>cell-mediated immunity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>XDA12020225</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Mingkai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Liaoning Revitalization Talents Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>XLYC1807226</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Mingkai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Science and Technology Plan Projects of Shenyang City Grants</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Y17-4-003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Mingkai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Shengyang High level Innovative Talents Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RC190060</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Mingkai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Science and Technology Agency Livelihood Program of Liaoning Province of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021JH2/10300075</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Mingkai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>By fusing influenza viral conserved epitopes and a superantigen fragment, we constructed a recombinant protein that might be a candidate universal broad-spectrum vaccine for the prevention and treatment of multiple influenza viruses.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Seasonal influenza viruses infect 5â15% of the global population and kill several hundred thousand people every year despite the availability of antivirals and inactivated tetravalent vaccines, which are effective for most recipients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ellebedy et al., 2014</xref>). As a cluster of RNA viruses, influenza viruses have a segmented genome and error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which enables influenza viruses to undergo minor antigenic changes (antigenic drift) and major antigenic changes (antigenic shift) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). This genomic mutability of influenza viruses permits the virus to evade adaptive immune responses. The unpredictable variability of influenza A viruses causes annual epidemics in human populations, and the time-consuming methods used to develop and produce influenza vaccines have resulted in a lack of effective prevention against influenza infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lu et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, currently available vaccines induce antibodies against most homologous virus strains, but do not protect against antibody-escape variants of seasonal or novel influenza viruses. Therefore, the development of a novel universal vaccine that induces broad protection against various influenza viruses is urgently required to overcome the problems caused by the annual epidemic of different types of influenza viruses. Conserved proteins or fragments of influenza A virus such as nucleoprotein (NP), matrix protein 2 ectodomain (M2e), and hemagglutinin stem (HA2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">StanekovÃ¡ and VareÄkovÃ¡, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">El Bakkouri et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">De Filette et al., 2006</xref>), which induce cross-protective immune responses, were reported to be promising antigens for the design of a universal vaccine.</p><p>Hemagglutinin is a highly immunogenic surface protein in the influenza virus. Overall, 18 HA subtypes of influenza A viruses have been identified and can be classified into two groups (12 subtypes from group 1 including H1 and H5, and 6 subtypes from group 2 including H3 and H7) based on the phylogenetic relationships of the HA proteins. HA consists of two subunits, a membrane-distal globular domain HA1 and a conserved stalk domain HA2 linked by a single disulfide bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wilson et al., 1981</xref>). The epitopes of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) in HA2 are more conserved across different influenza HA subtypes compared with the antigenic sites in HA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Julien et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ellebedy and Ahmed, 2012</xref>). The bnAbs induced by HA2 recognize diverse influenza A virus subtypes and prevent fusion of the virus and host cell membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Julien et al., 2012</xref>). M2, a membrane protein, forms a pH-gated proton channel incorporated into the viral lipid envelope, which is essential for the efficient release of the viral genome during virus entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Schnell and Chou, 2008</xref>). M2e, a 23 amino acid peptide, is highly conserved in influenza A strains and is thought to be a valid and versatile vaccine candidate that can induce heterosubtypic antibody responses against various human influenza strains. NP, a conserved inner antigen of the influenza virus, is required to induce cellular immune responses after natural infection. Furthermore, NP-specific helper T cells augment protective antibody responses and promote B cells to produce HA-specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Townsend and Skehel, 1984</xref>). Therefore, an effective vaccine against seasonal or pandemic influenza should contain conserved B-cell epitopes that prime the humoral immune system to induce a response that significantly diminishes virus replication immediately after infection, and T cell epitopes that promote cellular immune responses for overall protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Moltedo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hermesh et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Bacterial superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin C2 (SEC2) can directly activate T lymphocytes without the presence of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and stimulate bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yao et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dinges et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, SEC2 can activate T cells and BMDCs to produce various cytokines such as interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interferon-gamma (IFN-Î³). However, very low amounts of SEC2 can induce CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) to specifically kill target cells such as virus-infected cells and tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Laidlaw et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, our previous study reported that SEC2 linked innate immunity and adaptive immunity by activating Toll-like receptor (TLR) downstream signaling molecules including MyD88 and NF-ÎºB, and might be a promising adjuvant for rabies vaccines to provide efficient protection against exposure to the lethal rabies virus. Taken together, we hypothesized that SEC2 has adjuvant or adjuvant-like effects that would improve the protective efficiency of influenza vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yao et al., 2018a</xref>).</p><p>We designed a universal influenza vaccine by connecting the conserved fragments of NP (two epitopes of CTL and helper T lymphocytes), M2e, and highly conserved long Î±-helix regions of HA2 from group 1 (H1) and group 2 (H3 and H7) using a flexible linker (GSAGSAG) to construct a fusion protein NMH as a subunit vaccine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To enhance the antigenicity of NMH, we fused SEC2 into the C-terminal of NMH to construct a conjugate vaccine NMHC. We evaluated the influenza virus-specific antibody-inducing ability of NMHC using a direct-binding ELISA. Microneutralization-hemagglutination inhibition and cytotoxic lysis assays were performed to evaluate the bnAbs and immunogens induced by NMHC. We also evaluated the universal protective efficiency of NMHC in mice infected with influenza viruses in vivo.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Design, purification, renaturation, and verification of the recombinant protein NMHC.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Phylogenetic tree of the 18 hemagglutinin subtypes of influenza A viruses based on amino acid sequences.

To facilitate purification, a carboxyl-terminal His-tag reading frame was retained on the backbone of the expression vector pET-28a (+) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Recombinant proteins were expressed as inclusion bodies in plasmid-harboring <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strains and purified as a major band at 59 kDa (NMHC) and 31 kDa (NMH) by Coomassie blue-stained SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). After renaturation by dialysis, the soluble recombinant proteins NMHC and NMH were obtained with &gt;95% purity confirmed by SDS-PAGE. The structural modeling of NMHC in silico revealed that the fused NMH was independent of the SEC2 region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), which implied that the domains of NMH and SEC2 would not affect each other. To verify this hypothesis, a splenocyte proliferation assay was performed. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, NMH did not induce proliferation compared with the phosphate buffer saline (PBS)-negative control, whereas SEC2, NMHC, and NMH + SEC2 induced obvious proliferative clusters of murine splenocytes at 72 hr.

NMHC consists of two domains, an NMH domain as a universal immunogen and an SEC2 domain as an adjuvant-like molecular chaperone, fused by a flexible peptide linker. Both domains do not require post-translational modification; therefore, NMHC can be conveniently produced using an <italic>E. coli</italic> expression system. Here, we studied humoral immune responses mediated by NMHC that were involved in anti-influenza immune defense together with the contribution of cellular immunity. Our in vivo study showed that NMHC promoted B cells to differentiate into NMH-, H1N1-, and H3N2-specific ASCs or memory cells involved in humoral immune responses. NMHC induced the secretion of IgG2a and IgM, but not IgE, as the number of immunizations increased, and the antibody concentration reached a peak after the third immunization. During Th1-type immune responses, IgG2a mediates the clearance of virus and provides protection against influenza infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Valkenburg et al., 2014</xref>). IgM is involved in the initial humoral immune response and IgE is associated with type I hypersensitivity. As expected, antiserum from NMHC-immunized mice specifically neutralized H1N1 and H3N2, preventing the viruses from replicating in MDCK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In this experiment, virus suppression by antiserum was only detected when using the MN-HI assay, but not the HI assay. A reason for this might be that stem-specific antibodies did not bind to the head region of hemagglutinin, the receptor binding site (RBS) of the influenza virus that targets cells, and therefore, did not prevent red blood cell aggregation induced by the virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">He et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">van der Lubbe et al., 2018</xref>). However, stem-specific antibodies could bind to the non-receptor binding region of HA to prevent influenza virus from fusing into the endosomal membrane by interfering with the conformational change of HA induced by a low pH, even if influenza virus had attached to the receptor and infected cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Imai et al., 1998</xref>). This procedure prevented the release of the ribonucleoprotein complex into the target cell and led to the inhibition of viral replication, so the small number of viruses could not induce red blood cell aggregation, which is directly detected by the HI assay. Next, to determine whether the antibody induced by NMHC had broad heterosubtypic binding or neutralization activity against diverse influenza A strains, we detected the binding ability of anti-NMHC sera to different HAs from group 1 (H1, H2, H5, H9) and group 2 (H3, H7) by ELISA. As expected, antiserum from NMHC-immunized mice showed a broad pattern of binding to these HA fragments with high antibody titers. Although only six types of HA were available in our experiment, we believed that the anti-NMHC serum might bind to other HA subtypes. Furthermore, the SPR assay indicated that antibodies purified from anti-NMHC serum had high binding affinities to the HAs of H1, H2, and H5, and moderate affinity to H3. Because the H3 fragment used in this study was from a split virion of H3N2 but not a commercially purified full-length fragment, we think that this relatively low affinity of antibodies to H3 might be related to the impurity of the H3 fragment. These results indicated that the antibody induced by NMHC vaccination could bind to and neutralize different influenza viruses with a high affinity and effectively prevented virus replication in target cells.</p><fig id="fig13" position="float"><label>Figure 13.</label><caption><title>Detailed illustration of the anti-influenza mechanisms induced by NMHC.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-71725-fig13-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Regarding cellular immune responses, we found that NMHC promoted T lymphocyte proliferation and enhanced the functions of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, respectively. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells can differentiate into Th1 and Th2 cells that have critical roles in immune responses including clearing virus infection and regulating immunoglobulin isotype switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Snapper and Mond, 1993</xref>). Th1 cells enhance IgG2a switching by secreting IFN-Î³, and Th2 cells enhance IgG1 switching by secreting IL-4. IgG2a was reported to be more effective at resisting virus infection than IgG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yendo et al., 2016</xref>). CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells enhance antiviral responses by promoting the destruction of virus-infected cells through perforin and granzyme released by CTLs. Our results indicated that immunization with NMHC significantly enhanced Th1 and Th2 immune cell responses, specifically an increase in the differentiation of IFN-Î³ and IL-4-producing cells and antigen-specific cytokine expression. In addition, antigen-specific CTL responses were also elevated significantly, as shown by the in vivo CTL assay, where target cells âinfectedâ with NMH, but not control cells âinfectedâ with BSA, were killed in NMHC-immunized mice. In addition, the transcription of the immune effector molecules, perforin, and granzyme was also increased.</p><p>As expected, NMHC induced the proliferation of murine splenocytes, indicating that the recombinant protein NMHC maintained the superantigen activity of SEC2. Furthermore, NMHC significantly promoted the maturation of BMDCs and increased the expressions of the co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86, as well as MHC II in vitro. This effect of NMHC might be attributable to the combined effect of the NMH and SEC2 domains in the fusion protein because CD80 and CD86 expressions in BMDCs induced by NMHC were significantly higher than those induced by SEC2, NMH, and NMH + SEC2. Mature BMDCs promoted CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to differentiate into Th1, Th2, and Th17 subtypes as represented by IFN-Î³, IL-4, and IL-17A production. Compared with NMH and NMH + SEC2, NMHC had an adjuvant-like activity associated with the fused SEC2 domain, which regulated adaptive immune responses and augmented the immunogenicity of the NMH domain. The structural modeling of NMHC in silico demonstrated that the fused SEC2 was independent of the NMH region, which allowed immune cells to recognize components of the antigenic determinants and induce specific immune responses. Limited by laboratory biosafety, we only used two attenuated strains of H1N1 separated by different times and places, but not other virulent pathogenic strains, in the mouse challenge experiment. Immunization with NMHC protected mice against infection by either of the two virus strains as demonstrated by the decreased number of viruses and reduction of inflammatory infiltration in the lungs. Although immunization with NMH + SEC2 achieved similar results to NMHC by reducing the number of virus particles in the lungs, we think that NMHC is preferable to NMH + SEC2 when the comprehensive effects of humoral immunity and cellular immunity, as well as the convenience of future applications, are considered.</p><p>In summary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref>), the recombinant protein NMHC promoted B and T cell immune responses against influenza virus infection. The SEC2 domain of NMHC promoted DC maturation through the TLR/NF-ÎºB signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yao et al., 2018b</xref>), and matured DCs presented antigens of the NMH domain to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells via MHC II and to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells via MHC I. This process led to the activation, proliferation, and differentiation of antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Activated antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells then differentiated into IL-17A-producing Th17 cells, IFN-Î³-producing Th1 cells, and IL-4-producing Th2 cells. Th1 and Th2 cells help B cells secrete HA2-specific antibodies that bind to the HA2 of the influenza virus and block the fusion of virus and the endosomal membranes of target cells to prevent release of the ribonucleoprotein complex into the cytoplasm of the target cells. In addition, Th1 cells promoted the differentiation of activated antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells into CTL effector cells that specifically kill virus-infected cells by the exocytosis of cytolytic granules such as perforin and granzymes. Our findings suggest an innovative potential clinical strategy for influenza immunization. We propose the recombinant protein NMHC be a candidate universal broad-spectrum vaccine for the prevention and treatment of various influenza virus strains.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

NMHC consists of NMH at the amino terminal followed by SEC2 sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Xu et al., 2008</xref>) at the carboxyl terminal. A flexible linker peptide sequence (GSAGSAG) was designed between each component to avoid any stereo-hindrance effect. Then, the encoding DNA fragment of NMH was optimized according to the codon preference of <italic>E. coli</italic> and synthesized by Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China), while the DNA fragment of NMHC was constructed via overlap polymerase chain reaction. The encoding DNA fragment were ligated into the expression vectors pET-28a (+) plasmid and transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21(DE3), and the positive clones were verified by DNA sequencing. Vector-containing <italic>E. coli</italic> strains were cultured in (LuriaâBertani) medium, and protein expression was induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl Î²-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside at 30Â°C for 8 hr. Cells were harvested and disrupted by sonication on ice bath, then supernatants and precipitates were isolated by centrifugation at 21,000 g for 15 min.

The KD values were calculated using a steady affinity state model by the BIAcore T200 evaluation software (version 3.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>ELISpot assays</title><p>Splenocytes were freshly isolated from immunized mice of each group. Influenza-specific IgG ASCs were enumerated with ELISpot. MultiScreen HTS 96-well plates were coated with purified NMH at a concentration of 5 Î¼g/mL in PBS to detect antigens specific ASCs, or coated with split viruses of H1N1 and H3N2 at a concentration of 5 Î¼g/mL in PBS to detect influenza virus-specific ASCs. Wells coated with PBS served as negative controls. Plates were incubated overnight at 4Â°C and blocked with complete medium for 2 hr at 37Â°C. Then splenocytes were added into triplicate wells (500,000 cells/well) and incubated at 37Â°C for 20 hr. Plates were vigorously washed to remove cells, and then incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG overnight at 4Â°C. The spots representing the IgG ASCs in each well were counted by inspection. Nonspecific spots detected in the negative control (PBS) wells were subtracted from the counts of each total ASCs.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Tony Moody (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors have immunized mice three times every two weeks. The usual current influenza vaccine is immunized twice against mice to test its efficacy. The authors should discuss the comparison of the effectiveness of the current vaccine and theirs.</p><p>2) They conducted a cytometric bead array to calculate immunoglobulin subclasses in sera presented in Figure 3. In the control group on Day 100, the MFI of IgG2b is reduced compared to other time points. They should calculate the absolute amount of IgG2b, not MFI, by using standard.</p><p>3) The data on neutralization assays in Figure 4 is not sufficiently convincing. The authors should perform neutralization assays for H1N1 and H3N2 and other strains to prove that their vaccine candidate is effective against a wide range of influenza viruses. Also, they should conduct a statistical test to show significant differences.</p><p>4) The ELISA and Biacore assay indicate that the binding capacity of the antibodies induced by vaccination is higher against H2, H5, and H9 than H1, H3, and H7. They should discuss this.</p><p>5) Examining T cell responses is very important. The T-cell responses induced by NMHC are not different from those induced by SEC2 alone in Figure 8. Hence, the authors should verify whether the induced T cell response is indeed influenza antigen-specific or not. Specifically, cytokine production should be detected after stimulating splenocytes of post-immunized mice with influenza antigens without SEC2 and SEC2 alone.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>To make cross-protective vaccines for influenza, authors have made recombinant proteins composed of influenza conserved epitopes and super-antigen and examined. Particularly, they seemed to wish to show up the importance of fusion of super-antigen and viral antigen, although authors already demonstrated this concept in a previous paper by using another system.</p><p>Ab and T cell responses were analyzed which is good. But, every data are superficial; for instance, authors have not examined which epitopes Abs recognize, and which epitopes T cell recognize. Hence, this study does not have a significant impact.</p><p>In this study, Li and colleagues generated a novel recombinant protein NMHC as a potential candidate of universal broad-spectrum vaccine for various influenza virus prevention and therapy. The NMHC protein consisted of two domains. One is NMH domain consisting of influenza viral highly conserved long Î±-helix regions of HA from group 1 and group 2, NP (two epitopes of CTL and helper T lymphocytes) and M2e fragments as universal immunogen. The other is SEC2 domain as adjuvant-like molecular chaperone for enhancing the antigenicity of NMH. This vaccine strategy sounds interesting and promising and it certainly seemed that SEC2 domain increased ability of mice to protect against influenza viruses by enhancing the immune response for NMH domain. However, as shown below, in some respects, there seemed to be a lack of data and interpretation about the significance of incorporating all the elements as one domain.</p><p>I agree that the NP and M2 sequences are highly conserved across influenza virus subtypes, but it is necessary to validate the conservativeness more carefully about the peptide sequences used in NMH domain with the information of predicted binding ability to MHC (class I or II) by a tool like NetMHC. In particular, since the T epitope is greatly affected by even one amino acid difference, so please compare the typical influenza virus strains from H 1 (2009 pandemic type), H1 (Russian type or PR8), H2, H5, H3, H7, and H9 subtypes. This information seems to be important in considering the breadth of vaccine effect. If authors think HA2 element also includes conserved T cell epitopes covering various HA subtypes, please analyze together.</p><p>Probably it's being evaluated as an initial basic data, but it seems important to mention the author's interpretation about the importance of NP and Me2 elements in NMH protein. Especially, if authors think these elements also have critical role, it is necessary to show the data how NP or Me2 elements in NMHC protein work effectively for immune response by comparing with NP or Me2 elements excluded protein. In particular, these data seem to be important for considering the specific antigen for T cell-B cell interaction in Figure 7 and the antigen specificity of CD4 T cells activated by NMHC immunogen in Figure 8.</p><p>The authors mentioned that HA2 element in NMH domain is important for the induction of broadly cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies. However, antibodies or memory/GC B cells induced by NMHC immunization have not been evaluated at the single clone or single cell level. In particular, if authors think that connecting of each long Î±-helix region from H1, H3 and H7 HA in tandem as one domain has some advantages, for example it will increase the number of clones that can react to both grou1 and group2 strains, the experimental data is necessary. Anyway because the lacking of the data and interpretation for this point, it is difficult to evaluate the broadness of cross-reactive antibody induced by HA2 element in NMH domain. At least I would like authors to explain more carefully about this point (broadly cross reactivity at the level of single clone of antibody or single cell).</p><p>Regarding Figure 4 and 10-12. The authors mentioned in discussion part that it is very hard to use other strains except some restricted ones in your institute. However, H1N1 strains used in these figures are basically very closed to 2009 pandemic California strain used in NMH domain. If you want to show the antibodies induced recombinant proteins have broadly cross reactivity and protection, it is important to test the strains far from 2009 pandemic strains like representative laboratory strains PR8(H1N1) or RG14 (H5N1 *BSL2 strain). If it is impossible to use even these kinds of laboratory strains, authors should design the H1 Î±-helix regions in NMH domain from distant strains like H2, H5 or PR8(H1). On the other hand, in the case of H3N2 A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 strain, it is away from A/Hong Kong/1/1968(This HA is used in X31 laboratory strain). So it seems to be enough.</p><p>Regarding Figure 8. In this manuscript, authors did not touch the germinal center story like GC B cells or Tfh cells at all but these kinds of cells are very important in considering humoral immunity like affinity maturation of broadly cross reactive antibodies. So some information about Tfh marker like Bcl6, IL21 or interpretation about the germinal center reaction seem important at least even if it is difficult to perform detailed flow cytometry analysis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This paper aims to provide a novel universal influenza vaccine that could induce broad protection against various influenza viruses. For this purpose, the authors designed a new vaccine candidate who is composed of the conserved fragments of nucleoprotein (two epitopes of CTL and helper T lymphocytes), matrix protein 2, highly conserved long Î±-helix regions of hemagglutinin from group 1 (H1), and group 2 (H3 and H7), and superantigen Staphylococcal Enterotoxin C2, which is named NMHC. They showed that NMHC induces not only antibody production but also T-cell responses. The induced antibodies could bind broad rHA proteins and neutralize H1N1 1A/Michigan/45/2015 (group 1) and H3N2 A/Hong Kong/ 4801/2014 (group 2) viruses.</p><p>Their proposal is potentially interesting. However, the quality of the results is not sufficient enough to support their conclusion. They concluded that NMHC is a potential candidate for the universal broad-spectrum vaccine for various influenza virus prevention, whereas few data about protection against strains other than H1N1 and H3N2. In addition, there is no comparison to the effectiveness of current vaccines. Neutralization assays not only for H1N1 and H3N2 but also for other strains would strengthen their proposal. If it is difficult to use alive viruses for this purpose, it is recommended to use a simple experimental system such as pseudotyped viruses. For CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell analysis, various cytokines were induced even in superantigen alone. The authors should show the specificity for T-cell responses against influenza antigens.</p><p>1) The authors have immunized mice three times every two weeks.

I guess that one of the two is IgG2a. Please correct the figure.</p><p>7) There is no match between each KD shown in Figure 6 and the KD in the text.</p><p>8) The sentence &quot;IL-4 (for Th1 subtype), IFN-Î³ (for Th2 subtype)&quot; should be corrected to &quot;IFN-Î³ (for Th1 subtype), IL-4 (for Th2 subtype)&quot; (Page 34, Line 558).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This manuscript describes a vaccine construct comprised of multiple segments derived from influenza proteins, and in some cases conjugated to staphylococcal enterotoxin C2. There is an impressive amount of data and the workup of the immune response is quite detailed, including humoral, cellular, and protection data in mice. Overall, the impression is that this construct has the potential to move forward as a vaccine candidate. In addition, the provided data support their conclusions.</p><p>The data are clearly presented in most sections, and I am impressed that in places where multiple replicates were performed, the authors listed the number of replicates and the statistical measures.</p><p>The grammar of the manuscript needs work, and the text would benefit from copy-editing at a minimum and might even benefit from editing for length in some sections.</p><p>In some places, I would probably have presented some of the data differently. For example, I typically display bead-based antibody binding assays on a logarithmic scale which is more in line with the type of data shown. That being said, there is nothing deceptive in how the data are presented, so a change may not be necessary.</p><p>I do not recommend additional experimentation. I do think that moving this candidate forward through regulatory bodies may face significant hurdles, but that is not the problem being addressed in this paper.</p><p>Finally, I think Figure 13 is really more suited to a review article and not appropriate for this manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71725.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors have immunized mice three times every two weeks.

In fact, in our preliminary experiment, we have optimized the dosage and immune frequency of NMHC by detecting the H1N1 and H3N2 specific IgG by ELISA. Based on the result in <xref ref-type="table" rid="sa2table1">Author response table 1</xref>, we chose a dose of 200 Î¼g each time and each mice for three immunizations in order to achieve a better immune effect. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of this recombinant vaccine strategy, and three immunizations for recombinant influenza vaccine have been frequently reported by researchers such as Joan E. M (doi:10.1038/s41541-018-0063-7), Raffael Nachbagauer (doi:10.1038/npjvaccines.2016.15) and John Steel (doi: 10.1128/mBio.00018-10). As you mentioned, the usual current influenza vaccine is immunized twice against mice. Most of the usual current influenza vaccines are inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccines (QIV) which are more immunogenic than the recombinant vaccine. So two immunizations might be enough for QIV but not for recombinant vaccine. As shown in the supplementary materials (Table S1), the neutralizing antibodies induced by QIV could be effectively detected by HI test but not induced by the recombinant vaccine.</p><table-wrap id="sa2table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><caption><title>The antibody titers in preliminary experiment.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Treatment groups(Î¼g)</th><th>Serum antibody titer(H1N1)</th><th>Serum antibody titer(H3N2)</th><th/><th/><th/><th/></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">200 NMHC 3rd</td><td align="left" valign="top">&gt;2048</td><td align="left" valign="top">&gt;2048</td><td align="left" valign="top">&gt;2048</td><td align="left" valign="top">1024</td><td align="left" valign="top">1024</td><td align="left" valign="top">1024</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">100 NMHC 3rd</td><td align="left" valign="top">1024</td><td align="left" valign="top">&gt;2048</td><td align="left" valign="top">1024</td><td align="left" valign="top">256</td><td align="left" valign="top">256</td><td align="left" valign="top">256</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">200 NMHC 2nd</td><td align="left" valign="top">1024</td><td align="left" valign="top">1024</td><td align="left" valign="top">1024</td><td align="left" valign="top">256</td><td align="left" valign="top">512</td><td align="left" valign="top">256</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">100 NMHC 2nd</td><td align="left" valign="top">512</td><td align="left" valign="top">1024</td><td align="left" valign="top">512</td><td align="left" valign="top">256</td><td align="left" valign="top">128</td><td align="left" valign="top">128</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) They conducted a cytometric bead array to calculate immunoglobulin subclasses in sera presented in Figure 3.

According to the instruction manual of Mouse Immunoglobulin Isotyping Kit (Cat. No.550026), we used the MFI, the original data, to represent the amount of immunoglobulins.

According to your suggestion, we have supplemented neutralization assays for H1N1 A/Brisbane/02/2018 and H3N2 A/Kansas/14/2017 using the same batch of frozen serum samples which were used in neutralization assays for H1N1 A/Michigan/45/2015 and H3N2 A/Hong Kong/ 4801/2014 in our original manuscript. These four strains are all the living influenza virus strains we can obtain in current situation. We are so sorry that we have not been allowed to obtain any other living influenza virus strains to further verify the broad spectrum of NMHC. We agree that neutralization assays for these four strains were not enough to say that NMHC was effective against a wide range of influenza viruses. Therefore, we used the ELISA and Biacore assays, selected the HA fragments of representative influenza virus subtypes, to evaluate the broad binding properties of antibodies induced by NMHC. According to your advice, we reanalyzed the results of neutralization assays and conducted a statistical test to show significant differences by geometric mean titer (GMT).

As described in Materials and methods part in our manuscript, in the ELISA and Biacore assays, H2, H5, H7, and H9 were commercial recombinant HA proteins, while H1 and H3 were split viruses. It might be that the complex composition and conformation of the split viruses led to the relatively lower binding capacities to H1 and H3 in the ELISA and Biacore results. As to H7, we can see from the Table S2, the ELISA endpoint titers calculated from Figure 5, showed that the titer of H7 induced by NMHC was the same with titers of H2, H5, and H9.</p><p>Theoretically, the long Î±-helix regions of hemagglutinin (amino acids 76â130 from the HA2) were conserved among H1, H2, H3, H5, H7, and H9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>), so the binding capacities of antibodies induced by NMHC to these HAs should be similar.

As you mentioned, the T-cell responses in figure 8 was not antigen-specific because that the T cells had not been treated with any antigens in vitro. According to your advice, we have repeated the animal immunization experiment to detect the IL-4 and IFN-Î³ cytokine production after stimulating splenocytes of post-immunized mice with NMH without SEC2 and SEC2 alone. In brief, female wild-type BALB/c mice were respectively immunized with 200 Î¼g NMHC, 100 Î¼g NMH, 100 Î¼g SEC2, 100 Î¼g NMH plus 100 Î¼g SEC2, and PBS (control) by i.p. for three times with interval of 14 days. Two weeks after the third immunization, splenocytes from each group were collected and treated with 1000 ng/mL SEC2 alone or 1000 ng/mL NMH alone, and PBS was served as CK. Then, the culture supernatants were harvested at 48 h to detect the production of IL-4 and IFNÎ³ by ELISA following the manufacturerâs instructions. In Figure 8C the results showed that, in NMHC, NMH<sup>+</sup>SEC2 and NMH immunized groups, the productions of IL-4 and IFN-Î³ treated with NMH were significantly higher than CK (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), while SEC2 and PBS immunized groups didn't show significant changes. This result verified that the T cell response induced by NMH treatment is influenza antigen-specific. However, the splenocytes from all of the immunized groups produced high levels of IL-4 and IFN-Î³ after SEC2 treatment in vitro, and there were no significant differences among the five immunized groups. As a superantigen, SEC2 could induce nonspecific T cell responses, leading to massive production of cytokine. According to your comment, we have added this supplementary experiment and results to our revised manuscript, and added to Figure 8C in our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>To make cross-protective vaccines for influenza, authors have made recombinant proteins composed of influenza conserved epitopes and super-antigen and examined. Particularly, they seemed to wish to show up the importance of fusion of super-antigen and viral antigen, although authors already demonstrated this concept in a previous paper by using another system.</p><p>Ab and T cell responses were analyzed which is good. But, every data are superficial; for instance, authors have not examined which epitopes Abs recognize, and which epitopes T cell recognize. Hence, this study does not have a significant impact.</p><p>In this study, Li and colleagues generated a novel recombinant protein NMHC as a potential candidate of universal broad-spectrum vaccine for various influenza virus prevention and therapy. The NMHC protein consisted of two domains. One is NMH domain consisting of influenza viral highly conserved long Î±-helix regions of HA from group 1 and group 2, NP (two epitopes of CTL and helper T lymphocytes) and M2e fragments as universal immunogen. The other is SEC2 domain as adjuvant-like molecular chaperone for enhancing the antigenicity of NMH. This vaccine strategy sounds interesting and promising and it certainly seemed that SEC2 domain increased ability of mice to protect against influenza viruses by enhancing the immune response for NMH domain. However, as shown below, in some respects, there seemed to be a lack of data and interpretation about the significance of incorporating all the elements as one domain.</p><p>I agree that the NP and M2 sequences are highly conserved across influenza virus subtypes, but it is necessary to validate the conservativeness more carefully about the peptide sequences used in NMH domain with the information of predicted binding ability to MHC (class I or II) by a tool like NetMHC. In particular, since the T epitope is greatly affected by even one amino acid difference, so please compare the typical influenza virus strains from H 1 (2009 pandemic type), H1 (Russian type or PR8), H2, H5, H3, H7, and H9 subtypes. This information seems to be important in considering the breadth of vaccine effect. If authors think HA2 element also includes conserved T cell epitopes covering various HA subtypes, please analyze together.</p></disp-quote><p>It have been extensively studied that both NP and M2e fragments are conserved antigens inducing cellular or humoral immune responses (Tamar Ben-Yedidia et al., DOI: 10.1016/j.vaccine.2005.08.061, Neirynck et al. DOI: 10.1038/13484, Marina et al. DOI: 10.1016/j.vaccine.2005.08.061). In our study, NMH also contained the NP and M2e elements, and the conservativeness about the peptide sequences used in NMH domain has been validated using the online computational MHC binding prediction tool called TepiTool (http://tools.iedb.org/tepitool/.). All peptide lengths (8-14) were predicted for their binding affinity to 6 alleles of MHC I and 3 alleles of MHC II. A panel of 6 MHC I (H-2-Db, H-2-Dd, H-2-Kb, H-2-Kd, H-2-Kk, H-2-Ld) and a panel of 3 MHC II (H-2-IAb, H-2-IAd, H-2-IEd) were selected.

Especially, if authors think these elements also have critical role, it is necessary to show the data how NP or Me2 elements in NMHC protein work effectively for immune response by comparing with NP or Me2 elements excluded protein. In particular, these data seem to be important for considering the specific antigen for T cell-B cell interaction in Figure 7 and the antigen specificity of CD4 T cells activated by NMHC immunogen in Figure 8.</p></disp-quote><p>The roles of conserved epitopes in influenza A virus, especially NP and M2e, in design of broad-spectrum influenza vaccine have been widely studied (Wang Wenling et al., doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0052488; Raffael Nachbagauer et al., doi:10.1038/npjvaccines; Taia T. Wanga et al., DOI: 10.1073/pnas). In our manuscript, NMH and NMHC are designed based on these previous studies. We think that both NP and M2e are surely important. We are very sorry that we did not compare the results of NP or M2e excluded protein. NMHC consists of NP, M2e, three different HA2 fragments and SEC2 connected by flexible linker (GSAGSAG).</p><p>Our main aim is to explore whether the vaccine strategy is feasible. The structural modeling of NMHC in silico revealed that the elements of NP, M2e, HA2(H1, H3, H7) and SEC2 were independent from each other (Figure 1D in the manuscript), and these immunogens could play their respective functions. We are more concerned about the role of SEC2 in enhancing the protective effect induced by NMH. As showed in Figure 7 and Figure 8 in our revised manuscript, the introduction of SEC2 enhanced the T cell-B cell interaction and the antigen specificity of CD4 T cells activated by NMH. We agree that it is important to show the data how NP, M2e or HA2 elements in NMHC protein work effectively for immune responses. However, it is hard to test every element or any combination of these elements deeply in the limited time and space.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors mentioned that HA2 element in NMH domain is important for the induction of broadly cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies. However, antibodies or memory/GC B cells induced by NMHC immunization have not been evaluated at the single clone or single cell level. In particular, if authors think that connecting of each long Î±-helix region from H1, H3 and H7 HA in tandem as one domain has some advantages, for example it will increase the number of clones that can react to both grou1 and group2 strains, the experimental data is necessary. Anyway because the lacking of the data and interpretation for this point, it is difficult to evaluate the broadness of cross-reactive antibody induced by HA2 element in NMH domain. At least I would like authors to explain more carefully about this point (broadly cross reactivity at the level of single clone of antibody or single cell).</p></disp-quote><p>It has been widely proved that the HA2 element could induce broadly cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies. We connected the highly conserved long Î±-helix regions from H1, H3 and H7 HA2 in tandem in order to increase the immunogenicity. However, we don't think this combination is perfect, and the immune responses may change as the HA2 elements sequence and quantity changes. The recombinant protein NMHC is rather an example for this vaccine design strategy than a certain vaccine. The structure of NMHC must be further optimized before it become a candidate vaccine. Here, we initial studied the specific antibody secreting cells responses of HA2 (H1-H3-H7) on NMH, H1N1 and H3N2 with ELISPOT assay (Manuscript Figure 7). Furthermore, we also evaluated the broadness of cross-reactive antibody induced by HA2 element in NMH domain with the ELISA (Manuscript Figure.5) and Biacore (Manuscript Figure.6) assay. In conclusion, these results showed that the combination strategy is feasible, because HA2 elements in NMH domain could induce the broadness of cross-reactive antibody. We are so sorry that we did not supplement the single clone or single cell experiments in the limited time and space available.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding Figure 4 and 10-12. The authors mentioned in discussion part that it is very hard to use other strains except some restricted ones in your institute. However, H1N1 strains used in these figures are basically very closed to 2009 pandemic California strain used in NMH domain. If you want to show the antibodies induced recombinant proteins have broadly cross reactivity and protection, it is important to test the strains far from 2009 pandemic strains like representative laboratory strains PR8(H1N1) or RG14 (H5N1 *BSL2 strain). If it is impossible to use even these kinds of laboratory strains, authors should design the H1 Î±-helix regions in NMH domain from distant strains like H2, H5 or PR8(H1). On the other hand, in the case of H3N2 A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 strain, it is away from A/Hong Kong/1/1968(This HA is used in X31 laboratory strain). So it seems to be enough.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your comments and constructive advices. According to your suggestion, we have supplemented neutralization assays for H1N1 A/Brisbane/02/2018 and H3N2 A/Kansas/14/2017 using the same batch of frozen serum samples which were used in neutralization assays for H1N1 A/Michigan/45/2015 and H3N2 A/Hong Kong/ 4801/2014 in our original manuscript (Figure 4). These four strains are all the living influenza virus strains we can obtain in current situation. We are so sorry that we have not been allowed to obtain any other living influenza virus strains to further verify the broad spectrum of NMHC. We agree that neutralization assays for these four strains were not enough to say that NMHC was effective against a wide range of influenza viruses. Therefore, we used the ELISA and Biacore assay, selected the HA fragments of representative influenza virus subtypes, to evaluate the broad binding properties of antibodies induced by NMHC.

For this purpose, the authors designed a new vaccine candidate who is composed of the conserved fragments of nucleoprotein (two epitopes of CTL and helper T lymphocytes), matrix protein 2, highly conserved long Î±-helix regions of hemagglutinin from group 1 (H1), and group 2 (H3 and H7), and superantigen Staphylococcal Enterotoxin C2, which is named NMHC. They showed that NMHC induces not only antibody production but also T-cell responses. The induced antibodies could bind broad rHA proteins and neutralize H1N1 1A/Michigan/45/2015 (group 1) and H3N2 A/Hong Kong/ 4801/2014 (group 2) viruses.</p><p>Their proposal is potentially interesting. However, the quality of the results is not sufficient enough to support their conclusion. They concluded that NMHC is a potential candidate for the universal broad-spectrum vaccine for various influenza virus prevention, whereas few data about protection against strains other than H1N1 and H3N2. In addition, there is no comparison to the effectiveness of current vaccines. Neutralization assays not only for H1N1 and H3N2 but also for other strains would strengthen their proposal. If it is difficult to use alive viruses for this purpose, it is recommended to use a simple experimental system such as pseudotyped viruses. For CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell analysis, various cytokines were induced even in superantigen alone. The authors should show the specificity for T-cell responses against influenza antigens.</p><p>1) The authors have immunized mice three times every two weeks.

Based on the result in <xref ref-type="table" rid="sa2table1">Author response table 1</xref>, we chose a dose of 200 Î¼g each time and each mice for three immunizations in order to achieve a better immune effect. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of this recombinant vaccine strategy, and three immunizations for recombinant influenza vaccine have been frequently reported by researchers such as Joan E.

As described in Materials and methods part in our manuscript, in the ELISA and Biacore assays, H2, H5, H7, and H9 were commercial recombinant HA proteins, while H1 and H3 were split viruses.

As you mentioned, the T-cell responses in figure 8 was not antigen-specific because that the T cells had not been treated with any antigens in vitro. According to your advice, we have repeated the animal immunization experiment to detect the IL-4 and IFN-Î³ cytokine production after stimulating splenocytes of post-immunized mice with NMH without SEC2 and SEC2 alone. In brief, female wild-type BALB/c mice were respectively immunized with 200 Î¼g NMHC, 100 Î¼g NMH, 100 Î¼g SEC2, 100 Î¼g NMH plus 100 Î¼g SEC2, and PBS (control) by i.p. for three times with interval of 14 days. Two weeks after the third immunization, splenocytes from each group were collected and treated with 1000 ng/mL SEC2 alone or 1000 ng/mL NMH alone, and PBS was served as CK. Then, the culture supernatants were harvested at 48 h to detect the production of IL-4 and IFNÎ³ by ELISA following the manufacturerâs instructions. In figure 8C, the results showed that, in NMHC, NMH<sup>+</sup>SEC2 and NMH immunized groups, the productions of IL-4 and IFN-Î³ treated with NMH were significantly higher than CK (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), while SEC2 and PBS immunized groups didn't show significant changes.

However, the splenocytes from all of the immunized groups produced high levels of IL-4 and IFN-Î³ after SEC2 treatment in vitro, and there were no significant differences among the five immunized groups. As a superantigen, SEC2 could induce nonspecific T cell responses, leading to massive production of cytokine.
