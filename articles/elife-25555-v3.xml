In mammalian cells, the ER is degraded via a selective autophagy pathway (ER-phagy), mediated by two specific receptors: FAM134B, responsible for the turnover of ER sheets and SEC62 that regulates ER recovery following stress. Here, we identified reticulon 3 (RTN3) as a specific receptor for the degradation of ER tubules. Oligomerization of the long isoform of RTN3 is sufficient to trigger fragmentation of ER tubules. The long N-terminal region of RTN3 contains several newly identified LC3-interacting regions (LIR). Binding to LC3s/GABARAPs is essential for the fragmentation of ER tubules and their delivery to lysosomes. RTN3-mediated ER-phagy requires conventional autophagy components, but is independent of FAM134B. None of the other reticulon family members have the ability to induce fragmentation of ER tubules during starvation. Therefore, we assign a unique function to RTN3 during autophagy.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25555.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25555.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>selective autophagy</kwd><kwd>endoplasmic reticulum</kwd><kwd>RTN3</kwd><kwd>reticulon</kwd><kwd>autophagy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Collaborative Research Center on Selective Autophagy SFB1177</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Müller</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name><name><surname>Heilemann</surname><given-names>Mike</given-names></name><name><surname>Dikic</surname><given-names>Ivan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Cluster of Excellence Goethe University Frankfurt am Main</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EXC 115</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heilemann</surname><given-names>Mike</given-names></name><name><surname>Dikic</surname><given-names>Ivan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>LOEWE programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Network Ub-Net</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Müller</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name><name><surname>Dikic</surname><given-names>Ivan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>LOEWE Center for Gene and Cell Therapy Frankfurt</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CGT</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dikic</surname><given-names>Ivan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>7.FP, COFUND, Goethe International Postdoc Program GO-IN</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>No 291776</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grumati</surname><given-names>Paolo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>SNF Sinergia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRSII#_154421</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reggiori</surname><given-names>Fulvio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001826</institution-id><institution>ZonMw</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>VICI (016.130.606)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reggiori</surname><given-names>Fulvio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Marie Sklodowska-Curie Cofund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reggiori</surname><given-names>Fulvio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Full length RTN3 homodimerization mediates ER tubules fragmentation and their subsequent delivery to lysosome.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the most abundant membranous structure in the cell. It is a continuous membrane system that extends from the nuclear envelope throughout the cytosol where it forms the peripheral ER, which is a complex interconnected network of sheets, tubules and matrices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nixon-Abell et al., 2016</xref>). The ER is an extremely dynamic organelle; its different subdomains are constantly remodeled in shape and total volume in order to fulfill cellular needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shibata et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Friedman and Voeltz, 2011</xref>). Sheets and tubular-like networks are characterized by the presence and the collaboration of specific proteins. For example, CLIMP-63 (microtubule-binding 63 kDa cytoskeleton-linking membrane protein) localizes specifically to ER sheets (cisternae), while reticulon domain-containing proteins (RTN1 to 4) are concentrated at ER tubules. Since the reticulon domain has the ability to bend membranes, the ER shape depends on the concentration of these resident proteins and can undergo rapid structural changes in response to various environmental cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Voeltz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shibata et al., 2010</xref>). ER plasticity and the fine morphological organization of the ER support the plethora of different biological functions in which it is involved. Among others, The ER is responsible for, the biosynthesis of secretory and membrane proteins, lipids and steroids, the regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis, and the formation of functional contact sites with other organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borgese et al., 2006</xref>). The ER is also the essential site for quality control of newly synthesized proteins of the secretory pathway. The ER contains two interconnected quality control pathways: the unfolded protein response (UPR) and the ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) story. UPR activation increases the folding capacity of the ER, while the ERAD system recognizes terminally misfolded proteins and facilitates their retro-translocation into the cytoplasm where they are degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>). In this way, the ER maintains the flow of protein synthesis, folding and clearance. The ER is also actively involved in the second major degradative system of the cell: the autophagy-lysosome pathway. Autophagy is a catabolic process characterized by the formation of a double membrane structure, named autophagosome, which engulfs portions of the cytosol (like protein aggregates and organelles) and delivers them to the lysosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tooze and Yoshimori, 2010</xref>). Being the largest membranous organelle, the ER functions as the major membranes source for autophagosome formation. The nucleation of the double membrane, which is destinated to become an autophagome, takes place in specific compartments of the ER defined as omegasomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biazik et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, the ER has a double fate in autophagy. It initiates the process but is itself falls victim to selective autophagy, which regulats ER turnover (ER-phagy) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Khaminets et al., 2015</xref>). Critical determinants for selective autophagy pathways are cargo receptors, which are able to simultaneously bind the designated cargo and LC3 modifiers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rogov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stolz et al., 2014</xref>). In this manner, selective autophagy ensures the timely and specific removal of unwanted cellular components. So far, in mammals, two different ER resident proteins have been described as receptors for ER-phagy: FAM134B and SEC62 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Khaminets et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fumagalli et al., 2016</xref>). FAM134B is a member of the reticulon-homology-domain-containing FAM134 family and is mainly localized to the edges of the ER sheets. FAM134B binds MAP1LC3B via its LC3 interacting region (LIR) and at the same time to fragmented ER sheets and coalesces them into vesicles, which are subsequently degraded by lysosomes. Depletion of FAM134B causes an abnormal expansion of ER sheets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Khaminets et al., 2015</xref>). In humans, truncation mutations in the <italic>FAM134B</italic> gene are responsible for a severe sensory neuropathy (HSANII) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kurth et al., 2009</xref>). SEC62 is a subunit of the translocon complex and functions as an autophagy receptor during recovery from ER stress. It promotes the selective clearance of excessive membrane portions to preserve proper ER structure and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fumagalli et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Here we identify RTN3 as a new ER-phagy receptor responsible for the selective degradation of ER tubules. An increase in the local concentration of RTN3, facilitates its oligomerization, which is sufficient to induce fragmentation of ER tubules and their subsequent lysosomal degradation in an autophagy-dependent manner. The large amino-terminal domain of RTN3, which is present in the long isoforms, contains several LIR domains and confers this, newly-identified, biological function to RTN3. Indeed, this N-terminal region is unique for each reticulon and the other members of the RTN protein family do not possess the ability to facilitate the degradation of ER tubules.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RTN3 promotes fragmentation of ER tubules under starvation</title><p>FAM134B was the first ER-specific autophagy receptor identified. Its topology revealed a reticulon-like domain composed of a cytosolic linker region that connects two hairpin helixes (Reticulon homology domain; RHD), which anchor the protein to ER membranes, particularly to ER sheets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The N-terminal and C-terminal domains both face the cytosolic compartment and the longer C-terminal domain presents a LIR motif responsible for the binding to MAP1LC3B and necessary to facilitate ER-phagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Khaminets et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Thus far, FAM134B and the subsequently identified SEC62 are the only characterized ER-phagy receptors in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Khaminets et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fumagalli et al., 2016</xref>). However, these two proteins preferentially reside in ER sheets, while the ER is divided into functionally separated structures characterized by the presence of specialized proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shibata et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Friedman and Voeltz, 2011</xref>). We, therefore, investigated if different ER-phagy receptors exist and if they are specific for other ER compartments, in particular the ER tubules. In addition to FAM134, there are other ER resident protein families containing RHDs; one of these is the reticulon family consisting of RTN1-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The family structure is rather complex, due to the presence of an elevated number of splicing isoforms for each RTN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). All of the splicing products share the reticulon domain (RHD) as well as the very short C-terminal domain, while the major variations reside in the N-terminal domain, which represents the majority of the protein within the long isoforms. We chose to analyze one long and one short isoform of each RTN and generated eight different U2OS cell lines expressing the various RTNs under the control of a doxycycline inducible promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). Twenty-four hours after induction of protein expression, we monitored whether RTN isoforms influence the morphology of ER tubules or deliver parts of them to the lysosome for degradation upon starvation (EBSS medium + Bafilomycin A1 treatment). A confocal microscopy-based screen demonstrated that all four RTNs, independently of their isoform, were able to form a defined and continuous tubular ER network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>). In addition to tubules, RTN2 overexpression was reported to promote the formation of several punctuate structures, mediated by its interaction with ER morphogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Montenegro et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>). Upon autophagy induction, LC3B-positive puncta accumulated in the cytosol of all RTN expressing cell lines. Of note, only in the RTN3L over-expressing cells, the morphology of RTN3 decorated tubules was affected. This was evident as soon as 2 hr of starvation, but was more apparent after 4 hr and especially 6 hr. ER tubules formed by RTN3L lost their distinct morphology and progressively fragmented into smaller pieces. Strikingly, there was an almost complete co-localization between these RTN3L-decorated ER fragments and LC3B staining. Importantly, none of the other reticulons (RTN1, RTN2 and RTN4) nor the short isoform of RTN3 had either the ability to induce ER fragmentation or co-localized with LC3B puncta under conditions of starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A and B</xref>). The effective co-localization between RTN3L and LC3B was further visualized by super-resolution microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heilemann et al., 2008</xref>), which allowed us to focus directly on the RTN3L-decorated structures. Super-resolution images show distinct RTN3L and LC3B clusters of about 0.5 µm with a high degree of co-localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A</xref>). Moreover, even at the endogenous levels, LC3B-labeled ER fragments were positive for RTN3 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5B and C</xref>). We further confirmed that the RTN3L-decorated fragments co-localize with endogenous ER protein markers CALNEXIN, BSCL2 and REEP5, under standard growth conditions and during starvation, indicating that they correspond to discrete portions of the ER. Of note, RTN3L staining always overlies with the ER tubular protein REEP5, while no co-localisation was observed with the ER sheet protein CLIMP-63 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5D</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25555.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>RTN3 over-expression induces ER tubules fragmentation during starvation.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Schematic representation of the protein structure and topology of FAM134B (<bold>A</bold>) and RTN3 long and short isoforms (<bold>B</bold>).

We, therefore, investigated the potential role of RTN3L clustering with itself or with RTN3S in the fragmentation of ER tubules. To this end, we used a regulated homo/hetero-dimerization system. U2OS cells were co-transfected with FRB-FLAG-RTN3L along with FKBP-HA-RTN3L or FKBP-HA-RTN3S. The FRB domain [T2098L] (modified FKBP12-rapamycin-binding domain of human mTOR kinase) is fused to the N-terminal part of RTN3L while the FKBP domain (two tandem repeats of full length human FK506 binding protein-12) is fused to the N-terminus of RTN3L and RTN3S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Twenty-four-hour post transfection, Rapalog compound was added for 2 hr to the normal growing media (DMEM 10% FBS) in order to promote FKBP-FRB linkage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Over-expression of the single plasmids as well as the co-transfection of FRB-FLAG-RTN3L together with FKBP-HA-RTN3L or FKBP-HA-RTN3S, in the absence of Rapalog, did not particularly affect the ER morphology except that ER membrane tubulation was promoted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). On the contrary, the addition of Rapalog caused a significant change in ER morphology without affecting the autophagy flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B and D</xref>). The homo-dimerization of RTN3L promoted the fragmentation of ER tubules, in a similar way to that previously observed with RTN3L over-expression during EBSS starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Notably, tubule fragments of the ER were labeled with LC3B 1 hr following EBSS starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In contrast, the hetero-dimerization of RTN3L and RTN3S enhanced ER membrane tubulation rather than fragmentation. Indeed, ER tubules appeared longer and thicker in RTN3L and RTN3S transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Co-staining of RTN3L fragments and RTN3S large tubules with CALNEXIN, BSCL2 and REEP5 confirmed that these structures were discrete portions of ER. Of note, CLIMP-63 labeling did not co-localized with RTN3 highlighting that RTN3L fragments were exclusively portions of ER tubules and not ER sheets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25555.008</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>RTN3L homo-dimerization induces ER tubules fragmentation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of 2XFKBP-HA-RTN3L, 2XFKBP-HA-RTN3S and FRB-FLAG-RTN3L plasmids.

Autophagosomes are fined structures and are therefore unable to sequester the vast ER network. Consequently, the ER architecture has to be, at least in part, disassembled in order to permit delivery of ER membrane fragments into lysosomes ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Khaminets et al., 2015</xref>]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). To follow the fate of RTN3L-induced ER tubule fragments, we immuno-stained lysosomes with anti-LAMP1 antibody in HA-RTN3L expressing cells after 6 hr of nutrient starvation. Confocal microscopy showed that ER fragments, generated under these conditions, were localized to the interior of LAMP1-positive lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Similarly, ER fragments, obtained from the forced homo-dimerization of RTN3L, were degraded via lysosomes already after 1 hr EBSS treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Super-resolution microscopy imaging of U2OS RTN3L cells, which were nutrient starved for 6 hr in the presence of Bafilomycin A1, revealed that lysosomal membranes positive for LAMP1 formed a non-homogeneous nanoscale meshwork around RTN3L and ER fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B</xref>). Next, we fused RTN3L to mCherry-EGFP double tag, which allows to follow the turnover of autophagy substrates and receptors in lysosomes, to monitor the delivery of RTN3L into lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kirkin et al., 2009</xref>). In this system, lysosomal cargo delivery and degradation coincide with the appearance of mCherry-positive and EGFP-negative puncta, as the mCherry fluorescent signal is stable in the acidic milieu of lysosomes while GFP is not. HeLa cells stably expressing mCherry-EGFP-tagged RTN3L showed a clear formation of mCherry-positive, EGFP-negative puncta upon nutrient starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4C</xref>). Notably, none of the other RTNs nor RTN3S were detected inside LAMP1-positive lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). To further investigate the nature of the ER fragments in the autolysosomes, we performed immuno-electron-microscopy (IEM) analysis. We double labeled cryo-section from U2OS RTN3L cells, which were either grown in presence of nutrients or EBSS starved for 6 hr in EBSS supplemented with bafilomycin A1, with antibodies against the HA tag, to detect RTN3L, or the KDEL sequence, which is present in numerous ER resident proteins, and the endolysosomal protein CD63. Only after EBSS treatment, we could detect ER membranes positive for KDEL and HA-RTN3 inside autolysosomes labeled with the CD63 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref> – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5A and B</xref>).

Cells expressing RTN proteins and control cells were SILAC-labeled and treated with doxycycline for 24 hr and bafilomycin A1 for 4 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). All four RTN proteins shared the majority of the significant interacting partners with one or more of their family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 5—source data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">2</xref>). First, we observed that the four RTN proteins had one or more peptides of the other RTNs or a peptide of their own isoform as the most enriched peptides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). The high level of interconnection among the different RTNs and their isoforms was further validated by co-immuno-precipitation after the over-expression of the respective RTNs in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). The short isoforms of RTN1, RTN2, RTN3 and RTN4 had a smaller number of interacting partners, but at the same time their interactors were assigned to biological functions with the highest similarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 5—source data 2</xref>). The long isoforms had more extended and variable interactomes although they still shared a majority of the identified partners and clusters of proteins responsible for the same biological functions. The relative number of peptides belonging to the same protein complex or signaling pathway varied amongst the RTN proteins contributing to the uniqueness of their respective interactome. Notably, the peculiarities found within the interactome were specific not only to the four unique RTN members, but were also present within isoforms of the same RTN protein. For instance, there were several examples where the amino terminal domain of the long isoforms gained new interactors that could potentially confer a unique biological function to that specific protein. RTN2L was the only reticulon that interacted with the serine palmitoyltransferase enzymatic complex. Moreover, several ubiquitin ligases and ubiquitin-related proteins like SQSTM1 and KEAP1, which are also involved in the autophagy pathway, were found to be unique interactors of RTN2L. Of note, RTN4L showed a particular affinity for ubiquitin ligases like RNF41 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). However, RTN3L was the only reticulon found to interact with the classical autophagy modifier, GABARAP-L1. Moreover, RTN3L interactors included several other unique proteins linked to the vesicular transport system and Cullin-RING-based E3 ligase complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). The interaction between RTN3L and GABARAP-L1 hinted at the role of this reticulon member as an autophagy receptor. Immuno-precipitation of endogenous GABARAP and GABARAP-L1, in cells overexpressing different RTN isoforms, confirmed their unique interaction with the long isoform of RTN3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Moreover, we further verified the interaction between RTN3 and GABARAP on endogenous level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25555.019</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>RTN3 interacts with the autophagy modifiers.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Venn diagrams of the interactors of the four RTNs.

However, RTN members, especially the long isoforms, also interact with their own unique set of proteins. In particular, RTN3L is the only reticulon that directly binds to the members of the LC3s/GABARAPs family. This further confirms that the long isoform of RTN3 acts as a receptor for selective autophagy of ER tubules.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>The amino-terminal domain of RTN3 is required for binding to LC3s/GABARAPs</title><p>To further characterize the interaction of RTN3L with LC3B and GABARAP-L1, we performed in vitro pull-down experiments using GST-tagged ATG8 protein family members as affinity baits. Both endogenous RTN3 and overexpressed RTN3L were captured from cell lysates by all six LC3-like modifiers, but not by mono- or tetra-ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In contrast RTN3S, which almost completely lacks the N-terminal region, did not bind any of the LC3s or GABARAPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Another reticulon family member, RTN2L, did not bind to LC3s/GABARAPs, despite its interaction with SQSTM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To further define the interaction between RTN3L and LC3s/GABARAPs, we analyzed LC3 mutants: endogenous RTN3 did not bind when the pull-down was performed with LC3 protein family members lacking the unique amino-terminal region or LC3B with mutation in the LIR-binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). This indicated that RTN3L interacts with LC3 through a classical LIR motif. Bioinformatics analysis of the RTN3L protein sequence revealed the presence of six putative LIR motifs in the N-terminal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Substitution of the two hydrophobic amino acids, within the LIR motif, had been shown to be sufficient to ablate the interaction with ATG8 protein family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rozenknop et al., 2011</xref>). We validated the functionality of the putative LIR motifs through a sequential mutagenesis and in vitro pull down of each respective LIR mutants of RTN3L. None of the single LIR mutants, nor mutants, with only one residual LIR motif, completely lost the interaction with LC3s/GABARAPs. Complete lack of binding was obtained only after the mutagenesis of all six LIR domains (∆6LIRs), indicating that each of the six identified LIR motifs is functional and has the ability to bind LC3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>). A significant reduction in the fragmentation of ER tubules and ER-phagy was observed upon starvation of U2OS cells stably expressing the ∆6LIRs mutant of RTN3L as compared of WT RTN3L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). Moreover, no lysosomal delivery of ER tubules was detected in HeLa cells stably expressing the mCherry-EGFP-RTN3L∆6LIRs mutant, as observed by the lack of mCherry-positive puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>). However, RTN3L∆6LIRs was still able to tubulate ER membranes and to form an articulated ER network as well as wild-type RTN3L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2D</xref>).

FAM134B and RTN3L shared almost half of their interactors, while 123 peptides were unique to RTN3L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C and D</xref>). The most enriched interactor for both, FAM134B and RTN3L, was an autophagy modifier. While FAM134B preferentially interacted with MAP1LC3B, RTN3L favored GABARAP-L1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 8—source data 1</xref>). The other common interactors belonged to different complexes (ATP synthase), organelles (ER, mitochondria), and cellular compartments (cytoskeleton, vesicles) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E and F</xref>). Among the unique interactors, ER-related proteins were of particular interest. RTN3L interacted mainly with the other RTNs, but it did not interact with any of the FAM134 family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Interestingly, FAM134B interacted preferentially with RTN2L and partially with the short RTN isoforms, but not with RTN3L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>).

This could be due to the special separation of these proteins in different ER subdomains, with FAM134B in sheets and RTN3L in tubules, respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Autophagy is recognized as the principal cellular catabolic process that regulates turnover, volume, and abundance of various organelles, including the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schuck et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Khaminets et al., 2016</xref>). In this report, we identify the long isoform of the reticulon family member RTN3 (RTN3L) as a selective autophagy receptor for ER tubules. We show that RTN3L is able to interact with LC3 modifiers via six functional LIR motifs located in the long amino-terminal domain. This interaction is necessary to facilitate ER membrane fission and delivery of ER fragments to the lysosome for degradation upon autophagy induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). RTN3 itself is also degraded by the lysosome, thus acting as a <italic>de facto</italic> selective autophagy receptor. This property is unique to RTN3L, as none of the other reticulon family members nor the short isoform of RTN3 share this function. RTN3L loses the ability to fragment ER tubules when autophagy is completely impaired due to the loss of core machinery or when all its six of its LIR motifs are inactivated via site-specific mutagenesis. This number of functional LIR motifs is unusual for an autophagy receptor, which typically has only one LIR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Birgisdottir et al., 2013</xref>). An explanation could be the need for RTN3 to cluster a larger amount of LC3s modifiers and autophagic membranes, in order to fulfill its biological function as an autophagy receptor, as well as the possibility that RTN3 is itself attracted to pre-definited autophagic membranes. In both cases, this will lead to a positive loop, which determines a local concentration of RTN3L. On the molecular level, we showed that clustering of RTN3L is the driving force behind the fragmentation of ER tubules and their subsequent removal by ER-phagy. On the contrary, hetero-oligomerization of RTN3L with RTN3S instead favors the stabilization of ER tubules. Our observations also indicate that the autophagy machinery affects ER tubular remodeling via the co-operation between RTN3L concentration and LC3. The amino terminal domain of RTN3 plays a fundamental role in this process, and might as well have additional regulatory functions. It is a common feature for all the RTN proteins that their N-terminal regions are highly unstructured; a characteristic of many components of multi-proteins complexes with transformation ability towards alternative functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mészáros et al., 2007</xref>). The presence of multiple LIRs along the N terminal domain of RTN3 ensures that a relevant number of isoforms will contain at least one LIR motif to guarantee a proper ER turnover in all tissues. According to our model, the tubular ER network first undergoes fission events, and the resulting fragments are then engulfed by autophagosomes. During steady state tubular remodeling, the local concentration of RTN3L may increase and promote a massive recruitment of LC3 modifiers. At the same time, oligomerization of RTN3L could force the constriction of ER tubules, making them more prone to break, and the presence of LIR motifs directly targets the fragments to lysosomes. In this scenario, RTN3L is involved not only in ER tubules biogenesis, as it has been previously found to be along with the other RTNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shibata et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Voeltz et al., 2006</xref>), but it also has a unique role in the control of ER tubule turnover.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25555.034</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model for ER tubules degradation.</title><p>To drive ER tubules turnover, local RTN3L homo-dimerizes and leads to the recruitment of autophagic membranes and ER tubules fragmentation.

Although both are ER membrane-bound proteins, they are localized in different ER subcompartments: FAM134B preferentially in ER sheets while RTN3 resides in tubules. Moreover, the two proteins are not closely connected: they do not interact directly and the absence of one of them does not appear to influence the biological activity of the other one. Rtn3 degradation is not affected in <italic>Fam134b<sup>–/–</sup></italic> MEFs and <italic>vice versa</italic>. Moreover, while Fam134b regulates the degradation of ER sheets proteins, Rtn3 absence mainly affects ER tubular protein turnover. One exception is Rtn4, which is present in both ER tubules and sheets to some extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">GrandPré et al., 2000</xref>), so it is subjected to the activity of both receptors. As for <italic>Fam134b<sup>–/–</sup></italic> MEFs, Rtn3 absence does not affect macro-autophagy, as well as it does not influence the ER sheets <italic>versus</italic> tubules ratio and ER morphology. The ER structure is complex and subdomains are characterized by the presence of key proteins involved in precise ER-shaping and biological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shibata et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">2010</xref>). Therefore, it is reasonable that different resident proteins would regulate ER subdomain turnover in physiological situation or in response to a stress. Of note, SEC62, an element of the SEC61 translocon complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Conti et al., 2015</xref>), has an independent function as an ER-phagy receptor during stress recovery. The peculiarity of SEC62 is its specific activation in order to resolve an ER stress situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fumagalli et al., 2016</xref>). The presence of multiple ER-phagy receptors could be an adaptive mechanism to ensure the proper homeostasis for large and complex organelles like the ER. In yeast, Atg39 and Atg40 are characterized ER-phagy receptors; Atg40 is specific for the cytosolic and cortical ER, while Atg39 facilitates turnover of perinuclear membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mochida et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, a similar scenario has been described for mitochondria during mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Narendra et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lazarou et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>As we described, the biological function of RTN3 as an ER-phagy receptor is coupled to its unique amino terminal domain. In general, the complexity of the RTN family is mediated by the splicing rearrangements at the amino terminal that confer variable sizes to the proteins: from few amino acids to more than a thousand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oertle et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yang and Strittmatter, 2007</xref>). The importance of the individual RTNs isoforms has been largely underestimated. A very limited number of scientific reports described the unique and specific functions of different isoforms for RTN4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">GrandPré et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Diekmann et al., 2005</xref>) and RTN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Iwahashi and Hamada, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Steiner et al., 2004</xref>). In the case of RTN3, a large number isoforms were described for both: human and murine proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Di Scala et al., 2005</xref>). Although so far only the short isoforms have been characterized and were found to be associated with several biological processes such as: apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kuang et al., 2005</xref>), retrograde transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wakana et al., 2005</xref>), nuclear envelope formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson and Hetzer, 2008</xref>) and ER-plasma membrane contact sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caldieri et al., 2017</xref>). Our experimental settings allowed us to gain a broader over-view of the RTNs family and to ‘moonlight’ uncharacterized alternative functions. New proteins and complexes have now been annotated and linked to specific isoforms of RTN family members. We mainly concentrated on RTN3L, due to its interaction with GABARAP-L1 and its role in ER-phagy. However, we also noticed the interaction of SQSTM1 with RTN2, which also may be indirectly linked to selective autophagy or linked to the proteasomal system. In this regard, the long isoforms of RTN2, RTN3 and RTN4 have an affinity for the ubiquitin ligases and ubiquitin-related proteins, which may directly influence their function. For example, ubiquitination of RTN4B induces structural re-arrangements of ER tubules upon <italic>Legionella</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kotewicz et al., 2017</xref>), via a novel phosphoribose-linked ubiquitin modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bhogaraju et al., 2016</xref>). Ubiquitination, as well as other post-translational modifications, could potentially act as signals to induce RTN3 redistribution along the ER tubules in order to promote specific biological functions, like its homo-dimerization.</p><p>In mice, the complete lack of Rtn3 did not reveal any relevant phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shi et al., 2014</xref>) and there are not human pathologies genetically linked to RTN3. Although there are a few signs of RTN3S accumulation in dystrophic neurites from Alzheimer’s patients exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hu et al., 2007</xref>). Nevertheless, we have now identified a new role for RTN3, as an ER-phagy receptor. This function is mediated by its amino terminal domain. These findings pave the way to further investigate RTN3 biology with a particular attention to the tissues and cells where the long isoforms are expressed and the ER tubular network is subjected to intense remodeling and turnover.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning procedures and DNA mutagenesis</title><p>cDNAs were cloned into pDONR223 vector using the BP Clonase Reaction Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and further recombined into GATEWAY destination vectors: iTAP MSCV-N-FLAG-HA IRES-PURO, pHAGE-N-eGFP, pcDNA3.1-N-FLAG, pcDNA5-FRT/TO-N-mCherry-EGFP though the LR Clonase Reaction Kit (Invitrogen).

Ligation was performed with T4 ligase for 1 hr at room temperature. The ligation product was then transformed using XL1-Blue competent cells. To generate a knockout cell line, we infected our target cells with lentivirus containing three different sgRNA guides specific for the gene of interest. The lentiviruses were produced in HEK 293 T cell. Briefly, HEK293T cells were grown in 2 ml DMEM media (10% FBS) in six-well plates until they reached 90% confluence. They were further co-transfecting with the three lentiviral plasmids (1.1 µg cDNA for each plasmid), containing the CAS9 and the selected sgRNA guides, together with the two packaging vectors pPAX2 (2.2 µg cDNA) and pMD2.G (1 µg cDNA). The medium containing lentivirus was collected after 24 hr and replaced with 2 ml of fresh DMEM subsequently collected after an additional 24 hr. The total 4 ml of DMEM media were pulled together and centrifuged to clear from dead HEK293T cells and stored at −80°C. One ml of the medium was then used to infect the desired cell lines and the rest was stored at −80°C. After 48 hr of infection, cells were selected using fresh DMEM media containing 5 µg/ml of Puromycin (further reduced to 2 µg/ml for the maintenance). When the pLenti-Puro-EGFP was used, cells were selected for GFP positivity through FACS sorting.<table-wrap id="tbl3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25555.037</object-id><label>Table 3.</label><caption><p>CRISPR-CAS9 guides sequences.

U2OS TRex cells transfected with mock plasmid were cultured in media supplemented with L-arginine-<sup>12</sup>C6<sup>14</sup>N4 (Arg0) and L-lysine-<sup>12</sup>C6<sup>14</sup>N2 (Lys0), while U2OS TRex expressing FAM134B or the various isoforms of the four RTNs were labeled with L-arginine-<sup>13</sup>C6<sup>15</sup>N4 (Arg10) and L-lysine-−<sup>13</sup>C6<sup>15</sup>N2 (Lys8) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ong and Mann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ong et al., 2002</xref>). FAM134B and RTNs isoforms were induced for 24 hr with doxycycline and SILAC labeled cells were lysed using 50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 120 mM NaCl, 1% (v/v) NP40, complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Cell lysates from light and heavy labeled cells were harvested separately and immunoprecipitated separately using monoclonal anti-HA-agarose antibody (Sigma). Only prior to proteins elution, heavy and light immuno-precipitation beads were combined together in a 1:1 ratio (H/L). Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated according to their molecular weight by subjecting them to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. Gel lanes were cut into equal pieces and digested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shevchenko et al., 2006</xref>). In brief, gel pieces were washed, de-stained and dehydrated. Proteins were reduced with 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), alkylated with 55 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) and digested with the endopeptidase sequencing-grade Trypsin (Promega; Madison, WI, USA) overnight at 37°C.

Peptide separation was carried out according to their hydrophobicity on an in-house packed 20 cm column with 1.9 mm C18 beads (Dr Maisch GmbH) using a binary buffer system consisting of solution A: 0.1% formic acid (0.5% formic acid) and B: 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid (80% acetonitrile, 0.5% formic acid). 35 min gradients were used for immunoprecipitated samples. Linear gradients from 7 to 38% B in 20 min were applied with a following increase to 95% B within 5 min and a re-equilibration to 5% B. Q Exactive HF settings: MS spectra were acquired using 3E6 as an AGC target, a maximal injection time of 20 ms and a 60,000 resolution at 200 m/z. The mass spectrometer operated in a data dependent Top15 mode with subsequent acquisition of higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) fragmentation MS/MS spectra of the top 15 most intense peaks.

Cells were imaged in reducing buffer that facilitated photo-switching for <italic>d</italic>STORM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heilemann et al., 2008</xref>). The reducing buffer contained 100 mM MEA (Sigma) in PBS with pH adjusted to 8.0–8.5 using KOH from 1 M stock solution, and was freshly prepared before each experiment. Single-molecule imaging was performed on a custom-built wide-field microscope as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dietz et al., 2013</xref>. A 643 nm (iBeam smart, Toptica Photonics), and a 532 nm (DPPS-532-NL300, Eksma Optics, Lithuania) laser were combined by appropriate dichroic mirrors (LaserMUX 561–594R, LaserMUX 514–543R, LaserMUX 473–491R, 1064R, LaserMUX 427–25, AHF) and coupled into an inverted microscope (IX71, Olympus) equipped with a 100× oil immersion objective (PLAPO 100× TIRFM, NA ≥1.45, Olympus) and a nose piece (IX2-NPS, Olympus) to avoid drift. A translational mirror (Thorlabs) within the illumination pathway allowed for a continuous adjustment of the illumination light field angle from wide-field to total internal reflection (TIR) illumination. The 643 and 532 nm lasers were addressed separately by application of an acousto-optic tunable filter (AAOptics). Fluorescent light was collected by the objective and spectrally separated from excitation light by a dichroic mirror (Dualline zt532/638rpc, AHF) inside the microscope and bandpass filters (ET 700/75 for Alexa Fluor 647 and ET 575/50 for Alexa Fluor 532, both from AHF) situated in the emission pathway. Filtered fluorescent light was projected on an EMCCD (iXon3, Andor). Dual-color microscopy was performed with the EMCCD camera operating in frame transfer video mode at a 200-fold electron multiplying gain. Imaging was conducted sequentially by imaging longer wavelength absorption first, that is, Alexa Fluor 647 prior to Alexa Fluor 532. After TIR illumination was established, Alexa Fluor 647 was read out by recording image sequences of about 20,000 images with a frame rate of 33 Hz under continuous 643 nm laser illumination (2 kW/cm<sup>2</sup>). Lasers and filters were then rearranged for photo-activating and detecting Alexa Fluor 532. Image sequences of about 20,000 images were recorded with a frame rate of 10 Hz under constant 532 nm laser excitation (3 kW/cm<sup>2</sup>). SMLM data were analyzed by calculating the fluorescent label positions by fitting their point spread functions (PSFs) from single-molecule emissions to a two-dimensional Gaussian intensity distribution using rapidSTORM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wolter et al., 2010</xref>). A local relative threshold of 100 and of 150 was set for Alexa Fluor 647 and Alexa Fluor 532, respectively, to omit dim emitters. Coordinates of fluorescent labels were stored in charts, further referred to as localization lists. Based on the localization lists, images were reconstructed. TetraSpeck microspheres were used for spatial alignment of dual-color images.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Ultrastructural analyses</title><p>For the IEM analyses, U2OS RTN3L cells were starved in EBBS for 6 hr in presence of 200 nM bafilomycinA1 before being fixed by addition of 4% PFA and 0.4% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) in an equal volume to the DMEM medium and incubated for 20 min at room temperature.

For protein assignment, spectra were correlated with the Uniprot human database (v. 2016) including a list of common contaminants. Searches were performed with tryptic specifications and default settings for mass tolerances for MS and MS/MS spectra. Carbamidomethyl at cysteine residues was set as a fixed modification, while oxidations at methionine, acetylation at the N-terminus were defined as variable modifications. The minimal peptide length was set to seven amino acids, and the false discovery rate for proteins and peptide-spectrum matches to 1%. The match-between-run feature with a time window of 1 min was used. For further analysis, the Perseus software (1.5.3.0) was used and first filtered for contaminants and reverse entries as well as proteins that were only identified by a modified peptide. The SILAC Ratios were logarithmized and grouped into duplicates and a one-sample t-test was performed. Probability values (p) &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant. To identify significant enriched GO terms, we utilized the 1D enrichment tool in Perseus. Data visualization was done in the statistical environment R. MS analyses of three independent immuno-precipitations (IP) experiments for both isoforms of each RTN were performed. Peptides with Log<sub>2</sub> (Heavy/Light [H/L]) ratios ≥1 and a p value ≤ 0.05 were considered significantly enriched. Pearson’s correlation coefficients up to 0.9 indicated the high reproducibility between biological repetitions.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Manuel Kaulich, Christian Behrends, Hesso Fahran and Richard Youle for providing us vectors and cell lines; Prof. Noboru Mizushima for <italic>Atg5<sup>–/–</sup></italic> MEFs; Prof. Jun-Lin Guan for <italic>Fip200<sup>–/–</sup></italic> MEFs, Prof. Christian Hübner for <italic>Fam134b<sup>–/–</sup></italic> MEFs, Prof. Stephen Blacklow for U2OS TRex cells, Prof. S.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Randy Schekman as the Senior Editor.

The authors identified RTN3L as an important new player in starvation-induced fragmentation of tubular ER membranes coupling this process with the recruitment of the autophagic machinery to promote ERphagy. RTN3L is therefore proposed to act as an autophagic receptor for ERphagy acting by interacting with different Atg8 family members in a LIR-dependent manner. Overall, this study tackles and important question in cell biology in general and in autophagy in particular. The data characterizing RTN3L, as a novel autophagic receptor, is convincing and the manuscript is clearly presented. However, the reviewers found that additional work is required to strengthen the manuscript to meet the standards for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) This study relies on only exogenously overexpressed RTN3L. To prove that RTN3L mediates autophagic degradation of the ER as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, it is essential to test whether ER degradation is indeed affected in RTN3L KO or KD cells expressing the RTN3LΔ6LIR mutant or RTN3LΔ6LIR knock-in cells.</p><p>2) The authors only see degradation of overexpressed RTN3L itself. It does not represent ERphagy. In order to mention &quot;ERphagy&quot;, it is essential to determine lysosomal degradation of ER resident proteins using WB and IF approaches.</p><p>3) It is unclear what the RTN3L punctate structures represent. Are they fragmented ER, ER fragments in autophagosomes, or autolysosomes? This should be addressed by electron microscopy and/or density gradient analysis.</p><p>4) Related to comment #3, &quot;fragmentation of the ER&quot; and &quot;sequestration of the ER into autophagosomes&quot; may occur sequentially, but these should be distinct processes. Does RTN3L mediate both steps?</p><p>5) Given its localization to the tubular ER, the authors claim that RTN3L mediates degradation of this specific subdomain of the ER. However, it seems that experimental evidence for this proposal has not been provided. It should be investigated whether proteins in the tubular ER is preferentially degraded by RTN3L-driven ER-phagy compared with those in the other ER subdomains.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25555.039</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) This study relies on only exogenously overexpressed RTN3L.

The lack of Rtn3 blocked the degradation of several ER proteins, which are mainly resident in ER tubules. Of note, ER sheets proteins turnover was not compromised and also the global macro-autophagy flux was comparable to the one observed in wild-type cells.

It does not represent ERphagy. In order to mention &quot;ERphagy&quot;, it is essential to determine lysosomal degradation of ER resident proteins using WB and IF approaches.</italic> </p><p>In order to address this point, we performed new IF experiments where we showed that several ER resident proteins (CALNEXIN, CLIMP-63, REEP5 and RTN3) are degraded via lysosomes after EBSS treatment in cells were none of the RTNs were expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The same results were confirmed via WB analysis, where we showed that Rtn1, Rtn3, Rtn4, Reep1, Trap α, Climp63, Fam134b were degraded via lysosomes after nutrient deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, in cells over-expressing RTN3L, together with RTN3L were degraded other ER proteins like CALNEXIN, BSCL2 and the ER tubules protein REEP5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) It is unclear what the RTN3L punctate structures represent. Are they fragmented ER, ER fragments in autophagosomes, or autolysosomes? This should be addressed by electron microscopy and/or density gradient analysis.</italic> </p><p>To address this point, we performed immuno-electron-microscopy analysis on U2OS HA-FLAG-RTN3L cells after EBSS treatment. In details, we performed the following labeling:</p><p>anti-HA to highlight RTN3L presence inside autophagosomes and autolysosomes;</p><p>anti-KDEL to highlight ER structure inside autolysosomes;</p><p>anti-HA combined with anti-CD63, a late endo-lysosomal membrane protein marker;</p><p>anti-KDEL combined with anti-CD63-biotin.</p><p>In U2OS RTN3L cells treated with EBSS, ER fragments labelled for KDEL are often found inside autolysosomes (AL) as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5A</xref>. This phenotype was not observed when cells were grown in normal media (data not shown). HA labelling (to visualize RTN3L) was also detected inside autophagosomes and autolysosomes in U2OS-RTN3L cells after EBSS treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5B and C</xref>). The double labelling KDEL–CD63 and HA(RTN3L)–CD63 confirmed the presence of RTN3L-positive vesiculo-tubular structures inside autolysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) Related to comment #3, &quot;fragmentation of the ER&quot; and &quot;sequestration of the ER into autophagosomes&quot; may occur sequentially, but these should be distinct processes. Does RTN3L mediate both steps?</italic> </p><p>We believe that RTN3L is able to mediate both processes. RTN3L dimerization is functional and sufficient to fragment ER tubules as we showed using the FKBP-RTN3L – FBP-RTN3L co-transfection in combination with Rapalog treatment. The forced dimerization of RTN3L was sufficient to induce ER tubules fragmentation when cells were kept in standard growing conditions (DMEM with 10% FBS), and the Rapalog treatment itself did not affect the basal autophagy flux. However, autophagy is required to catalyze the fragmentation process. When macro-autophagy was impaired, RTN3L ability to fragment ER tubules was compromised. Moreover, the presence of the LIR motives is than necessary to attract the autophagy machinery and to recruit the LC3s modifiers in order to form the autophagosome and promote the subsequent delivery to the lysosomes. The mutant form RTN3LΔ6LIR was, in fact, unable to fragment ER tubules.</p><p><italic>5) Given its localization to the tubular ER, the authors claim that RTN3L mediates degradation of this specific subdomain of the ER. However, it seems that experimental evidence for this proposal has not been provided. It should be investigated whether proteins in the tubular ER is preferentially degraded by RTN3L-driven ER-phagy compared with those in the other ER subdomains.</italic> </p><p>In order to address this point, we analyzed how different ER proteins were degraded in <italic>Rtn3</italic> vs <italic>Fam134b</italic> knockout MEFs. We previously demonstrated that Fam134b is a ER-phagy receptor mainly dedicated to ER sheets turnover (Khaminets et al. Nature 2015).</p><p>ER tubules resident proteins like RTN1 and REEP5 were more stable in <italic>Rtn3</italic> knockout MEFs respect to ER sheets proteins like Climp-63 and Trap-α, after EBSS starvation. Contrary, in <italic>Fam134b</italic> knockout cells, ER tubules proteins were normally degraded while ER sheets proteins were more stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, CLIMP-63 never co-localized with the ER-tubules fragments positive for RTN3L; neither after RTN3L over-expression followed by 6h EBSS starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>) nor after Rapalog induced dimerization of FKBP-RTN3L and FBP-RTN3L co-overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Contrary, REEP5 always co-localized with RTN3L positive structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
