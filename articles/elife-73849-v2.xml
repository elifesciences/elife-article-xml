Despite research efforts to define the role of various immune cells in MS pathogenesis, the focus has been on a few immune cell populations while full-spectrum analysis, encompassing others such as natural killer (NK) cells, has not been performed. Here, we used single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF) to profile the immune landscape of brain periventricular areas – septum and choroid plexus – and of the circulation from donors with MS, dementia and controls without neurological disease. Using a 37-marker panel, we revealed the infiltration of T cells and antibody-secreting cells in periventricular brain regions and identified a novel NK cell signature specific to MS. CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells were accumulated in the septum of MS donors and displayed an activated and migratory phenotype, similar to that of CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells in the circulation. We validated this signature by multiplex immunohistochemistry and found that the number of NK cells with high expression of granzyme K, typical of the CD56<sup>bright</sup> subset, was increased in both periventricular lesions and the choroid plexus of donors with MS. Together, our multi-tissue single-cell data shows that CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells accumulate in the periventricular brain regions of MS patients, bringing NK cells back to the spotlight of MS pathology.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>multiple sclerosis</kwd><kwd>natural killer cells</kwd><kwd>single-cell mass cytometry</kwd><kwd>periventricular</kwd><kwd>choroid plexus</kwd><kwd>septum</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003000</institution-id><institution>Stichting MS Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20-1087</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rodríguez-Lorenzo</surname><given-names>Sabela</given-names></name><name><surname>Kooij</surname><given-names>Gijs</given-names></name><name><surname>de Vries</surname><given-names>Helga E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Together, our multi-tissue single-cell data shows that CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells accumulate in the periventricular brain regions of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, bringing NK cells back to the spotlight of MS pathology.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neuroinflammatory disease characterised by demyelinating lesions within the central nervous system (CNS). In MS, peripheral immune cells gain access to the CNS and cause severe neuroinflammation, myelin damage, and subsequent neurodegeneration. In the past decades, a wealth of knowledge has been gained on the role of monocyte-derived macrophages, CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, B cells and antibody-secreting cells in MS pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Machado-Santos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vogel et al., 2013</xref>). To date, however, we still know relatively little about the presence and roles of other immune cell subsets in the MS brain, such as natural killer (NK) cells.</p><p>Brain regions around the ventricles are hotspots for MS lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brownell and Hughes, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jehna et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Palmer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Simon et al., 1986</xref>), but underlying mechanisms are poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pardini et al., 2021</xref>). Since the majority of periventricular MS lesions occur around a central vessel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tallantyre et al., 2011</xref>), it has been suggested that vascular topography may influence MS pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martinez Sosa and Smith, 2017</xref>). Although the accumulation of immune cell infiltrates around post-capillary venules suggests their trafficking across the blood-brain barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Smolders et al., 2020</xref>), periventricular veins drain to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pardini et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, MS periventricular pathology may be related to factors from both the blood and the CSF.</p><p>In MS, the CSF that flows through the ventricles is enriched in immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cepok et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rodríguez-Martín et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schafflick et al., 2020</xref>) and inflammatory factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Khaibullin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vidaurre et al., 2014</xref>). The main source of CSF is the choroid plexus, a secretory tissue located in the brain ventricles that acts as an immunological hub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Strominger et al., 2018</xref>) and forms the blood-CSF barrier. Thus, the location and functions of the choroid plexus are strategic to regulate periventricular homeostasis and thereby influence neuroinflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ghersi-Egea et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Monaco et al., 2020</xref>). For example, pro-inflammatory immune cells infiltrate the brain through the choroid plexus in the early stages in an MS animal model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reboldi et al., 2009</xref>). On the contrary, in progressive MS patients, the choroid plexus may be a source of neuroprotective factors in response to chronic periventricular damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rodríguez-Lorenzo et al., 2020a</xref>). Moreover, we and others have shown that immune cells accumulate at the choroid plexus in the progressive phases of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rodríguez-Lorenzo et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vercellino et al., 2008</xref>). We postulate that CSF-mediated immune processes originating in the choroid plexus participate in the periventricular inflammation typical for MS patients. However, it is still uncertain whether such processes involve cell trafficking into the CNS and/or the secretion of pro- or antiinflammatory factors.</p><p>Here, we used single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF) to profile the immune landscape of periventricular MS brain regions and to better understand their pathology and routes of immune cell infiltration into the CNS. For this purpose, we isolated immune cells from the human postmortem periventricular brain areas (septum), the choroid plexus and the blood. With our 37-marker panel, we defined the main innate and adaptive immune cell populations and their phenotype in MS, dementia, and control donors without neurological disease. Besides detecting the accumulation of T cells and antibody-secreting cells typical of MS in the periventricular brain regions, we also identified an NK signature consisting of CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells. CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells are known for their immunoregulatory properties and were also detected in the blood of the same MS donors with a migratory and activated phenotype, similarly to those in the brain. Using multispectral immunofluorescence, we validated these findings in an independent cohort of periventricular brain and choroid plexus tissue, which indicated that NK cells expressing granzyme K, typical of the CD56<sup>bright</sup> subset, are enriched in MS lesions and the choroidal tissue from MS donors. Together, our study brings NK cells back to the spotlight of MS pathology by suggesting a local immunoregulatory role of the CD56<sup>bright</sup> subset within periventricular MS brain regions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single-cell mass cytometry of the septum reveals an accumulation of T cells and natural killer cells in multiple sclerosis</title><p>To investigate the periventricular immune landscape in MS, we performed cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF) on postmortem septum – a periventricular brain region highly exposed to CSF –, choroid plexus – the main producer of CSF –, and peripheral blood from controls without neurological disease, donors diagnosed with dementia (used as a neurological control) and MS donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

The septum was mainly populated by microglia (84.3% of CD45<sup>+</sup> immune cells), followed by other antigen-presenting cells (APCs) of myeloid origin (8.5 %). APCs of myeloid origin consisted of 3 subsets (80% were CD11c<sup>high</sup> CD49d<sup>+</sup> CD206<sup>-</sup>, 12.8% were CD11c<sup>low</sup> CD49d<sup>+</sup> CD206<sup>+</sup>; and 7.3% were CD11c<sup>high</sup> CD49d<sup>-</sup> CD206<sup>-</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). The frequency of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (2.2 %) more than doubled that of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (0.9 %). Other immune cells present in the septum were granulocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes, and cells from the B lymphocyte lineage.</p><p>We next compared the proportions of each population in the septum among the MS and control groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). We found a higher percentage of both CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in MS compared to controls. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell accumulation was specific for MS, while the percentage of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was higher in both MS and dementia compared to controls. We also found a higher percentage of NK cells in the MS group compared to the control and dementia cases. A moderate negative correlation was found between the percentage of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and age, while there was a moderate positive correlation between the B cell lineage frequencies and postmortem delay (PMD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>Thus, we were able to identify the canonical brain immune cell populations in lesion-prone, periventricular brain regions using CyTOF. We found that the septum also presents an accumulation of CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells typical of MS brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Babbe et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Machado-Santos et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, we show that NK cell accumulation is a signature of the septum of MS patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Phenotyping the T cell populations in the septum</title><p>Next, we investigated which subsets within CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were accumulating in the septum of MS donors.

Effector memory T cells (T<sub>EM</sub>) were also present (clusters CD8 c4 and CD4 c2), including a cluster of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells re-expressing CD45RA (T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells, cluster CD8 c3). A small cluster of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells presented an intermediate or transitional phenotype between naïve and memory (cluster CD8 c5). Naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (cluster CD4 c3) and CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>REGS</sub> (cluster CD4 c4) were present in small proportions.

In MS donors, there were more connections between immune cells derived from the septum, choroid plexus and the blood, suggesting increased cellular communication and movement in periventricular areas in MS.

This technique allowed us to stain up to seven markers in the same section. Due to the difficulty of making a clear distinction between bright and dim expression of CD56 in NK cells by immunohistochemistry, we used granzymes (Gr) expression as a surrogate marker. We defined CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells as CD45<sup>+</sup> NKp46<sup>+</sup> GrK<sup>+</sup> GrB<sup>-</sup> and CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells as CD45<sup>+</sup> NKp46<sup>+</sup> GrK<sup>-</sup> GrB<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bratke et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hanna et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>We analysed the presence of NK cells in periventricular brain tissue from controls and within normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) and white matter lesions from MS donors.

Since periventricular areas of the brain are a predilection site for MS lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brownell and Hughes, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jehna et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Palmer et al., 1999</xref>), we focused on the septum as it separates the two lateral ventricles and is highly exposed to CSF. Although magnetic resonance imaging studies demonstrated the presence of MS lesions in the septum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gean-Marton et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Palmer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Palotai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Simon et al., 1986</xref>), the composition of the inflammatory infiltrates remained unknown. We found an expansion of CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells within the septum of MS donors, and these CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells expressed higher levels of proteins involved in NK cell activation and migration. Using multiplex immunohistochemistry, we validated the accumulation of NK cells expressing GrK, typical of the CD56<sup>bright</sup> subset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bratke et al., 2005</xref>), in periventricular MS lesions from an independent cohort. Putative CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells abound in the rim of the lesions, where the highest activity is present in terms of immune cell activation and demyelination. The centre of MS lesions is characteristically hypocellular, and this is reflected in the number of NK cells present. We also found a slight increase in the density of GrB<sup>+</sup> NK cells — the putative CD56<sup>dim</sup> cells — in MS lesions versus NAWM and healthy controls that was not detected with the CyTOF. Next to NK cells, we detected higher frequencies of ASCs, CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the septum from MS donors compared to controls, which is similar to other periventricular regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Machado-Santos et al., 2018</xref>). The distribution of general immune cell populations in the septum was consistent with previous literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Korin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Smolders et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>NK cells are lymphocytes of the innate immune system with the ability to regulate adaptive responses. There are two main NK cell subsets based on the expression of CD56 and CD16: CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells express low levels of CD16 and are specialised immunoregulators, while CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells have a potent cytolytic capacity, which may be mediated by CD16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mimpen et al., 2020</xref>). Importantly, we relied on the markers CD56 and NKp46 to identify human NK cells by CyTOF and immunohistochemistry, respectively. However, NK cells belong to the broader group of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), which also include ILC1, ILC2 and ILC3 subsets. ILC subpopulations are highly plastic and their identification remains a challenge; it has been proposed that they belong to a single, highly plastic population, but this debate is beyond the scope of this study. Although NK cells are thought to predominate in the brain parenchyma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sedgwick et al., 2020</xref>), we cannot exclude the presence of other ILCs. Particularly, certain subsets of ILC3s share the expression of CD56 with NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Trabanelli et al., 2018</xref>). The extent and pathological consequences of the presence of ILC3s in MS should be determined in future studies.</p><p>A beneficial role of CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells in MS was first discovered with the anti-inflammatory drug daclizumab. Daclizumab is an anti-CD25 antibody therapy that leads to the expansion of circulating CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bielekova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wynn et al., 2010</xref>), an increase that was later reported with other disease-modifying treatments for MS as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gross et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Saraste et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Smith et al., 2018</xref>). In line with this, a protective role for NK cells was shown in animal models of MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xu et al., 2005</xref>) through cytotoxicity against autoreactive T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xu et al., 2005</xref>). Despite the beneficial immunomodulatory role assigned to CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells in the context of MS, the presence of NK cells in the CNS can also be detrimental (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lagumersindez-Denis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu and Shi, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morse et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, while NK cells may act as a double-edged sword in MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gross et al., 2016a</xref>), we postulate that the presence of specifically CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells in the periventricular areas primarily has a beneficial effect on MS pathology by limiting neuroinflammation.</p><p>To date, studies of NK cells in the MS brain parenchyma did not distinguish between the CD56<sup>bright</sup> and CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK subsets. NK cells were detected in the brains from MS donors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gross et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lagumersindez-Denis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Traugott and Raine, 1984</xref>), while absent from controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gross et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). Within active MS lesions, NK cells express GrK polarised towards neighbouring T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gross et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jiang et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, the expansion of the CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cell population we observed in MS brains may mediate a protective response to neuro-inflammation by killing autoreactive T cells through the release of GrK. Moreover, we observed higher expression of the ligand PDL1 in CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells from MS brains compared to those from controls, suggesting an involvement of the PD1-PDL1 axis. PDL1 is an NK cell activation marker associated with enhanced cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dong et al., 2019</xref>) and binds the T cell co-inhibitory molecule PD1 inducing suppression of PD1<sup>+</sup> autoreactive T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Riley, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Proportions of circulating CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells remained the same in MS and control donors, as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gross et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Laroni et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells in both the MS brain and blood expressed higher levels of proteins associated with cell migration. As such, the enrichment of CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells in the CNS of MS patients could result from selective infiltration from the blood towards the brain rather than being the result of accumulation in the circulation. In line with this, migration studies showed that CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells have a higher capacity to transmigrate across a blood-brain barrier in vitro model than their CD56<sup>dim</sup> counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gross et al., 2016a</xref>). However, this study did not show enhanced migration of CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells from MS donors compared to controls.</p><p>Direct infiltration from the circulation through the local brain vasculature is a likely route for MS immune infiltrates. Besides, abundant periventricular veins drain to the ventricles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pardini et al., 2016</xref>), resulting in an indirect peripheral-brain connection through the choroid plexus via the CSF. Here, we described the presence of NK cells in the human choroid plexus and identified the upregulation of the adhesion molecule CD54 in CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells in MS. The higher ratio of CD56<sup>bright</sup>/CD56<sup>dim</sup> cells in the choroid plexus compared to the blood indicates enrichment of CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells in the choroid plexus. Accordingly, we could not detect GrB<sup>+</sup> NK cells, presumptive CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells, within the choroid plexus stroma from controls, and rarely in MS cases, using multiplex immunohistochemistry. The upregulation of CD54 in CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells in MS was unique to the choroid plexus and differed from CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells in the circulation and the septum. However, the proportion of CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells did not differ between groups. Although the higher frequency of CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells measured by CyTOF in the choroid plexus from MS donors relative to controls was not significant, multiplex immunohistochemistry confirmed the accumulation of GrK<sup>+</sup> NK cells in the choroid plexus stroma of MS donors from an independent cohort. Future studies should uncover if CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells continue their journey across the blood-CSF barrier and the ependymal layer lining the periventricular brain. Supporting this idea, the CSF ratio of CD56<sup>bright</sup>/CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells is higher in MS patients than in controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rodríguez-Martín et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schafflick et al., 2020</xref>), and it is further increased upon treatment with the anti-CD25 antibody therapy daclizumab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bielekova et al., 2011</xref>). In conclusion, circulating CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells in MS may infiltrate into periventricular brain areas directly across the blood-brain barrier, and indirectly via the choroid plexus-CSF route.</p><p>Our study has two main limitations, first scarcity of fresh human tissue prevented having sex and age-matched groups with large sample sizes for the CyTOF analysis. To overcome the underpowered design and possible effects of confounders, we have validated our main finding by multiplex immunohistochemistry in a separate cohort with a similar age and female/male ratio. Secondly, there is a strong contribution of blood-derived immune cells in the choroid plexus, which precluded a clear distinction between circulating and stromal immune cells. This may have prevented the detection of choroid-plexus specific changes in the stroma, such as an accumulation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the choroid plexus from MS donors, previously described by our group using immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rodríguez-Lorenzo et al., 2020b</xref>). In addition, the high proportion of granulocytes in the CP as detected by our CyTOF analysis likely originates from the circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rodríguez-Lorenzo et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vercellino et al., 2008</xref>). Contrariwise, the scarcity of B cells, despite the high vascularisation, is in line with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rodríguez-Lorenzo et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vercellino et al., 2008</xref>); and the detection of rare ASCs in the choroid plexus but not in the blood reassures their tissue specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vercellino et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Notably, our study with postmortem blood uncovered a higher frequency of B cells in MS donors relative to controls and dementia cases. While the efficacy of peripheral B cell-depleting therapies suggests a pathogenic role of circulating B cells in MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hauser et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Montalban et al., 2017</xref>), we could not find evidence in the literature showing an accumulation of B cells in the blood of MS patients, and a recent study showed similar frequencies relative to controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schafflick et al., 2020</xref>). Although most B cells lack T-bet expression, a small subset of T-bet<sup>+</sup> B cells shows a trend towards more abundance in MS postmortem blood, in line with recent literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Couloume et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van Langelaar et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, the expression of T-bet within T-bet<sup>+</sup> B cells was higher in MS donors relative to control and dementia donors. T-bet expression on B cells has been associated with increased pathogenic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barnett et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Piovesan et al., 2017</xref>). The relevance of T-bet<sup>+</sup> B cells in MS should be further confirmed in fresh blood samples.</p><p>In addition, we aimed to uncover MS-specific immune changes by comparing our findings in MS donors to an extra neurological control group consisting of demented cases next to our non-neurological controls. All but one of our demented controls were diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We found that the increase in CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells and ASCs were specific to MS compared to both dementia and controls. Although our study was not powered for focusing on dementia, we found that the abundance of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the septal periventricular area was higher compared to the controls, following the trend seen in MS donors. The most notable increase was seen in CD8<sup>+</sup> tissue-resident memory T cells, a population that has been found in the ageing brain before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Smolders et al., 2018</xref>). In AD, higher numbers of circulating CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells relative to healthy donors were negatively associated with cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gate et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, clonally expanded CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were more abundant in the CSF of AD patients compared to healthy controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gate et al., 2020</xref>). Although our findings were not statistically significant, they highlight a role for periventricular CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in AD pathology. Moreover, we identified an activated phenotype of periventricular B cells in demented donors, consisting of higher expression of CD25 and CD49d. Interestingly, an accumulation of activated B cells was found in the circulation of AD mouse models before, together with infiltration of B cells into the brain parenchyma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2021</xref>). Future studies with increased sample size should confirm these results and reveal how T and B cells play a role in AD pathogenesis.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In sum, our study provides a characterization of the periventricular immune landscape in MS and reveals the involvement of CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells in local MS brain pathology.

Our findings highlight the importance of CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells in the CNS and their potential as a therapeutic target in MS. Instead of indiscriminately preventing immune cell surveillance in the CNS, an expansion of immunoregulatory CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells could selectively suppress neuroinflammation while minimizing side effects for patients suffering from MS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Human samples and study design</title><p>Fresh postmortem tissue was obtained from donors by rapid autopsy from the Netherlands Brain Bank.

Digestion was stopped with RP-HE (RPMI 1640, Thermo Fisher; 10% FCS (Corning, #35–079-CV)), 10 mM EDTA (ThermoFisher, #15575020), 20 mM HEPES (Gibco, #156300–056), 50 µm 2-mercaptoethanol (Gibco, #31350010) for 5 min on ice. The cell suspension was filtered through a 70 µm cell strainer (Life Sciences) to remove undigested pieces of tissue. Immune cells were isolated from this cell suspension using a 70–30% Percoll (Sigma Aldrich, #17-0891-01) gradient as follows. The eluent containing the single-cell suspension was centrifuged, the pellet was resuspended in 70% Percoll, and 30% Percoll was carefully layered on top. Following centrifugation at 900 g for 30 min at 22 °C, immune cells in the 70–30% interphase were collected and washed twice with RP10 (RPMI 1640, Thermo Fisher; 10% FCS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen, #15140122), 1% glutamine (Thermo Fisher, #25030–024) and counted. For the septum, an identical isolation protocol was used leaving out the first step of incubation with EDTA.</p><p>Postmortem blood was diluted with 1% citrate in PBS and filtered through a 70 µm cell strainer to remove clots. Diluted and filtered blood was then carefully layered on top of Lymphoprep (STEMCELL Technologies, #07851). The gradient was centrifuged at 800 g for 30 min at room temperature. The immune cells in the interphase were collected and washed with 1% citrate in PBS. Erythrocytes were lysed with ACK Lysing Buffer (Thermo Fisher, #A1049201) for 5 min at room temperature. Lysis was stopped with 1% citrate in PBS and cells were washed twice with RP10 and counted.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Viability staining, fixation, and freezing of immune cells</title><p>Isolated immune cells were washed with HBSS<sup>-/-</sup> (without Mg<sup>+2</sup>, Ca<sup>+2</sup>, and phenol red, #14175–095). Cells were distributed in wells of a 96-well V-bottom plate (0.5–1 million cells/well for septum and choroid plexus cells, 5 million cells/well for blood cells) and washed again with HBSS<sup>-/-</sup>. Cells were washed with Maxpar PBS (Fluidigm, #201058) and stained with the viability marker Cell-ID Cisplatin-198Pt (Fluidigm, #201198) for 5 min at 37 °C according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were then washed three times with RP10 and fixed with Maxpar Fix I Buffer (Fluidigm, #201065) for 10 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were centrifuged at 800 g for 7 min at 4 °C.

Purification of the bound antibody was performed with high-performance liquid chromatography (Thermo Fisher) and subsequently concentrated by filtering with a 10 kDa filter (Merck Millipore) in a swing-out bucket at 4000 RPM for 15 min. The end volume was determined and an equal volume of antibody stabilizer buffer (Fluidigm; supplemented with 0.05% sodium azide) was added before the antibodies were stored at 4 °C. All antibodies used in this study were titrated using both fixed and unfixed thawed PBMCs and the most optimal concentrations with the least spillover were chosen. Concentrated antibody cocktails for surface and nuclear antigen detection were made, aliquoted, and stored at –80 °C, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schulz et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Staining protocol</title><p>During the staining, reagents were cooled on ice, centrifugation steps were performed at 800 g for 7 min at 4 °C with acceleration 9 and deceleration 7, and incubations were performed at room temperature. Samples were thawed rapidly and washed twice with 8 mL of Maxpar PBS (Fluidigm, #201058). Cell pellets were resuspended in Maxpar PBS and transferred to a 96 well V-bottom plate (Sigma Aldrich, #M9686). After centrifugation, cells were washed twice with 150 μL of 1 X Barcode Perm Buffer (Fluidigm, #201057). Then, samples were incubated with the appropriate barcodes (Fluidigm, #201060) in 1 X Barcode Perm Buffer for 30 min, gently mixing after 15 min. After centrifugation, samples were washed twice with 150 μL of cell staining buffer (CSB) (Fluidigm, #201068) and the cells from all samples were pooled. Cells in this combined sample were counted and after centrifugation, cells were incubated with FC block (BioLegend, #422302) diluted in CSB (1:50) for 10 min. Then, the surface antibody cocktail (thawed and centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 x g at 4 °C) was diluted with CSB in the appropriate concentration and volume relative to the cell count (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) and added to the combined sample. This was followed by a 30 min incubation, gently mixing after 15 min. After the incubation, cells were washed twice with CSB followed by a wash with Maxpar PBS. Then, cells were fixed with 1 mL of freshly made 1.6% PFA (Thermo Fisher, #28906) in Maxpar PBS for 10 min. After centrifugation, cells were permeabilised with a 30 min incubation in 1 mL of FoxP3 Fix/Perm working solution (eBioscience, #00–5523), gently mixing after 15 min. After centrifugation, cells were washed twice with 1 X Permeabilisation Buffer (eBioscience, #00–5523). The nuclear antibody cocktail was thawed and centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 x g at 4 °C and cells were incubated with the nuclear antibody cocktail in 1 X Permeabilisation Buffer with the appropriate concentration to the cell count. The cells were incubated with the nuclear antibody mix for 45 min, gently mixing every 15 min. Cells were then washed three times with 1 X Permeabilisation Buffer and fixed with 1 mL of freshly made 1.6% PFA in Maxpar PBS for 10 min. After centrifugation, nucleated cells were stained with Maxpar Intercalator (Fluidigm, #201,192B) diluted 1:4000 in Maxpar Fix and Perm Buffer (Fluidigm, #201067) overnight at 4 °C, until sample acquisition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Sample acquisition</title><p>Cells in the Intercalator solution were washed twice with CSB and divided over approximately 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells per tube, followed by washing with cell acquisition solution (CAS) (Fluidigm, #201241) right before acquisition. Samples were filtered and calibration beads (Fluidigm, #201078) were added to the suspension to 15% of the final volume. Cells were acquired on the Helios (Fluidigm), with an event rate of 250–350 events per second. Runs took approximately 30–45 min. During the day, tuning of the machine was performed during start-up and after 4 hr of sample acquisition. Within each barcoded set of samples, one reference sample was included to monitor possible differences in staining intensity between barcodes due to technical variation in the staining protocol or daily changes in instrument functioning.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Generation of the reference sample</title><p>The reference sample contained peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from the blood of 3 healthy controls of which a part was stimulated with a cytokine cocktail to induce expression of each protein and transcription factor included in the CyTOF panel. Unstimulated and stimulated PBMCs were combined, stained for viability as described earlier, fixated, and stored in aliquots at –80 °C until further use.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>CyTOF data pre-processing and tissue comparisons</title><p>Acquired samples were randomised using Gaussian negative half zero randomization in CyTOF Software version 6.7. The FCS files were normalised using bead normalisation, concatenated, and debarcoded using the CyTOF Software version 6.7. The concatenated FCS files were uploaded into FlowJo V10 to perform the clean-up where normalization beads, cell debris, and cell doublets were removed using DNA, beads and Gaussian parameters. Next, live cells showing negative reactivity for viability marker Cell-ID Cisplatin-198Pt and dim-to-positive reactivity for CD45-89Y were selected and used for the further processing steps. To anticipate similarities between choroid plexus, septum, and blood-derived immune cells, 10,000 cells per donor tissue were imputed and visualised in one UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>CyTOF data processing and statistical analysis</title><p>Data analysis was performed in R version 4.0.3 (2020-10-10). Clinical data were analysed by the Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum test followed by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test with continuity correction. Quantitative data are shown as independent data points in box plots indicating the median and interquartile range.</p><p>CyTOF data was analysed following a published workflow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nowicka et al., 2017</xref>) (update 28 April 2020) with some modifications. Marker expression data was arcsinh transformed with a cofactor of 5. We decided to not normalise the data after visually confirming that the expression pattern distribution did not differ between batches of stain/run days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Clustering of the single-cell data was performed with FlowSOM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Van Gassen et al., 2015</xref>) and ConsensusClusterPlus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wilkerson and Hayes, 2010</xref>), using the lineage markers labelled as ‘type’ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). We clustered each tissue separately and pooled the samples from all donors; we subsampled the data using the 75th percentile of the number of cells per tissue as a threshold, to prevent big samples from driving the clustering (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2a</xref>). The metaclusters obtained (20 for the main populations, 12 for the T cell lineage, and 8 for the NK and B cell lineages) were manually annotated and merged based on visualisation using heatmaps with normalised median marker expression per cluster and dimensionality reduction plots (tSNE and UMAP).</p><p>We used a generalised linear mixed model (GLMM) for analysing the differential abundance of cell populations and a linear mixed model (LMM) for the differential expression of ‘state’ phenotypic markers per cell population. The models were built through the R package <italic>diffcyt</italic>, with a few modifications. The GLMM response variable is the cell counts per cell type (those with more than 100 cells) and sample, and the explanatory variable is the disease group, as a fixed effect. To model the overdispersion in proportion estimates (uncertainty is higher when proportions are calculated from samples with a low total number of cells), we included the sample ID as a random effect. The LMM response variable is the median marker expression of the state markers per cell type (those with more than 100 cells) and sample. Differential expression of markers was only considered in cell populations for which they were biologically meaningful (for example, FoxP3 was only considered in T and B cells), and in which the expression values were higher than 0 in at least a third of the samples. Only cell subsets in which at least one marker was differentially expressed are displayed in the state marker figures. Weights were assigned to each cluster and sample based on the number of cells, to account for differences in uncertainty in the calculation of the medians. We specified the contrasts MS vs. control, MS vs. dementia, and control vs dementia. We corrected the p-values for multiple testing with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, with a false discovery rate (FDR) cut-off of 10%; for differential abundance, we corrected for cell population per tissue type, and for differential expression, we corrected for state marker per cell population.</p><p>Correlations were performed using the functions <italic>rcorr</italic> and <italic>corr.test</italic>, as implemented in the packages <italic>psych</italic> and <italic>Hmisc</italic>, respectively, using the Benjamini-Hochberg method to adjust p-values. Only patients with samples analysed in all three tissues were used. Significant correlations (adjusted p≤0.1) were visualised in a network plot using Cytoscape. The strength of the correlation was calculated as -log10(adjusted p) and shown as the width of the edges.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Multiplex immunohistochemistry</title><p>Sections of 5-µm-thickness from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue were cut with a microtome and mounted on SuperFrost Plus slides. Sections were deparaffinised in xylene and rehydrated with a series of graded ethanol (100%, 90%, 80%, and 70% for 2 min). Antigen retrieval was performed in citrate buffer pH 6.0 at 95 °C for 30 min in a water bath. Endogenous peroxidases were blocked using 0.3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in PBS for 15 min. Slides were blocked using 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS with 0.05% Tween-20 for 30 min. Sections were then incubated with a single unconjugated primary antibody (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) in 10 x diluted blocking buffer for either 60 min at room temperature or 24 hr at 4 °C.</p><p>Slides were washed in PBS-Tween-20 and incubated with Envision +Dual link HRP (Dako, #K4061) for 30 min. Sections were then incubated with the respective Opal fluorochrome (Opal 480, Opal 520, Opal 570, Opal 620, Opal 650, Opal 780) at a 1:250 dilution made in tyramide signal amplification reagent (Akoya, #FP1498) for 60 min. Slides were washed in PBS-Tween-20 and a heating step of citrate buffer pH 6.0 at 98 °C for 30 min in a water bath was performed for primary antibody removal. Afterwards, the tissue was stained by repeating staining cycles in series as described above with a primary antibody removal step in each cycle. Finally, slides were counterstained with DAPI (Invitrogen, #D1306) for 5 min and mounted with Prolong Gold (Invitrogen, #P36930). Slides were imaged using the Vectra 3.0 spectral imaging system (PerkinElmer), with a low magnification scanning at 10 x to get an overview of the slide. To get representative images of the tissue section, a minimum of 2 regions of interest across the fields were chosen and scanned at ×40 magnification. Spectral unmixing was performed using InForm advanced image analysis software (PerkinElmer) and image segmentation was done in Nis Elements (Nikon). In short, nuclei detection was based on the DAPI signal, and a mask was made from nuclei that were directly surrounded by the CD45 signal. This mask was used to further select NK cells based on the NKp46 signal. The NK cell mask was then divided based on granzyme K and granzyme B expression. Cells within the lumen of vessels were excluded manually with the aid of collagen IV staining. All cell counts were then normalised to the total tissue area. If data were normally distributed as assessed by the Shapiro-Wilk test, an ANOVA test or unpaired t-test was used; if the data did not pass normality, the Kruskal-Wallis test or Mann-Whitney test was used. Staining, imaging, and analysis were performed blinded.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Funding acquisition</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Funding acquisition, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: Post-mortem tissue was obtained from donors by rapid autopsy from the Netherlands Brain Bank and Multiple Sclerosis Society Tissue Bank.

Overall the work is an impressive analysis of an understudied cell-type in MS, and represents an important finding. The paper is well presented and the figures very clear.</p><p>However, the manuscript is highly descriptive and the depth and limitations of the Cytof leaves the reader without a clear idea of what these cells could be doing. A major weakness of the study is that is underpowered and thus not clear how robust or representative these findings are in MS given the heterogeneity of the disease and also potential differences in Sex, Age and lack of healthy controls. (AD samples labelled as control.) While the patterns found are necessarily descriptive as yet, these are extensive hard-to-get data that well deserve publication the following key issues and concerns are addressed first.</p><p>1. The depth and limitations of the Cytof leaves the reader without a clear idea of what these cells could be doing. At minimum more immunohistochemical and smFish or in situ hybridization to validate key findings (using the markers identified by CyTOF) and add to the spatial relationships of Nk Cells with other border and brain cells would be informative.</p><p>2. Details on samples and controls should be more clearly communicated in the text and legends as well as the caveats and limitations of the study in the discussion. See specific comments below related to potential sex differences and gender distributions. Have the gender ratio and the age distribution been excluded in interpreting the data for the NK cell populations?</p><p>3. The authors reference the initiation of immune lesions in early MS. However, the work itself addresses end-stage MS situations, which is quite possibly an entirely different landscape altogether, and may not be informative about MS initiation. Moreover, the manuscript makes far too many speculations about possible cell trafficking between compartments than is justified by a cross-section study.</p><p>4. Are the NK cells actually in the parenchyma and interacting with other cells (eg. microglia) of the lesion. If the authors have this tissue and antibodies to do that, this would add to the study.</p><p>5. The relative prominence of leukocytes in the septum tissue is a missing analysis for completeness of the CyTOF data. (See suggestion below.)</p><p>6. The dendritic cell component in the 'myeloid APC' group could use further characterisation to the extent feasible, given potential NK cell-DC crosstalk, especially since there appears to be a selective absence of T-bet-expressing potentially cytotoxic NK cells.</p><p>7. Please address: Do the CD56bright NK cells show a normal distribution for the markers examined in figure 3d, or are there subsets of NK cells revealed when examining these markers? Do all CD56bright NK cells show similar T-bet expression (with the per cell T-bet level lower in the MS group), or are there subsets? And what is the GATA-3 status on these NK cell populations (given the GATA-3 prominence in cytokine-producing ILC2-like cells)?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>While the patterns found are necessarily descriptive as yet, these are extensive hard-to-get data that well deserve publication, although it would be important to have some issues and concerns addressed first.</p><p>1. The non-neurological control group shows a very different gender distribution than the other two groups, the three groups show differences in age ranges (supplementary figure 1), and there are clearly gender-based and age-based differences in at least some of the cell subsets examined (supplementary figure 2). Have the gender ratio and the age distribution been excluded in interpreting the data for the NK cell populations, which is the most striking finding emerging?</p><p>2. The relative prominence of leukocytes in the septum tissue is a missing analysis for completeness of the CyTOF data. This could be done either as yields of CD45-expressing cells per quantum of tissue, or as CD45 transcript levels in total tissue RNA. Further from this, some estimate of the prominence of each immune cell subset identified per quantum of tissue would be very informative.</p><p>3. The dendritic cell component in the 'myeloid APC' group could use further characterisation to the extent feasible, given potential NK cell-DC crosstalk, especially since there appears to be a selective absence of T-bet-expressing potentially cytotoxic NK cells.</p><p>4. Does the relative prominence of NK cells show any correlations with that of CD4 (or CD8) T cells?</p><p>5. A previous report, cited by the authors (their reference 46), shows that CD56bright NK cells are specifically increased in the CSF in MS, and that this is accompanied by an increase in NK T cells. Is this the case in the septum and/or choroid plexus in the present dataset (NK T cells do not seem to have been clearly identified in the present analyses)?</p><p>6. Is T-bet expression altered in the MS group in CD4/CD8 effector/memory T cells as well? (It IS lower both in γ-δ T cells and NK cells in this group.)</p><p>7. Do the CD56bright NK cells show a normal distribution for the markers examined in figure 3d, or are there subsets of NK cells revealed when examining these markers? A sub-query of this general question is; do all CD56bright NK cells show similar T-bet expression (with the per cell T-bet level lower in the MS group), or are there subsets? And what is the GATA-3 status on these NK cell populations (given the GATA-3 prominence in cytokine-producing ILC2-like cells)?</p><p>8. The immunohistochemistry data provide a small but interesting indication that location in the lesion makes a difference; its appears that the CD56bright/CD56dim (or at least, the granzyme K/granzyme B) NK cell ratio may be quite different for MS lesion centres versus borders. Given the potential functional differences in these two subsets, this might be worth confirming and discussing if confirmed.</p><p>9. The sentence in the 'results' section, that 'Matching the CyTOF data, GrB+ NK cells were more abundant than GrK<sup>+</sup> cells', is puzzling; what are the data that this sentence refers to? Assuming that it refers to findings in choroid plexus immunohistochemistry in figure 8d, the data do not actually seem to show what the sentence says, nor do they seem to support the CyToF findings in the choroid plexus. This would make sense if, in fact, the data immunohistochemistry data exclude intravascular NK cells in the choroid plexus, but this is not described. A clarification would be useful.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73849.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>While the patterns found are necessarily descriptive as yet, these are extensive hard-to-get data that well deserve publication, although it would be important to have some issues and concerns addressed first.</p><p>1.

However, the sex ratio in the non-neurological control and MS groups is the same (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1), and these two groups are the main base for our findings of an accumulation of CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells in the MS periventricular brain. Regarding the age differences, the MS group is younger than the controls. Given the known increase in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells with ageing (Smolders et al., 2018), our finding of higher numbers of this subset in the younger MS group is only strengthened, as well as in line with previous literature (Machado-Santos et al., 2018). It has been reported before that CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells decline in peripheral blood with increasing age (Chidrawar et al., 2006). However, we validated the accumulation of CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells in MS with immunohistochemistry in an independent cohort. This cohort presented a similar mean age between controls (65.8y) and MS cases (62.5y) (Wilcoxon rank-sum test with continuity correction, <italic>P</italic>-value = 0.41) and the sex ratio was also similar with a control f:m ratio of 0.667 and MS f:m ratio of 0.75). We have now highlighted the characteristics (age and sex) of the IHC validation cohort in the results.</p><p>Finally, to confirm that CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells accumulate in periventricular brain regions in MS donors, we used multiplex immunohistochemistry in an independent cohort (Supplementary File 1), wherein MS and control groups were age-matched (Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction, p-value = 0.41) and had a similar female:male ratio (0.667 in controls and 0.75 in MS).</p><p>Smolders J, Heutinck KM, Fransen NL, Remmerswaal EB, Hombrink P, Ten Berge IJ, van Lier RA, Huitinga I, Hamann J (2018) Tissue-resident memory T cells populate the human brain.

Regarding CD56bright NK cells, we could sub-cluster this population into two groups, which interestingly were characterized as T-bet- and T-bet+ (Essential Revisions Figure 3). As the reviewer points out, we observed a decrease of T-bet+ CD56bright NK cells in MS (Figure 3 —figure supplement 2 c), which fits the decrease in expression observed in Figure 3a in the manuscript. This absence of T-bet on CD56bright NK cells could indicate a loss of cytotoxicity (Harmon et al., 2016) or developmental immaturity (Collins et al., 2017) which is also associated with a hampered ability to kill target cells in comparison to more mature subsets (Oei et al., 2018). We have added this data to Figure 3 —figure supplement 2 and discuss these new data in the results:</p><p>“Further sub-clustering of CD56bright NK cells revealed the existence of a Tbet+ and a Tbet- subset (Figure 3 —figure supplement 2). Tbet- NK cells expressed higher levels of molecules that were increased in the general CD56bright NK cluster of MS patients (Figure 3a), and were the dominant CD56bright cell type in MS but not in control or dementia cases (Figure 3 —figure supplement 2). Overall, this suggests that specifically Tbet- CD56bright NK cells are increased in the septum of MS donors.”</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells and myeloid cells subpopulations in septum.</title><p>(a) UMAPs displaying pre-gated CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK subpopulation in the septum.

We have not included this in the initial version of our paper, where we focused on inter-tissue correlations and did not further elaborate on correlations within each tissue. We did not find a correlation between septum-derived NK and T cells (both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup>).

A previous report, cited by the authors (their reference 46), shows that CD56bright NK cells are specifically increased in the CSF in MS, and that this is accompanied by an increase in NK T cells. Is this the case in the septum and/or choroid plexus in the present dataset (NK T cells do not seem to have been clearly identified in the present analyses)?</p></disp-quote><p>While we detected NKT cells in the blood (Figure 6), our study was not enough powered to identify NKT cells in the CNS samples (Figures 1 and 4). Therefore, we cannot comment on the possible involvement of CP or septum-derived NKT cells in MS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Is T-bet expression altered in the MS group in CD4/CD8 effector/memory T cells as well? (It IS lower both in γ-δ T cells and NK cells in this group.)</p></disp-quote><p>Due to a large amount of data, out of all the “state” markers, we display only those which show significant differential expression between the studied groups. In Figure 2c, we show that γδ T cells in MS donors express lower levels of T-bet than those in controls.

Do the CD56bright NK cells show a normal distribution for the markers examined in figure 3d, or are there subsets of NK cells revealed when examining these markers? A sub-query of this general question is; do all CD56bright NK cells show similar T-bet expression (with the per cell T-bet level lower in the MS group), or are there subsets? And what is the GATA-3 status on these NK cell populations (given the GATA-3 prominence in cytokine-producing ILC2-like cells)?</p></disp-quote><p>We studied in more detail the subpopulations of CD56bright NK cells as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref> Regarding CD56bright NK cells, we could sub-cluster this population into two groups, which interestingly were characterized as T-bet- and T-bet. As the reviewer points out, we observed a decrease of T-bet+ CD56bright NK cells in MS (Figure 3 —figure supplement 2 c), which fits the decrease in expression observed in Figure 3a in the manuscript. This absence of T-bet on CD56bright NK cells could indicate a loss of cytotoxicity (Harmon et al., 2016) or developmental immaturity (Collins et al., 2017) which is also associated with a hampered ability to kill target cells in comparison to more mature subsets (Oei et al., 2018). We have added this data to Figure 3 —figure supplement 2 and discuss these new data in the results “Further sub-clustering of CD56bright NK cells revealed the existence of a Tbet+ and a Tbet- subset (Figure 3 —figure supplement 2). Tbet- NK cells expressed higher levels of molecules that were increased in the general CD56bright NK cluster of MS patients (Figure 3a), and were the dominant CD56bright cell type in MS but not in control or dementia cases (Figure 3 —figure supplement 2). Overall, this suggests that specifically Tbet- CD56bright NK cells are increased in the septum of MS donors.</p><p>The subcluster of T-bet+ CD56bright NK cells showed a dim expression of GATA3, which could suggest a more ILC2-like cell, but it is not possible to further characterize this population.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The immunohistochemistry data provide a small but interesting indication that location in the lesion makes a difference; its appears that the CD56bright/CD56dim (or at least, the granzyme K/granzyme B) NK cell ratio may be quite different for MS lesion centres versus borders. Given the potential functional differences in these two subsets, this might be worth confirming and discussing if confirmed.</p></disp-quote><p>We want to thank the reviewer for this thoughtful comment on the different ratios of GrK<sup>+</sup>/GrB+ NK cells in the border and center of the lesions, as observed by immunohistochemistry. CD56bright NK cells (measured with the surrogate marker GrK) abound in the rim of the lesions, where the highest activity is present in terms of immune cell activation and demyelination. We can speculate that this is the ideal location for CD56bright NK cells to exert immunosuppression and try to contain the damage. The center of MS lesions is characteristically hypocellular, and this is reflected in the number of NK cells present. We have discussed these differences further in the Results section manuscript. “GrK<sup>+</sup> NK cells accumulated in both the border and the centre of the lesion compared to NAWM, and were more abundant than GrB+ NK cells (Figure 8b-c). The increased presence of GrK<sup>+</sup> NK cells in the MS lesion confirms our earlier CyTOF data where the MS septum contained more CD56bright than CD56dim NK cells, while CD56dim NK cells were the dominant NK subset in the septum derived from controls and donors with dementia (Figure 3c). And in the discussion: “Putative CD56bright NK cells abound in the rim of the lesions, where the highest activity is present in terms of immune cell activation and demyelination. The center of MS lesions is characteristically hypocellular, and this is reflected in the number of NK cells present.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. The sentence in the 'results' section, that 'Matching the CyTOF data, GrB+ NK cells were more abundant than GrK<sup>+</sup> cells', is puzzling; what are the data that this sentence refers to? Assuming that it refers to findings in choroid plexus immunohistochemistry in figure 8d, the data do not actually seem to show what the sentence says, nor do they seem to support the CyToF findings in the choroid plexus. This would make sense if, in fact, the data immunohistochemistry data exclude intravascular NK cells in the choroid plexus, but this is not described. A clarification would be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>First, we apologize for the typo in our sentence; it should read: “Matching the CyTOF data, GrK<sup>+</sup> NK cells were more abundant than GrB+ cells”. We have corrected and rephrased it for further clarity into: “GrK<sup>+</sup> NK cells accumulated in both the border and the centre of the lesion compared to NAWM, and were more abundant than GrB+ NK cells (Figure 8b-c). The increased presence of GrK<sup>+</sup> NK cells in the MS lesion confirms our earlier CyTOF data where the MS septum contained more CD56bright than CD56dim NK cells, while CD56dim NK cells were the dominant NK subset in the septum derived from controls and donors with dementia (Figure 3c).</p></body></sub-article></article>
