by integrating signals emanating from niche-like cells and those from differentiating blood cells. We term the signal from differentiating cells the ‘equilibrium signal’ in order to distinguish it from the ‘niche signal’. Earlier we showed that equilibrium signaling utilizes Pvr (the <italic>Drosophila</italic> PDGF/VEGF receptor), STAT92E, and adenosine deaminase-related growth factor A (ADGF-A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mondal et al., 2011</xref>). Little is known about how this signal initiates during hematopoietic development. To identify new genes involved in lymph gland blood progenitor maintenance, particularly those involved in equilibrium signaling, we performed a genetic screen that identified <italic>bip1</italic> (<italic>bric à brac interacting protein 1</italic>) and <italic>Nucleoporin 98</italic> (<italic>Nup98</italic>) as additional regulators of the equilibrium signal. We show that the products of these genes along with the Bip1-interacting protein RpS8 (Ribosomal protein S8) are required for the proper expression of Pvr.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03626.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03626.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03626.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Progenitor cells are cells that can either multiply to make new copies of themselves or mature into different specialized cell types—such as blood cells. In the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila</italic>, new blood cells are formed in several different locations, including in an organ called the lymph gland.</p><p>In 2011, researchers found that the fate of blood progenitor cells within the lymph gland is controlled by signals from two nearby sources—one from specialized, supportive (‘niche’) cells and the other from maturing blood cells. The signal from the maturing blood cells ensures that the relative amounts of progenitor and maturing blood cells are kept in the right balance. As a result, this signaling process has been called ‘equilibrium signaling’.</p><p>Questions remain as to how equilibrium signaling is regulated, and how it interacts with signals from the niche. To investigate this, Mondal et al.—including some of the researchers involved in the 2011 work—used various genetic techniques to create <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae in which the tissues that become blood cells are made visible with fluorescent proteins. This meant that these tissues could be examined in live, whole animals by using a microscope. Mondal et al. then searched for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes involved in generating new blood cells in the lymph gland—particularly those involved in equilibrium signaling. This was done by switching on and off hundreds of genes, one by one, in the lymph gland, and any genes that caused changes to the generation of new blood cells were then investigated further.</p><p>Following these investigations, Mondal et al. focused on three genes—and when each of these genes was switched off in maturing blood cells, the result was that fewer progenitor cells remained in the lymph gland. This effect was not seen when the genes were switched off in the progenitor or the niche cells, which suggested that the genes are likely to be components of the equilibrium signaling pathway. Switching off these genes in maturing blood cells also dramatically reduced the levels of a protein called Pvr, a key equilibrium signaling protein known from the 2011 study and an important player in blood cell development in several species.</p><p>How the newly identified genes actually control Pvr protein levels to maintain proper equilibrium signaling in the lymph gland remains to be explored. However, this work provides a basis for investigating the role of related genes in blood cell development in vertebrate systems, namely humans.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03626.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03626.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>hematopoiesis</kwd><kwd>lymph gland</kwd><kwd>hemocyte</kwd><kwd>equilibrium signaling</kwd><kwd>niche signaling</kwd><kwd>macrophage</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HL067395</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Banerjee</surname><given-names>Utpal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000900</institution-id><institution>California Institute for Regenerative Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TG2-01169</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shim</surname><given-names>Jiwon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The THAP-domain protein Bip1, along with other proteins Nup98 and RpS8, controls the expression of the protein Pvr, a critical non-cell-autonomous regulator of <italic>Drosophila</italic> blood progenitor maintenance.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Similar to vertebrates, blood cell differentiation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is regulated in multiple hematopoietic environments, which include the head mesoderm of the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tepass et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lebestky et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Milchanowski et al., 2004</xref>), the specialized, tissue-associated microenvironments of the larval periphery (e.g, body wall hematopoietic pockets) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Markus et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Makhijani et al., 2011</xref>), and the larval lymph gland, an organ dedicated to the development of blood cells that normally contribute to the pupal and adult stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rizki, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shrestha and Gateff, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lanot et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jung et al., 2005</xref>). Understanding how blood cell development is regulated in the lymph gland is the primary goal underlying the work presented here. Differentiating blood cells (hemocytes) of the lymph gland are derived from multipotent progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jung et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Martinez-Agosto et al., 2007</xref>). These blood progenitors readily proliferate during the early growth phases of lymph gland development, which is followed by a period in which many of these cells slow their rate of division and are maintained without differentiation in a region termed the medullary zone (MZ, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jung et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>). During the same period, other progenitor cells begin to differentiate along the peripheral edge of the lymph gland to give rise to a separate cortical zone (CZ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jung et al., 2005</xref>). How progenitor cell maintenance and differentiation are regulated during the course of lymph gland development has become a major area of exploration in recent years, and several different signaling pathways have been identified that maintain progenitor cells through the larval stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lebestky et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Owusu-Ansah and Banerjee, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sinenko et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mondal et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mukherjee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tokusumi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dragojlovic-Munther and Martinez-Agosto, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pennetier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sinenko et al., 2012</xref>). Wingless (Wg; Wnt in vertebrates) is expressed by blood progenitor cells in the lymph gland and has an important role in promoting their maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sinenko et al., 2009</xref>), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) function in these cells to potentiate blood progenitor differentiation both in the context of normal development and during oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Owusu-Ansah and Banerjee, 2009</xref>). Progenitor cell maintenance at late developmental stages is also dependent upon Hedgehog (Hh) signaling from a small population of cells called the posterior signaling center that functions as a hematopoietic niche (PSC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lebestky et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jung et al., 2005</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03626.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Equilibrium signaling maintains hematopoietic progenitors in the developing lymph gland.</title><p>The lymph gland primary lobe consists of three distinct cellular populations or zones. The medullary zone (MZ) contains blood progenitor cells while the nearby cortical zone (CZ) contains differentiating and mature blood cells. The posterior signaling center (PSC) functions as a supportive population (a niche) that expresses Hedgehog (Hh) and maintains the progenitor cells utilizing this ‘niche signal’. The receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) Pvr and the STAT (STAT92E) transcriptional activator are required in CZ cells for the proper expression and secretion of the extracellular enzyme ADGF-A, which keeps the extracellular adenosine levels relatively low by converting it to inosine. The Pvr ligand Pvf1 is made in PSC cells and is transported through the lymph gland to activate Pvr in CZ cells. Collectively, we refer to the system that generates ADGF-A from the differentiating cells as ‘equilibrium signaling’, which is required independently of the niche-derived Hh signaling for the maintenance of progenitor blood cells in the MZ. Signaling events downstream of both ADGF-A and Hh (dashed arrows) cause the inhibition of Protein Kinase A (PKA) within progenitor blood cells, thereby promoting their maintenance. The individual components are color coded to match the schematic of the lymph gland. The equilibrium signal ADGF-A is blue, originating from the CZ; the niche signal Hh is magenta, originating in the PSC; PKA is gray, functioning in the MZ progenitor cells. Full details of this molecular pathway can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mondal et al., (2011)</xref>.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03626.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03626.003</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-03626-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>More recently, it has been discovered that the maintenance of lymph gland blood progenitors also requires a backward signal arising from the differentiating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mondal et al., 2011</xref>). This signal is controlled by a novel pathway that combines the function of the receptor tyrosine kinase Pvr and JAK-independent STAT (STAT92E) activation in differentiating cells, followed by the expression of ADGF-A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), a secreted enzyme that converts adenosine to inosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mondal et al., 2011</xref>). Extracellular adenosine is a well-established signal in mammalian systems in various contexts, particularly stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fredholm, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sheth et al., 2014</xref>), and an elevated adenosine level in <italic>Drosophila</italic> causes extensive blood cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dolezal et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mondal et al., 2011</xref>). It has been demonstrated that differentiating and mature cells express (and are the primary source of) ADGF-A, and that its enzymatic activity (which converts adenosine to inosine) is required for progenitor cell maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mondal et al., 2011</xref>). As differentiation proceeds, ADGF-A expression (activity) increasingly promotes the maintenance of extant blood progenitors through the reduction of stimulatory adenosine. In this way, the differentiating cell population helps balance the progenitor/differentiating cell ratio and is the basis for our referring to ADGF-A as an ‘equilibrium signal’.</p><p>Loss of ADGF-A (or STAT or Pvr) from differentiating cells increases extracellular adenosine level and thereby increases Adenosine Receptor (AdoR) signaling and downstream Protein Kinase A (PKA) activity in progenitors, which causes these cells to proliferate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dolezal et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mondal et al., 2011</xref>). PKA is a central regulator of progenitor maintenance because it integrates input from both the equilibrium signal (ADGF-A) and the niche signal (Hh). PKA mediates the conversion of the transcriptional regulator Cubitus interruptus (Ci, a homolog of vertebrate Gli) from its full length form (Ci<sup>155</sup>), required for progenitor maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>), to a cleaved form (Ci<sup>75</sup>) that promotes proliferation. Signaling by Hh inhibits PKA and promotes Ci<sup>155</sup> stabilization whereas adenosine/AdoR signaling activates PKA and promotes Ci<sup>75</sup> conversion. Thus, both Hh (the niche signal) and ADGF-A (the equilibrium signal which removes adenosine) limit PKA activity and promote progenitor cell maintenance.</p><p>Although niche and equilibrium signaling are both clearly important, details of their regulation and interaction are less clear. Thus, we performed a loss-of-function genetic screen to identify new genes involved in lymph gland blood progenitor maintenance, particularly those involved in equilibrium signaling. In this study, we report the results of this screen and the identification of three genes, <italic>bip1</italic>, <italic>RpS8</italic>, and <italic>Nup98</italic>, as new components of the equilibrium signaling pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>HHLT-gal4 and its use for whole-animal genetic screening during hematopoietic development</title><p>Unlike the adult eye or wing, analysis of internal larval tissues such as the lymph gland requires laborious dissection and processing.

Importantly, the work described here sheds new light upon this issue by demonstrating a role for <italic>bip1</italic>, <italic>RpS8</italic>, and <italic>Nup98</italic> in the regulation of <italic>Pvr</italic> expression. Our data and that of others suggest that this regulation of <italic>Pvr</italic> is likely taking place at the gene level, although other mechanisms are also possible. Ribosomes are required for protein translation, however specific ribosomal components or subunits may selectively stabilize transcripts and/or mediate preferential translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xue and Barna, 2012</xref>), while nucleoporins control both nuclear entry of regulatory proteins and the exit of mRNAs to the cytoplasm, and specific subcomponents are known to exhibit differential functions in this regard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Strambio-De-Castillia et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, RpS8 and Nup98 may selectively affect <italic>Pvr</italic> expression post-transcriptionally through transcript stabilization, transport, and translation. Although the specific mechanisms of molecular control of <italic>Pvr</italic> expression by <italic>bip1</italic>, <italic>RpS8</italic>, and <italic>Nup98</italic> remain to be determined, their function is clearly critical in mediating proper equilibrium signaling and, therefore, proper blood progenitor maintenance within the lymph gland.

The predicted Bip1 protein exhibits only one recognizable structural sequence, namely a THAP domain that contains a putative DNA-binding zinc finger motif.

Due to the embryonic activity of <italic>Hand-gal4</italic>, <italic>HHLT-gal4</italic> also labels dorsal vessel cardioblasts and pericardial cells, although by late larval stages the expression of EGFP in the former is almost undetectable.</p><p><italic>HHLT-gal4</italic> virgins were crossed to males from individual LA lines, RNAi lines, or <italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup> as a control. All crosses were reared at 29°C to maximize Gal4 activity. Wandering third-instar larvae from control and experimental crosses were collected, washed with water, and placed in glass spot wells (Fisher) on ice to minimize movement. Animals were scored visually using a Zeiss Axioskop 2 compound fluorescence microscope. Non-screen images of <italic>HHLT &gt; GFP</italic> larvae were collected with a Zeiss SteREO Lumar fluorescence microscope. Images were collected using either an AxioCam HRc or HRm camera with AxioVision software.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Tissue dissection and antibody staining and analysis</title><p>Lymph glands were dissected and processed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jung et al., 2005</xref>). Briefly, lymph glands were dissecting from third-instar larvae in 1× PBS, fixed in 4% formaldehyde/1× PBS for 30 min, washed three times in 1×PBS with 0.4% Triton-X (1× PBST) for 15 min each, blocked in 10% normal goat serum/1× PBST for 30 min, followed by incubation with primary antibodies in block. Primary antibodies were incubated with tissue overnight at 4°C and then washed three times in 1× PBST for 15 min each, reblocked for 15 min, followed by incubation with secondary antibodies for 3 hr at room temperature. Samples were washed three times in 1× PBST, with TO-PRO-3 iodide (diluted 1:1000; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California) added to the last wash to stain nuclei. Samples were washed briefly with 1× PBS to remove excess TO-PRO-3 and detergent prior to mounting on glass slides in VectaShield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, California). Mouse anti-Peroxidasin was a kind gift from John and Lisa Fessler (UCLA) and was used at 1:1500 dilution. Rat anti-Pvr was a kind gift from Benny Shilo and was used at 1:400 dilution. Secondary Cy3-labeled antibodies were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc. (West Grove, Pennsylvania) and used at 1:500 dilution.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Quantitative real-time PCR analysis</title><p>Lymph glands from 50 third-instar larvae were isolated by dissection. For fat body analysis, ten third-instar larvae were used. RNA was extracted from these tissues with the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Germantown, Maryland). Relative quantitative RT-PCR (comparative CT) was performed using Power SYBR Green RNA-to-CT 1-step kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, California) and a StepOne Real-Time PCR detection thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems) using primers specific for <italic>Pvr</italic>, <italic>bip1,</italic> and <italic>rp49</italic>.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by K (Vijay) VijayRaghavan (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom served as a guest Reviewing editor.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This paper from Mondal and colleagues addresses how blood cell progenitors within the Drosophila larval lymph gland are maintained. The work follows on from an earlier Cell paper that showed the existence of an 'equilibrium signal' from differentiating blood cells centered around PVR. In this study the authors have carried out a well-designed screen to identify novel genes required for blood progenitor maintenance and successfully identify 20 novel regulators of this process. The study then focuses on those that regulate the 'equilibrium signal' in the differentiating cells, namely bip1 and Nup98. The upstream regulation of PVR is an understudied and very important question that has wide-reaching implications, which will likely benefit our understanding of the regulation of this receptor family across species.</p><p>Technically this paper is excellent, the screen is beautifully designed and the HHLT-gal4 line is likely to be a great resource to the research community. However, there is little follow up work to the screen. Whilst the screen must have been very labour intensive the paper does feel more like a 'technique paper' rather than a ground-breaking research paper. Therefore, the storyline of the manuscript would benefit from re-shaping and focusing, placing less emphasis on the early steps of screening and more on PVR regulation. The authors may even want the title to reflect this. Some experimental clarifications and amendments of the text would be required to make the manuscript suitable for publication.</p><p>Substantive concerns:</p><p>1) The authors should address whether regulation of PVR by Nup98, bip1 and RpS8 is cell autonomous, or related to non-autonomous events, which could even originate from the population of tissue hemocytes/macrophages (by the authors called 'circulating hemocytes', see comment below), which express the same drivers as differentiating/-ed hemocytes of the LG (ie Hml-GAL4 and Pxn-GAL4). This overlap in expression is in fact a major caveat of most LG papers, an issue that receives increasing attention now that the biology of larval tissue hemocytes, the active hemocyte population of the larva, has been revealed in more detail (see below). The LG field would greatly benefit from an expression system for differentiated LG-hemocytes only (e.g. by inducible elimination of GAL4 in the earlier differentiated population of tissue hemocytes). However, in the absence of such a tool the authors need to retreat to other methods to demonstrate whether or not the presented regulation of PVR is cell autonomous. These methods should comprise:</p><p>1a) Use of flipout-GAL4 to generate <italic>in vivo</italic> RNAi clones of the genes in question, assessing PVR expression and the GAL4 expressing clones (e.g. by UAS-GFP) in the LG. Side-by-side comparison of kd and control tissue should allow to evaluate cell autonomous effects.</p><p>1b) Use of Hand-GAL4 with UAS-GAL4, or HHLT without Hml-GAL4, as driver to determine the effects of RNAi of the genes in question on LG PVR expression, in the absence of expression in tissue hemocytes.</p><p>2) The authors show all genes of the RNAi screen that led to increased Pxn expression. Do all or just some of these kds affect PVR expression? Was this a selection criterion by the authors to go forward with specific genes?</p><p>3) What is the overexpression phenotype of Nup98, bip1 and RpS8? From the phenotypes listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary File 1</xref> it looks as if they may not be fully complementary to the RNAi phenotypes. This is not a big issue as complex regulatory effects are possible, but nevertheless the authors should mention phenotypes and expression levels of PVR.</p><p>4) The discussion mainly focuses on specific hypotheses, i.e. a functional transcription complex consisting of bip1 and RpL8, suggested by third party interaction reports, and Nup98 targeting the promoter of PVR and other genes by third party ChIP data. While these are possible mechanisms, the authors should also discuss alternative and more traditional scenarios, such as general roles of nuclear pore components and consequences of their loss-of-function, and a role of ribosomal subunits either as part of the general translation machinery or in the translation regulation of specific transcripts (see e.g. review by Xue and Barna Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol 2012). Do the authors know whether other nup genes or other ribosomal proteins also have an effect on PVR expression in their system? In this context it would be very interesting to find out whether the identified PVR upstream regulators, and maybe related genes of the same functional families, may have been found by other approaches such as genome-wide RNAi screening for PVR modifiers. Any information from complementary systems would greatly synergize with the observations made by the authors.</p><p>5) Some phrasing of the manuscript is misleading and should be corrected.</p><p>5a) In the introduction, the LG is presented as 'the larval hematopoietic organ'. This may mislead to think that all hemocyte tools have high LG specificity and no crosstalk with another blood cell population may take place. To provide a more balanced view, the population of larval self-renewing tissue hemocytes/macrophages needs to be mentioned, and appropriate literature should be cited (Markus PNAS 2009; Makhijani et al. Development 2011; Makhijani and Brückner Fly 2012; Gold and Brückner Exp Hematology 2014).</p><p>5b) Related to this, when using Hml-GAL4 or another driver active in both the LG and tissue hemocyte populations, the authors should stay away from overstating specificity such as “overexpression of bip1 in Nup98 RNAi lymph glands...” (main text discussing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>5c) Hml-GAL4 does not only express in 'differentiating' hemocytes, but mainly in fully 'differentiated' hemocytes of both the tissue hemocyte population and differentiated LG hemocytes. The term 'differentiating' should therefore be used with caution.</p><p>5d) 'Circulating hemocytes' should be changed to 'tissue hemocytes', which are also known as 'larval hemocytes'. Recent research has shown that this independent population of hemocytes is largely resident in inductive tissue microenvironments (Hematopoietic Pockets), and under unchallenged conditions enters circulation only gradually and rather late in larval life (see references above).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03626.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Technically this paper is excellent, the screen is beautifully designed and the HHLT-gal4 line is likely to be a great resource to the research community.

As suggested by the reviewers, the text of the manuscript has now been reshaped to focus less on the early screening steps. In response to specific reviewer concerns about the description of the screen (below), we have removed the proof-of-principle details of the screen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (to a child figure and legend for those that would like to see this part of the screen) and have streamlined the text accordingly. Additionally, we have changed the title to reflect the central role of PVR and its regulation.</p><p><italic>Substantive concerns</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) The authors should address whether regulation of PVR by Nup98, bip1 and RpS8 is cell autonomous, or related to non-autonomous events, which could even originate from the population of tissue hemocytes/macrophages (by the authors called 'circulating hemocytes', see comment below), which express the same drivers as differentiating/-ed hemocytes of the LG (ie Hml-GAL4 and Pxn-GAL4). This overlap in expression is in fact a major caveat of most LG papers, an issue that receives increasing attention now that the biology of larval tissue hemocytes, the active hemocyte population of the larva, has been revealed in more detail (see below). The LG field would greatly benefit from an expression system for differentiated LG-hemocytes only (e.g. by inducible elimination of GAL4 in the earlier differentiated population of tissue hemocytes). However, in the absence of such a tool the authors need to retreat to other methods to demonstrate whether or not the presented regulation of PVR is cell autonomous. These methods should comprise</italic>:</p><p><italic>1a) Use of flipout-GAL4 to generate in vivo RNAi clones of the genes in question, assessing PVR expression and the GAL4 expressing clones (e.g. by UAS-GFP) in the LG. Side-by-side comparison of kd and control tissue should allow to evaluate cell autonomous effects</italic>.</p><p><italic>1b) Use of Hand-GAL4 with UAS-GAL4, or HHLT without Hml-GAL4, as driver to determine the effects of RNAi of the genes in question on LG PVR expression, in the absence of expression in tissue hemocytes</italic>.</p><p>For 1a and 1b, the major issue is whether the observed PVR phenotype in the lymph gland is due to autonomous RNAi effects or due to non-autonomous, secondary effects of RNAi in circulating/sessile, non-lymph gland hemocytes. We have addressed both 1a and 1b by expressing RNAi using Hand-gal4, which is expressed in the lymph gland but not in circulating or sessile hemocytes. Small flipout-gal4 clones (UAS-FLP Ay-gal4 UAS-GFP) constitutively driving RNAi were made at low temperature (room temp and 25 °C), while larger clones covering the most or all of the lymph gland were generated at 29 °C. In both cases, PVR expression was assessed in RNAi backgrounds. In both cases, the evidence indicates a lymph gland-autonomous role in the regulation of PVR. Clones expressing RNAi to PVR show a robust knockdown of PVR protein expression, whereas mock clones do not. RNAi knockdown of bip1 and Nup98 strongly and moderately reduces PVR protein expression, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6–figure supplement 2</xref>). By contrast, clones expressing RNAi for RpS8 show little if any effect on PVR expression (not shown). Why RpS8 RNAi fails to give a PVR phenotype is unclear, however it is likely that the regulation of PVR by these factors is complex and that the generation of small clones is not equivalent to expressing RNAi throughout a defined cell population (e.g., the Hml-gal4-expressing cells of the CZ). More importantly, to address whether bip1, Nup98, or RpS8 knockdown in the circulating/sessile cell population can affect lymph gland PVR expression, we used srpHemo-gal4 (Bruckner et al., 2004) as an RNAi driver, which expresses in a large fraction of third-instar circulating cells but with essentially no expression in lymph glands. RNAi for bip1, Nup98, and RpS8 were used and for each PVR expression in the lymph gland was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6–figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) The authors show all genes of the RNAi screen that led to increased Pxn expression. Do all or just some of these kds affect PVR expression? Was this a selection criterion by the authors to go forward with specific genes</italic>?</p><p>PVR expression was not a primary screening criterion, so the RNAi lines were not assessed as a group. However, we do know that not all RNAi knockdowns cause a reduction or loss of PVR expression, because CTPsynthase RNAi exhibits normal PVR levels (see Results and Discussion section). PVR expression was only assessed after three RNAi lines (targeting bip1, Nup98, and CTPsynthase) were identified that cause a loss of progenitors when expressed with Hml-gal4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, similar to RNAi of PVR/loss of equilibrium signaling; Mondal et al., 2011) in differentiating/mature cells, and after the bip1RNAi phenotype could be suppressed by expressing PVR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) What is the overexpression phenotype of Nup98, bip1 and RpS8? From the phenotypes listed in</italic> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data"><italic>Supplementary File 1</italic></xref> <italic>it looks as if they may not be fully complementary to the RNAi phenotypes. This is not a big issue as complex regulatory effects are possible, but nevertheless the authors should mention phenotypes and expression levels of PVR</italic>.</p><p>Overexpression of bip1, Nup98, or RpS8 has no significant effect on PVR levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6–figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) The discussion mainly focuses on specific hypotheses, i.e. a functional transcription complex consisting of bip1 and RpL8, suggested by third party interaction reports, and Nup98 targeting the promoter of PVR and other genes by third party ChIP data. While these are possible mechanisms, the authors should also discuss alternative and more traditional scenarios, such as general roles of nuclear pore components and consequences of their loss-of-function, and a role of ribosomal subunits either as part of the general translation machinery or in the translation regulation of specific transcripts (see e.g. review by Xue and Barna Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol 2012)</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers’ comments and have now revised and expanded our discussion of this issue in the text and have included the appropriate references.</p><p>Do the authors know whether other nup genes or other ribosomal proteins also have an effect on PVR expression in their system? In this context it would be very interesting to find out whether the identified PVR upstream regulators, and maybe related genes of the same functional families, may have been found by other approaches such as genome-wide RNAi screening for PVR modifiers. Any information from complementary systems would greatly synergize with the observations made by the authors.</p><p>This is an important question. We found that unlike Nup98, loss of the nucleoporin Sec13 does not cause a loss of Pvr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6–figure supplement 3</xref>). In response to the reviewer’s question, we have now used RNAi to knock down 3 additional nucleoporins (Nup154, 214, and 358; using Hml-gal4) and found that they do not affect PVR levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6–figure supplement 5</xref>). Thus, the function of Nup98 is specific. We have not analyzed additional ribosomal protein genes since there are a large number of genes that belong to this family.</p><p>During our analysis we looked at the literature for possible connections between nucleoporins or ribosomal protein and PVR, but did not find any reports connecting them beyond what we cite in the manuscript already. We are not aware of any previous screen to identify regulators of PVR; however, as mentioned in the manuscript, a genome-wide RNAi screen in S2 cells that identified PVR as a major regulator of proliferation also identified RpS8 (Sims et al., 2009), although no attempt was made by the authors to link it to PVR regulation.</p><p><italic>5) Some phrasing of the manuscript is misleading and should be corrected</italic>.</p><p><italic>5a) In the introduction, the LG is presented as 'the larval hematopoietic organ'. This may mislead to think that all hemocyte tools have high LG specificity and no crosstalk with another blood cell population may take place. To provide a more balanced view, the population of larval self-renewing tissue hemocytes/macrophages needs to be mentioned, and appropriate literature should be cited (Markus PNAS 2009; Makhijani et al. Development 2011; Makhijani and Brückner Fly 2012; Gold and Brückner Exp Hematology 2014)</italic>.</p><p>We have added text to state that multiple hematopoietic populations are evident in Drosophila. We have also cited the appropriate literature, however we do want to emphasize that this manuscript deals only with the hematopoietic compartments found within the lymph gland.</p><p><italic>5b) Related to this, when using Hml-GAL4 or another driver active in both the LG and tissue hemocyte populations, the authors should stay away from overstating specificity such as “overexpression of bip1 in Nup98 RNAi lymph glands...” (main text discussing</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>.</p><p>To say that Hml-gal4 is used to overexpress UAS constructs in the lymph gland is not incorrect; however we have clarified that Hml-gal4 expression is not limited to the lymph gland (see 5c below) at its first description in the manuscript. For the sake of simplicity, and, given our experimental results (including those conducted here to demonstrate autonomy), we have kept the original language elsewhere since Hml-gal4-expressing cells in the lymph gland are the relevant cells.</p><p><italic>5c) Hml-GAL4 does not only express in 'differentiating' hemocytes, but mainly in fully 'differentiated' hemocytes of both the tissue hemocyte population and differentiated LG hemocytes. The term 'differentiating' should therefore be used with caution</italic>.</p><p>This point is correct. Hml-gal4 activity is a definitive marker for the earliest stages of differentiation in the lymph gland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and Jung et al., 2005) but it is also expressed by more mature cells in the lymph gland (such as those expressing the P1 marker) and those cells in circulation and sessile populations. We have rechecked the manuscript and have clarified this point where appropriate.</p><p><italic>5d) 'Circulating hemocytes' should be changed to 'tissue hemocytes', which are also known as 'larval hemocytes'. Recent research has shown that this independent population of hemocytes is largely resident in inductive tissue microenvironments (Hematopoietic Pockets), and under unchallenged conditions enters circulation only gradually and rather late in larval life (see references above)</italic>.</p><p>In consideration of established and newer contributions to the literature (Rizki, 1978; Zetterval et al., 2004; Markus et al., 2009; Honti et al., 2010; Makhijani et al., 2011, among others) we have chosen to use “circulating and sessile cells” in the manuscript to refer to non-lymph gland larval hemocytes. These terms are well established and widely used, including the view that circulating/sessile cells and lymph gland cells represent distinct hemocyte populations arising from their different developmental origins. Perhaps there is need for new nomenclature that combines the sessile and circulating pool. However neither “tissue hemocyte” nor “larval hemocyte” is appropriate for them as the hemocytes within the lymph gland are contained within a larval tissue and released into the hemocoel both upon infection and at the end of the larval period.</p></body></sub-article></article>
