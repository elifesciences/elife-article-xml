fuse. The logistics underlying myofilament assembly and disassembly have started to emerge with the possibility to follow labeled sarcomere components. Here, we generated the mCherry knock-in at titin’s Z-disk to study skeletal muscle development and remodeling. We find titin’s integration into the sarcomere tightly regulated and its unexpected mobility facilitating a homogeneous distribution of titin after cell fusion – an integral part of syncytium formation and maturation of skeletal muscle. In adult mCherry-titin mice, treatment of muscle injury by implantation of titin-eGFP myoblasts reveals how myocytes integrate, fuse, and contribute to the continuous myofilament system across cell boundaries. Unlike in immature primary cells, titin proteins are retained at the proximal nucleus and do not diffuse across the whole syncytium with implications for future cell-based therapies of skeletal muscle disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>muscle</kwd><kwd>sarcomere</kwd><kwd>titin</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>live imaging</kwd><kwd>proteostasis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERCAdv</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gotthardt</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRC1470 + Single</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gotthardt</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010447</institution-id><institution>Deutsches Zentrum für Herz-Kreislaufforschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MD3-Nanopathology</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lehnart</surname><given-names>Stephan E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Titin’s regulated integration and mobility after cell fusion support syncytium formation in culture, while limited diffusion in vivo highlights a key challenge for developing effective cell-based therapies for skeletal muscle diseases.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During skeletal muscle development, the first myogenic wave starts around E11 with the fusion of embryonic myoblasts at the limb buds and the dermomyotome and is accomplished by a cascade of myogenic transcription factors like myogenic factor 5 (Myf5) and myoblast determination protein (MyoD). In the second myogenic phase (E14.5–E17.5), these primary fibers fuse with fetal myoblasts to build secondary fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chal and Pourquié, 2017</xref>). Thereafter, some myoblasts remain less differentiated to become satellite cells, the stem cell pool in adult muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Relaix et al., 2005</xref>). They enter quiescence a few weeks after birth, and subsequently, hypertrophy is the main driver of muscle growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chal and Pourquié, 2017</xref>). In the adult, satellite cells can get activated to facilitate muscle regeneration with differentiation to myoblasts and then myocytes, which eventually undergo cell fusion to form new fibers and extend existing ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Almada and Wagers, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Titin is abundantly expressed in vertebrate striated muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Wang et al., 1979</xref>), determines skeletal muscle structure and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Horowits et al., 1986</xref>), and is extensively spliced to produce isoforms with differential mechanical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cazorla et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Li et al., 2012</xref>). These vary between heart and skeletal muscle and integrate into the Z-disk and M-band of the sarcomere to form a continuous elastic filament system along the myofiber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gregorio et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Obermann et al., 1997</xref>). The process is tightly orchestrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Rudolph et al., 2019</xref>) and the resulting scaffold facilitates proper localization of sarcomeric proteins along the filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Rudolph et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, traditionally, titin has been proposed to act as a molecular ruler and as a blueprint for sarcomere assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Tonino et al., 2017</xref>) and has been recognized for its role in controlling stiffness and fine-tuning contraction in mature muscle. The novelty of our study is in the ability to track titin dynamics in real time in skeletal myocytes, both in vivo and in tissue culture, during critical processes such as sarcomere remodeling and cell fusion.</p><p>With the use of fluorescent titin proteins expressed at physiological levels in knock-in mice, we have obtained insights into the titin lifecycle and sarcomere dynamics in cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">da Silva Lopes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Rudolph et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast to the heart, skeletal muscle cells form large syncytia, which contain nuclei of several fused cells. How titin moves along the large syncytium and how titins derived from different nuclei within the syncytium are organized and integrated after cell fusion has so far been prohibitively difficult to assess.</p><p>Here, we have extended the portfolio of fluorescent titin mice with the fluorophore mCherry inserted into titin’s Z-disk region to follow titin not only around the sarcomere, but also during cell fusion. By using mCherry as well as eGFP knock-in mice, we can directly observe the reconstitution of the myofilament during regeneration and highlight the limitations and potential of cell-based therapies in skeletal muscle diseases. This real-time visualization of titin dynamics following cell fusion represents a significant advancement in understanding muscle development and regeneration, offering novel insights into the remodeling of the sarcomere and the mobility of titin across multinucleated syncytia, as well as the improved evaluation of cell-based therapies, as we not only learn where injected cells go, but demonstrate reconstitution of the myofilament in regenerating muscle and the limits of delivering healthy protein in a syncytium in cell-based therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The Ttn(Z)-mCherry mouse</title><p>To follow titin dynamics during cell fusion of skeletal muscle cells, we relayed on our established reporter mice, with fluorophores integrated into the M-band (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">da Silva Lopes et al., 2011</xref>) or Z-disk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Rudolph et al., 2019</xref>) region of titin. The knock-in approach resulted in the physiological expression of fluorescent-tagged titin and did not interfere with sarcomere assembly, titin integration, and striated muscle function. To improve the signal intensity of the red fluorophore and thus enable the analysis of skeletal muscle, we replaced dsRed at the Z-disk exon 27, C-terminal of the Z9 domain with mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–c</xref>). The process involved homologous recombination in ES cells, blastocyst injection, and removal of the NEO cassette with FLP recombinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Homozygous and heterozygous Ttn(Z)-mCherry mice assembled functional sarcomeres with intermediate signal intensity in muscles of heterozygous mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a and b</xref>). As expected from models created earlier, there was no obvious adverse phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Rudolph et al., 2019</xref>), no difference in heart-to-bodyweight ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c and d</xref>), or change in titin isoform expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1e</xref>), and proper co-localization of the mCherry-fluorophore with the Z-disk protein α-actinin in homozygous Ttn(Z)-mCherry and double-heterozygous Ttn(Z)-mCherry/Ttn(M)-eGFP mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c and d</xref>).

With the improved red fluorescent label at titin’s Z-disk, it is now possible to study the dynamics of endogenously expressed titin simultaneously at Z-disk and M-band and even in immature myocytes during cell fusion.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Generation and validation of a titin Z-disk knock-in with enhanced fluorescence.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Targeting strategy to insert <italic>mCherry</italic> into <italic>titin</italic>’s Exon 28 (Z-disk).

The different cell morphology and titin isoform composition between heart and skeletal muscle prompted the question whether titin kinetics is different in skeletal muscle cells, which we addressed using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) in Ttn(Z)-mCherry/Ttn(M)-eGFP double-heterozygous myotubes. In the representative images, the Ttn(Z)-mCherry signal reemerges already after 1 hr as compared to 4 hr for the Ttn(M)-eGFP signal and documented in the respective line profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). To confirm that the recovery of the fluorescence signal is due to titin protein exchange and not caused by a reactivation of the fluorophore, we performed the same experiment in fixed cells, where the striated signal pattern did not recover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Only minimal background fluorescence was recovered in fixed cells after 14 hr with no difference between Ttn(Z)-mCherry and Ttn(M)-eGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b–d</xref>). In contrast, there was a significant difference in fluorescence recovery and hence protein exchange between mCherry-labeled Z-disk titin and eGFP-labeled M-band titin in living cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). The mobile fraction of Z-disk titin is significantly higher than the mobile fraction of M-band titin with 73 vs. 46% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>), although there is variability between individual cells. The faster recovery of the mCherry-titin signal is also reflected in its significantly reduced exchange half-life of 1.5 hr compared to the 4.9 hr for the Ttn(M)-eGFP signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). To the average fluorescence recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>) as well as for the recovery in most individual cells, a two-phase association curve provided a better fit to the data points than the classical one-phase association curve, suggesting that the measured signal can be attributed to two protein isoform populations with different kinetics. The percentage of the fast population is significantly higher for Ttn(Z)-mCherry than for Ttn(M)-eGFP with 37 vs. 16% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). Quantification of the fluorescence signal at the opposite ends of the half-sarcomere (red signal at the M-band and green signal at the Z-disk) allowed us to quantify the kinetics of nonintegrated titin. Outside their respective integration sites, there was no significant difference anymore between the recovery of mCherry-labeled Z-disk region and the eGFP-labeled M-band region of titin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2-figure supplement 1e</xref>). However, while there was no difference in mobile fraction and ratio of slow to fast population, there was still a significant difference in exchange half-life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1f–h</xref>). There was no significant difference between integrated and nonintegrated Z-disk titin (determined at its integration site and between, respectively), but there was an increased fluorescence recovery of nonintegrated titin-eGFP (significant from 6 to 10 hr). Of note, the nonintegrated titin signal was much lower than the signal at the integration sites.

These animal models were specifically designed with an approach that enables us to follow titin originating from different cells in real time to study titin dynamics, sarcomere remodeling, and the mobility of titin across the syncytium after cell fusion. Visualizing opposing sarcomere integration sites in double-heterozygous myocytes facilitates the analysis of sarcomere assembly and disassembly. We find increased mobility of Z-disk titin vs. M-band titin in FRAP experiments. These data nicely complement our earlier work on cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Rudolph et al., 2019</xref>). Most myotubes expressed at least two titin isoforms (biphasic fit of the fluorescent recovery curve), so that skeletal muscle cells appear more homogeneous than cardiomyocytes with respect to titin isoform expression. Independent of the isoform makeup, protein exchange rates were largely similar between cardiac and skeletal muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Rudolph et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, the exchange is faster at the Z-disk than at the M-band, likely due to the integration of the newly synthesized protein with Z-disk titin mRNA available 1 hr earlier than M-band titin based on the speed of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jonkers and Lis, 2015</xref>). Alternatively, the contribution of short titins such as the Novex-3 isoforms, which contain the Z-disk, but not the M-band sequences, could help explain the difference.</p><p>To better understand titin distribution after cell fusion, we developed a theoretical model of titin diffusion. We assumed that titin synthesized in one region of the syncytium diffuses into adjacent areas while decaying according to its half-life. Based on published data, we estimated the half-life of titin in our system to be ~3.5 days (<italic>τ</italic> = 3.024 × 10⁵ s). However, our measured diffusion coefficient for titin (D = 0.3 µm² s⁻¹) does not align with the observed width of the titin gradient (~50 µm) after 8 hr. If we maintain the experimentally determined diffusion coefficient, the half-life would need to be under 100 min, an unrealistic value. Alternatively, using the estimated half-life would require a much smaller diffusion coefficient. These inconsistencies suggest that passive diffusion alone cannot account for the observed titin spread and that active transport mechanisms, such as microtubule-dependent transport, may play a significant role.</p><p>We used the increased fluorescence of homozygous mCherry and eGFP knock-ins to study cell fusion and the outcomes of cell therapy as they allow the analysis of protein flux, compartmentalization, and the generation of functional units. Within hours after myotube fusion in cell culture, we found titin gradually distributed throughout the resulting syncytium. The spread of titin appeared to be facilitated in myotubes where mature sarcomeres had not yet formed. Nevertheless, even in myotubes that had already established a mature sarcomere structure, titin proteins of a newly fused cell were able to travel through almost half of the syncytium. Both protein and mRNA mobility contribute to the efficient distribution of titin after fusion.</p><p>Diffusion of proteins through the cytoplasm in myocytes vs. nonmuscle cells should be much more limited based on the high protein concentration in the cytoplasm and attachment to the dense cytoskeletal network within. The speed of diffusion is inversely correlated with the hydrodynamic radius of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arrio-Dupont et al., 1996</xref>) and packing titin in the myofilament structure limits protein diffusion even more. Microinjection of labelled dextran molecules into myotubes revealed the decrease of the diffusion coefficient with the molecular weight from 30 µm<sup>2</sup>/s for a 9.5 kDa molecule to 2 µm<sup>2</sup>/s for a 150 kDa molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arrio-Dupont et al., 1996</xref>). In a similar experiment, globular proteins of different sizes were injected into isolated muscle fibers and diffusion coefficients differed depending on the fiber type likely due to differences in myofilament packing and not contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Papadopoulos et al., 2000</xref>). The distribution of titin along the myotube with about 1000 µm<sup>2</sup>/hr (~0.3 µm<sup>2</sup>/s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>) immediately after fusion is relatively fast compared to the much smaller dextran molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Papadopoulos et al., 2000</xref>), suggesting a contribution of additional factors such as active transport (involving microtubules and the motor proteins kinesin or dynein) vs. passive diffusion.</p><p>The directed transport of mRNA to achieve proper subcellular localization is common in all types of cells and involves the interaction between Zip-code elements on the mRNA, multiple RNA-binding proteins, and motor proteins. Thus, mRNA can be distributed 60 times faster than via passive diffusion and specific localization can be achieved. Transporting mRNA is more energy efficient than transporting protein since many proteins can be translated from a single spatially organized mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buxbaum et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, myocytes use the scarce sarcomeric space to accommodate ribosomes even in adult muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Rudolph et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting that sarcomeric proteins are not transported actively in mature striated muscle cells, but rather produced on site from locally translated mRNA and limited distribution by diffusion.</p><p>In our cell culture model of myotube fusion, titin protein and mRNA from adjacent cells distribute throughout the sarcoplasm. Here, titin travels faster in cells without a mature sarcomere structure. In differentiated cells, sarcomeres are built from titins originating from both parental cells, resulting in an alternating striated pattern. Still, it has remained unclear if this also applies in vivo, where fusion events ultimately lead to large muscle fibers, which do not form in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Almada and Wagers, 2016</xref>). To analyze how titin is distributed and integrated during regeneration and how healthy protein can be provided to diseased muscle in vivo, we used an injury model with injection of CTX into skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Garry et al., 2016</xref>) of the Ttn(Z)-mCherry mouse and transplanted Ttn(M)-eGFP myoblasts. As injury triggers the activation of the endogenous Ttn(Z)-mCherry satellite cells and their differentiation towards myocytes, myotubes, and finally fibers, the transplanted Ttn(M)-eGFP cells differentiate as well and fuse with mCherry cells and fibers. Here, we found that fluorescent titin provides a strong label to not only quantitatively follow the repopulation of injured muscle with transplanted cells, but also evaluate the generation of a functional syncytium with continued directionality of myofibers. After 3 weeks of regeneration, eGFP-positive fibers and their alternating fluorescent pattern confirmed the proper integration of donor titin. However, unlike in our tissue culture experiments, titin did not distribute throughout the fiber, but remained compartmentalized around the respective nucleus of origin. This might in part reflect the size difference between myotubes built in vitro from 2 to 10 cells and myofibers in vivo with up to hundreds of nuclei. In vitro-generated fibers retained short mRNAs close to their nucleus, whereas long mRNAs like <italic>titin</italic> spread through the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Pinheiro et al., 2021</xref>), consistent with the <italic>titin</italic> mRNA localization in our smFISH experiments in myotubes. In vivo, single-nucleus RNA sequencing (sn-RNAseq) revealed also distinct nuclear subtypes and compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kim et al., 2020</xref>), but did not allow statements of mRNA mobility. Our data would suggest that <italic>titin</italic> mRNA and the derived protein can cover distances of less than one millimeter, but will not travel from its nucleus of origin throughout the myofiber of several millimeters.</p><p>Ultimately, the difference between the fusion of cultured cells with homogeneous distribution of titin vs. compartmentalization of titin from donor cell and acceptor fiber in knock-in mice confirms the importance of in vivo studies toward understanding myocyte biology and extracting clinical relevance. Our mouse cell transplantation data suggest that in myopathies compartmentalization of the therapeutic protein after fusion of a healthy cell with a diseased fiber might restrict the therapeutic effect (most prominent for the giant protein titin). To repopulate skeletal muscle with a relevant number of cells that deliver a therapeutic protein, it would therefore be beneficial to develop treatment protocols that target the early postnatal patient or consider in utero cell therapy approaches for a higher ratio of therapeutic to diseased cells and facilitated remodeling.</p><p>In conclusion, our study advances the understanding of titin dynamics in muscle biology by providing a real-time view of titin mobility following myotube fusion. These findings highlight the need for in vivo models to better understand how titin behaves during muscle regeneration and extract clinically relevant insights for therapeutic interventions in muscle diseases. The observation of compartmentalized titin distribution underscores the challenges in cell-based therapies and emphasizes the importance of early therapeutic interventions for improved outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Generation of titin(Z)-mCherry knock-in mice</title><p>The mCherry cDNA was inserted into titin’s exon 28 (Z-disk) via a targeting vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) using standard procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Radke et al., 2007</xref>).

As myocytes merge, titin integrates into the sarcomere structure, creating a stable myofilament system. The authors of the present study have shed light on the intricate process of myofilament assembly and disassembly, which is made possible by tracking labeled sarcomere components. In this study, they introduced the mCherry marker into titin's Z-disk to investigate its role in skeletal muscle development and remodeling. Their findings demonstrate that the integration of titin into the sarcomere is tightly regulated, with its unexpected mobility aiding in the uniform distribution of titin post-cell fusion. This distribution is crucial for the formation and maturation of skeletal muscle syncytium. In adult mice with mCherry-labeled titin, treating muscle injuries by introducing titin-eGFP myoblasts illustrates how myocytes integrate, fuse, and contribute to a seamless myofilament system across cell boundaries.

The novelty lies in the ability to track titin dynamics over time, both in life mice and in tissue culture – and for the first time after cell fusion.

Cell fusion was determined by the mixing of the labeled titin originated from different cells and the break-down of the connecting membrane as an obvious criterium for cell fusion. The rate of fusion events was rather low, making it difficult to measure myomaker – especially in vivo. Based on the number of nuclei after cell fusion, we suggest that cell fusion was rather heterogenous and we therefore also expect the myomaker levels to be heterogenous. The myomaker antibody from abcam is rated as poor and we do not have access to an antibody that works well for immunofluorescence in mouse tissue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Authors indicate that knock-in of titin doesn't affect the localization. Does the knock-in of titin fused with titin express the same combination of spliced forms of titin? Can you explain in the methods section or at the beginning of the results a bit about this?</p></disp-quote><p>In our previous work (https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1904385116) we integrated dsRed at the same position, where we now inserted mCherry. Since there was no effect on titin isoform expression, we expected the same for the mCherry integration. Following the reviewer’s suggestions, we performed a titin-gel analysis on WT and titin-mCherry knockin to confirm that there is no obvious change in titin isoform expression. Please find this data now included in supplement figure S1 e.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 1c, it's very hard to visualize the α-actinin staining. Can we present it as independent, self-normalized monochrome images and their overlap? It would be great if you could also provide insets of the same. Is the variability in α-actinin across the Z-disk comparable to other studies? Why does the red band look like a broadened double peak?</p></disp-quote><p>We improved Figure 1c (now 1d), hopefully the a-actinin staining (as monochrome) is now better visible. We also inserted a scheme of the fluorophore localization (Figure 1c) that explains the double peak of the mCherry signal at both sites of the Z-disk and the GFP at both sides of the M-band. We have a similar double band in our titin BioID animals, where the BioID is integrated at the same position as the mCherry or dsRed. The distance is increased when the sarcomere is stretched. Depending on the resolution of the microscope the bands merge to a single signal, a double peak, or two separate signals as expected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Do the mCh/+ and mCh/mCh mice have higher variances for the body weight ratio and heart weight-to-body weight ratio? Is that significant?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. The Bartlett’s test for equal variances shows no significant difference between the genotypes. This information was added to Figure S1 figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 2, what is the long lifetime and how does it differ?</p></disp-quote><p>The long lifetime refers to the slow phase of the recovery of fluorescently labeled titin (mCherry-labeled titin at the Z-disk or GFP-labeled titin at the M-band). This slow phase represents the time required for full recovery of titin fluorescence. The titin in the slow phase recovers in 700-800 minutes (about 12 h) in the fast phase it recovers in about 2 min. 20% of the signal has a fast and 80% a slow recovery.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is the short phase time for FRAP different when you FRAP a volumetric GFP data? It may be better to normalize the curves with free pools of fluorescent proteins for better quantification. Figure 2 may not be the best option.</p></disp-quote><p>The bleaching laser spread more in the z direction than in the x and y direction, so that usually the titin signal was bleached over the whole cell depth within the selected square. We could detect this, because we followed the recovery time lapse with 5 z-stacks per time point. For the data analysis we used indeed just the stack that was in focus and not the volumetric data. It is possible that the recovery is slightly faster outside the focus plane. However, this effect would be present for the GFP-labeled M-band-Titin as well as for the mCherry-labeled Z-disk Titin, because both were analyzed identically.</p><p>Data from our previous work (https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1904385116) in cardiomyocytes isolated from a similar mouse line suggested that the pools of not integrated titin proteins differ between the M-band and the Z-disk region, probably due to nascent proteins, shorter isoforms (e.g. Novex3) etc. Therefore, normalization to free protein could create a bias between the two titin populations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Cardiotoxin injury and cell transplantation: Samples from three animals with insufficient myoblast integration were excluded from in-depth analysis. Please articulate the exact conditions for choosing discarded versus selected animals for the analysis of titin integration and distribution during in vivo regeneration. Is such a low sample size for controls a norm in such experiments?</p></disp-quote><p>The experiments for Figure 6 were a proof-of-principle, that cell fusion with transplanted myoblasts happened and titin proteins originated from graft cells is produced and integrated successfully together with host titin. Therefore, we worked with a low animal number in alliance with the local ethical guidelines regarding animal experiments (3R). In some cases, we could not detect any GFP+ cells. Since this might be due to low myoblast quality, we excluded these mice (compare response to reviewer 1). Importantly, we show 8 representative fused cells across animals and in 8 out of 8 we did not have protein exchange throughout the merged fiber.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the primary antibodies, α-actinin (A7811, Σ, RRID:AB_476766) was used at 1:100 dilution, Laminin (L9393, Σ, RRID:AB_477163) at 1:100 dilution, and M-Cadherin (sc-81471, SantaCruz, RRID:AB_2077111) at 1:50 dilution. After washing five times with PBS, cells were incubated with a fluorescent secondary antibody (diluted 1:1000 in PBS) for 2 hours at room temperature. Please add and specify ecolabelling was not done because actinin and cadherin seems to be monoclonal antibodies. Please reframe the sentence.</p></disp-quote><p>The M-cadherin antibody was only used for the staining of early fusion (Figure S3 a) to detect the cell membrane. The α-actinin antibody was used for later cell fusion staining (Figure S3 b and c) to visualize the sarcomere Z-disk structure. No co-labeling with M-cadherin and α-actinin was done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please indicate the sampling (lateral and sampling) and laser illumination conditions for each experiment for ICC and live imaging. Line profiles can easily cause artifacts due to geometry. Can you indicate the relative spatial variability between the staining if possible?</p></disp-quote><p>Voxel size for live imaging is 0.1311x0.1311x1 µm³ and 0.081x0.081x1 µm³ for confocal imaging of IF stained samples. The overview images in Figure 6 have a pixel size from 0.447x0.447 µm². There is a physiological spatial variability of the sarcomeres, depending on whether the myotubes were contracted or relaxed during the time of fixation and the exact developmental state. Therefore, we expected and observed different sarcomere length within the myotubes. This is also why the line profile in Figure 2a corresponds only to the representative image to point out the faster recovery of the mCherry-labeled Z-disk Titin. The broad double-peak spacing of the Z-disk signal could be observed in many myotubes, but not always. It depends on sarcomere length and magnification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the Statistical analysis section, have you performed normality tests to indicate if the tests being used are consistent with the data distribution?</p></disp-quote><p>We performed normality tests, but we agree with the GraphPad statistical guide that the decision of when to use a parametric test and when to use a nonparametric test is a difficult one, and this decision should not be automated. We used the D’Agostino-Pearson test, which was passed in all cases (Figure 2b-d and Figure 4d-e) except for the GFP-M-band data set in Figure 2d (likely due to the single data point at &gt;700 min). Based on the distribution of the remaining data in 2d (between 0 and 400 min) and the potential to introduce inconsistencies by applying a nonparametric test to only one data set within an experiment, we proceeded with a t-test for this data set to maintain uniformity in statistical analysis across all conditions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
