While there is a wide array of classes of small-RNA-producing loci, those resulting from stem-loop structures (hairpins) have received profuse attention. Such is the case of microRNAs (miRNAs), which have distinct roles in plants and animals. Fungi also produce small RNAs, and several publications have identified miRNAs and miRNA-like (mi/milRNA) hairpin RNAs in diverse fungal species using deep sequencing technologies. Despite this relevant source of information, relatively little is known about mi/milRNA features in fungi, mostly due to a lack of established criteria for their annotation. To systematically assess mi/milRNA characteristics and annotation confidence, we searched for publications describing mi/milRNA loci and re-assessed the annotations for 41 fungal species. We extracted and normalized the annotation data for 1727 reported mi/milRNA loci and determined their abundance profiles, concluding that less than half of the reported loci passed basic standards used for hairpin RNA discovery. We found that fungal mi/milRNA are generally more similar in size to animal miRNAs and were frequently associated with protein-coding genes. The compiled genomic analyses identified 25 mi/milRNA loci conserved in multiple species. Our pipeline allowed us to build a general hierarchy of locus quality, identifying more than 150 loci with high-quality annotations. We provide a centralized annotation of identified mi/milRNA hairpin RNAs in fungi which will serve as a resource for future research and advance in understanding the characteristics and functions of mi/milRNAs in fungal organisms.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fungi</kwd><kwd>miRNAs</kwd><kwd>annotation</kwd><kwd>multi-species</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002850</institution-id><institution>Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo - FONDECYT</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>11220727</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>Nathan R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100020884</institution-id><institution>Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo - Millennium Science Initiative Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Instituto Milenio de Biologia Integrativa (iBio) - ICN17_022</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vidal</surname><given-names>Elena A</given-names></name><name><surname>Larrondo</surname><given-names>Luis F</given-names></name><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>Nathan R</given-names></name><name><surname>Álvarez</surname><given-names>José M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>International Research Scholar Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Larrondo</surname><given-names>Luis F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A critical assessment of published microRNA/microRNA-like provides clues on features and conservation of these hairpin RNAs in fungi in addition to a centralized loci annotation resource for the community.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Silencing by RNA interference (RNAi) is an ancient system for regulating RNA abundance found within eukaryotes. Small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) are the functional elements behind RNAi and are typically 20–24 nucleotides in length. Functionally, sRNAs play key roles in genome stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lewsey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nolan et al., 2005</xref>), protection against RNA-based organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nicolás and Ruiz-Vázquez, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Segers et al., 2007</xref>), and regulation of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jones-Rhoades et al., 2006</xref>). In the context of pathogenic organisms, such as fungal plant pathogens, sRNAs have even been shown to display <italic>trans</italic>-kingdom functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Weiberg et al., 2013</xref>), where fungal sRNAs serve as effectors of pathogenicity regulating host genes to undermine resistance.</p><p>The biogenesis pathway of an sRNA locus can provide key insights into its function in an organism. Significantly, pathways differ by the sRNA class and by organism but generally follow the same schema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borges and Martienssen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Torres-Martínez and Ruiz-Vázquez, 2017</xref>) (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Regions of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) are processed by a Type-III RNAse called Dicer or Dicer-like (collectively abbreviated here as DCR), producing sRNA duplexes which are subsequently loaded in an Argonaute protein (AGO) for their resulting function. DCRs are responsible for the resulting sRNA length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Macrae et al., 2006</xref>) and these lengths are selective for the specific AGO loading. As a result, DCRs directly influence sRNA function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fang and Qi, 2016</xref>). The source of the dsRNA is also critical to sRNA function. Two main pathways exist for this: (1) dsRNA produced through synthesis by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR) and (2) complementary regions in transcripts form stem-loop foldback structures known as hairpins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Axtell, 2013a</xref>). Several RDR-derived sRNA classes have been defined in eukaryotes, with fungal types including those resulting from DNA damage (qiRNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2009</xref>), associated with meiotic silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hammond et al., 2013</xref>), or associated with transcriptional silencing (i.e. quelling) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fulci and Macino, 2007</xref>). Hairpin-derived sRNAs (hpRNAs) are widespread in eukaryotes and include microRNAs (miRNAs), which have central roles in gene expression control in plants and animals.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Publications referring to microRNAs (miRNAs) and/or miRNA-like (mi/milRNA) RNAs in fungi were identified, classified, and assessed for reported loci.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Generalized depiction of canonical miRNA synthesis pathway.

These have been sometimes referred to as the mature-miRNA or the miR and the miR*, though these terms are imprecise considering both of these sequences may be functional and may reverse in the rank of abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yang et al., 2011</xref>). Homologs of miRNAs are classified into families, defined by nearly identical mature-miRNA sequences, though more distant relationships have been shown to exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Xia et al., 2013</xref>). The mechanistic function of miRNAs is distinctly different by clade. In plants, miRNAs function mostly through direct cleavage of a target mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rogers and Chen, 2013</xref>), whereas in animals the process is less straightforward, relying on inhibition of translation and mRNA de-tailing, de-capping, and degradation by exonucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jonas and Izaurralde, 2015</xref>). A significant number of miRNA are anciently conserved in sequence and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cuperus et al., 2011</xref>), though they may also be highly clade- or species-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fahlgren et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johnson et al., 2019</xref>). Most miRNAs come from intergenic or untranslated genic regions (introns, UTRs), and there are rare if any examples of miRNAs derived from coding sequences (CDS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Olena and Patton, 2010</xref>). There are also examples of hpRNAs that are clearly divergent from miRNAs and produce a spectrum of sizes from differing pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Axtell, 2013a</xref>). Long hairpin RNAs have long been a biotechnological tool for induction of RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fusaro et al., 2006</xref>), however, exploration is needed to identify clearly if this occurs in organisms naturally.</p><p>Fungi have also been shown to produce hpRNAs. The hpRNA class of miRNA-like RNAs (milRNAs) was first identified in <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> (<italic>Necra</italic>), where they follow the same schema: RNA foldbacks are processed by one of two redundant DCRs (NcDCL1 and NcDCL2), which are subsequently loaded into an AGO protein (QDE2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). Homolog proteins of the DCR and AGO families have been identified in many fungal species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Choi et al., 2014</xref>) and are involved in milRNA biogenesis and function. Since, over 60 publications have cited hpRNAs in fungi, using the designations miRNA or milRNA (collectively referred to as mi/milRNAs). In fungi, these sRNAs have been identified frequently in the context of pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xu et al., 2020</xref>). This also includes some proposed to regulate gene expression in trans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cui et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wong-Bajracharya et al., 2022</xref>), regulating plant and animal host gene expression. However, most lack clear evidence for the causative role of the sRNA in the process, as many studies rely on target prediction alone for understanding their biological role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pinzón et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The advent of small-RNA-seq technology has massively increased the amount of data available for detecting sRNA-producing loci. This has affected the standards of miRNA identification, as we now can rely on high-quality evidence for their identification, as opposed to low-throughput and error-prone approaches like identification through RT-PCR. A wide spectrum of tools are available for annotation of miRNAs, with most of them based on strict rules derived from characteristics that are specific to known miRNAs from plants or animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Axtell and Meyers, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Friedländer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Johnson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kuang et al., 2019</xref>). Despite many publications identifying mi/milRNA loci in fungi, there has yet to be a systematic assessment of their characteristics and annotation confidence, as in other eukaryotic species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kozomara and Griffiths-Jones, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Meng et al., 2012</xref>). In plants and animals, much is known about miRNAs. Here, we know the lengths of the hairpins and their foldback dynamics, the sizes of sRNAs that are produced, and the mechanisms behind their targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kozomara and Griffiths-Jones, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kozomara and Griffiths-Jones, 2011</xref>). We also know the genomic context for the hairpins and the extent of their evolutionary conservation. In fungi, we lack this categorical knowledge about mi/milRNAs, which is further complicated by the abundance of non-uniform pipelines and inconsistent methodology, raising significant questions about the quality of their systematic identification. In this work, we focused solely on sRNAs derived from hairpin structures, aiming to identify fundamental characteristics of fungal mi/milRNAs. Furthermore, we sought to assess the quality of their annotations based on key metrics, ultimately building a centralized and well-documented annotation for public use. In this effort, we provide the first steps to evaluate the actual shape, size, context, and function of mi/milRNAs in fungi.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Annotation of mi/milRNA in fungal species is sparse and heterogeneous</title><p>To gain insights into fungal mi/milRNA distinctive features and to assess the state of the genomic annotation of published loci, we conducted an exhaustive search for publications including terms related to fungal miRNAs and milRNAs in PubMed. The search yielded a list of 60 publications which assess fungal mi/milRNAs, 53 of which performed and reported de novo mi/milRNA loci identification from sRNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), using a broad range of bioinformatic tools or pipelines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Noteworthy, these tools have been developed for miRNA prediction and annotation in plants and/or animals and can fail to identify loci with particular characteristics of mi/milRNA in fungi, as we demonstrated below. The majority of these sRNA-seq libraries are publicly available (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) and span 41 fungal species, including some subspecies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), presenting a prime opportunity to uncover common fungal mi/milRNA characteristics. These species come from a variety of lifestyles and relevance to humans, including laboratory models as well as many plant and animal pathogens (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Nearly all explored species are Ascomycetes and Basidiomycetes, though more distant divisions of Glomeromycota and Microsporidia are also included (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Several species have many observed mi/milRNA loci, such as <italic>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</italic> (<italic>Scscl</italic>) or <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> (<italic>Fugra</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). However, these counts may be more related to the study or the particular number of studies for a given organism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This could be due to differing levels of bioinformatic and/or experimental evidence required for mi/milRNA annotation and may fail to reveal their actual abundance/diversity in particular fungal species. For instance, only around half of the publications provide coordinates or complete sequences for precursor genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), key information to derive structural and compositional features of the hairpins and genomic contexts. Furthermore, less than half of the published mi/milRNA have support from at least two independent biological replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), a requirement considered as vital for miRNA annotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Axtell and Meyers, 2018</xref>). Regarding experimental validation, a minority of the source publications for a locus provide genetic evidence to support mi/milRNA biogenesis machinery using knock-out or over-expressor lines, or explore targeting relationships with direct experimental evidence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This assessment indicates a need for establishing a set of standard rules for reporting mi/milRNA annotations in fungi, as it has been described for animals and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Axtell and Meyers, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kozomara and Griffiths-Jones, 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Loci lacking coordinates were recovered using genome-based inference</title><p>Reporting sequence information and genomic coordinates of mi/milRNA loci is essential to determine precursor features.

To gain insights into the genomic origin of these hairpins, we utilized bowtie alignment to identify perfect matches of a supplied mature RNA sequence to the corresponding genome version and modeled possible precursor hairpin structures with RNAfold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lorenz et al., 2011</xref>). This hairpin precursor recovery pipeline was evaluated in terms of precision and sensitivity for identifying the correct locality for an mi/milRNA locus as well as its folding pattern, confirming that our pipeline has reasonably high accuracy for predicting the correct genomic locality, based on the number of alignments for a cited MAS for an mi/milRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We also found solid metrics for recapitulating the same hairpin when testing the pipeline against known hairpins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). We considered three minimal criteria for determining whether a sequence corresponds to a valid hairpin: (1) the precursor contains the reported MAS(s) within its boundaries, (2) the foldback region that gives rise to the RNA duplex must not contain secondary stems, and (3) the duplex must not contain large loops (maximum of 20 unpaired bases) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Axtell and Meyers, 2018</xref>). Hairpins reported in publications and obtained from the recovery pipeline were evaluated according to these standards, finding that most of them met these minimum requirements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

These algorithms utilize different approaches to fulfill this task. The most commonly used tools perform or require a read alignment to genome sequences, followed by locus determination based on the genomic position and depth of the reads. Although bioinformatic prediction of sRNA loci from sequencing data is the preferred method to discover miRNAs and other types of sRNAs, frequently bona fide miRNA annotations require further curation and validation considering the differences in annotation standards. Hence, the quality of the annotations may appear quite variable among the submitted datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Axtell and Meyers, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kozomara et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ludwig et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Meng et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>We sought to independently evaluate reported mi/milRNAs in each publication, taking advantage of the availability of most of the source sRNA-seq data used for annotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

We confirmed alignment rates mostly similar to that of their parent publications for each step, where the data are available (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). In these publications, mi/milRNA are reported with a short sequence referred to as the mature sequence or alternatively as the miRNA or milRNA. In the case of animal and plant miRNA discovery, mature miRNA sequences are the MASs aligned to a locus, as a requirement of precise locus processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Axtell and Meyers, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kozomara and Griffiths-Jones, 2014</xref>).

These categories are examples for which the locus annotation pipeline may need further curation via a consistent set of rules. Close inspection of sequences in raw, untrimmed libraries shows that it is unlikely these issues are caused by differences in the trimming, filtering, or alignment steps, since the exact reported mature mi/milRNA sequence was not present in the raw libraries.

These rules are derived from examples of known miRNA loci in well-studied organisms, and focus on the specific alignment profile of sRNA-seq reads over these loci, which is intimately related to the biogenesis mechanism of these regulatory molecules. Applying these criteria (summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>), we found that fungal sRNAs frequently fail to meet key points compared to animal or plant miRNAs, resulting in very few that pass all rules in a set. This partial fulfillment of criteria is similar to the performance of miRNAs annotated as low confidence in miRbase for plants and animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This led us to explore a less-strict set of rules to confirm that reported mi/milRNA in fungi are sRNAs derived from bona fide hairpins.</p><p>sRNAs originate from dsRNA precursors, either produced from an RNA-dependent polymerase or from a stem-loop foldback in the case of hpRNAs. These scenarios result in different alignment profiles of sRNA-seq reads, as hpRNAs will only be produced from the strand of the hairpin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Axtell, 2013a</xref>). It follows that the first basic criterion is that hpRNAs should largely originate from the proposed hairpin strand (&gt;80%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Axtell, 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). A second criterion focuses on a minimum standard of expression. Here, we estimated that a minimum threshold of detection for the MAS is 0.5 reads per aligned loci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>) as this would be at the detection limit for libraries of depths around 5 million aligned reads, a threshold passed by the raw depth of ~95% of libraries referenced in this work (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Finally, we applied a third criterion for valid hairpins: the duplex for the MAS must contain no secondary structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). This needed to be re-evaluated despite the prior hairpin validation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), due to the discovery of different MASs than reported for many loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We found that nearly half of the loci pass these three criteria in at least one library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>).</p><p>In order to evaluate how these three rules allowed for the discrimination between high- and low-confidence miRNA loci, we determined the performance of known miRNA reported in miRbase for <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<italic>Artha</italic>) and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<italic>Drmel</italic>) using public sRNA-seq libraries for these two organisms. We found low-confidence miRNAs performed poorly, especially in terms of strandedness and expression, while for high-confidence loci more than 80% passed all three rules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This points to the ability of these rules to discriminate low-confidence annotations. We found that fungal loci perform considerably worse than high-confidence <italic>Artha</italic> and <italic>Drmel</italic> loci in terms of passing both expression and stranding filters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). However, it is noteworthy that these fungal loci still perform much better than low-confidence miRNA considering these metrics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), indicating that they may represent a heterogeneous mixture of sRNA, possibly including siRNA or degradation-related loci, for example.</p><p>From our initial set of 1727 loci, 394 (22.8%) passed all criteria (‘confirmed’ set, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>), while 272 (15.7%) passed all criteria in two or more different libraries (‘confirmed and replicated’ set, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>), for a total of 666 confirmed loci. Interestingly, 15 (0.9%) of these loci met our criteria and also the more strict set of rules used for plant miRNAs (ShortStack and Axtell-2018) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Axtell, 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Axtell and Meyers, 2018</xref>). We found important differences between the numbers of ‘confirmed’ and ‘confirmed and replicated’ loci between species, with some of them showing a lower number (e.g. <italic>Trichophyton rubrum – Trrub</italic>, <italic>Verticillium dahliae – Vedal</italic>) or a higher number (e.g. <italic>Rhizophagus irregularis – Rhirr</italic>, <italic>Gigaspora margarita – Gimar</italic>) of confirmed loci than <italic>Artha</italic> or <italic>Drmel</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Confirmation rates are highly variable in relation to source publication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>), with lower confirmation rates tending to be associated with specific tools and pipelines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>). While most mi/milRNA loci produce 20–24 nucleotide sRNAs as the MAS, there is no clear association of sRNA sizes with rates of confirmation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>). In particular, species with high counts of identified loci such as <italic>Fugra</italic> and <italic>Scscl</italic> are prone to low confirmation rates pointing to systematic issues with the annotation pipelines, including problems with identifying valid hairpins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). While this minimal rule set is useful for filtering the lowest-confidence loci, it is likely not sufficient to form the basis of an annotation and this analysis further confirms the need for a standardized pipeline and set of criteria for miRNA annotation in fungi.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>mi/milRNA are frequently associated with protein-coding regions</title><p>The genomic context of miRNAs is an important feature to understanding their function and evolution. In animals particularly, miRNAs can associate quite closely with protein-coding genes (PCGs), originating mostly from introns, and untranslated regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Han et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Westholm and Lai, 2011</xref>). Conversely, plant miRNAs are mostly distant from coding regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Axtell et al., 2011</xref>). In fungi, the genomic origins of mi/milRNAs have not been thoroughly studied. To gain insight into the genomic context of fungal mi/milRNAs, we first determined whether loci overlapped with any known structural or non-regulatory RNA. Structural RNAs (rRNAs, tRNAs) and non-regulatory sRNAs (snRNAs, snoRNAs) have fold patterns that might be similar to a hairpin. Considering that these are expressed sequences that likely produce short RNAs due to degradation, these may be erroneously assigned as miRNAs. Similarly, transposable elements (TEs) are known to produce siRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nicolás and Ruiz-Vázquez, 2013</xref>). For these reasons, mi/milRNAs that overlap with other gene products should be treated with great scrutiny. We performed a blast search of all hairpin sequences against Rfam RNA families excluding RNAi-related sRNA families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Griffiths-Jones et al., 2003</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, most hairpins did not find hits in Rfam. The minority that did find hits can represent an outsized presence genomically. This appears to explain some of the most repetitive sequences such as bba-milR4 in <italic>Beauveria bassiana</italic> (<italic>Bebas</italic>), which matches the nearly universal U6 snRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In this case, we find that bba-milR4 matches hundreds of loci in animals and plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and is found in the majority of other searched genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>mi/milRNA loci were evaluated for homology and overlap with other genomic features.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Number of loci matching Rfam structural RNA families, identified by blastn (bitscore ≥ 50).

A genomic search for hairpin sequences is challenging, as large amounts of sequence variation can occur in many regions as long as they maintain the same structure (i.e. compensatory variation) for example, plant miR156 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

This might be an indication of the larger evolutionary distances in subject fungi compared to controls. Animal miRNAs also show signs of conservation, though distinctly lower than plants, possibly a result of their shorter hairpin lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). These loci with genomic conservation are strong candidates for biologically important mi/milRNAs, as selection plays a part in their retention.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Well-supported fungal mi/milRNAs have similar characteristics to plant and animal miRNAs</title><p>Each prior analyses give different facets of support to published mi/milRNA loci.

Tier 1 hairpins are intergenic, found to be conserved between genomes, and are supported by our re-analysis of source sRNA-seq data. Tier 2 loci must have two of these three elements of support, also allowing PCG intersections not associated with a CDS in addition to intergenic loci. Tier 3 loci fail the prior two tests, but do not contain any exclusionary evidence, such as intersections with a TE or PCG-CDS, a hit with a structural RNA (Rfam), or failure to confirm with sRNA-seq evidence. These loci need more evidence to be supported as mi/milRNAs. Tier 4 loci have one of these exclusion criteria, and are likely non-mi/milRNA-derived sRNAs or represent the product of RNA degradation.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Supporting evidence was used to categorize hairpin RNAs into tier classifications.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Tier classifications of loci based on evidence quality.

The most commonly identified species was <italic>Rhizoctonia solani</italic> (<italic>Rhsol</italic>), which had the highest quantity of confirmed and replicated loci of all species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). These top-tier loci tend to fall into similar size ranges as sRNAs found in plants and animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), though these sizes are usually more concise for miRNAs (20–22 nucleotides). Cleavage by dicer proteins is known to be the causative factor in sRNA size and only rare evidence exists for mi/milRNAs with pathways alternative to DCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). Considering this, loci falling into more atypical ranges (shorter than 19 or longer than 25 nucleotides) may be false positives for mi/milRNA as they might not be indicative of a DCR-derived locus. This is further evidence of a need of standards defining sRNA profiles of mi/milRNAs in fungi. Hairpin lengths tend to be short in fungal loci, much more similar to those of animals than plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Indeed, the inter-duplex length for loci is usually minimally sized, and less than 20 nucleotides in all. A very basic measure of the specificity of processing for an sRNA locus is the proportion of total locus abundance that is represented by the MAS. Here, we show that MAS of top-tier mi/milRNAs in fungi comprises a much lower proportion of locus reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). This is possibly a sign of differences in the specificity of dicing in fungi or that these loci are not genuine miRNAs or milRNAs. Overall, these characteristics point to similar features to known miRNAs, which is further evidence of an ancient mechanism for miRNAs in eukaryotes.</p><p>Using the combined evidence presented in this work, we provide a centralized source of mi/milRNA annotations in fungi. This includes annotations outlined in GFF format (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata2">Source data 2</xref>) and complete tables describing extensive details of the loci with supporting evidence for all loci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>).

Despite the wealth of loci identified in these publications, it is evident that there are persistent problems with filtering out false identifications. Our work finds that only a fraction of these loci remain when performing independent validation. Particularly concerning are those loci failing minimal standards using their own sequencing data, pointing to a serious problem with the standards for locus identification based on sRNA-seq alignment profiles.</p><p>It is crucial to adopt a pipeline which is fully auditable for the publication of new sRNA loci, such as an miRNA. This means publishing the unabridged output of any tools used in annotation, including important details such as the sRNA profile of the locus itself (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>). This is especially important if sequencing libraries for the study are not made available. Custom analyses and curation should be largely avoided, but if they are used, they must be explained thoroughly and demonstrate supporting evidence found with common tools. Many of the publications citing mi/milRNAs in fungi failed to share even the most basic features of the locus they have identified, sometimes only giving a single sRNA-sequence. For an annotation to be of use to the scientific community, full details of the locus should be given, including precursor coordinates, sequences, and predicted folding structures. Plant and animal miRNAs also suffered from this lack of detail, which was a major motivation for establishing of the miRbase repository (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Griffiths-Jones et al., 2006</xref>). Even with complete reporting, low-quality annotations have been pervasive in miRNA annotations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kozomara and Griffiths-Jones, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Meng et al., 2012</xref>), showing that this challenge is not unique to fungi. Indeed, evidence in this work points to many fungal mi/milRNAs that have qualities similar to low-confidence miRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), further emphasizing a need for stricter standards for annotating these loci. We found that only a small number of loci passed all of the rules laid out for miRNAs by some of the more strict rule sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Axtell, 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Axtell and Meyers, 2018</xref>). It is unclear if this is truly representative of the number of loci that might be defined by miRNA rules or if technical challenges are preventing their discovery. An approach more tuned to this clade may be required to assess the question more broadly.</p><p>Many tools exist for sRNA-annotation, with most focusing on miRNAs in animals and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Axtell and Meyers, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Friedländer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kuang et al., 2019</xref>). In fungi, at least one tool has been developed for milRNA identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yao et al., 2020</xref>), but uses a genome-free approach and doesn’t address other categories of loci. The lack of reporting quality and differences in methods between species and studies shows a need for systematic analyses in fungal sRNA loci as has been performed for plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lunardon et al., 2020</xref>) to more clearly grasp the actual types of loci produced in this clade.</p><p>Dimensions of an sRNA locus can tell us a great deal about its synthetic pathway and likely function in an organism. Confirmed hairpins in fungi are much more similar to animals in length – they are very short with little to no terminal loop structure. Phylogenetic comparisons of dicer proteins in eukaryotes show fungal proteins differing vastly from plants and animals, where they are much more similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bollmann et al., 2016</xref>). Animals have a two-step mechanism for dicing hairpins, utilizing two different RNAse III proteins (DCR and Drosha) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Axtell et al., 2011</xref>). However, no evidence points to such a compartmentalization of dicing roles in fungi, further confounding the observed hairpin similarities. Lengths of the MASs from mi/milRNAs broadly fall into expected size ranges for eukaryote sRNAs (20–24 nucleotides). Specific DCRs are the causative factor for determining sRNA length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Macrae et al., 2006</xref>), but fungi have an average of only two DCR homologs in a species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Choi et al., 2014</xref>) and are thought to be partially redundant in some cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). This limited radiation of DCR proteins challenges how this range of lengths might be possible. Our results point to low specificity in fungal mi/milRNA dicing, which might explain the wide range of sizes observed, though this may also be a sign of clade-specific neofunctionalization of DCRs or other unknown protein factors.</p><p>As for the function of fungal sRNAs, there appears to be a higher average count of AGO genes across important clades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Choi et al., 2014</xref>), which might point to multiple roles in terms of transcriptional or post-transcriptional gene silencing. However, the details of AGO functions in terms of mi/milRNAs is still unclear and important questions still remain about how these loci may function in relation to sRNA length, their targeting dynamics, and the manner of which given sRNA affects the expression of target genes. These results are challenging to obtain and frequently require follow-up studies to confirm functionality and role of a proposed mi/milRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Xu et al., 2022</xref>). Proving targeting function in fungi is particularly difficult, as we have yet to develop a detailed view of the targeting dynamics, especially in terms of base-pairing requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Broughton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2014</xref>) or distinct mechanisms of different AGOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fang and Qi, 2016</xref>). Targeting for mi/milRNAs in <italic>Necra</italic> appears to tolerate some degree of mismatching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2010</xref>), though it is unclear what if any patterning requirements exist (i.e. seed pairing). <italic>Our</italic> analyses did identify that numerous mi/milRNAs may function more similarly to plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dutta et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hunt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jeseničnik et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Silvestri et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2017b</xref>), as this indicates directed cleavage of a target RNA. However, more evidence is needed to determine if mi/milRNAs in fungi function in a manner fully consistent with miRNAs in other organisms.</p><p>Few annotations curated by this work have high-quality evidence of targeting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>), owing to the one-at-a-time nature of many targeting confirmation approaches. Three mi/milRNAs from tiers 1/2 had strong confirmed targeting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). One was shown in <italic>Coprinopsis cinerea</italic> (cci-milR-24, PID1279) regulating genes involved in developmental transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lau et al., 2020</xref>). The others were identified in two different strains of <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> (<italic>Fuoxy</italic>) which infect tomato (Fol-milR1, PID2279) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ji et al., 2021</xref>) and banana (milR-87, PID2109) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2022</xref>), and are likely paralogous loci producing the same MAS. Interestingly, their confirmed targets point to both <italic>trans</italic>-species and endogenous roles in regulation, targeting a tomato resistance gene (SlyFRG4) and a <italic>Fuoxy</italic> glycosyl hydrolase (FOIG_15013) linked to pathogenicity, respectively. These show the importance of mi/milRNA in fungi both endogenously and in inter-species relationships.</p><p>While identifying proof of targeting is not a requirement of mi/milRNA annotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Meyers et al., 2008</xref>), it is an essential facet for determining the biological role of any sRNA. Our analyses did identify numerous mi/milRNAs which are likely biologically relevant (tiers 1 and 2) and are strong candidates for future analyses of expression, biogenesis, and biological function/role. Those which have genomic conservation are particularly interesting, as conserved targeting relationships as have been observed in other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johnson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Xia et al., 2013</xref>) and would be further evidence of evolutionarily conserved roles. It is also important to note that validation of sRNA function is not necessarily a sign that it is derived from an mi/milRNA, as there are numerous RDR-derived sRNA classes that can likely function similarly. Lower tier loci with strong targeting evidence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>), suggesting they are functional sRNAs that are not mi/milRNAs, as has been shown with other important fungal siRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Weiberg et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Conservation of mi/milRNAs is a strong sign of their importance. Retention of a processed hairpin between species can be an indicator of selection for retention of function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cuperus et al., 2011</xref>). However, even in systems with widespread conservation, many identified miRNAs are lineage-specific. These non-conserved miRNAs are often imprecisely processed and lowly expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Qin et al., 2014</xref>) making them frequently designated ‘low confidence’. Many fungal mi/milRNAs presented here have these similar characteristics, with nearly all of top-tier loci shown as highly lineage-specific, based on our conservation analysis. Considering that the vast majority of species analyzed here are pathogens, this could be related to adaptation to hosts and/or a function as <italic>trans</italic>-species sRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Weiberg et al., 2013</xref>). These sRNAs quickly differentiate in parasites, with evidence of evolution influenced by the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johnson et al., 2019</xref>). The most conserved locus from our work (milR22, <italic>Comil</italic>) is an insect pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shao et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting at a possible <italic>trans</italic>-species role. In all, much more evidence is needed to conclude that these genomically conserved mi/milRNAs are similarly expressed, processed, functional, and facilitate a similar role. Identifying the conservation of these aspects will be an important milestone in the exploration of mi/milRNAs in fungi.</p><p>The genomic context of fungal mi/milRNAs remains uncertain. Many mi/milRNA loci were shown to be derived from coding sequences of genes. These might warrant further investigation, though should be treated carefully, as inverted repeat structures like those in miRNA precursor stem loops might interfere with mRNA secondary structure or codons. While many loci were considered lower quality given their homology with TEs or structural RNAs, these still might be legitimate sources of mi/milRNA. Indeed, some work has concluded that miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yoshikawa and Fujii, 2016</xref>) may be derived from rRNAs. However, RDR-derived sRNAs are more frequently associated with rRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lambert et al., 2019</xref>), including the qiRNA class in fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2009</xref>). Some evidence even points to milRNAs in <italic>Necra</italic> which might span portions of tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). Finding strong evidence supporting these loci would represent unique paths for biogenesis of mi/milRNAs and could give great insight into the genomic evolution of fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Qin et al., 2015</xref>). These annotations should be treated with caution, as all expressed loci produce short RNAs as a natural result of degradation. Accordingly, these require more attention to conclude that they are actually derived from a DCR protein and are a sRNA locus at all. Considering the enriched proportion of TEs in loci which did not pass confirmation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), loci discovered with these features are likely a symptom of false annotation. This is also true for those derived from protein-coding regions, though this phenomenon is much more documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rearick et al., 2011</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>A large number of sRNAs derived from hairpin sequences have been reported as mi/milRNAs throughout the literature. Here, we provide a complete and centralized annotation of these loci, giving all essential data for their exploration. This work identifies that many of the loci fail in basic validation of the locus structure and expression, highlighting a need for better standards of annotation in fungal mi/milRNA loci. Around 10% of loci were found to fall in the highest tiers of support, with these validations and annotations provided as a community resource. We found that these loci frequently arise from coding regions of the genome, including some from introns in genes. Genomically conserved mi/milRNAs also provide insight into the possible retention of these loci and their function. Overall, we see that fungal mi/milRNAs are similar in many ways to those of animals and plants though it is not always clear to which they are more, varying in aspects of sRNA length, hairpin length, and mode of action. These results provide one of the first clade-wide explorations of this topic and allow greater perspective into the still-developing topics of mi/milRNAs in fungi.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Finding published fungal mi/milRNAs</title><p>To assess the state of mi/milRNAs in fungi, we searched for publications related to ‘miRNAs’ and ‘miRNA-like RNAs’ in fungal species. We performed this search on the PubMed web interface using the following term: (‘Fungi’[Text Word] OR ‘Fungus’[Text Word] OR ‘Fungal’[Text Word]) AND (‘miRNA’ OR ‘milRNA’ OR ‘miRNA-like small RNA’) NOT Review[Publication Type], yielding 238 results (July 29, 2022). These were subsequently filtered by hand as to whether they referenced these types of sRNAs in a fungal species. Publications were then assessed for whether they identify sequences or loci related to mi/milRNA, extracting all relevant sequence and coordinate information. Only discoveries based on small-RNA-sequencing were considered. Other information extracted was the accession numbers associated with sequencing repositories, any indications about the replication of a given mi/milRNA in multiple libraries, and the genome assembly used to identify loci. When assemblies were incompletely identified, the correct genome was inferred by manually matching coordinates (where available) to likely assemblies.</p><p>Support for mi/milRNA genes was analyzed in two contexts: genetic evidence supporting their synthesis pathway and functional evidence supporting targeting relationships. Confirmed genetic evidence constitutes studies that used knock-out, knock-downs, or over-expression to identify genetic dependencies for at least one mi/milRNA. For proving function of an mi/milRNA, studies that relied only on target prediction or indirect perturbations (i.e. a knock-out of essential sRNA genes) were considered weak evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pinzón et al., 2017</xref>). Molecular evidence of cleavage (5’-RACE, degradome) or observing the effects of direct modulation of a specific mi/milRNA abundance (i.e. through target mimics, sRNA supplementation/over-expression, sRNA knock-outs) were considered strong evidence. Targeting evidence was identified both at the publication and at the individual mi/milRNA levels.</p><p>A complete record of loci was produced based on the available data, including the coordinates, chromosome/scaffold (with NCBI identifiers), strand, hairpin sequence, genome/assembly, and the published mature sRNA-seq. Where coordinate information was lacking but a hairpin sequence was available, coordinates were inferred using blastn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Camacho et al., 2009</xref>). Hairpins were folded using RNAfold (default options) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lorenz et al., 2011</xref>). The duplex was estimated based on the pairing for the published mature sequence, including a conventional 2 nucleotide 5’ overhang on the mature and star sequences. To be considered valid, a hairpin must (1) contain the reported MAS, (2) have no secondary structures present in the duplex region, and (3) have no more than 20 base positions in the duplex that do not have a paired sequence.

For those with only a single mature sequence provided, genome alignment of this sequence with bowtie (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Langmead et al., 2009</xref>) was used to find candidate localities. For those with two mature sequences, genome alignments of these two sequences were intersected so that a locality must contain both. In the case of multiple localities found, they were tested in an arbitrary order (random). Testing involved dividing a locality into sequential candidate hairpins, 10 each of sizes 150, 300, and 600 nucleotides, making 30 candidates in all. These were folded and assessed for validity as shown prior. The recovered hairpin was chosen based on the most frequently identified duplex sequence among the hairpins. The chosen hairpin passing these requirements was reported for an mi/milRNA and all subsequent localities were ignored.

When the assembly associated with an mi/milRNA did not have an NCBI entry, or failed to have one or both of the annotations, we chose the most complete assembly that did. We used blastn alignment of the hairpin sequence to translate between genomes where necessary. Genomic distance was determined using bedtools closest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>), reporting the closest feature to the hairpin locus on either strand. This was repeated for TE and PCG annotations. In the case of a tie, a single closest feature is reported, with TEs favored in the case of a tie in distance (or intersect). Distances of 100 nucleotides or less were considered intersections in terms of calling intergenic loci. To assess intragenic context, we looked for overlaps with exon and CDS annotations, classifying a hairpin as such if over 15% of its length is derived from one of these regions. Non-exonic hairpins derived from within the gene are identified as introns, while exonic hairpins without CDS overlap are identified as coming from a UTR.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Finding orthologous hairpin sequences</title><p>To identify putative orthologs of mi/milRNA in other fungi, we utilized genomic sequence searches.

Search output was filtered to include only orthologous hits (excluding hits in the same species) and redundant hits in a species, retaining only the best candidate by bitscore. To control for length of hairpins, positive hits were filtered to have a bitscore/input sequence length &gt;0.4. Profiles for milR22 homologs in other species were performed by aligning all libraries of said species to their hairpin profile, using bowtie (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Langmead et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Building phylogenetic trees</title><p>To compare organismal taxonomy, phylogenetic trees were constructed based on 18S ribosomal data from the SILVA database (v138.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Quast et al., 2013</xref>). Single sequences for each species were obtained from the reference NR99 aligned dataset when available and taken from the partial database when not available there. Alignments were performed to remove gaps and align the partial sequences to the NR99 alignments using MUSCLE (3.8.31) with default settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Edgar, 2004</xref>). Maximum likelihood trees were produced for each organismal kingdom separately (fungi, plants, and animals) using raxml -m GTRCAT -p 9182 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stamatakis, 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Tier classification criteria</title><p>Loci were classified into four confidence tiers based on metrics of sRNA-seq confirmation, genomic context, and inter-genomic conservation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Tier 1 loci are categorized to pass all criteria: they are confirmed and replicated by sequencing analysis, are derived from intergenic regions, and are conserved in two or more genomes. Tier 2 loci meet two out of three of these standards, also allowing genomic intersections with non-CDS-PCG regions (near-PCG, PCG-UTR, and PCG-intron). Tier 3 loci do not meet the higher standards of tiers 1 and 2, but also do not meet any exclusion criteria, defined as: having genomic intersection with a TE or PCG-CDS, having homology to structural RNAs (Rfam), or having failed confirmation based on sRNA-seq re-analysis. Tier 4 loci are those that failed in one or more of these exclusion criteria.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Reviewing editor, <italic>eLife</italic></p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>List of publications reporting miRNAs and miRNA-like (mi/milRNA) from fungi referred in this work.</title><p>We show the publication identifier used in this work, the organism it pertains to, the publication title, journal, URL, whether the miRNA/milRNA reported were obtained by sRNA-seq analysis (Y:yes; N:no; other context), details of why a study was excluded, whether sRNA-seq data is available (Y: yes, N:no), whether mi/milRNA loci coordinates are provided (Y:yes, N:no), whether biological replication of results has been performed (Y:yes, N:no), whether genetic evidence is provided (Y:yes; N:no), type of targeting evidence provided (prediction, degradome, 5’ RACE, in vitro support for targeting, and detection of target gene modulation through indirect approaches knock-outs of biosynthetic genes and direct approaches which modify the expression of the functional sRNA), and bioinformatic tool used for mi/milRNA identification.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Pablo A Manavella as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>After the consultation, we believe that all the suggestions made by the reviewers are constructive and that you are likely to be able to address them. As you can see in the reviewer's comments, there was a concern regarding the functional validation of the identified miRNAs. During the consultation, we agreed that while discussing this limitation of the study would be acceptable, it would be preferable if you can provide some level of confirmation, perhaps in form of a target prediction analysis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have only a few comments, not necessarily ordered by their importance:</p><p>Line 60-62.

It is not common to find IR sequences in coding regions.</p><p>I'm curious about figure 5 C. Contrary to your statement, this is not a typical profile for miRNAs (especially in plants). Most miRNAs in plants are 21 nt with a few 20 and 22, but almost no 23-24, which DCL3 produces from TE. There are some exceptions, for example, in dcl1 mutants or in flowers where DCL3 may overcome DCL1 function and produce 23-24 &quot;miRNA&quot;, but in these cases, these sRNA do not work as miRNA but as siRNA triggering TGS instead of PTGS. Is there any evidence that 24 nt siRNA act in PTGS in fungi? You mentioned that fungi have 2 DCR proteins. What about AGO? as PTGS in plants is mainly triggered by 21 nt loaded into proteins from the AGO1 clade and TGS by 24 loaded into AGO4 clade.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Figures contain too much detailed information from the statistical analysis, which cannot be easily interpreted independently of the main text. It is suggested to show the key points of data for better understanding.</p><p>2. It is suggested to draw the biogenesis process of fungal mi/milRNAs in the figures, including their genomic loci (exon and intron of protein-coding genes, TE, intergenic regions) and hairpins to better show their features.</p><p>3. How fungal mi/milRNA loci are classified into four tiers? Please state the classification criteria.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The absence of follow-up experiments somewhat limits the impact of this paper. Overall this paper will be of interest to readers trying to understand the characteristics and functions of miRNA and miRNA-like hairpins in fungi. Though the theme is interesting, I felt some clarification is needed. I listed some critical points to be reconsidered. I hope it helps the authors improve the manuscript.</p><p>– l:364 You mentioned that you use HMMER to search for conserved hairpin sequences. You use a cutoff of &gt; 0.4 bits/base pair, attempting to normalize for shorter hairpins, similar to animals.</p><p>But, in Figure 5D in tier2 despite, on average the length of the hairpin being even below that of animals, you have several outliers with larger hairpins (similar to plants). So, why try to center only in shorter hairpins? I don't see the point here.</p><p>– l:400 &quot;While there is conservation in fungal mi/milRNAs, it does not compare with the magnitude in plants, where miRNA conservation is widespread&quot;</p><p>This is partially true, at least by the phylogenetic trees you are showing. In plants, you are comparing only angiospers (mostly eudicots plants). But, if you compare less closely related plants, for example, Artha with some moss (bryophytes), you won't find widespread miRNA conservation. The evolutionary distance in fungi you are comparing seems higher than in plants. Thus, to support your claim, it would be interesting to compare two similar evolutionary distant groups in fungi and plants. Or at least mention it in the discussion.</p><p>– I already mentioned that the absence of follow-up experiments somewhat limits the impact of this paper.

We agree with all of the suggestions and have made an effort to remedy them by text or re-analysis where necessary or possible. Direct responses to all comments/suggestions are shown below.</p><p>As for the essential revision of exploring targeting, we decided to use the confirmed targets proven in source publications and secondary publications referencing the mi/milRNA loci evaluated in our study. Though these represent only a small number of loci, we believe that their inclusion contributes importantly to the record of annotation presented in this work. All loci with strong validation (molecular evidence, genetic evidence) of function are now identified in our annotation table, pointing to the type of evidence used in the confirmation. This information is now available in Supplementary File 5.</p><p>We have additionally added a passage to the discussion directly addressing this topic. Here we explain that function is important for understanding what a mi/milRNA does biologically, but is not necessary for its annotation (Meyers et al., 2008), pointing to the pitfalls/shortcomings of prediction-only approaches. We also highlight what supported top-tier loci do, both in terms of their targets and roles.</p><p>We decided to not perform our own analysis of target prediction for two primary reasons:</p><p>–Our work excludes prediction-only evidence of targeting in our assessment of functional support, requiring stronger validation support. These analyses are fraught with false positives (Pinzón et al., 2017), which is further exacerbated by our lack of knowledge on complementarity requirements in fungi.</p><p>– Many fungi producing top-tier mi/milRNAs have important inter-species relationships (pathogens/parasites/mutualists), sometimes as a generalist (may be compatible with many hosts). Considering trans-species sRNAs, the host transcriptome adds a level of complexity that we believe takes this analysis out of the scope of the study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I have only a few comments, not necessarily ordered by their importance:</p><p>Line 60-62.

Considering that this paper is the only evidence of this phenomenon we are aware of, and that it has been subsequently retracted, we have taken the reviewer’s suggestion and removed the corresponding passage. The text now reads:</p><p>“Long hairpin RNAs have long been a biotechnological tool for induction of RNAi (Fusaro et al., 2006), however, exploration is needed to identify clearly if this occurs in organisms naturally.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 85: the abbreviation milRNA reads to me continuously as a typo. Could you replace it with &quot;miRNA-like&quot;? It is not much longer, and it is clearer what it means. Probably most non-specialized readers will have a similar problem.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the reviewer’s comment, however we have chosen to maintain our naming/abbreviation schema for the work. The abbreviation “milRNA” is commonly used in fungal literature. Additionally, we believe it’s frequent use in this manuscript calls for abbreviation and leads to less confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can you graphically display a flowthrough of the miRNA/milRNA selection criteria?</p></disp-quote><p>We have taken this suggestion to add a flowchart as Figure 1—figure supplement 3, which explains the publication, mi/milRNA, sRNA-sequencing confirmation, and tier selection criteria.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I may be missing something, sorry. In the results from figure 3, you found a considerable amount of miRNA in the coding sequences. How does the inverted repeated (IR) sequence affect the coding region? It is not common to find IR sequences in coding regions.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important question. To answer it, we re-evaluated our classification of genomic intersections to include more specific distinctions in classes (near-TE, TE, near-PCG, PCG-CDS, PCG-UTR, PCG-intron, intergenic). This re-evaluation (shown in modified figure 3) shows that much fewer miRbase annotated miRNAs are coming from coding regions: a more believable control.</p><p>However, this still shows that CDS mi/milRNA annotations are common in fungi. We believe this may be a symptom of incorrect annotations, and fits well with our strategy of using multiple analyses to classify confidence tiers. We have further corrected figure 5 (our tier classifications) to include a distinction between CDS and non-CDS PCG overlaps, where PCG-CDS overlaps are categorized in tier 4.</p><p>We have additionally added this phrase to clarify the result in this section:</p><p>“We found across species that many of the confirmed/no-sequencing-evidence loci arise from coding-regions within PCGs (Figure 3B). This observation is concerning as this is very rarely observed in other organisms (Liu et al., 2018; Olena and Patton, 2010) and is likely a sign of incorrect annotations even in our confirmed groups, as is demonstrated in animal and plant controls (Figure 3B).”</p><p>Furthermore, we added a statement to the discussion to clarify our thoughts on this topic:</p><p>“Many mi/milRNA loci were shown to be derived from coding-sequences of genes. These might warrant further investigation, though should be treated carefully, as inverted repeat structures like those in miRNA precursor stem loops might interfere with mRNA-secondary structure or codons.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I'm curious about figure 5 C. Contrary to your statement, this is not a typical profile for miRNAs (especially in plants). Most miRNAs in plants are 21 nt with a few 20 and 22, but almost no 23-24, which DCL3 produces from TE.

The text and the figure have now been changed to clarify that these are sRNA size ranges in plants/animals, not common miRNA sizes.</p><p>“These top-tier loci tend to fall into similar size ranges as sRNAs found in plants and animals (Figure 5C), though these sizes are usually more concise for miRNAs (20-22 nucleotides).”</p><p>As for the questions in terms of AGO and sRNA size-dependent functionality, little is known in fungi. To address this, we modified our discussion to read:</p><p>“As for the function of fungal sRNAs, there appears to be a higher average count of AGO genes across important clades (Choi et al., 2014), which might point to multiple roles in terms of transcriptional or post-transcriptional gene silencing. However, the details of AGO functions in terms of mi/milRNAs is still unclear and important questions still remain about how these loci may function in relation to sRNA length, their targeting dynamics, and the manner of which given sRNA affects the expression of target genes.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

Tier 1 loci are categorized to pass all criteria: they are confirmed and replicated by sequencing analysis, are derived from intergenic regions, and are conserved in 2 or more genomes. Tier 2 loci meet two out of three of these standards, also allowing genomic intersections with non-CDS-PCG regions (near-PCG, PCG-UTR, and PCG-intron). Tier 3 loci do not meet the higher standards of tiers 1 and 2, but also do not meet any exclusion criteria, defined as: having genomic intersection with a TE or PCG-CDS, having homology to structural RNAs (Rfam), or having failed confirmation based on sRNA-seq re-analysis. Tier 4 loci are those that failed in one or more of these exclusion criteria.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The absence of follow-up experiments somewhat limits the impact of this paper.

We also mention the limitation of distance in our controls.</p><p>“While there is conservation in fungal mi/milRNAs, it does not compare with the magnitude in plants, where miRNA conservation is widespread among our examined species (Figure 4A).

I suggest looking for potential targets for the strong mi/milRNAs candidates detected in your work.</p></disp-quote><p>This paper focuses on mi/milRNAs, which are defined by their biogenesis. While proof of function is not considered a requirement for their annotation (Axtell and Meyers, 2018; Meyers et al., 2008). We agree that assessing targets is highly desirable for identifying the biological role of sRNAs, an interesting topic that however falls beyond the scope of this paper.</p><p>Considering we require high-quality experimental confirmation to consider targeting, we have decided not to explore our own target prediction as a way to address this comment. Prediction suffers from prohibitive false positive rates (Pinzón et al., 2017), which can only be exacerbated by the lack of knowledge we have on miRNA targeting dynamics in fungi.</p><p>Instead, we focused on cited evidence of targeting – in keeping with the re-analysis and curation presented here. To try to answer this suggestion, we have aggregated all of the confirmed targeting interactions, including the manner of evidence for all reported mi/milRNAs (where available). These data are now available in Supplementary File 5 (column “functional_support”). We believe this adds great value to any researcher looking to use our centralized annotations.</p><p>We also addressed this in the text in several ways, including a re-ordering of the final paragraphs.</p><p>1) Discussing our lack of knowledge of targeting dynamics:</p><p>“Proving targeting function in fungi is particularly difficult, as we have yet to develop a detailed view of the targeting dynamics, especially in terms of base-pairing requirements (Broughton et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2014) or distinct mechanisms of different AGOs (Fang and Qi, 2016).”</p><p>2) Discussing top-tier loci that have been confirmed (3), as well as their targets and roles:</p><p>“Few annotations curated by this work have high-quality evidence of targeting (Supplementary File 5), owing to the one-at-a-time nature of many targeting confirmation approaches. Three mi/milRNAs from Tiers 1/2 had strong confirmed targeting (Supplementary File 5). One was shown in Coprinopsis cinerea (cci-milR-24, PID1279) regulating genes involved in developmental transition (Lau et al., 2020). The others were identified in two different strains of Fusarium oxysporum (Fuoxy) which infect tomato (Fol-milR1, PID2279) (Ji et al., 2021) and banana (milR-87, PID2109) (Li et al., 2022), and are likely paralogous loci producing the same MAS. Interestingly, their confirmed targets point to both trans-species and endogenous roles in regulation, targeting a tomato resistance gene (SlyFRG4) and a Fuoxy glycosyl hydrolase (FOIG_15013) linked to pathogenicity, respectively. These show the importance of mi/milRNA in fungi both endogenously and in inter-species relationships.”</p><p>3) Discussing the importance of target confirmation while highlighting it is not essential for annotation:</p><p>“While identifying proof of targeting is not a requirement of mi/milRNA annotation (Meyers et al., 2008), it is an essential facet for determining the biological role of any sRNA. Our analyses did identify numerous mi/milRNAs which are likely biologically relevant (tiers 1 and 2) and are strong candidates for future analyses of expression, biogenesis, and biological function/role. Those which have genomic conservation are particularly interesting, as conserved targeting relationships have been observed in other organisms (Johnson et al., 2019; Xia et al., 2013) and would be further evidence of evolutionarily conserved roles. It is also important to note that validation of sRNA function is not necessarily a sign that it is derived from a mi/milRNA, as there are numerous RDR-derived sRNA classes that can likely function similarly. Lower tier loci with strong targeting evidence (Supplementary File 5), suggesting they are functional sRNAs that are not mi/milRNAs, as has been shown with other important fungal siRNAs (Weiberg et al., 2013).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be nice to discuss the most important rules to predict miRNA targets in fungi. (More similar to plants or animals?)</p></disp-quote><p>We now highlight what is known on this topic with the following statement:</p><p>“Targeting for mi/milRNAs in Necra appears to tolerate some degree of mismatching (Lee et al., 2010), though it is unclear what if any patterning-requirements exist (i.e., seed-pairing).”</p><p>References</p><p>Axtell MJ, Meyers BC. 2018.
