Thus, a mutagenic effect of their repair could constitute a serious genetic burden. We show here that while mismatches introduced into human cells on an SV40-based episome were invariably repaired, this process induced mutations in flanking DNA at a significantly higher rate than no mismatch controls. Most mutations involved the C of TpC, the substrate of some single strand-specific APOBEC cytidine deaminases, similar to the mutations that can typify the ‘mutator phenotype’ of numerous tumors. siRNA knockdowns and chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that TpC preferring APOBECs mediate the mutagenesis, and siRNA knockdowns showed that both the base excision and mismatch repair pathways are involved. That naturally occurring mispairs can be converted to mutators, represents an heretofore unsuspected source of genetic changes that could underlie disease, aging, and evolutionary change.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02001.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02001.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02001.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The inherent chemical instability of the four bases that are found in DNA leads to our genetic material being damaged on a daily basis. The sequence of these bases codes the genetic instructions necessary for all cellular functions, so damaged bases must be efficiently recognized and accurately repaired. The base excision repair pathway carries out these functions.</p><p>However, there are some circumstances in which random changes to the genetic code can be beneficial. In immune cells, for example, these changes enhance the diversity of antibodies generated to fight bacteria and viruses. In immune cells, a second repair pathway—the mismatch repair pathway—hijacks the base excision repair pathway. This gives enzymes belonging to the APOBEC family access to the DNA that is undergoing repair, and these enzymes change cytosine bases to uracil bases. Subsequent processing steps can lead to different bases substituted for the original cytosine. The recent discovery that APOBEC enzymes are abundant in other types of cells raised the possibility that these enzymes could be significant source of mutations in the DNA of cells where such mutations are not welcome.</p><p>To explore this possibility Chen et al. deliberately introduced a number of mutations (that are normally repaired by the base excision repair pathway) into non-immune human cells and observed what happened. The mutations were repaired, but the number of mutations in neighboring bases increased by a statistically significant amount. In particular, most of these mutations involved a cytosine base that was preceded by a thymine base. Chen et al. also showed that both APOBEC and the mismatch repair pathway are involved, as is the case for the mutations caused by APOBEC enzymes in immune cells. Similar APOBEC mutations are known to be involved in cancer.</p><p>The model system developed by Chen et al. not only shows that normally error-free DNA repair can be involved in generating these mutations, but also used to obtain a better understanding of these processes and thereby provide new insights in cancer biology.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02001.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02001.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>DNA repair</kwd><kwd>mutagenesis</kwd><kwd>APOBEC deaminase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Intramural Research Program of the NIH</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Furano</surname><given-names>Anthony V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The repair of spontaneous DNA damage can introduce mutators that lead to further genetic changes, which could underlie evolutionary change, disease and aging.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Species survival depends on the faithful replication of genetic information which is monitored and maintained by a number of complex and interacting DNA repair pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Modrich, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cannavo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cortázar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hsieh and Yamane, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kunz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Robertson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jacobs and Schar, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jiricny, 2013</xref>). Continual DNA repair is required to correct the thousands of genetic lesions that occur daily due to just the inherent chemical lability of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atamna et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barnes and Lindahl, 2004</xref>). For example, the susceptibility of C (and its methylated derivative) to spontaneous hydrolytic deamination daily generates hundreds of U/G and T/G mismatches respectively, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barnes and Lindahl, 2004</xref>) and could explain why C is the most frequent source of single nucleotide substitutions in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hwang and Green, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Error-free base excision repair (BER) can correct the naturally occurring U/G and T/G mismatches (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cortázar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hegde et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Robertson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jacobs and Schar, 2012</xref>). The basic reaction involves removal of the base that is paired with G by anyone of several glycosylases to generate an abasic site that is cleaved on its 5′ side by the APE1 endonuclease. The resulting 3′ end is extended by insertion of dCMP by the high fidelity polymerase β coincident with its hydrolysis of the 5′-phosphodeoxyribose that had been generated by the glycosylase. This step is followed by sealing the resulting single stranded break (SSB) by DNA ligase III with the assistance of the scaffolding protein XRCC1.</p><p>However, in lymphoid (B) cells the U/Gs that are generated by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID, a member of the AID/apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC) family of cytidine deaminases, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Conticello, 2008</xref>) on transient single-stranded DNA regions produced during transcription, are prone to several mutagenic processes that enhance diversification of immunoglobulins (somatic hypermutation, SHM, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martomo and Gearhart, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Teng and Papavasiliou, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Peled et al., 2008</xref>). One of these involves processing U/G mismatches, or BER products thereof, by a non-canonical application of the mismatch repair (MMR) pathway. Normally, MMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Modrich, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hsieh and Yamane, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jiricny, 2013</xref>) is a high fidelity process that operates post-replicatively on the nascent DNA strand to remove mismatches that have escaped the proof-reading activity of high fidelity replicative DNA polymerases. Essential components of this pathway include the heterodimer MutSα (MSH2 and MSH6), which recognizes mismatches, the heterodimer MutLα (MLH1 and PMS2), which accesses the mismatch-containing nascent strand in a reaction mediated by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA, a multipurpose replication clamp, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moldovan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee and Myung, 2008</xref>). PCNA also activates a latent endonuclease in MutLα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kadyrov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pluciennik et al., 2010</xref>), which provides entry points for the EXO1 nuclease that excises the mismatch-containing nascent strand to expose the replication template for re-copying by a high fidelity DNA polymerase, such as polymerase δ.</p><p>In B cells, non-canonical MMR can expose single stranded regions at U/G-containing sites unrelated to DNA replication that can serve as a template for DNA repair. However, the high fidelity DNA polymerase is replaced by the error-prone polymerase η (mediated by mono-ubiquitylated PCNA). Thus, MMR is subverted to an error-prone process that contributes to SHM. Recently, elements of non-canonical MMR have been recapitulated in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schanz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Peña-Diaz et al., 2012</xref>), and the latter study also showed that extracts of non-lymphoid mammalian cells can also process U/G mismatches by a non-canonical MMR process. In addition, these non-lymphoid cells when stressed in vivo by the alkylating agent, N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), generated more mutations in MMR proficient than deficient cells, thereby implicating MMR in the mutagenic process but presumably using an AID-independent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hsieh, 2012</xref>).</p><p>As DNA homeostasis would seem to require a continual state of DNA repair, its involvement in error-prone processes even at a low frequency would have important implications for the mutational mechanisms that could underlie evolution, aging, and disease. Of interest in this regard is the mechanism that produces the enhanced mutation rate that characterizes certain tumors, which has been termed the ‘mutator phenotype’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bielas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Venkatesan et al., 2006</xref>). Recent examples of such a mutator phenotype are the high mutation rates of the C of TpCpN (or its complement, G of NpGpA) that can accompany the progression of some cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nik-Zainal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Roberts et al., 2012</xref>). TpC-preferring members of the AID/APOBEC family of C deaminases, particularly APOBEC3B (A3B), mediate these mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burns et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leonard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roberts et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>), which can occur in strand-coordinated clusters. These deaminases prefer single stranded DNA and an important issue is how the single stranded APOBEC substrate is generated. Experiments using yeast as a model system showed that the transitory single stranded regions that arise at replication forks or during double strand break repair can accumulate such mutations upon chronic alkylation of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Roberts et al., 2012</xref>). These mutations were also observed at experimentally introduced double strand breaks coincident with overexpression of AID/APOBEC deaminases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Here, we determined directly whether repair of the naturally occurring T/G and U/G mismatches would be mutagenic to flanking DNA in mammalian cells that were not stressed by genotoxic agents. We introduced these mismatches (and other mispairs and lesions) into an SV40-episome that can replicate in human cells. Numerous studies have shown that processing lesions harbored by such episomes (as well as those introduced in the SV40 virion) faithfully captured the DNA repair repertoire and mutational environment of its host (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hare and Taylor, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Seidman et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown and Jiricny, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choi and Pfeifer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Terai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pathania et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Qi et al., 2012</xref>). We found that the introduced mispairs were invariably corrected. However, their repair generated mutations in normal flanking DNA at statistically higher rates than the no mismatch control, but only if the episomes were passed through mammalian cells.</p><p>Regardless of the lesion, most of the mutations involved the C of TpCpN, and shared other features of the aforementioned mutations that occur in some cancers. siRNA knockdowns showed that the TpC-preferring deaminases, particularly A3B mediated the mutagenic effect, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) showed that A3B could access the episome in a mismatch dependent way. siRNA knockdowns also showed that components of both the BER and MMR pathways are involved in generating the single-stranded APOBEC substrate and that two factors that have diverse roles in various aspects of DNA metabolism, ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) and PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moldovan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Flynn and Zou, 2011</xref>) modulate the mutagenic effect.</p><p>The APOBEC deaminases are relatively ubiquitous in various tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Refsland et al., 2010</xref>), as is the potential for generating single-stranded templates from BER processed lesions. These would not only include the mispairs generated from C and methyl-C by their spontaneous deamination as we found here, but potentially also those involving other normal metabolites of methyl-C (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wu and Zhang, 2014</xref>) and the thousands of BER substrates that arise daily from other naturally occurring degradative processes that affect DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atamna et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barnes and Lindahl, 2004</xref>).

HmU/G repair induced ∼sevenfold more mutations (0.182%), and U/G or ab/G repair induced ∼30-fold more mutations (0.726% and 0.78% respectively) than the 0 MM control. These differences were statistically significant (legend, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The bottom strand location reduced the mutagenic effect of repairing U/G or ab/G, but not of T/G or hmU/G. Repair of bottom strand T/G was ∼twofold more mutagenic than on the top strand: 0.23% ± 0.013 vs 0.11% ± 0.011 (mean ± standard error, p&lt;10<sup>−7</sup>, Fisher exact test).</p><p>The differences in mutagenesis were not due to differences in repair efficiency. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> shows that, except for T/G, essentially all of the top and bottom strand lesions were restored to C/G. T/G was converted to T/A about 25% of the time. This would result from using the T-containing strand as the repair template (see section, ‘The mutational spectrum, sequence context, and fate of the bases mutated in response to DNA repair are consistent with APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis’). The mutated plasmids represented repair of 426 T/G, 116 hmU/G, 293 U/G and 90 ab/G mismatches (combined top and bottom lesions, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), and the percent restoration to the C/G base pair was: 72.3, 99, 100 and 100 respectively. The values for the restoration of lesions in the non-mutated episomes (isolated from blue colonies), were 75% of 111 T/G, 95.8% of 24 hmU/G, 99% of 105 U/G, and 100% of 7 ab/G mismatches. Thus, the ratio of restoring T/G to C/G or converting it to T/A was independent of repair-induced mutagenesis. Conversion of T/G mismatches to T/A had also been observed with T/G-containing SV40 virion DNA (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hare and Taylor, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown and Jiricny, 1987</xref>). The mutagenic effect was also independent of the G+C content of the mismatch region; 69% G+C for FM1, 39% for FM2, and 53% for FM3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, mutagenesis was not affected by the presumed stability of the MM region helix.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The distance between the lesion and the <italic>cis</italic> 3′ end of the reporter region affects mutagenesis</title><p>The distance between the <italic>cis</italic> 3′ end of the reporter region and the lesion is &lt;50 bp for top-strand, but ∼5 kb for bottom-strand lesions in FM1 (top panel <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This difference accounts for their different mutagenic effects because relocating the MM region upstream of the reporter region (M1F) switches these distances (now &lt;50 bp for bottom—but ∼5 kb for top-strand lesions respectively), and it also switches the extent of their respective mutagenic effects (cf. top and middle panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Reversing the orientation of the entire reporter cassette (the DNA between the EcoRI and NheI sites [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>] to produce FM1_R [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, lower panel]) has the same effect. These results also show that strand-specific mutagenesis is neither due to transcription nor DNA replication effects (i.e., transcribed vs non-transcribed strand, and leading vs lagging strand, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fijalkowska et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hanawalt and Spivak, 2008</xref>) imposed on the reporter region by the episome backbone.</p><p>BER would be recruited to T/G, hmU/G and U/G mismatches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Robertson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jacobs and Schar, 2012</xref>). Removal of the mismatched T, hmU, or U by a glycosylase and cleavage of the DNA 5′ of the ensuing (or introduced) abasic site (ab), and modification of the 3′ ends ultimately generates a single strand break (SSB, arrow immediately 5′of the green triangle <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) that could be extended in the 5′ to 3′ direction by either a single (short patch) or several (long patch) nucleotides. Neither is error prone nor would BER remove the DNA strand on the 5′ side of the lesion (green triangle, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), which would expose its complement as the template for the error-prone process that would generate mutations in the reporter region. However, components of the MMR pathway can hijack U/G-BER intermediates and generate such gapped substrates (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kadyrov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schanz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pluciennik et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Peña-Diaz et al., 2012</xref>) and we show later in the paper that components of both BER and MMR are involved in the mutagenesis.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02001.020</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Mutagenic process and mutational outcome.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Graphical representation showing the expected repair template strands (red) for the mutagenic repair of top strand (left panel) or bottom strand (right panel) lesions that were restored to C/G.

Here, we replaced respectively the top or bottom strands of FM1, and bottom or top strands of M1F with non-5′ phosphorylated versions of the 0 MM control oligonucleotide. The preformed SSB &lt;50 bp from the <italic>cis</italic> 3′ end of the reporter region in the top strand of FM1 or bottom strand of M1F generates the same mutagenic effect as U/G-ab/G at these positions. We also obtained this result when using non-5′ phosphorylated versions of T/G-mismatch producing oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Therefore, processing this nick bypasses T/G repair, and generates a substrate that is susceptible to mutagenesis. However, unlike the other lesions, a preformed SSB at ∼5 kb from the <italic>cis</italic> 3′ end of the reporter region (bottom and top strand respectively for FM1 and M1F) has little if any mutagenic effect. This difference could reflect the fact that these SSBs would be substrates for a SSB repair (SSBR) pathway that would recruit proteins different from those at the SSB generated during BER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caldecott, 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The mutational spectrum, sequence context, and fate of the bases mutated in response to DNA repair are consistent with APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis</title><p>We determined the fraction of total mutations contributed by each base of the reporter and mismatch regions, and the identity of the base to which it was mutated (i.e., its mutational fate), and report these results in terms of the top strand sequence.

The pooled data for top strand T/G or U/G that were restored to C/G are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref> respectively. The mutations are distributed throughout the cassette, mostly on G, irrespective of the type of lesion (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Mutations of either G or C would equally affect the integrity of the <italic>supF</italic> tRNA stems and potentially produce a non-functional tRNA. Thus, the skewed mutational pattern toward G does not likely reflect an ascertainment bias. In addition, the sequence context of ∼80% of the G mutations is GpA, but with less specificity for the 5′ base (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> shows that essentially the same mutational spectrum was induced by restoring each type of top strand lesion—that is, T/G, hmU/G, U/G or ab/G to C/G. Thus a similar mutagenic process is recruited during repair of any of these lesions.</p><p>The restoration of top strand lesions to C/G would employ the bottom strand as the repair template. Thus, the preponderance of mutations on the G of GpA indicates that its complement on the repair template, the C of TpC, is targeted by the mutagenic process that is recruited during repair. This preference implicates the TpC-preferring APOBEC family members of single strand-specific cytidine deaminases. The left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> outlines how this could occur during the restoration of top strand lesions to C/G after the repair process was initiated by BER at the lesion (green triangle), and subsequent resection of the lesion-containing strand by MMR as described in the previous section. Deamination of the C of TpC would generate TpU, and as discussed by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lange et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nik-Zainal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Peña-Diaz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Roberts et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burns et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leonard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roberts et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>) further processing of the U could generate a number mutational outcomes of the original C (and its complement G). Faithful copying of the U in the repair template would produce an A/U pair. Subsequent replication would result in a G to A transition (complementary C to T transition). On the other hand, the A/U base pair could also be a substrate for a U glycosylase, which would remove the U and generate an abasic site. Subsequent replication of this strand by a high fidelity DNA polymerase would generally insert an A opposite the abasic site–that is, the ‘A rule’, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Strauss, 2002</xref>). The fact that the most frequent mutational outcome at GpA was a G to A transition is consistent with the above two mechanism of generating an A opposite the original C of TpC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, upper left quadrant). On the other hand, replication across the abasic site by various other DNA polymerases could insert a T or C opposite the abasic site and generate G to T or C transversions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lange et al., 2011</xref>), which we also found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, upper left quadrant). As a consequence approximately equal amounts of transitions and transversions result from repair-induced mutagenesis, an outcome that was also observed for APOBEC-mediated mutations in some tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burns et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leonard et al., 2013</xref>).

In this case, the top strand serves as the repair template, but because we show all the mutations in terms of the top strand sequence the final mutational outcome is basically the complement of the results generated from the repair of top strand lesions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> shows the fate and mutational spectra (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>) induced by repair of bottom strand lesions. Now, most of the mutations are on C of TpC when the lesions are restored to C/G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>), and, as the lower left quadrant of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> shows, the most common mutational outcome involves C to T transitions and with about an equal amount of transversions, to A and G.</p><p>The right side of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> (gray box) shows the mutational outcome of converting top or bottom strand T/Gs to T/As. In these cases, the top or bottom strand respectively serves as the repair templates (indicated in red font, right side <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), and the mutational outcomes parallel those that found for the restoration of bottom or top strand lesions to C/G wherein the top or bottom strands respectively were used as the repair template. Thus, when a top strand T paired with a bottom strand G is converted to T/A, most of the mutations are on C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, T/G_con), ∼80% of which involve the C of TpC with almost no specificity for the 3′ base (top panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). However, when a bottom strand T/G is converted to T/A, most mutations are on the G of GpA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>–T/G_con, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>, bottom panel).</p><p>Approximately, equal amounts of G and C mutations are generated from the 0 MM controls (most left hand bar graphs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). These mutational spectra and their dinucleotide sequence contexts resemble what would result from repair of a mixture of top and bottom SSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7</xref>), and are thus consistent with that expected from repairing trace amount of random nicks on both strands.</p><p>APOBEC-mediated mutations in some cancer cells showed a strong preference for the C of TpCpW (W is T or A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roberts et al., 2013</xref>).

Although the trinucleotide context of about half of our G mutations was ApGpA, the others were mostly CpGpA and not TpGpA, which not surprising as the latter trinucleotide is represented only once in the reporter region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s8">Figure 3—figure supplement 8</xref>). These results indicate that the APOBECs do not strongly discriminate between the nucleotides that are 3′ to TpC (readily apparent in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>).

This figure also shows that the mutational spectra and the dinucleotide contexts of the clustered and unclustered mutations induced by repair of top strand lesions did not differ, and all exhibited the mutational preference for the complement of the C of TpC, that is, the G of GpA. However, the spectra and dinucleotide context of clustered and unclustered mutations induced by repair of bottom strand lesions differed. In contrast to the clustered mutations, which had the same mutational APOBEC signature as the top strand lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), the unclustered mutations show less of a preference towards mutating the C of TpC, most evident for those induced by restoration of T/G to C/G (cf. lower 2 panels, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and the lower panels labeled unclustered, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

While knockdown of any one of them marginally affected the mutational frequency, knockdown of two (A3B and A3F) inhibited mutagenesis associated with T/G and U/G repair (middle panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Although knocking down all three did not further reduce the mutagenic effect, the lower part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> shows that only knocking down all three deaminases (siA3(B,F,C)) eliminates the mutational signature associated with deamination of the C of TpC. However, even though the single knockdowns did not substantially inhibit the mutational frequency, they do change the mutational signature with respect of the dinucleotide context (hereafter referred to as the dinucleotide signature) consistent with the extent of their preferences for TpC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bishop et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Langlois et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, knocking down A3C (46% preference for TpC) hardly alters the dinucleotide signature, whereas knocking down A3B (91% preference) had a more profound effect, and the knockdown of A3F (intermediate at 77%) produced an intermediate effect on this signature. Although the numbers of mutations analyzed are relatively low, these data suggest that while the three deaminases compete for substrates generated during repair, A3B is the most important contributor to repair-induced mutagenesis.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02001.022</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>APOBEC deaminases mediate repair-induced mutagenesis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Effect of APOBEC knockdowns.

Thus, more deaminase is bound to the <italic>supF</italic> reporter of top strand U/G- than bottom strand U/G-containing episomes (cf. mutational frequencies in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, panel C). Also, as predicted from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, the extent of deaminase binding to the <italic>supF</italic> reporter of T/G-containing episomes is indifferent to the top or bottom strand location of the mismatch. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> also shows that the deaminase binds to other episomal regions, for example, the T antigen-containing region for both mismatches. This would be expected as the mutagenic effect can extend over 5 kb for both lesions, which is undiminished for T/G but not for U/G. Consistent with this difference, the deaminase binds both <italic>supF</italic>- and T antigen-containing regions to about the same extent for either the top or bottom strand location of T/G. However, considerably more deaminase binds to the <italic>supF</italic> reporter gene than T antigen gene for top strand U/G wherein the U is closer to the <italic>cis</italic> 3′ end of the <italic>supF</italic> reporter gene than to the T antigen gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, top panel).

Two of the cell lines (HeLa_KU and 2102ep) exhibited distinct dinucleotide mutational signatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Also the repertoire of APOBEC enzymes in these cell lines differed, even quite dramatically between HeLa_JM and HeLa_KU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

In contrast, differences between the extent of U/G repair-associated mutagenesis were more marked. Thus, U/G repair was about fivefold more mutagenic in HeLa_JM than in HEK293 although their APOBEC repertoires were comparable.

The blue box encloses components of the MMR pathway. In non-canonical MMR (MutSα and MutLα/PCNA) can hijack U/G-BER intermediates and recruit EXO1 that could generate a gapped DNA 5′ of the lesion (see text).

Therefore, we depict the T/G repair intermediate as a migrating D-loop.

However, U/G is a substrate for four glycosylases (UNG, SMUG, TDG, MBD4), and T/G for two (TDG, MBD4) (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cortázar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Robertson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jacobs and Schar, 2012</xref>). Therefore, we knocked down two BER proteins (APE1 and XRRC1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) that act downstream of the glycosylases. We also knocked down a component of the heterodimers (MutSα, MutLα) that initiate MMR (MSH2 and MLH1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> shows that the knockdown of any one of the above proteins was sufficient to reduce mutagenesis induced by repair of T/G or U/G. While the maximal effect of the knockdowns of U/G-induced mutagenesis was about the same for the BER or MMR, the maximal inhibition of T/G-induced mutation by MMR knockdown was greater than that attained by the BER knockdown. This result is consistent with a model whereby MMR can not only highjack BER intermediates generated from a T/G mismatch but also directly access the mismatch, that is, independently of BER. Direct access of T/G by MMR has been demonstrated in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pluciennik et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Peña-Diaz et al., 2012</xref>).

PCNA acts as a DNA replication clamp that is involved in numerous aspects of DNA replication and can also be involved in both generating gapped substrates and assembling DNA replication complexes on them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caldecott, 2008</xref>).

Inhibiting PCNA synthesis somewhat reduced T/G-induced mutagenesis, but ATR knockdown had no effect. In contrast, PCNA knockdown stimulated the mutagenic effect of U/G repair, but ATR knockdown inhibited its effect. Simultaneous knockdown of both proteins returns the mutagenic effect of U/G repair to control levels, a result that suggests the effects of both proteins converge on a common pathway. However, the double knockdowns did not alter the inhibition of T/G-induced mutagenesis by PCNA knockdown, not unexpected as T/G repair-induced mutagenesis is indifferent to ATR.

Neither PCNA nor ATR knockdown altered the mutational signature of repair-induced mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, similar to the BER and MMR proteins, PCNA and ATR act upstream of the APOBEC deaminases. Although our results do not provide any mechanistic insights on the roles of PCNA and ATR on APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis, they do indicate the levels of, or access to, APOBEC substrates are sensitive to the activities of these proteins.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we showed that repair of normally occurring mismatches (i.e., those that arise from the inherent chemical instability of DNA) can be mutagenic to flanking DNA. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> summarizes our results, which suggest that APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis induced by DNA repair acts downstream of the DNA repair pathways that generate the obligatory single-stranded substrates for TpC preferring APOBEC deaminases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Conticello et al., 2007</xref>). siRNA knockdowns (bold font depicts the factors that we tested) indicate that components of both BER and MMR are required to generate the deaminase substrates from both T/G and U/G, and that PCNA and ATR could modulate the availability of these substrates to the deaminases. With respect to U/G and T/G, we depict the interaction of the BER and MMR pathways in the framework of that proposed from elegant biochemical studies that showed that MMR can hijack the 3′ end of the nick that would result from a U/G-BER intermediate and generate a single stranded region 5′ of the lesion that could serve as an APOBEC substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kadyrov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schanz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pluciennik et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Peña-Diaz et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The cited in vitro studies from the Modrich group also showed that MMR could directly access T/G mismatches in a PCNA-dependent reaction, which we illustrate on the right hand side of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>. In such cases, MMR could load on either strand of the T/G containing episome and lead to resection of either the bottom or top strand of the duplex. However, we can only currently score mutagenic events that occur on the 5′ side of the T/G wherein resection of the top strand would expose the <italic>supF</italic> reporter region. Thus, our results suggest an apparent 3′ bias for the MMR-mediated resection. We are now implementing experiments to examine the induction of mutations 3′ of the T/G.</p><p>Although the sensitivity of U/G-induced mutagenesis to the proximity of this lesion to the <italic>cis</italic> 3′ end of the reporter region is consistent with the foregoing biochemical results, some of our findings are at odds with the biochemical model—for example, the apparent inhibitory effect of PCNA on U/G-repair induced mutagenesis (knockdown increases its mutagenic effect, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) vs the requirement for PCNA in the MMR hijacking of BER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kadyrov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pluciennik et al., 2010</xref>). While these paradoxical results could be reconciled by considering differences between threshold concentrations of PCNA required for its various functions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pluciennik et al., 2010</xref>), our results do not directly address the mechanistic details of the interaction of PCNA and the U/G-repair generated APOBEC substrate. Furthermore, while we depict PCNA and ATR converging on a common pathway downstream of the hijacked BER intermediate, our only rationale for doing so are the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, which show that their simultaneous knockdown cancels the effects of their separate knockdowns.</p><p>Likewise, while the effects of knocking down various BER and MMR components, as well as the ATR and PCNA knockdowns distinguish the T/G- and U/G-repair intermediates, the mechanistic relationships between these pathways or factors, and the properties of the T/G repair intermediate that distinguish it from the U/G intermediate are not clear. The fact that the extent of T/G-induced mutagenesis is more sensitive to the knockdown of MMR than BER suggests that MMR can generate an APOBEC-sensitive substrate independent of (i.e., in addition to) that mediated by BER (right hand side of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Also, that an APOBEC-vulnerable substrate can be generated from either strand of a T/G mismatch—either restoration of T/G to C/G or conversion to T/A can induce mutagenesis—and that it is sensitive to PCNA knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) are consistent with studies in vitro that showed that MMR components can access either strand of T/G containing DNA in a PCNA-dependent reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pluciennik et al., 2010</xref>). Given the relative insensitivity of the mutagenic effect of T/G to its distance from a <italic>cis</italic> 3′ end of reporter region, we tentatively propose that a migrating D-loop can be mounted on either strand of the episome to provide a top or bottom strand deaminase substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>).</p><p>Numerous recent studies support a role for the TpC preferring APOBEC C deaminases, especially APOBEC3B, in generating large numbers of mutations (i.e., the ‘mutator phenotype’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bielas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Venkatesan et al., 2006</xref>]) that characterize the progression, and perhaps initiation, of cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nik-Zainal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Roberts et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stephens et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burns et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leonard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roberts et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>). Less certain is the source of the single-stranded DNAs that are the preferred substrates for the APOBEC deaminases. Here, we directly showed that A3B can access the T/G and U/G repair intermediates generated in our mammalian model system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) and generate the mutational signatures induced in some cancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The hundreds of T/Gs and U/Gs that are generated daily by spontaneous hydrolytic deamination respectively of methyl-C and C would provide a continual source of potential APOBEC substrates. This source could also be potentially augmented by the thousands of other BER-processed lesions that arise daily due to additional spontaneous degradative processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atamna et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barnes and Lindahl, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Although our findings showed that DNA repair of T/G, U/G, and other lesions can generate APOBEC deaminase substrates, the composition of the repair intermediates that both renders them susceptible to APOBEC-mediated deamination and accounts for their distinct mutagenic properties are unknown. Components of both the BER and MMR pathways that are normally recruited to these lesions can also engage in complex interactions with factors involved in both DNA metabolism and other cellular functions (e.g.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cortázar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kovtun and McMurray, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jacobs and Schar, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Peña-Diaz and Jiricny, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Peña-Diaz et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, the availability of APOBEC deaminases per se may not be sufficient to support repair-induced mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, also observed in certain cancers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roberts et al., 2013</xref>). Thus some of the factors required to either generate APOBEC substrates from repair-intermediates, or recruit the deaminases to them, might not be present in all cells.</p><p>Given the fairly ubiquitous distribution of ABOPBEC deaminases in various cell types and tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Refsland et al., 2010</xref>), determining such factors will be important for evaluating the extent to which DNA repair intermediates can be accessed by APOBEC-mediated mutators, and whether DNA repair could be vulnerable to other error-prone processes as well. Such alternate processes might contribute to the distinctive mutational signatures of the unclustered mutations induced by repair of bottom strand lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). Therefore, an important next step is to characterize the composition of the mutagenic and non-mutagenic repair intermediates that assemble on the various mismatches. An advantage of generating these repair intermediates using preformed mispairs on a defined DNA as done here, is that they could be isolated from cells by selection for either the nucleic acid or a presumed protein component (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dèjardin and Kingston, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wu et al., 2011</xref>), or by the sequential application of each. The latter approach should enhance the chances of isolating genuine mutagenic intermediates, a prerequisite for more definitive analysis of their functional and biochemical properties.</p><p>Repair-associated mutagenesis might not only contribute to the genetic changes that underlie various disease states (e.g., cancer, as discussed above) but also aging and evolutionary change (as has been earlier suggested, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huttley et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Walser and Furano, 2010</xref>), which in some instances might result from normal physiological processes.

In our initial experiments some episomal plasmids suffered large deletions that included all or part of the reporter cassette, which we found was due to over zealous attempts to remove episomes that lack the bar code by digestion with BstZ17I, which is unique to this region. However, we found that this step was not necessary and eliminating it largely eliminated the deletions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Most of these knockdowns increased the mutagenic effect of the 0 MM control (and presumably also that of the lesion-containing plasmids, results not shown). We reasoned that perhaps the trace amounts of gapped episomes are not readily repaired when various repair enzymes are depleted and thereby provide ready-made substrates for the APOBEC deaminases. This idea was supported by our finding that knockdowns of any of the tested repair proteins increased the mutagenesis induced by non-reconstituted gapped plasmids (results not shown). A brief treatment of the reconstituted vectors in the ligation reaction with the 5′–3′ exo<sup>−</sup> Klenow nuclease just prior to their transfection into mammalian cells reduced the amount of gapped plasmids to undetectable amounts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>), eliminated the increase of the mutagenic effect of the 0 MM control during siRNA knockdowns of repair proteins, but did not materially affect the extent of the mutagenesis induced by the 0 MM control or the lesion-containing episomes in experiments with the siRNA controls—cf. the siCtrl for 0 MM, T/G or U/G in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8 fig9">Figures 8 and 9</xref> with those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig6 fig7">Figures 2, 6 and 7</xref> (for HeLa_JM).

The replicated plasmids isolated from each transfection were subject to one or more independent trials of blue/white screening. The plasmids from all the white clones were screened for deletions by PCR and all those with undeleted plasmids from a given transfection were sequenced. More than 99% of the undeleted plasmids contained at least one mutation in the reporter region (data not shown).

Overall, we determined the DNA sequences of ∼2600 undeleted plasmids, about 5% of which contained small indels in the reporter region that could not be detected by PCR screening. We excluded these sequences from further analysis because their frequency was not correlated with either the type of introduced lesion or even the presence of one. We grouped the rest (∼2500) into 155 distinct alignments. We also determined the DNA sequences of ∼250 blue clones, grouped into 38 alignments. We parsed these alignments and computed mutational data using custom Unix, Perl, and R scripts (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.R-project.org/">http://www.R-project.org</ext-link>). We also used R for statistical analysis as indicated in the legends to the Figures or text. We determined the fate of the introduced DNA lesions, and the frequency with which each base of the reporter and mismatch regions was mutated, and to which base it was mutated (i.e., its mutational fate). We determined the mutagenic effect caused by the repair of each type of lesion (T/G, hmU/G, U/G, ab/G) located on the top or bottom strand from the pooled results of each lesion class irrespective of their location, number, or context within the mismatch region of a given vector as these variables did not materially affect the mutagenic effect of their repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Ms Pritha Bhattacharyya for participating in some of the experiments, Dr Stephen J Elledge for providing the ATR-expressing plasmid, and Drs Jean-Claude Walser and Angelique Aschrafi for their participation in the preliminary implementation of the shuttle vector assay.

Your article has been evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before reaching this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Chen et al. constructed an episome containing SV40 and pBR origins of replication and a 51 bp sequence bearing a mismatch or DNA lesions (T/G, U/G, hmU/G, abasic). Previous work showed that these lesions can form as the result of deamination, demethylation or glycosylase removal of cytosine residues. The vector also contains the <italic>supF</italic> gene adjacent to the 51 bp sequence. This gene serves as a reporter for mutagenesis in <italic>E. coli</italic> because it can suppress an amber mutation present in a lacZ variant.</p><p>Different versions of the episome were created in which a DNA lesion(s) was placed in different sequence contexts on the “top” or “bottom” strand of the 51 bp sequence. The resulting vectors were transfected into HeLa cells that were then incubated for 48 hrs, after which the plasmids were extracted, digested with DpnI, and electroporated into <italic>E. coli</italic>. Bacterial transformants were then assessed for blue (functional supF) and white (supF loss of function) phenotypes. In some cases experiments involving the same lesion but present in different contexts/quantities were pooled. Also, vectors recovered from <italic>E. coli</italic> that contained large deletions in the <italic>supF</italic> gene were not analyzed.</p><p>The major results were:</p><p>1) Vectors containing no mismatches, the lesions described above, or a single strand break (SSB, present at sites where lesions/mismatches were introduced) were examined for mutations in <italic>supF</italic>. The major finding was that both lesions and an SSB induced mutagenesis that appeared directional (for most substrates) with respect to the location of the lesion. Based on these observation the authors propose that lesions induce a 3'–5' directed excision mechanism, followed by APOBEC-mediated deamination of the ssDNA and subsequent repair synthesis. Curiously the SSB caused the highest level of mutagenesis. Most lesion repair resulted in restoration to a C/G sequence, consistent with a BER-type mechanism.</p><p>2) DNA sequencing analysis of <italic>supF</italic> mutations was performed, with the mutation spectra showing a signature consistent with APOBEC mutagenesis. In support of this idea, about 30 % of the episomes displayed “mutational showers,” and siRNA treatment of HeLa cells indicated that a triple knockdown of APOBEC A3B, A3F, and A3C (restored by reintroducing A3B) eliminated the APOBEC mutational signature.</p><p>3) siRNA knockdowns of BER, MMR and DNA damage response proteins altered the mutagenesis the frequency, but in general not the mutational spectra.</p><p>This work involved the development of clever methods to create plasmids with specific DNA lesions and a significant amount of cell manipulations (different cell lines, siRNA knockdowns, ChIP) and molecular analyses.</p><p>1) One major concern is that vectors containing an SSB displayed the highest frequency of mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). However, knockdowns of BER components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) showed that single knockouts provided minor, if any, effect on the mutagenesis frequency. Double knockouts of the BER components APE1 and XRCC1 yielded results that were difficult to interpret because the mutagenesis frequency seen in the 0-mismatch control was elevated to fairly high levels. Together these observations call into question the main conclusion that “naturally occurring mismatches can induce mutations in flanking DNA” and that an SSB is an intermediate in a BER-type pathway that is initiating the mutagenic event. I'm convinced that some type of 3’–5' single-stranded excision mechanism initiated at an SSB is occurring that leads to APOBEC deamination of the ssDNA template, followed by resynthesis. However, it is unclear if this is an artifact of the plasmid system or represents a novel in vivo mechanism.</p><p>2) We worry about pooling data from a variety of mismatch/lesion substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). It appears that datasets for individual substrates were too small to analyze statistically and so combining data could skew the analysis. Also, it is not clear to me whether data pooling was performed for work shown in the other figures. This should be made clear. At the very least a single set of vectors should be directly compared in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> in a large data set.</p><p>3) We find it curious that repair in this system appears to be primarily 3' directed whereas repair of G/T mismatches in vitro DNA mismatch repair reactions (Paul Modrich type studies) appears to be bi-directional (nicks are placed 3' or 5' to the mismatch). Can the authors speculate as to the source of the bias?</p><p>4) The data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8 fig9">Figures 8 and 9</xref> are challenging because in the case of MMR and BER, double knockdowns are required to observe subtle changes in mutation frequency without a change in mutation spectra. Why is it necessary to knockdown two members of the same pathway (i.e., Ape1 and XRCC1)? Similarly, if BER and NER function in the same mutagenesis pathway proposed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, why do both need to be knocked down to see an effect? Also, the 0-mismatch substrate shows unusual fluctuations in mutation frequency. For example, there is an unusual mutagenesis pattern in the OMM substrate for the single MLH1 and MSH2 knockdowns compared to the double knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>) that makes me concerned based on the high mutation rate expected for single knockouts of these critical MMR genes. Unusual patterns are also seen when comparing the single and double BER knockdowns, and the patterns seen for PCNA and ATR are hard to interpret, again because of the fluctuation in the 0-mismatch substrate.</p><p>Although there was some disagreement among the reviewers on this issue, it was felt by some that it might be better to remove <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8 fig9">Figures 8 and 9</xref> from the paper, and publish these results at a later time when the data are more clear or better rationalized.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02001.034</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>We enumerate below our response to each point but start with those raised in points 1 &amp; 4 as we were particularly attentive to the concerns about the interpretation of the results on the effects of inhibiting DNA repair pathways shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8 fig9">Figures 8 &amp; 9</xref>, and that some of these data defied a straightforward interpretation. We also were mindful of these issues; e.g., in the Results section in reference to the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> we had written:</p><p>“Somewhat paradoxically, some of the single and double knockdowns increased the mutagenesis associated with the 0 MM top strand control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8A and 8B</xref>). The dinucleotide signature of these mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8–figure supplement 1</xref>) resembled that induced by repair of a top stand lesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). As reconstituted vectors retain traces of gapped episomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), perhaps these gapped molecules are not so readily repaired when various repair enzymes are depleted thereby providing ready made substrates for the APOBEC deaminases.”</p><p>And in light of the following comment – “Although there was some disagreement among the reviewers on this issue, it was felt by some that it might be better to remove <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8 fig9">Figures 8 and 9</xref> from the paper, and publish these results at a later time when the data are more clear or better rationalized” – we felt that we should attempt to clarify the repair knockdown data by directly addressing the issue of whether the traces of gapped molecules in our reconstituted plasmids were skewing our results in these experiments as we had suggested above.</p><p>Therefore, we first examined the effect of all the repair knockdowns reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8 fig9">Figures 8 &amp; 9</xref> on the mutagenic effect induced by a non-reconstituted gapped version of the pFM1 episome. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 1</xref> shows, all the knockdowns increased the mutagenic effect of the gapped plasmid, generally by two-fold or more, which would certainly confound the effect of the knockdowns on the reconstituted vectors, all of which could be contaminated by varying amounts of gapped episomes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref> of our original &amp; current submission). We could reduce the content of gapped contaminants to undetectable levels by briefly treating the reconstituted episomes with the 3’-5’ exo-Klenow polymerase (described in the Materials and Methods of our revised paper), as is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>. We then proceeded to examine the effects of BER, MMR, PCNA and ATR knockdowns with reconstituted episomes that were treated with the Klenow polymerase as described in the Material and Methods (last paragraph of Vector preparation) of our revised paper.<fig id="fig11" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic xlink:href="elife-02001-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>As the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> of our revised paper shows, the effects of the knockdowns on the repair pathways are now quite straightforward, and also more informative:</p><p>First, the mutagenic effects of the 0MM, T/G and U/G lesions in the absence of repair pathway knockdowns (i.e., the siCtrl values) were not materially affected by Klenow treatment as they are consistent with those observed for the non-Klenow treated versions of these episomes - cf. the siCtrl for 0 MM, T/G or U/G in our new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8 fig9">Figures 8 and 9</xref> with those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig6 fig7">Figures 2, 6, and 7</xref> (for HeLa_JM).</p><p>Second, the knockdowns of any one of the tested members of either the BER or MMR pathways was sufficient to reduce mutagenesis induced by any of the lesions.</p><p>Third, while the maximal effect of the knockdowns on U/G induced mutagenesis was about the same for the BER or MMR knockdowns, the maximal inhibition of T/G-induced mutation by MMR knockdown was greater than that attained by the BER knockdown. This result is consistent with a model whereby MMR can both highjack BER intermediates generated from a T/G mismatch but also access a T/G mismatch directly, i.e., independently of BER. We had suggested the direct access of T/G by MMR in our original paper, referencing the work from the Modrich and Jiricny groups in the third paragraph of the Discussion:</p><p>“That either the restoration of T/G to C/G or its conversion to T/A can induce mutagenesis, indicates that either strand of a T/G mispair can be accessed by APOBEC. These results are consistent with the in vitro studies, which showed that purified MMR proteins can access either strand of T/G-containing closed circular molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kadyrov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schanz et al., 2009</xref>).”</p><p>We now explicitly illustrate this possibility in a modified <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> of our revised paper and this issue also speaks to point 3 wherein the reviewers ask “Can the authors speculate as to the source of the bias?”, which we address in more detail below.</p><p>The new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> of our revised paper shows that the ATR and PCNA knockdowns have distinct effects on T/G repair- and U/G repair-induced mutagenesis. The new results also reveal a partial dependence of T/G-induced mutations on PCNA – i.e<italic>.</italic>, PCNA knockdown decreases the mutagenic of T/G, a result which was obscured in our original submission. This finding is consistent with in vitro results from the Modrich group that showed that direct access of MMR for T/G required PCNA.</p><p>The new results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8 fig9">Figures 8 and 9</xref> greatly simplified our discussion of the roles of BER and MMR in repair induced mutagenesis and we have modified both the Results and Discussion sections accordingly.</p><p>We now address the remaining points not covered by the above:</p><p><italic>1) One major concern is that vectors containing an SSB displayed the highest frequency of mutagenesis (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2C</italic></xref><italic>). However, knockdowns of BER components (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9"><italic>Figure 9</italic></xref><italic>) showed that single knockouts provided minor, if any, effect on the mutagenesis frequency. Double knockouts of the BER components APE1 and XRCC1 yielded results that were difficult to interpret because the mutagenesis frequency seen in the 0-mismatch control was elevated to fairly high levels. Together these observations call into question the main conclusion that “naturally occurring mismatches can induce mutations in flanking DNA” and that an SSB is an intermediate in a BER-type pathway that is initiating the mutagenic event.

However, it is unclear if this is an artifact of the plasmid system or represents a novel</italic> in vivo <italic>mechanism</italic>.</p><p>It was stated here that “One major concern is that vectors containing an SSB displayed the highest frequency of mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>).” But this result was only found in one case, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> bottom strand, wherein the mutagenic effect of SSB was marginally higher than ab/G, whereas for the top strand, the SSB effect was marginally lower than ab/G. In these experiments and others not reported, the mutagenic effect of U/G, ab/G and SSB were generally the same, except, as noted on lines:</p><p>“However, unlike the other lesions, a preformed SSB at ∼5 kb from the cis 3’ end of the reporter region (bottom and top strand respectively for FM1 and M1F) has little if any mutagenic effect. This difference could reflect the fact that these SSBs would be substrates for a SSB repair (SSBR) pathway that would recruit proteins different from those at the SSB generated during BER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hanawalt and Spivak, 2008</xref>).”</p><p>(The rest of the issues raised in this point are similar to those raised in point 4, which we addressed above.)</p><p><italic>2) We worry about pooling data from a variety of mismatch/lesion substrates (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref><italic>). It appears that datasets for individual substrates were too small to analyze statistically and so combining data could skew the analysis. Also, it is not clear to me whether data pooling was performed for work shown in the other figures. This should be made clear. At the very least a single set of vectors should be directly compared in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>in a large data set</italic>.</p><p>We feel that some of this worry could have stemmed from our not being precise about what we meant about “pooling” data, and by using this term for two different purposes we elided the distinction between what we did.</p><p>(A) We stated that we pooled the mutational effects of repairing each type of lesion. However, our original (and present) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> does not show pooled data but a dot plot of the % mutational frequency of every trial of repairing each type of lesion. By calculating a mean from each type of lesion regardless of their number or position or context within the mismatch region, we treat each lesion type (i.e<italic>.</italic>, T/G, U/G) as a distinct class despite the inevitable overlap in some of the values for % mutational frequency induced by their repair. This assumption was borne out by the distinctive mutagenic effect and properties that the repair of these lesions exhibited. We have modified our paper to make these distinctions.</p><p>(B) We pooled the mutational spectra – i.e., which bases were mutated and their dinucleotide (and trinucleotide) sequence contexts – that were generated in response to the repair of different lesions. We felt that this was warranted because we recovered the same mutational signature regardless of which type of lesion (i.e<italic>.</italic>, T/G, U/G, etc.) was restored to C/G. For example, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> wherein the spectra of mutations induced by the repair of T/G and U/G are shown separately. In fact, even in the one case (unclustered bottom strand mutations, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) where we detected mutational spectra in addition to that generated by the TpC-specific deaminases, the spectra induced by T/G and U/G repair were very similar.</p><p>Nonetheless, we think that the reviewers’ suggestion to show the results for a single set of vectors is a good idea and so we modified <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref> to include a separate statistical analysis comparing the mutagenic effects 2 T/G, 2 hmU/G, and 2 U/G. The oligonucleotides for reconstituting these lesion-containing episomes are “isogenic” in that the lesions are in the same position (and thus context) of the MM region. We also included an additional supplemental figure, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, which shows that there is no difference between the dinucleotide context of the mutations induced by repair of these lesions as well as by the repair of ab/G. In our revised paper we explicitly point out these results and also indicate which results were derived from what kind of pooled data in the figure legends.</p><p><italic>3) We find it curious that repair in this system appears to be primarily 3' directed whereas repair of G/T mismatches</italic> in vitro <italic>DNA mismatch repair reactions (Paul Modrich type studies) appears to be bi-directional (nicks are placed 3' or 5' to the mismatch). Can the authors speculate as to the source of the bias</italic>?</p><p>This bias would reflect the choice of which strand of the T/G mismatch that is selected as the repair template (the right hand part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). In our case, and in the pioneering experiments from the Jiricny and Taylor laboratories on the fate of T/G lesions introduced into an SV40 virion (Hare and Taylor 1985, Brown and Jiricny 1987), the G-containing strand was chosen ≥ 75% of the time. This bias towards the G-strand is in part due to the T-specific glycosylases (to our knowledge there are none that are specific for the G of a T/G mismatch). But this mechanism probably does not account for all of the G-strand bias, for in other experiments not reported here we found that the sequence context of the mismatch, including the presence of C-methylation can strongly affect the choice of strand selection as repair template. In some cases, the T-strand is used as the repair template more than 50 % of the time and this can occur whether or not repair is mutagenic. These instances quite likely involve direct access of the MMR pathway to the T/G mismatch. Whatever the extent that MMR can compete with BER to directly access a T/G mismatch, a built in bias of MMR towards accessing the T-containing strand would minimize C to T transitions at CpG sites. Even so, transitions at CpG sites represent the most frequent class of SNPs and, with time, CpGs not under selection are converted to TpGs (CpAs). We have modified our paper to more explicitly address this issue and modified <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> to show that the conversion of T/G to T/A results from the mounting of MMR components on the G-containing strand.</p></body></sub-article></article>
