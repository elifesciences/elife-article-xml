Despite years of research, the role of this signaling in integrin activation and focal adhesion assembly is unclear. We provide evidence that the Src-family kinase (SFK) substrate Cas (Crk-associated substrate, p130Cas, BCAR1) is phosphorylated and associated with its Crk/CrkL effectors in clusters that are precursors of focal adhesions. The initial phospho-Cas clusters contain integrin β1 in its inactive, bent closed, conformation. Later, phospho-Cas and total Cas levels decrease as integrin β1 is activated and core focal adhesion proteins including vinculin, talin, kindlin, and paxillin are recruited. Cas is required for cell spreading and focal adhesion assembly in epithelial and fibroblast cells on collagen and fibronectin. Cas cluster formation requires Cas, Crk/CrkL, SFKs, and Rac1 but not vinculin. Rac1 provides positive feedback onto Cas through reactive oxygen, opposed by negative feedback from the ubiquitin proteasome system. The results suggest a two-step model for focal adhesion assembly in which clusters of phospho-Cas, effectors and inactive integrin β1 grow through positive feedback prior to integrin activation and recruitment of core focal adhesion proteins.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>epithelial cells</kwd><kwd>human foreskin fibroblast</kwd><kwd>cell migration</kwd><kwd>cell spreading</kwd><kwd>integrin</kwd><kwd>p130Cas</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005895</institution-id><institution>Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kumar</surname><given-names>Saurav</given-names></name><name><surname>Stainer</surname><given-names>Amanda</given-names></name><name><surname>Simpkins</surname><given-names>Christopher</given-names></name><name><surname>Cooper</surname><given-names>Jonathan A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM109463</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kumar</surname><given-names>Saurav</given-names></name><name><surname>Stainer</surname><given-names>Amanda</given-names></name><name><surname>Simpkins</surname><given-names>Christopher</given-names></name><name><surname>Cooper</surname><given-names>Jonathan A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 CA015704</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dubrulle</surname><given-names>Julien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fred Hutch/University of Washington Cancer Consortium</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cooper</surname><given-names>Jonathan A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel two-step model for integrin activation primed by Cas during cell migration and spreading on multiple extracellular matrix ligands.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell migration on extracellular matrix (ECM) involves the repeated assembly and disassembly of integrin-mediated cell–ECM adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hynes, 2002</xref>). Integrins are heterodimers of α and β chains that can switch between inactive and active conformations. Integrin activation exposes binding sites for ECM outside the cell and for specific integrin-tail-binding proteins inside the cell. The latter can associate with other proteins to form focal adhesions that link integrins to the actin cytoskeleton, providing traction forces for actomyosin-driven cell movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Iwamoto and Calderwood, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kanchanawong and Calderwood, 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Moser et al., 2009</xref>). At the ultrastructural level, focal adhesions are heterogeneous, with nanoclusters of active integrins and integrin tail-associated proteins closest to the membrane, F-actin and actin-associated proteins on top, and mechanosensing force transducers sandwiched between (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kanchanawong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Legerstee and Houtsmuller, 2021</xref>). Forces generated by actin polymerization and actomyosin contractility partially unfold the force transducers, exposing binding sites for other focal adhesion proteins and stabilizing the structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wolfenson et al., 2019</xref>). For example, talin is a conformationally sensitive protein that binds integrin through its head domain and actin through sites in its tail. Tension between the talin head and tail regions exposes binding sites for vinculin and other structural and regulatory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bachmann et al., 2023</xref>). In turn, binding to talin exposes actin-binding sites on vinculin, building links between integrins and actin filaments, providing resistance to contractile forces and anchorage for cell movement. Even though these mechanical principles are well understood, it is unclear whether they explain the early stages of adhesion assembly, when integrin clusters may be too small to develop sufficient force and where inside-out signaling, membrane lipid microdomains, the glycocalyx, and actin polymerization may also be important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Coyer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Henning Stumpf et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In addition to binding ECM and focal adhesion proteins, integrins are also signaling centers, transducing biochemical signals. Cell adhesion, or integrin clustering with antibodies or beads coated with ECM, rapidly activates Src-family tyrosine kinases (SFKs) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK), leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of several integrin-associated proteins and activating the GTPase Rac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burridge and Chrzanowska-Wodnicka, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Parsons et al., 2010</xref>). These signaling events are clearly important for regulating cell motility, cell cycle and cell survival, but their roles in focal adhesion dynamics remain unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burridge and Chrzanowska-Wodnicka, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mitra and Schlaepfer, 2006</xref>).</p><p>One of the main substrates for integrin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation is an adaptor protein named Cas (p130Cas or BCAR1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chodniewicz and Klemke, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Janoštiak et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mitra and Schlaepfer, 2006</xref>). At the molecular level, Cas contains an N-terminal SH3 domain, a four-helix bundle, and a C-terminal FAT domain, separated by unstructured regions and an SFK SH3/SH2-binding site. Cas localizes to focal adhesions through its SH3 and FAT domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Donato et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nakamoto et al., 1997</xref>), which bind vinculin, FAK, and paxillin in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Janoštiak et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Polte and Hanks, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Cas and SFKs mutually activate each other, with Cas binding to and activating SFKs and SFKs phosphorylating Cas at up to 15 repeated YxxP motifs in the ‘substrate domain’ (SD) between the SH3 domain and four-helix bundle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chodniewicz and Klemke, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pellicena and Miller, 2001</xref>). The Cas SD is also phosphorylated rapidly during cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Miyamoto et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Petch et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Vuori and Ruoslahti, 1995</xref>). The trigger for Cas phosphorylation is unclear: integrin clustering or conformation changes or protein binding to the Cas SD may be involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arias-Salgado et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hotta et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sawada et al., 2006</xref>). After phosphorylation, the pYxxP motifs can bind specific SH2-domain proteins including the paralogs Crk and CrkL. Crk/CrkL in turn can bind to and stimulate various proteins, including the Rac1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) DOCK180 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chodniewicz and Klemke, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gotoh et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hasegawa et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Klemke et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Knudsen et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tanaka et al., 1994</xref>). DOCK180 can then activate Rac1. Rac1 promotes actin polymerization and lamellipodial protrusion through the WAVE/Arp2/3 complex, and induces focal complex formation through unknown mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nobes and Hall, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Stradal et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zaidel-Bar et al., 2003</xref>). Cas activity in focal adhesions is limited by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which targets phosphorylated Cas for ubiquitination and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Steenkiste et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Teckchandani and Cooper, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Teckchandani et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The role of integrin-activated tyrosine phosphorylation in focal adhesion dynamics is unclear. Early studies of Cas knockout mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) revealed defects in cell attachment and the actin cytoskeleton, suggesting that Cas may regulate adhesion assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Honda et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Honda et al., 1998</xref>). In addition, Cas regulates spreading and migration of Caco-2 epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sanders and Basson, 2005</xref>). However, other studies, using mutant MEFs lacking Cas, SFKs, FAK, or paxillin, revealed no change in adhesion assembly but major inhibition of adhesion disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bockholt and Burridge, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ilić et al., 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Webb et al., 2004</xref>). To revisit the role of Cas phosphorylation, we have studied focal adhesion assembly in spreading and migrating epithelial cells. Unexpectedly, we found that phosphorylated Cas co-clusters with inactive integrins nearly a minute before integrin activation and recruitment of core focal adhesion proteins. Cas is required for vinculin recruitment but vinculin is not required for Cas clusters to form. A positive feedback loop between SFKs, Cas, Crk, Rac1, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) promotes the growth of the early Cas–integrin clusters and subsequent integrin activation and focal adhesion assembly, opposed by negative feedback from the ubiquitin–proteasome system. The results suggest a key role for SFK–Cas–Crk–Rac1 signaling in early stages of focal adhesion formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cas clusters are precursors for vinculin clusters</title><p>Cas has the potential to serve as a signaling hub that may be critical for focal adhesion assembly. However, we are only aware of one study where Cas recruitment kinetics were measured relative to other focal adhesion proteins. The results showed that Cas and paxillin are recruited simultaneously during adhesion assembly in migrating fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Donato et al., 2010</xref>). Another study using endothelial cells showed that tyrosine phosphorylation precedes paxillin recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zaidel-Bar et al., 2003</xref>). These two studies suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation may start before Cas is recruited. However, the kinetics of tyrosine phosphorylation, Cas recruitment, and adhesion assembly may vary according to cell type, integrin, or ECM. Therefore, we evaluated the kinetics of Cas recruitment and tyrosine phosphorylation relative to focal adhesion assembly, making use of the immortalized, normal, mammary epithelial line MCF10A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Debnath and Brugge, 2005</xref>). Since Cas over-expression can stimulate cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Klemke et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yano et al., 2000</xref>), we tagged Cas by editing the <italic>Cas</italic> gene, inserting an artificial exon encoding mScarlet (mSc) and a linker sequence into the first intron and selecting a polyclonal population of mScarlet fluorescent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Western blotting revealed similar levels and phosphorylation of Cas and Cas<sup>mSc</sup> proteins, indicating that most cells are heterozygous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This intron tagging approach avoided the need for single-cell cloning that can select for variants (see Methods). To monitor focal adhesions, the Cas<sup>mSc</sup> cells were transduced to express near-endogenous levels of YFP-tagged vinculin (VCL). Imaging using total internal reflection (TIRF) microscopy revealed that Cas<sup>mSc</sup> and YFP-VCL substantially co-localized, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Staining with Cas and vinculin antibodies revealed that tagging Cas and vinculin did not alter focal adhesion number or structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cas clusters before vinculin during focal adhesion assembly.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Cas</italic> wildtype and <italic>Cas<sup>mSc</sup></italic> genomic organization and <italic>Cas<sup>mSc</sup></italic> mRNA structure.

First, Cas phosphorylation, detected with pY410 Cas antibody, is maximal at the head of the cluster, ~0.5 μm from the cell edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We were unable to detect Crk with available antibodies but the Crk paralog CrkL peaked at the head of the cluster, consistent with high levels of phospho-Cas and rapid recruitment of Crk during adhesion assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The head of the cluster also contained the Cas SH3-binding protein FAK, phosphorylated at Y861, an SFK phosphorylation site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eliceiri et al., 2002</xref>). This population of FAK is unlikely to be active since it has low levels of autophosphorylation at Y397, a site required for kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Le Coq et al., 2022</xref>). This suggests that the head of the cluster is the peak of SFK activity.</p><p>Next, the peak of vinculin at ~1.5 μm also contains highest levels of mechanosensing and structural components of focal adhesions, including kindlin2, talin1, paxillin, kinase-active pY397 FAK, and F-actin, but decreased amounts of pY410Cas and total Cas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The presence of mechanosensing proteins suggests this part of the cluster is attached to the ECM and subject to mechanical force.</p><p>Finally, the distribution of integrin β1 varied according to the antibody used. Total integrin β1, detected with conformation-insensitive antibody AIIB2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mould et al., 2016</xref>), forms two peaks, one coincident with pY410Cas and pY861FAK and one aligning with the peak of vinculin. The first peak was also detected with mAb13, specific for inactive, bent-closed (BC) and extended-closed (EC) β1 integrin conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Su et al., 2016</xref>). The second peak was detected with 12G10, specific for the active, extended-open (EO) conformation, and by 9EG7, which detects both EO and EC conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Su et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, D</xref>). This suggests that integrin activation increases as kindlin, talin, and vinculin are recruited, consistent with the roles of kindlin/talin binding and mechanical force in integrin activation.</p><p>Overall, while differential antibody access may affect immunofluorescent staining profiles, the spatial patterns suggest a temporal sequence of events in which active phosphorylated Cas and Crk/CrkL initially cluster with inactive integrin β1 and SFK phosphorylated but kinase-inactive FAK. Since integrin β1 is in its BC conformation it is probably not attached to the ECM. Later, phosphorylated and total Cas levels decrease as integrin β1 recruits talin and kindlin, adopts the EO conformation, and able to bind ECM. Mechanical forces from the actin cytoskeleton then expose binding sites for vinculin and a mature focal adhesion is formed (model, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Phosphorylated Cas is enriched in the adhesome</title><p>Even though many imaging studies have detected Cas in focal adhesions, Cas is not routinely detected in the adhesome, as defined by proteomics or proximity biotinylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kanchanawong and Calderwood, 2022</xref>). However, low abundance proteins may be significantly enriched in the adhesome yet escape detection.

Cells were seeded on polylysine or COLI for 60 min and incubated with protein–protein cross-linking reagents before lysis and separation of adhesome and supernatant fractions as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Humphries et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Schiller et al., 2011</xref>). We then reversed the cross-links and performed Western blotting on the adhesome and supernatant samples. We found that the adhesome contained ~20–27% of total cellular integrin β1, talin, vinculin, paxillin, and total and autophosphorylated (pY397) FAK, but only ~7% of a control protein, ERK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). The adhesome fraction also contained ~25% of total cellular Cas, suggesting it is as enriched in adhesions as bona fide adhesome proteins. Moreover, the adhesome also contained ~73% of phospho-Cas, detected with pY410 or pY249 antibodies, and pY861 FAK. This suggests that pY410 Cas, pY249 Cas, and pY861 FAK are significantly enriched in the adhesome fraction relative to their non-phosphorylated (or in the case of FAK, pY397 phosphorylated) forms. This suggests that these phosphorylations occur locally within adhesions and are rapidly lost when Cas or FAK dissociate. In contrast, autophosphorylated pY397 FAK remains active in the cytosol.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Cas, Crk, and SFKs regulate vinculin recruitment and focal adhesion assembly</title><p>The early arrival of Cas at sites of future focal adhesions suggests Cas may nucleate adhesion assembly.

We tested the roles of β1 and αv heterodimers in Cas-dependent adhesion of epithelial and fibroblast cells using siRNA. On COLI, β1 depletion strongly inhibited spreading and recruitment of vinculin to Cas clusters, while depleting αv had smaller effects. In contrast, on FN, both β1 and αv were required for spreading and vinculin recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). Thus, Cas regulates β1-dependent adhesion assembly on COLI, and β1- or αv-dependent adhesion assembly FN. To further identify the specific integrins regulated by Cas, we noted that MCF10A cells express α chains α2, 3, 5, and v at 10-fold higher level than other α chains, while β3 is under-expressed relative to β1 and β6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ly et al., 2018</xref>).

Early β1 clusters at the edge lack αv.

This suggests that, even though Cas requires Rac1 to support normal spreading and adhesion formation, active Rac1 requires Cas to induce spreading, raising the possibility of a positive feedback loop from Rac1 back to Cas.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Positive and negative feedback regulates focal adhesion assembly.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Rac1 requires Cas to induce cell spreading.

In the first step, co-clustering of Cas with inactive integrin leads to SFK-dependent phosphorylation of Cas, recruitment of Crk/CrkL, activation of Rac1, ROS production, and positive feedback that strengthens and maintains signaling to form a nascent adhesion. Positive feedback is opposed by negative feedback resulting from CRL5<sup>SOCS6</sup>. In a second step, integrin β1 is activated and talin1, kindlin2, vinculin, actin, and other proteins are recruited to form a focal adhesion. The second step may be triggered by growth of the nascent adhesion to a critical size, or by decreased occupancy with Cas.

Rac1 stimulates localized production of ROS by the Nox1 NADPH-dependent oxidase by binding p47<sup>phox</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Ushio-Fukai, 2006</xref>). ROS are short-range signaling molecules, rapidly reacting with and inhibiting protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) and increasing local tyrosine phosphorylation of various substrates including Cas, SFKs, and p190RhoGAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Garton et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Giannoni et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nimnual et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tonks, 2005</xref>). Thus, Rac1 potentially activates Cas through a Rac1–ROS–PTP–SFK–Cas pathway. Such a positive feedback loop, where the output signal is fed back as input, can amplify the signal, enhancing the outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brandman and Meyer, 2008</xref>). To test whether ROS are involved in positive feedback and adhesion assembly in MCF10A cells, we inhibited Nox1 with diphenylamineiodonium (DPI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Reis et al., 2020</xref>). DPI inhibited Rac1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), inhibited cell spreading, and delayed vinculin recruitment to Cas clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video9">Video 9</xref>).

Other structural components of focal adhesions are recruited within a few seconds of talin binding and ECM engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bachir et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Choi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Han et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Laukaitis et al., 2001</xref>). Steps preceding mechanosensing are unclear, however. Our results suggest a two-step model in which SFKs, Cas, Crk/CrkL, and Rac1 play a key role before talin and vinculin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). In the first step, phosphorylated Cas and Crk/CrkL cluster with inactive integrin β1. This step does not require talin1, kindlin2, vinculin, or other structural proteins tested, and these proteins are only present at low level. Moreover, the integrin is inactive, so presumably not bound to the ECM. The clusters appear to grow through positive feedback involving SFKs, Cas, Crk/CrkL, Rac1, and ROS, opposed by negative feedback through CRL5<sup>SOCS6</sup>. Clusters may need to reach a critical size for force transmission before the next step can occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Coyer et al., 2012</xref>). In the second step, integrin β1 is activated and mechanosensing and structural proteins accumulate. FAK is present at low level in step one but is not activated until step 2, consistent with FAK as a mechanosensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Le Coq et al., 2022</xref>). Remarkably, levels of total and phosphorylated Cas decline during the second step. Thus, in our model, Cas regulates the first step of integrin clustering but may not be needed for the final assembly.</p><p>Our model is based largely on experiments using epithelial cells attaching to collagen through integrin α2β1 and contrast with previous studies reporting normal focal adhesion assembly when Cas and SFK-mutant fibroblasts were spreading or migrating on FN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bockholt and Burridge, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Webb et al., 2004</xref>). FN adhesions contain αv as well as β1 integrin heterodimers, so in principle a non-β1 integrin could bypass the need for Cas. Different integrins are known to have different properties. For example, integrin αv adhesions are larger and more reliant on RhoA than integrin β1 adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Coyer et al., 2012</xref>), and talin1 binds more strongly to β3 than β1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anthis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lu et al., 2016</xref>). However, our preliminary experiments suggest that the two-step model applies also to fibroblasts on FN. We found that Cas is required for epithelial and fibroblast adhesion and spreading on FN, mediated by α5β1 and one or more αv integrins. Cas clusters were also precursors of focal adhesions when epithelial cells spread on FN. A Cas requirement for adhesion assembly in previous studies of mutant fibroblasts may have been hidden by expression of Cas family members or compensation during isolation of the cell lines.</p><p>The type of integrin may explain the unexpected finding that Yes1 was limiting for integrin β1 adhesion assembly on collagen. Previous studies showed that Src regulates αvβ3 adhesions but not α5β1 adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Felsenfeld et al., 1999</xref>), while Fyn and Cas were both needed for force-sensitive integrin αvβ3 adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kostic and Sheetz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">von Wichert, 2003</xref>). Yes1 has a higher affinity than Src or Fyn for integrin β1 cytoplasmic tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arias-Salgado et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arias-Salgado et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, liquid-ordered membrane microdomains (lipid rafts) contain Yes1 and Fyn but not Src (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Resh, 1999</xref>). These microdomains play a poorly understood role in integrin clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lietha and Izard, 2020</xref>). Therefore, Yes1 preference for membrane microdomains and integrin tails may explain its special role in Cas-dependent integrin clustering.</p><p>SFK–Cas–Crk/CrkL–Rac1 signaling not only initiates focal adhesion formation but also cell spreading. Curiously, cell spreading induced by active Rac1 was also Cas dependent. This appears to be due to positive feedback by Rac1-dependent ROS generation and ROS activation of SFK–Cas signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Garton et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Giannoni et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nimnual et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tonks, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Ushio-Fukai, 2006</xref>). Such feedback may serve to amplify and spread the signal, allowing the initial integrin–Cas clusters to grow in the face of negative feedback through CRL5<sup>SOCS6</sup>. However, the positive feedback makes it challenging to identify the exact mechanism for initial cluster growth and later adhesion assembly. For example, SFK–Cas–Crk/CrkL signaling may only be required to activate Rac1, and Rac1 may then induce integrin clustering. Indeed, seminal studies showed that transient expression of active Rac1 induces focal complexes, although the Rac1 effector involved is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nobes and Hall, 1995</xref>). That study also showed that Rac1-induced focal complexes only mature into focal adhesions when Rac1 is inhibited, RhoA is activated, and actomyosin tension develops. The loss of Cas from clusters may thus be important in our system to locally decrease Rac1 activity and allow force generation for focal adhesion maturation. Unfortunately, the Rac1 sensor we used did not allow high resolution temporal imaging of Rac1 activity at the level of individual adhesions. Alternatively, Rac1 may only be needed to generate ROS and stimulate Cas phosphorylation, and the latter may induce integrin clustering. This could occur by formation of networks of phospho-Cas, Crk, and multivalent Crk-binding proteins like DOCK180, linked somehow to integrin tails. Recent studies elegantly showed that phospho-Cas forms protein condensates when mixed with an SH2–SH3 protein, Nck, and an Nck-binding protein, N-WASP, in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Case et al., 2022</xref>). These protein condensates synergize with FAK–paxillin condensates and kindlin to cluster integrin tails on planar lipid bilayers in vitro. It is possible that similar protein condensates or networks form in our system. These condensates could then grow in space and time through Rac1-induced actin polymerization, and positive feedback through ROS.</p><p>Our studies also raise the question of how phospho-Cas induces integrin β1 clustering. Cas localization to focal adhesions requires its SH3 and FAT domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Donato et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nakamoto et al., 1997</xref>). These domains are thought to localize Cas in adhesions by direct binding to FAK, vinculin and paxillin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Janoštiak et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Polte and Hanks, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). However, FAK, vinculin, and paxillin levels were low in initial phospho-Cas–Crk–integrin clusters and increase when Cas levels decrease, suggesting that Cas associates with integrins through a different mechanism. For example, the integrin β1 tail may bind to Yes1 that is associated with Cas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arias-Salgado et al., 2005</xref>), or membrane microdomains could mediate co-clustering of Yes1 with integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lietha and Izard, 2020</xref>). Whatever the mechanism for cluster formation, cluster growth could then activate associated SFKs by increasing transphosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arias-Salgado et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berrier et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bodeau et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buensuceso et al., 2003</xref>).

Intron targeting has several advantages over exon targeting. First, the exact position of artificial exon within the intron is unimportant, allowing insertion at the single guide RNA (sgRNA) SpCas9 target site with highest predicted efficiency. Second, the exon does not need to be inserted precisely, since errors should be corrected by RNA splicing. Thus, homology arms are unnecessary, shortening the donor sequence.

Backgrounds were subtracted and intensities adjusted equally across each image set.</p><p>For analysis of the spatial distribution of the proteins and phosphoproteins within Cas/vinculin clusters, a line (5 × 25-pixels width × length, 0.16 µm/pixel) was plotted along the major axis of a Cas<sup>mSc</sup> cluster, starting from the outer edge and moving inwards. The intensity profile for each antibody along this line was quantified in ImageJ and aligned using Cas<sup>mSc</sup> as a reference point. The mean normalized intensity profile for each antibody was then calculated across 20–25 regions from several cells. A heat map for the mean intensity profile of the normalized value was generated using GraphPad Prism.</p><p>To analyze the number and intensity of clusters containing either Cas or vinculin, or both, images were first spit into individual channels and then summed using the ‘Image calculator’ command in ImageJ. This summed image was used to generate a binary image mask by applying manual threshold through the Yen method. ROIs &gt;20 pixels (0.52 μm<sup>2</sup>) were then counted and their mean areas and mean Cas and vinculin intensities quantified. Cell area was quantified either manually by drawing around the cell or from a binary mask created by thresholding through the Triangle method, setting minimum size as 50 pixels.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Quantification of cluster kinetics from two-color TIRF videos</title><p>TIRF image datasets were exported as two-channel time-series hyperstacks in TIF format. Quantification of the time shift between red (Cas<sup>mSc</sup>) and green (YFP-VCL, β1-EctopH, ITGB1<sup>GFP</sup> or Crk<sup>mGL</sup>) cluster formation was performed in MATLAB (R2021b). The pipeline involves the following steps: drift correction, image preprocessing and denoising, focal adhesion segmentation and tracking, intensities extraction and normalization, and signal analysis.</p><p>Drifts between time frames were corrected by registering the image of one frame to the image of the previous frame using a translation transformation. Drift corrected timeseries were then denoised with a median filter and their background was equalized with a top-hat transform. Clusters were segmented separately in each channel at each time frame by intensity thresholding and size filtering. Threshold values were arbitrarily defined as a quarter of the intensity value of the 50th brightest pixel of the dataset for each channel, and the union of the binary masks of the two channels with an area greater than 20 pixels (0.52 μm<sup>2</sup>) was used to define clusters. Clusters were tracked over time by creating a 3D stack (XYT) and by computing the resulting connected components. Only clusters tracked in three or more frames (≥40 s) were quantified. For each tracked cluster, the average mean intensity of each channel over time was extracted by first measuring the mean intensity within the mask at each time frame from time zero to the end, resulting in a number of intensity traces equal to the number of time frames where the cluster was tracked.</p><p>To calculate the time shift between the red and green channel intensity profiles for each tracked cluster, average mean intensity traces were rescaled to the [0 1] value range, and after smoothing the signal by applying a moving average filter, the time at which the rescaled intensity reaches 0.5 (<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub>) was interpolated. The time shift was finally calculated by subtracting red (Cas) <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> from green (vinculin, integrin, or Crk) <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Adhesome isolation</title><p>Adhesome samples were isolated as described with minor modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schiefermeier et al., 2014</xref>). MCF10A cells were detached from near-confluent 5 cm plates, resuspended in assay media, incubated in suspension for 30 min, then re-seeded onto an equal number of 5 cm plates that had been precoated with 50 μg/ml collagen. After 1 hr at 37°C, one dish was washed and lysed in 400 μl RIPA buffer to provide a sample of total protein (T) and the other dishes were washed gently with room temperature PBS and incubated with 2 ml freshly diluted 0.5 mM dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (EMD Millipore 322133) 0.05 mM (1,4-di [3′-(2′-pyridyldithio)propionamido] butane) (Sigma 16646) in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. Cross-linking was terminated by washing twice with 50 mM Tris 140 mM NaCl pH 7.4 before transferring to ice. 400 μl RIPA buffer was added and the plates were rocked at 4°C for 1 hr. Supernatants (S) were collected in a 2-ml microtube (Axygen MCT-200-L-C). The plates were washed twice with PBS, drained, and 400 μl RIPA buffer added. 2-Mercaptoethanol was added to 2% concentration to all samples, and all microtubes and dishes were sealed and incubated at 50°C for 1 hr. After cooling to room temperature, the dish was scraped and the adhesome (A) fraction was transferred to a 2 ml microtube. Total, supernatant, and adhesome fractions were sonicated (10 s, microtip) to shear DNA and the proteins were precipitated by adding 1.6 ml acetone and placing at −20°C for 1 hr. After centrifugation (10 min, 14,000 rpm), pellets were drained, dried in a stream of air, and incubated with 25 μl 5× concentrated SDS sample buffer at 95°C for 5 min, then 100 μl RIPA buffer was added to all tubes. Samples were centrifuged and equal volumes analyzed by SDS–PAGE, typically on 10% acrylamide/0.13% bisacrylamide gels, followed by Western blotting. The procedure was scaled up as needed to run replicate blots for probing with different antibody combinations. On occasion, dilutions of the T sample were loaded to estimate detection sensitivity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Ratiometric FRET imaging</title><p>The Rac1-2G reporter was expressed in MCF10A cells by lentiviral transduction. After siRNA treatment, cells were allowed to attach to collagen for 30 min in the absence or presence of various inhibitors, then fixed and mounted. Coverslips were imaged on a Leica SP8 confocal microscope using Leica HCX Plan Apo ×63/1.40 oil immersion objective. Excitation and emission wavelengths as follows: donor (mTFP1) excitation 440 nm, emission 450–510 nm: FRET excitation 440 nm, emission 515–600 nm; acceptor (mVenus) excitation 514 nm, emission 515–600 nm. All channels were collected on the HyD detectors. Images were processed with the Lightening deconvolution (Leica LASX software) and the FRET ratio in the most ventral plane was quantified using ImageJ as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kardash et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Statistics</title><p>Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism. Median and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for non-normal distributions of measurements from single cells. Data from multiple cells or biological replicates were assumed to follow normal distributions allowing calculation of mean and SEM in cases where data from multiple cells in biologically independent experiments were combined. Pairwise comparisons between control and experimental populations testing independent hypotheses were made using the non-parametric Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test. Experiments testing alternative hypotheses were analyzed using the non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis analysis of variance followed by Dunn’s multiple comparison test.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Senior editor, <italic>eLife</italic></p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Software, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-90234-mdarchecklist1-v2.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All raw Western blots generated during the study have been included as source files.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the paper &quot;Cas phosphorylation regulates focal adhesion assembly&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. We sincerely apologise for the delay in reviewing your manuscript, which was due to the fact that it was difficult to find peer reviewers. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Mike Sheetz (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>. All three reviewers found that the work is potentially novel and important, and would be interesting to the field. However, very significant concerns were raised. Specifically, reviewers would like to see stronger proof that b1 integrin is the only relevant β integrin in the system you use; they would like to see controls excluding the potential involvement of b6 integrin, as well as experiments in fibroblasts knockout for b3 integrin. There were also concerns about the choice of the integrin antibodies used, the small number of cells analyzed, and some important controls of the tagging strategies missing. Addressing all these concerns is likely possible but will also be laborious and will take more time and effort than can be expected from a normal revision at <italic>eLife</italic>. We, therefore, return the paper to you so that you can send it to another journal if you seek rapid publication. However, we will be prepared to reconsider the manuscript if you can thoroughly address the reviewers' comments. In this case, we will do our best to send the paper to the same reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have investigated the role of the p130-cas/crk complex in cell spreading and the hierarchy of adhesion formation in epithelial cells. The authors propose a model whereby phosphorylated Cas (p130Cas, BCAR1), its binding partner, Crk, and inactive FAK and inactive b1-integrins cluster together at the leading edge of the cell protrusion. This they suggest precedes focal adhesions formation with F-actin, active integrins, active FAK, vinculin, and talin. They show convincingly that p130cas depletion severely impairs cell spreading downstream of integrin activation, as integrin activation with Mn<sup>2+</sup> fails to rescue the spreading defect. The model is attractive; however, it does not seem to be supported fully by the data. The biggest problem is the unfortunate choice of the integrin antibodies used in the paper. Unfortunately, the authors have been misinformed in their choice of the antibodies used (Please see Byron et al., JCS PMID: 19910492). They indicate that they have chosen an antibody that specifically recognizes the active ligand-bound state of integrins. However, the 9EG7 antibody does not recognize the open conformation but it is specific to the extended primed state. Instead, 12G10 for example would recognize this state. They also indicate that they have used an antibody that recognizes the bent inactive state that is not ligand bound. Unfortunately, AIIB2 is not conformation-specific but rather blocks directly the ligand binding to the integrins and thus does not stain inactive integrins. This in fact is obvious from looking at the example stainings provided where their inactive beta1 staining is clearly in adhesions. In most epithelial cells, inactive b1-integrin (detected with Mab13, PIH5, or 4B4 antibodies specifically recognizing inactive integrins) localise primarily to membrane ruffles above the FA staining detected by TIRF.</p><p>A big part of the data included in the main figures describes the approaches the authors have used to generate endogenously tagged cell lines for some of the components investigated. This is commendable but as such genomic editing is an established methodology, these details could be moved to the supplements.</p><p>Throughout the manuscript, the quantifications are based on rather low numbers of cells, and for some experiments, it is not clear if these are from a single experiment or from biologically independent experiments. In addition, there are several instances where the authors show just a small magnified area of the cells. Smaller magnification images should be provided as well to help the reader to evaluate the quality of the staining overall and how representative the chosen areas are.</p><p>Specific points:</p><p>1) For endogenous tagging of Cas, the authors employed the insertion of an artificial exon containing mScarlet (mSc) into the first intron of the Cas gene. In the resulting protein, mSc is inserted between Pro4 and Asn5 of Cas without any further linker sequence, thus potentially affecting some of the functions of the Cas SH3 domain. Moreover, phosphorylation of Tyr12 in the Cas SH3 domain has been reported to regulate interaction with several SH3-binding proteins, including vinculin (PMID: 21937722, PMID: 28808245, PMID: 23974298). The authors should provide evidence that inserting mSc in close proximity to the Cas SH3 domain and an important regulation site (Y12) does not affect downstream signalling of the endogenously tagged Cas. For instance, the authors should analyse the interaction of Cas and CasmSc with SH3 domain-binding proteins or analyse Y12 phosphorylation levels of Cas and CasmSc in cells with and without Src expression.</p><p>2) In Figure 1B authors show levels of Cas in the CasmSc cells. While most of the Cas in CasmSc cells is tagged, the phosphorylation pattern as shown by pY410 Ab does not replicate the pattern of the total Cas antibody, suggesting phosphorylation of the tagged Cas is substantially weaker than that of the remaining untagged Cas. Authors should provide further evidence that their tagging strategy does not influence Cas substrate domain phosphorylation and thus signalling downstream of the phosphorylated SD (such as interaction with Crk) when compared to untagged Cas.</p><p>3) In Figure 2C the authors show data points of 11 cells on Fn and 7 cells on collagen (although the legend indicates n=7-13). Measurement of more cells should be provided in order to strengthen this observation, given the median Δt<sub>1/2</sub> (VCL<sup>-</sup>Cas) ranges from less than 0s to more than 120s. Moreover, based on this data authors suggest that &quot;Cas clusters may specify localization of integrin α5β1 and α2β1 adhesions&quot;, however, this is not obvious from the data provided in this section.</p><p>4) Figure 3. Please show the overall distribution of the tagged integrins in the cell. How well do the tagged integrins overlap with the endogenous ones? Please show b1-integrin blots alongside the GFP in the WB.</p><p>5) Figure 5. The authors need to provide representative images (lower and higher mag) of all the antibody stainings they have quantified in 5C. How has the specificity of the antibodies/staining been determined? Please see above the comments related to the integrin antibodies used.</p><p>6) Figure 6 and 7. How have the authors controlled for off-target effects of their siRNAs? The vinculin silencing efficacy in Figure 6 is poor and precludes making any conclusions on the role of vinculin.</p><p>In Figure 6C the authors analyse the role of Cas depletion on the regulation of Mn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent spreading. As a further control, the authors could include a rescue experiment with Cas WT and Cas lacking the CCH domain in Cas-depleted cells.</p><p>7) The results in Figure 7A suggest that the interaction of Crk with phosphorylated Cas accelerates the recruitment of Vinculin to the Cas-Crk clusters. Do the authors have a mechanistic explanation of how this could be regulated? Also, to support this data, the authors should perform a Crk rescue experiment in Crk-depleted cells to see whether recruitment of Vinculin to Cas clusters will be rescued to control levels.</p><p>8) In Figure 8D, the fluorescence intensity of CasmSc seems to be lower in siSOCS6 than in siCtrl cells. This is rather counterintuitive since the depletion of SOCS6 should stabilize Cas levels. Could the authors comment on this?</p><p>Other points:</p><p>1) In the introduction, the authors mention the mechanoresponsive roles of talin in adhesion maturation and assembly. It would be beneficial to mention in this context also the effect of the force-mediated extension of the Cas substrate domain on its downstream signalling (PMID: 17129785, reviewed in PMID: 25062607).</p><p>2) Figure 1 supplement 2. What is the difference between Hela panels E and F?</p><p>3) It is not clear, whether the cells measured in Figure 3 are seeded on Fn or Col-I. If on Fn – would the delay in ITGB1 arrival to Cas clusters be different on Col-I, since authors show there are more 9EG7-positive ITGB1 clusters in cells seeded on collagen (Figure 2B)?</p><p>4) This study is in line with previous work (PMID: 30639111), where pY410 Cas has been shown to co-localize with Crk in filopodia tips in a CCH domain-dependent manner and extends these observations to the edge of spreading/migrating MCF10A and HeLa cells. This could perhaps be discussed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript &quot;Cas phosphorylation regulates focal adhesion assembly&quot; by Kumar et al. investigates the role of Cas in cell spreading and finds that Cas, Crk, and FAK cluster together at the cell periphery to initiate focal adhesion formation. In contrast to the previous understanding, they suggest that Cas clustering happens before integrin clustering and hence is the initial step in adhesion formation. This notion is the key novel aspect of the study, however, it is based on the assumption that b1 integrin is the only relevant integrin in the system, which at this point is not supported by the data.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>– The central finding of the study (i.e. that Cas clusters before integrin) is based solely on the study of b1-integrin and hence on the assumptions that it is the only integrin that is relevant for adhesion formation in the cells used here. To this end, the authors cite work by Kulak, 2014 and Ly, 2018 that MCF10A and HELA cells express 10-fold less b3 integrin compared to b1 integrin. While b3 is indeed found at lower levels in these studies it might be (a) nonetheless present at sufficient levels to initiate adhesion formation (as it was picked up by mass-spec analysis); (b) the authors discuss that b1 integrin is 10fold higher expressed compared to Cas ( based on same studies) meaning that Cas and b3 integrin would be expressed at comparable levels, further supporting point (a) above; lastly, (c) the studies by Kulak and Ly find other β-integrins at high levels – Kulak: ITGB5 and ITGB8; Ly: ITGB5, ITGB6, ITGB8, which are all RGD receptors and can complex with ITGAV which is also found at high levels in both studies, consistent with the general understanding of αvβ6 being a major fibronectin receptor in cancer cells. Mechanosensing and binding properties are different for these integrins (e.g. PMID: 24793358, 22328497), but especially the binding to Cas, or their involvement in early adhesion formation have not been characterised to my knowledge. As such the fact that Cas clusters before b1 integrin does not suggest that it is integrin independent, but might only associate with clusters of other integrins (e.g. αvβ6) that then mature into b1 integrin-containing adhesions.</p><p>– Apart from this central point, the authors show that phosphorylated Cas is enriched at the adhesome, knockdown of Cas leads to cell spreading and migration defects, that Cas is upstream of vinculin recruitment and that Cas is phosphorylated by Yes1, which are all points that have been described in the past. Especially, inwards movement of Cas dependent on phosphorylation: PMID 24928898; the role of Cas in spreading: PMID 10448062; also here: PMIDs 23974298, 21937722; 15817476;</p><p>– The authors find phosphorylation through Yes, but not fyn or src, although PMID 17129785 previously demonstrated that Yes, Src, and Fyn can phosphorylate Cas; whereas PMID 11604500 finds that Src can phosphorylate Cas. The discrepancy here should be explored.</p><p>– Also the lack of effect of Src and Fyn knockdown in the current study is in apparent contrast to the existing literature, e.g. PMID 16597701, and should be explored further.</p><p>– Similarly the question about the recruitment of vinculin downstream of Cas seems to be in disagreement with the literature reporting that vinculin is upstream of FAK dynamics – i.e. since adhesion localisation of Cas is less pronounced in absence of Vinculin (PMID 23974298).</p><p>The authors should expand the investigation to other integrins; in order to exclude that the change in adhesion localisation (i.e. distance from cell edge; e.g. Figure 5C) is not affected by the different penetration depth of the green and red light in the dual color TIRF experiments, the authors should investigate as a control green Cas vs CasmSc.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The findings of this paper show that epithelial cell adhesion to fibronectin or collagen involves a novel adhesion site assembly process that relies on clusters of Cas at the cell edge. Further, an SFK-Cas-Crk-Rac1 pathway is linked to spreading and further adhesion maturation through vinculin recruitment. The MCF10A and HeLa lines that are used in this study have very low levels of β 3 integrin and the β 1 integrin is the primary integrin involved but Mn activation does not rescue spreading in the absence of Cas.</p><p>The mechanism of Cas concentration at the leading is not determined but there are many other findings that support the major hypothesis.</p><p>An experiment that would test the hypothesis that the major difference between the adhesion formation in fibroblasts and these epithelial cells is the level of β 3 integrins would be to overexpress β 3 and/or deplete β 1 in the MCF10A cells. If β 3 integrin would be processed and reach the cell surface, then the process of adhesion formation may change.</p><p>I liked this paper and it was very thorough in documenting the pathway for adhesion formation. My major suggestion is to try to increase β 3 integrin levels in the epithelial cells or alternatively, deplete them in the fibroblasts while increasing β 1 levels. This may not work for a variety of reasons but it would be spectacular if it did.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.90234.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

We had mistakenly used 9EG10 to profile active integrin β1, but, as the reviewer points out, 9EG10 actually binds both extended-closed (EC, primed) and extended-open (EO, active) conformations (Su et al. 2016 PMC4941492). We therefore repeated our analysis using 12G10, which is specific for the EO conformation (Su et al. 2016). The 12G10 (EO) and 9EG7 (EO+EC) profiles are very similar, suggesting that levels of EC are low relative to EO (Figure 4D). The results confirm that active (EO) integrin is enriched towards the inner end of each cluster, coinciding with the peak of vinculin, kindlin, talin, and other focal adhesion markers, consistent with our interpretation that this part of the cluster is attached to the ECM.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>They also indicate that they have used an antibody that recognizes the bent inactive state that is not ligand bound. Unfortunately, AIIB2 is not conformation-specific but rather blocks directly the ligand binding to the integrins and thus does not stain inactive integrins. This in fact is obvious from looking at the example stainings provided where their inactive beta1 staining is clearly in adhesions. In most epithelial cells, inactive b1-integrin (detected with Mab13, PIH5, or 4B4 antibodies specifically recognizing inactive integrins) localise primarily to membrane ruffles above the FA staining detected by TIRF.</p></disp-quote><p>We regret the error. As the reviewer points out, AIIB2 recognizes both active and inactive integrin β1 (Mold et al. 2016, PMC5076510). The AIIB2 profile showed a prominent peak near the outer edge of the cluster, co-localizing with phospho-Cas, and a lower, broad peak overlapping with vinculin. We interpreted these peaks as inactive and active integrin respectively. As the reviewer recommended, we have now used mAb13, which binds both bentclosed (BC) and EC integrin β1 (Su et al. 2016). mAb13 only shows the first peak, co-localizing with phospho-Cas (Figure 4D). Inactive integrin was also detected on the upper cell surface but was out of the plane of focus and was not quantified.</p><p>Comparing the profiles obtained with mAb13 (BC+EC), 9EG7 (EO+EC), 12G10 (EO) and AIIB2 (total) suggests that inactive (BC) integrin β1 peaks with Cas and pYCas near the cell edge, while active (EO) β1 peaks with vinculin and other focal adhesion markers further from the edge (Figure 4E). Minimal overlap between mAb13 and 9EG7 profiles implies that the level of primed (EC) integrin β1 is low.</p><p>Please note also that the spatial distribution of total integrin β1 (all conformations) across the adhesion is difficult to assess by immunostaining, which is influenced by antibody affinity and accessibility. However, live imaging showed that integrin β1 clustering is delayed relative to Cas (Figure 2), suggesting that immunostaining underestimates the amount of active EO integrin under the cell body relative to inactive BC integrin near the edge.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A big part of the data included in the main figures describes the approaches the authors have used to generate endogenously tagged cell lines for some of the components investigated.

We omitted the important point that the mScarlet PCR product used to generate the targeting construct included 24 nucleotides of vector sequence. This introduces an 8-residue linker (GGMDELYK) between the folded structure of mScarlet and residue 5 of Cas. This makes our construct more similar to the viral constructs used by others. For example, inserting Cas at the BglII site in pEGFP-C1 introduces a 5-residue linker (SGLRS) between EGFP and the first residue of Cas (Janostiak et al. 2011, PMID: 21937722; Branis et al. 2017, PMC 5390273). The reviewer may also be concerned about possible functions of first four residues of Cas (MNHL), which now separated from residue 5 by mScarlet and the linker. In principle, these four residues could be important for Cas function. This seems unlikely because MNHL is just one of seven different alternative first coding exons that all splice into the same second exon (Uniprot P56945). The alternative first exons range in length from 2 to 50 residues and end in various residues – L, W, K, E, P (twice) and R – suggesting that the protein must tolerate a variety of N-terminal sequences. We have modified the Results and Figures to indicate that Cas<sup>mSc</sup> contains a linker between mScarlet and the SH3 domain.</p><p>Even with the linker, mScarlet tagging may affect Cas function. Therefore, we performed additional controls, comparing parental and Cas<sup>mSc</sup> MCF10A cells. First, we plated parental MCF10A cells on collagen for 30 min and immunostained for phospho-Cas and vinculin. Cell spread area and the areas and intensities of pYCas and vinculin clusters were the same as for Cas<sup>mSc</sup> MCF10A cells analyzed in parallel (new Figure 1 —figure supplement 2). Second, we analyzed the spatial distribution of endogenous Cas and vinculin in parental MCF10A cells (new Figure 4 —figure supplement 1). The untagged proteins are organized spatially in the same pattern as Cas<sup>mSc</sup> and EYFP-vinculin (Figure 4). Thus, mScarlet tagging appears not to affect Cas function or spatial organization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, phosphorylation of Tyr12 in the Cas SH3 domain has been reported to regulate interaction with several SH3-binding proteins, including vinculin (PMID: 21937722, PMID: 28808245, PMID: 23974298). The authors should provide evidence that inserting mSc in close proximity to the Cas SH3 domain and an important regulation site (Y12) does not affect downstream signalling of the endogenously tagged Cas. For instance, the authors should analyse the interaction of Cas and CasmSc with SH3 domain-binding proteins or analyse Y12 phosphorylation levels of Cas and CasmSc in cells with and without Src expression.</p></disp-quote><p>pY12 was identified in a shotgun pTyr proteomics experiment on SrcYF-transformed mouse fibroblasts (Luo et al. 2008, PMC2579752). The investigators then developed a pY12 antibody and found that the site is phosphorylated in some cancer cells and in SrcYF-transformed but not control fibroblasts (Janostiak et al. 2011, PMID: 21937722). However, pY12 has not been noted by other investigators. It has only been detected in three high-throughput phosphoproteomics experiments, compared with 10’s to 100’s of detections of other Cas pY sites (Phosphosite). We suspect that Cas Y12 may only be phosphorylated when Src is highly active. We contacted Dr. Rosel requesting the pY12 Cas antibody used in PMID: 21937722, 28808245 and 23974298.</p><p>However, Dr. Rosel declined to send the antibody, stating that it is not very specific and partially recognizes Y12F Cas. There is no commercial source for a pY12 Cas antibody and it would be difficult for us to perform the analysis.</p><p>Functional studies implicating Y12 in signaling made use of a vector expressing wildtype or mutant GFP-mCas (mouse Cas) (Janostiak et al. 2011, PMID: 21937722; Janostiak et al. 2014, PMID: 23974298; Gemperle et al. 2017, PMID: 28808245). The Y12E mutation inhibited localization to focal adhesions and binding to FAK, PTP-PEST and vinculin. We transduced MCF10A cells with a similar retroviral construct (EYFP-mCas) in rescue experiments to control for off-target effects of Cas siRNA (see below, Reviewer 1, point 6). The kinetics of EYFP-mCas relative to mCherry-vinculin (new Figure 5 —figure supplement 2A-C) were very similar to the kinetics of Cas<sup>mSc</sup> and EYFP-vinculin (Figure 1). Moreover, the spatial distribution of EYFPmCas and mCherry-vinculin in adhesions again showed Cas distal to vinculin, as with Cas<sup>mSc</sup> and EYFP-vinculin or untagged Cas and vinculin in parental cells. If the mScarlet tagging affected Y12 phosphorylation, we would have expected Cas<sup>mSc</sup> to behave differently from EYFP-mCas or endogenous Cas. Thus we feel that it is unlikely that the tag affects Y12 phosphorylation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 1B authors show levels of Cas in the CasmSc cells. While most of the Cas in CasmSc cells is tagged, the phosphorylation pattern as shown by pY410 Ab does not replicate the pattern of the total Cas antibody, suggesting phosphorylation of the tagged Cas is substantially weaker than that of the remaining untagged Cas. Authors should provide further evidence that their tagging strategy does not influence Cas substrate domain phosphorylation and thus signalling downstream of the phosphorylated SD (such as interaction with Crk) when compared to untagged Cas.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out the unexpected low stoichiometry of phosphorylation of Cas<sup>mSc</sup> relative to untagged Cas in Figure 1B. These were not typical blots: there may have been a problem with transfer of the upper band. In most blots the phosphorylation stoichiometries of Cas and Cas<sup>mSc</sup> are equal. We have replaced the panel with blots from a more representative experiment. This result and other controls mentioned in our response to Point 1 (above) lend confidence that tagging Cas does not affect its phosphorylation or function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure 2C the authors show data points of 11 cells on Fn and 7 cells on collagen (although the legend indicates n=7-13).

There is still no significant difference in Cas-vinculin recruitment kinetics on collagen or fibronectin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, based on this data authors suggest that &quot;Cas clusters may specify localization of integrin α5β1 and α2β1 adhesions&quot;, however, this is not obvious from the data provided in this section.</p></disp-quote><p>Previous Figure 1 showed that Cas clustered in membrane regions that developed into focal adhesions when cells were plated on collagen, with a time delay between Cas clustering and vinculin recruitment of about a minute. Previous Figure 2 reported similar findings when cells were plated on fibronectin, and used blocking antibodies to show the importance of integrin α2β1 for collagen adhesion and α5β1 for fibronectin adhesion. Based on this, we speculated that Cas may specify localization of vinculin clusters. However, Cas siRNA results were not shown until later and did not use fibronectin. In response to this comment and comments from Reviewer 2, we have investigated focal adhesion assembly on different ECMs in more detail. The new results are in Figure 6 and Figure 6 —figure supplement 1. Briefly, we found that (a) Both MCF10A epithelial cells and human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) require Cas to spread and assemble focal adhesions on both collagen and fibronectin; (b) Cas clusters develop into vinculin clusters after ~1 min delay on both collagen and fibronectin, implying a similar mechanism; (c) Cas-dependent attachment to collagen and fibronectin is inhibited by integrin β1 knockdown or by α2β1-blocking antibody; (d) Cas-dependent attachment to fibronectin is inhibited by either β1 or αv knockdown or α5β1-blocking antibody. Taken together, these results suggest that Cas is required for adhesion formation through different integrin heterodimers on different ECM and in different cell types.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 3.

It would be ideal to also probe with β1 antibody. We would expect to see a single band in control cells and two bands in ITGB1<sup>GFP</sup> cells. Unfortunately, after testing two monoclonals and two rabbit antibodies, the only antibody that worked on a Western (AB1952P, Millipore) did not detect the β1-GFP fusion protein. Instead, the amount of untagged integrin β1 was decreased in ITGB1<sup>GFP</sup> cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, black arrowhead). This suggests that one allele has been tagged and is not detected by this antibody. AB1952P was raised to the C terminus of integrin β1, where the tag is attached. Rather than showing this Western, we feel that showing the cDNA sequence, the GFP blot, and GFP in focal adhesions is sufficient evidence that the gene is tagged correctly.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-90234-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 5.

Cas and vinculin antibodies were validated by immunofluorescence and Western blotting of corresponding knockdown cells (Figure 5A and B and Figure 5 —figure supplement 1A). The CrkL, paxillin, talin1, kindlin2, Yes1 and FAK antibodies were validated by Western blot of cells treated with the corresponding siRNAs (Figure 5 —figure supplements 4 and 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 6 and 7. How have the authors controlled for off-target effects of their siRNAs?</p></disp-quote><p>We have not controlled for off-target effects of siRNAs against FAK, Kindlin2 or Talin1 because they had little effect on Cas clustering and their effect on vinculin recruitment agrees with published studies. Regarding SFK siRNAs, we note that the pan-SFK allosteric inhibitor eCF506 inhibited vinculin recruitment to Cas clusters, suggesting that one or more SFKs is required. When we knocked down Src, Fyn and Yes we surprisingly found that only Yes was required, despite good knock down in all cases. We discuss the possibility that Yes has a special role based on its trafficking or preference for membrane microdomains. We did not control for off target effects of Yes siRNA but in view of the eCF506 result it seems likely that the effect of Yes siRNA is on-target.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The vinculin silencing efficacy in Figure 6 is poor and precludes making any conclusions on the role of vinculin.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that vinculin silencing is poor despite use of a double knockdown protocol (Figure 5 —figure supplement 1A). Vinculin may have a longer half life than the other proteins we studied. However, imaging shows that vinculin siRNA caused a ~50% decrease in vinculin mean intensity but no decrease in Cas intensity, while Cas siRNA caused a ~50% decrease in Cas intensity and a ~60% decrease in vinculin intensity. Thus Cas appears to be quantitatively limiting for vinculin clustering but vinculin is not limiting for Cas clustering.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 6C the authors analyse the role of Cas depletion on the regulation of Mn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent spreading. As a further control, the authors could include a rescue experiment with Cas WT and Cas lacking the CCH domain in Cas-depleted cells.</p></disp-quote><p>To control for off-target effects of Cas siRNA, we have now generated cells expressing EYFPmCas (mouse Cas) and mCherry-vinculin, treated with control or human Cas siRNA, and measured cell spread area and the number, areas and intensities of Cas-vinculin clusters in absence and presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup>. Wildtype EYFP-mCas fully rescued all effects of Cas siRNA (Figure 5 —figure supplements 2D and 5). We did not try a CCH domain mutant, but a 15F mutant, lacking the 15 YxxP phosphorylation sites, failed to rescue focal adhesion formation in the absence or presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup>. Clustering of the 15F mutant was also defective, consistent with the importance of Cas phosphorylation for clustering. These results control for off-target effects of siCas and for possible issues of use of red and green fluorophores on detection by TIRF, as well as showing the importance of Cas phosphorylation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The results in Figure 7A suggest that the interaction of Crk with phosphorylated Cas accelerates the recruitment of Vinculin to the Cas-Crk clusters. Do the authors have a mechanistic explanation of how this could be regulated?</p></disp-quote><p>Our two-step model is presented in Figure 8E and the Discussion. We propose that SFK-CasCrk/CrkL complexes first activate a Rac1 positive-feedback loop to build cluster size and incorporate inactive integrin. Cluster growth may be driven by the formation of protein networks between multiply phosphorylated Cas bridged by Crk/CrkL to proteins containing multiple SH3 binding sites, such as DOCK180. These protein networks interact with integrins through an unknown mechanism, perhaps bridged by membrane microdomains or Yes1-integrin binding. In a second step, the integrin is activated and structural components such as talin and vinculin are recruited. However, it is unclear how the transition from step 1 to step 2 is regulated. There may be lateral interactions between integrin heterodimers, membrane microdomains and other components that lead to adhesion maturation; Cas may need to be inactivated; or some kind of critical size may need to be reached for force application.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, to support this data, the authors should perform a Crk rescue experiment in Crk-depleted cells to see whether recruitment of Vinculin to Cas clusters will be rescued to control levels.</p></disp-quote><p>We have not performed the suggested rescue experiment but we have added results of single and double knockdowns of Crk and CrkL (Figure 5 —figure supplement 3A-C). Neither single knockdown had much effect but the double knockdown reduced the number, areas and intensities of Cas-vinculin clusters. This suggests functional redundancy between Crk and CrkL. If there the Crk and CrkL siRNAs have off-target effects, they would also have to be functionally redundant, which seems improbable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) In Figure 8D, the fluorescence intensity of CasmSc seems to be lower in siSOCS6 than in siCtrl cells. This is rather counterintuitive since the depletion of SOCS6 should stabilize Cas levels. Could the authors comment on this?</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 8D shows that either siSOCS6 or the Neddylation inhibitor MLN4924 shortens the time interval between Cas arrival and vinculin arrival. However, as the reviewer notes, the fluorescence intensity of Cas<sup>mSc</sup> is decreased, not increased as might be expected if Cas was less degraded. We have performed immunofluorescence and find that pY410Cas is unchanged (i.e., the pYCas/Cas ratio is increased). This is consistent with SOCS6 targeting pYCas for degradation. However, why is total Cas<sup>mSc</sup> decreased? We note that vinculin intensity also decreased. We know that siSOCS6 stimulates Cas-dependent adhesion <italic>disassembly</italic> as well as assembly (Teckchandani et al. 2016 PMC5092051). Thus we suspect that the decreased intensities of Cas and vinculin at the 30 min time point may be due to quicker turnover.</p><p>To explore this possibility further, we have re-analyzed the time-lapse imaging of Cas<sup>mSc</sup> YFP-VCL cells treated with SOCS6 siRNA (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). The time delay between Cas <italic>departure</italic> and vinculin <italic>departure</italic> is decreased when SOCS6 is depleted. Thus, faster turnover of adhesions in SOCS6-depleted cells may mean that more adhesions are undergoing disassembly when Cas and vinculin intensities were measured at the 30 min time point. We feel that fully understanding this aspect would take more analysis and prefer to leave it for follow up study.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-90234-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other points:</p><p>1) In the introduction, the authors mention the mechanoresponsive roles of talin in adhesion maturation and assembly. It would be beneficial to mention in this context also the effect of the force-mediated extension of the Cas substrate domain on its downstream signalling (PMID: 17129785, reviewed in PMID: 25062607).</p></disp-quote><p>The role of force in Cas substrate domain phosphorylation is unclear. Unlike talin, very little energy is needed to extend the Cas substrate domain and it is unlikely to be structured in cells (Hotta et al. 2014, PMID: 24722239). However, allosteric regulation may be important and we have added the Sawada paper to the Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 1 supplement 2.

The data are not normally distributed, so we calculate a median time delay (66.2 s in this cell) and variance (95% CI 21-114 s). Panel F shows the median time delays clusters in each of n=13 cells, from which mean time interval (48.08 s) and variance (SEM + 9s) can be calculated.

If on Fn – would the delay in ITGB1 arrival to Cas clusters be different on Col-I, since authors show there are more 9EG7-positive ITGB1 clusters in cells seeded on collagen (Figure 2B)?</p></disp-quote><p>All experiments in the initial submission except Figure 2 were done on collagen. We’ve expanded our studies of adhesion assembly on different ECM and moved the relevant section later in the paper. The new Figure 6 shows that both epithelial and fibroblast cells require Cas to assemble adhesions on fibronectin and collagen. Cas clusters are precursors for vinculin clusters after a similar time delay on both matrix proteins. Attachment to collagen is inhibited by β1 siRNA or α2β1-blocking antibody, but not by αv siRNA. Attachment to fibronectin is inhibited by αv or β1 siRNA or by α5β1-blocking antibody. Thus, the role of Cas in focal adhesion assembly extends to different cell types, integrins, and matrix proteins. Please also see Reviewer 2, point 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) This study is in line with previous work (PMID: 30639111), where pY410 Cas has been shown to co-localize with Crk in filopodia tips in a CCH domain-dependent manner and extends these observations to the edge of spreading/migrating MCF10A and HeLa cells. This could perhaps be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>In separate experiments, we are analyzing Cas mechanism in regulating filopodia dynamics induced by cell attachment. Since this work is unfinished, we would prefer to leave comparisons between adhesions and filopodia to a future publication.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The manuscript &quot;Cas phosphorylation regulates focal adhesion assembly&quot; by Kumar et al. investigates the role of Cas in cell spreading and finds that Cas, Crk, and FAK cluster together at the cell periphery to initiate focal adhesion formation. In contrast to the previous understanding, they suggest that Cas clustering happens before integrin clustering and hence is the initial step in adhesion formation. This notion is the key novel aspect of the study, however, it is based on the assumption that b1 integrin is the only relevant integrin in the system, which at this point is not supported by the data.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer’s main concern is that a different integrin may be present and induce Cas phosphorylation before integrin β1 is activated. However, most of our experiments were done on collagen, and, to the best of our knowledge, all collagen receptors contain β1 with various α chains. Adhesion assembly on collagen was inhibited by blocking antibody to α2β1. Therefore, we did not explore possible roles of other integrins. However, we realize that other integrins may be important during attachment to other ECM. In the revision, we have expanded our study to investigate the roles of other integrins and other ECM. We note that all integrins expressed by MCF10A cells form heterodimers with either β1 or αv, so we have used siRNA to inhibit expression of these integrins and studies cell spreading and adhesion formation. We found that collagen adhesion was inhibited by β1 but not by αv siRNA. Therefore it seems unlikely that a different integrin induces Cas phosphorylation before β1 is activated on collagen. In addition, we found that adhesion to fibronectin requires Cas, αv and β1. We have not tagged αv to follow its clustering kinetics, but immunofluorescence of spreading cells revealed β1 adhesions nearer the edge and adhesions containing both β1 and αv further back, suggesting that αv comes later. Therefore, the evidence points to Cas-dependent collagen attachment through integrins containing β1, and Cas-dependent fibronectin attachment through dimers containing αv and β1, with αv unlikely to precede β1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific comments:</p><p>– The central finding of the study (i.e. that Cas clusters before integrin) is based solely on the study of b1-integrin and hence on the assumptions that it is the only integrin that is relevant for adhesion formation in the cells used here. To this end, the authors cite work by Kulak, 2014 and Ly, 2018 that MCF10A and HELA cells express 10-fold less b3 integrin compared to b1 integrin. While b3 is indeed found at lower levels in these studies it might be a) nonetheless present at sufficient levels to initiate adhesion formation (as it was picked up by mass-spec analysis); (b) the authors discuss that b1 integrin is 10fold higher expressed compared to Cas ( based on same studies) meaning that Cas and b3 integrin would be expressed at comparable levels, further supporting point (a) above; lastly, (c) the studies by Kulak and Ly find other β-integrins at high levels – Kulak: ITGB5 and ITGB8; Ly: ITGB5, ITGB6, ITGB8, which are all RGD receptors and can complex with ITGAV which is also found at high levels in both studies, consistent with the general understanding of αvβ6 being a major fibronectin receptor in cancer cells. Mechanosensing and binding properties are different for these integrins (e.g. PMID: 24793358, 22328497), but especially the binding to Cas, or their involvement in early adhesion formation have not been characterised to my knowledge. As such the fact that Cas clusters before b1 integrin does not suggest that it is integrin independent, but might only associate with clusters of other integrins (e.g. αvβ6) that then mature into b1 integrin-containing adhesions.</p></disp-quote><p>We focused on Cas role in integrin β1 adhesion assembly because most of our experiments used cells spreading or migrating on collagen. To our knowledge, all collagen-binding integrins contain integrin β1. We confirmed β1 dependence using blocking antibody P1E6 to α2β1, which inhibited MCF10A cell adhesion to collagen (previous Figure 2A, now Figure 6 —figure supplement 2A). To further confirm the importance of integrin β1 for collagen adhesion, we have now knocked down β1 in epithelial and fibroblast cells and found that cell spreading and formation of Cas-vinculin clusters was inhibited (new Figure 6 —figure supplement 1B and C). Since other integrins are not known to bind collagen, we think it is unlikely that Cas clusters with other integrins during adhesion assembly on collagen.</p><p>We also investigated Cas role in fibronectin adhesion, where αvβ3/β6 and α5β1 may both be important. We previously reported that Cas clustering preceded vinculin clustering by a similar time delay on fibronectin as on collagen, and that attachment and spreading on fibronectin were inhibited by blocking antibody P8D4 to α5β1 (previous Figure 2, now Figure 6B and Figure 6 – supplement 2A). We now show that both epithelial and fibroblast cells require Cas, β1 and αv for attachment and spreading on fibronectin (Figure 6 – supplement 1B and C). This implies that Cas regulates assembly of adhesions containing β1 or αv (or both) on fibronectin.</p><p>Immunofluorescence of spreading cells did not reveal any αv clusters that do not also contain β1. Early β1 clusters at the edge lack αv. Therefore, it seems unlikely that an αv integrin induces Cas clustering before β1 recruitment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Apart from this central point, the authors show that phosphorylated Cas is enriched at the adhesome, knockdown of Cas leads to cell spreading and migration defects, that Cas is upstream of vinculin recruitment and that Cas is phosphorylated by Yes1, which are all points that have been described in the past. Especially, inwards movement of Cas dependent on phosphorylation: PMID 24928898; the role of Cas in spreading: PMID 10448062; also here: PMIDs 23974298, 21937722; 15817476;</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that there have been many previous studies of Cas in focal adhesions but our results shed new light on the role of Cas in adhesion assembly, which has been controversial. Previous adhesome studies were not designed to measure the proportion of a specific protein or phosphoprotein in the adhesome, just whether they were detectable. Our semi-quantitative Western blot analysis shows that pY410Cas, pY249Cas and pY861FAK are highly enriched in the adhesome fraction relative to their non-phosphorylated (or in the case of FAK, pY397 phosphorylated) forms (Figure 4 —figure supplement 4). This suggests that these phosphorylations occur locally within adhesions and are rapidly lost when Cas or FAK dissociate.</p><p>Other studies have shown that Cas is required for cell spreading and migration, but we are not aware of other studies investigating how Cas regulates adhesion assembly.</p><p>Machiyama et al. (2014) (PMID 24928898) reported that Cas molecules within adhesions sites move inwards dependent on actomyosin contraction and Cas phosphorylation and that Src-Cas dissociation is important for adhesion disassembly. They inferred that Cas may become more phosphorylated towards the inner end of an adhesion, the inverse of what we see. Honda et al. (1999) (PMID 10448062) first reported that cas-/- MEFs spread and assembled the actin cytoskeleton slowly. Janostiak et al. (2014) (PMID 23974298) and 2011 (PMID 2193772) detected direct Cas-vinculin interaction and concluded that vinculin regulates Cas localization, rather than vice versa, as we report. Sanders and Basson (2005) (PMID 15817476) showed that Cas but not paxillin knockdown inhibited Caco2 cell spreading but did not look at adhesion assembly.

The focal adhesions in vinculin-/- MEFs were smaller than in control MEFs which may have made it harder to detect co-localization of GFP-Cas against the cytoplasmic background.

Formation of tension-sensitive, αvβ3 adhesions on fibronectin requires Fyn and Cas (von Wichert et al., 2003; Kostic and Sheetz, 2006). However, our experiments were done on collagen and β3 integrins are not known to mediate adhesion to collagen. Moreover, our new siRNA experiments show that β1 but not αv is needed for Cas-dependent epithelial or fibroblast cell attachment to collagen. Together with our finding that α2β1 antibody blocks adhesion, the results suggest that Cas is working through β1 without participation by other integrins on collagen.</p><p>The situation is more complicated on fibronectin. We find that β1 siRNA or α5β1-blocking antibody inhibits Cas-dependent adhesion of epithelial cells or fibroblasts to fibronectin. However, siRNA against αv is also inhibitory, suggesting a requirement for αvβ3/6 as well as α5β1. The αv partner may be β6 in epithelial cells since β3 was not detected. The αv partner in fibroblasts may be β3, since we detected β3, αv and β1 in fibroblast focal adhesions. Thus Cas may regulate focal adhesion assembly through integrin dimers containing αv as well as β1. We have not tagged αv so do not know whether it clusters before or after Cas, but we suspect it clusters after Cas and after β1 because immunofluorescence of spreading cells shows αv adhesions further from the cell edge than β1 adhesions.</p><p>We are presently investigating how phospho-Cas/Crk clusters nucleate integrin clusters, focusing on β1. For the present paper, we hope the reviewers will agree that showing the Cas requirement for focal adhesion formation on different ECMs, through different integrins, and in two cell types, is sufficiently interesting for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
