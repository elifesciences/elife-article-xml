Muscle loss is often associated with denervation and a loss of resident muscle stem cells (satellite cells or MuSCs); however, the relationship between MuSCs and innervation has not been established. Herein, we administered severe neuromuscular trauma to a transgenic murine model that permits MuSC lineage tracing. We show that a subset of MuSCs specifically engraft in a position proximal to the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), the synapse between myofibers and motor neurons, in healthy young adult muscles. In aging and in a mouse model of neuromuscular degeneration (Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase knockout – <italic>Sod1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>), this localized engraftment behavior was reduced. Genetic rescue of motor neurons in <italic>Sod1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice reestablished integrity of the NMJ in a manner akin to young muscle and partially restored MuSC ability to engraft into positions proximal to the NMJ. Using single cell RNA-sequencing of MuSCs isolated from aged muscle, we demonstrate that a subset of MuSCs are molecularly distinguishable from MuSCs responding to myofiber injury and share similarity to synaptic myonuclei. Collectively, these data reveal unique features of MuSCs that respond to synaptic perturbations caused by aging and other stressors.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Skeletal muscle atrophy and weakness are primary features of physical frailty and are common among the elderly and patients afflicted with neuromuscular disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Marcell, 2003</xref>). The decline in the health and repair of skeletal muscle can be partially attributed to two key features. First, aging invokes decreases in number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blau et al., 2015</xref>) and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schultz and Lipton, 1982</xref>) of a population of resident stem cells called satellite cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang and Rudnicki, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shcherbina et al., 2020</xref>) or muscle stem cells (MuSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Porpiglia et al., 2017</xref>), which are the principal source of myonuclei for muscle growth and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Almada and Wagers, 2016</xref>), contributing to muscle degeneration and sarcopenia. Second, impairments in innervation and synaptic integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ham et al., 2020</xref>) between motor neurons and myofibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shi et al., 2012</xref>) become prevalent with aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jang and Van Remmen, 2011</xref>). To date, the connection between MuSCs and neuromuscular junction (NMJ) dysfunction in aging remains underexplored.</p><p>MuSCs have been shown to support the integrity of the NMJ by generating new synaptic myonuclei (SyM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liu et al., 2017</xref>), but how MuSCs sense and respond to innervation and how this behavior in old age remains poorly understood. Recent studies have shown that specific genetic depletion of MuSCs can accelerate aging-related NMJ deterioration through loss of SyM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liu et al., 2017</xref>) and reciprocally, MuSC depletion impairs the regeneration of NMJs after nerve injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). Accordingly, understanding how changes in innervation influences MuSC actions such as differentiation to become SyM can provide insight into NMJ deterioration and muscle wasting observed with aging and neurodegenerative disease.</p><p>Herein, we assessed the response of MuSCs to functional and structural changes at NMJs. We demonstrate that disruption of innervation results in fusion of a subset of MuSC-derived progenitors adjacent to NMJs. We next show that after NMJ perturbation in aged muscle, MuSCs migrate toward the NMJ but do not fuse as efficiently as in young adult mice. Single cell gene expression analysis revealed a subset of MuSCs express transcripts associated with NMJs.

We also demonstrate that a subset of MuSCs are proximal to the NMJ across lifespan, and that the MuSC response to SNT is acute, but diminished with age and neurodegeneration. The inability of MuSCs to contribute SyM in aged and <italic>Sod1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> muscle effectively leave behind a subset of progenitors expressing transcripts associated with the NMJ and are transcriptionally similar to SyM. These results are consistent with previous reports showing MuSCs in denervated muscle fail to terminally differentiate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Borisov et al., 2005a</xref>) and form smaller myotubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Macpherson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Borisov et al., 2005b</xref>).

Conversely, Schwann cells and glia also secrete multiple neurotrophic factors (<italic>glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, neurotrophin-3 and -4, nerve growth factor, and N-cadherin</italic>), and these paracrine signaling factors have been shown to influence regenerative functions of MuSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mousavi and Jasmin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hicks et al., 2018</xref>) by signaling through the <italic>ERBB3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Van Ho et al., 2011</xref>) and <italic>NGFR/p75</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Deponti et al., 2009</xref>) receptors.

While we cannot exclude that additional factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yang et al., 2021</xref>) and other cell types may also contribute to this process, our results suggest that reductions in MuSC number and attenuation of MuSC ability to fuse in aged muscle may contribute to lack of re-innervation and degenerative changes that occur at the muscle endplate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2011</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Valdez et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Degeneration of the NMJ has been shown to be a gradual process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Martineau et al., 2018</xref>), resulting from imbalances between denervation and new innervation.

First, growing evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Henriquez et al., 2008</xref>) from in vivo and in vitro models suggests that the WNT signaling family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Budnik and Salinas, 2011</xref>) plays a critical role in age-associated motor unit remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Koles and Budnik, 2012</xref>). Non-canonical WNT signaling such as from <italic>Wnt7a</italic> in motoneurons has been observed to enhance AChR clustering and promote neurite outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Messéant et al., 2017</xref>), synaptic assembly, as well as stimulate nerve terminal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hall et al., 2000</xref>) and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shen et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>Wnt7a</italic> also confers potent effects onto MuSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Le Grand et al., 2009</xref>) and promotes engraftment as well as AChR expression. How non-canonical Wnts locally contribute to MuSC actions at the synapse and change in aging requires further study. Next, aging has been observed to induce dysregulation of calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) homeostasis, and calcium-sensitive proteins such as <italic>S100β</italic> were observed to be upregulated in aged and <italic>Sod1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> MuSCs. The mechanism of dysregulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in aged MuSCs remains unresolved, but Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through mechano-sensitive cation channels or voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels may play a role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boers et al., 2018</xref>) and contribute to NMJ gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 2011</xref>) in MuSCs. In line with this and our observations of an attenuated response of MuSCs after denervation in aging, alterations in Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx has been shown to modify MyoG ability to bind and activate targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tang et al., 2004</xref>). Additionally, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced calmodulin-dependent protein kinase signaling has been observed to activate expression of genes associated with AChR clustering and NMJ formation such as <italic>Rapsn</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Further studies are required to elucidate if alterations in Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis contributes to synaptic fate development in MuSC-derived myonuclei, and how these actions are modified in age.</p><p>In summary, our results provide a new insight into MuSC support of the NMJ and innervation that is lost with old age. These results suggest new opportunities for intervention through MuSCs to maintain NMJ integrity by promoting re-innervation. We envision these insights will provide further understanding of non-regenerative muscle diseases, anti-aging models, and severe forms of trauma such as volumetric muscle loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aguilar et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">APC anti-mouse Ly-6A/E (Sca-1), clone: D7, isotype: Rat IgG2a, κ</td><td valign="top">BioLegend</td><td valign="top">BioLegend 108112; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_313349">AB_313349</ext-link></td><td valign="top">FACS (1:400)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">APC anti-mouse CD45, clone: 30-F11, isotype: Rat IgG2b, κ</td><td valign="top">BioLegend</td><td valign="top">BioLegend 103112; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_312977">AB_312977</ext-link></td><td valign="top">FACS (1:400)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">APC anti-mouse/human CD11b, clone: M1/70.

S100B-GFP mice were obtained from a breeding colony at Brown University. Two- to three-month-old Pax7<sup>CreER/+</sup> male mice were crossed with 2- to 3-month-old Rosa26<sup>mTmG/+</sup> female mice to generate Pax7<sup>CreER/+</sup>-Rosa26<sup>mTmG/+</sup> and genotyped. Two- to three-month-old Pax7<sup>CreER/+</sup> male mice were bred with mice carrying a loxP-flanked STOP cassette followed by <italic>TdTomato</italic> in the ROSA26 locus and genotyped. To activate GFP expression in the Pax7<sup>CreER/+</sup>-Rosa26<sup>mTmG/+</sup>, Pax7<sup>CreER/+</sup>-Rosa26<sup>nTnG/+</sup> mice, 4- to 6-month-old mice were administered tamoxifen (100 mg/kg body weight) through intraperitoneal injection five times (1× per day) and allowed to recover for 2–5 days. Pax7<sup>CreER/+</sup>-Rosa26<sup>TdTomato/+</sup> mice were fed with tamoxifen chow for 2 weeks prior to euthanasia to induce TdTomato expression in Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells through the Cre recombinase activity and recombination efficiency was measured at &gt;90%. All mice were fed normal chow ad libitum and housed on a 12:12 hr light-dark cycle under UM veterinary staff supervision. All procedures were approved by the University Committee on the Use and Care of Animals at UM and were in accordance with the U.S. National Institute of Health (NIH). Young female mice (4–6 months) and aged female mice (19–24 months) were randomly assigned to one of five groups: uninjured, day 3, and day 7 injured (n=4 per group). To induce skeletal muscle injury, mice were first anesthetized with 2% isoflurane and administered a 1.2% barium chloride (BaCl<sub>2</sub>) solution injected intramuscularly into several points of the TA and gastrocnemius muscles for a total of 80 µL per hind limb.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Satellite cell isolation via FACS</title><p>For tissue collection, mice were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane, then euthanized by cervical dislocation, bilateral pneumothorax, and removal of the heart. Hind limb muscles (TA and gastrocnemius) of control and experimental mice were quickly harvested using sterile surgical tools and placed in separate plastic petri dishes containing cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Using surgical scissors, muscle tissues were minced and transferred into 50 mL conical tubes containing 20 mL of digest solution (2.5 U/mL Dispase II and 0.2% [~5500 U/mL] Collagenase Type II in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium [DMEM] per mouse). Samples were incubated on a rocker placed in a 37°C incubator for 60 min with manual pipetting the solution up and down to break up tissue every 30 min using an FBS-coated 10 mL serological pipette. Once the digestion was completed, 20 mL of F10 media containing 20% heat inactivated FBS was added into each sample to inactivate enzyme activity. The solution was then filtered through a 70 µm cell strainer into a new 50 mL conical tube and centrifuged again at 350× <italic>g</italic> for 5 min. The pellets were re-suspended in 6 mL of staining media (2% heat inactivated FBS in Hank’s buffered salt solution) and divided into separate FACS tubes. The FACS tubes were centrifuged at 350× <italic>g</italic> for 5 min and supernatants discarded. The cell pellets were then re-suspended in 200 µL of staining media and antibody cocktail containing Sca-1:APC (1:400), CD45:APC (1:400), CD11b:APC (1:400), Ter119:APC (1:400), CD29/β1-integrin:PE (1:200), and CD184/CXCR-4: BIOTIN (1:100) and incubated for 30 min on ice in the dark.

Pellets were re-suspended in 200 µL staining solution containing PECy7:STREPTAVIDIN (1:100) and incubated on ice for 20 min in the dark. Again, samples were diluted in 3 mL staining solution, centrifuged, supernatants discarded, and pellets re-suspended in 200 μL staining buffer. Live cells were sorted from the suspension via addition of 1 µg of propidium iodide stain into each experimental sample and all samples were filtered through 70 μm cell strainers before the FACS. Cell sorting was done using a BD FACS Aria III Cell Sorter (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and APC negative, PE/PECy7 double-positive MuSCs were sorted into staining solution for immediate processing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Single cell mRNA sequencing</title><p>Freshly isolated MuSCs were sorted into staining solution, enumerated by hemocytometer, and re-suspended into PBS.

Myofibers were purified by conventional collagenase digestion and trituration with fire polished glass pipettes as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zammit et al., 2004</xref>). Briefly, the EDL muscle was dissected, rinsed in Dulbecco’s PBS, put into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube containing 1 mL 0.1% type I collagenase (Invitrogen) and 0.1% type II collagenase (Invitrogen) in DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), incubated in a shaker water bath at 37°C for 75 min and gently mixed by inversion periodically. Following digestion, the muscle was transferred to 100 mm × 15 mm plastic petri dishes containing 10 mL of plating media (10% horse serum in DMEM) using fire-polished-tip Pasteur pipettes. Under a stereo dissecting microscope, single myofibers were released by gently triturating the EDL with a series of modified Pasteur pipettes that varied in tip diameter to accommodate the progressive decrease in muscle trunk size. Inseparable fibers and debris were removed. Purified single myofibers were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 3 min, washed with PBS, and transferred to 5 mL polystyrene cell collection tubes for GFP, Pax7 and BTX immunofluorescence. The percentage of myofibers that had nGFP+ myonuclei at NMJs was enumerated. Images were acquired using a Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 or LSM 780 confocal microscope. n=5 muscles (3 males and 2 females) for each injury type, and 20–30 myofibers were counted per muscle. Routs analysis was used to identify outliers and one data point was excluded. Two-sided two-sample Student’s t-test was used, and groups were determined statistically significantly different (p = 0.0012, difference between means = 16.5925, 95% confidence interval = (9.0802, 24.1048), t = 5.2228, 7 degrees of freedom).

FACS-enriched MuSCs were then seeded at a density of 10,000 cells/well and allowed to adhere for 45 min in staining buffer at RT. After adhering to the cover slide, staining buffer was aspirated and cells were fixed with 4% PFA in PBS at RT for 20 min. PFA was aspirated and after three quick washes with PBS, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% TritonX-100 and blocked with 1% BSA, 0.1% Tween-20, and 22.52 mg/mL glycine in PBS. After blocking, cells were incubated with primary antibodies (1:500 dilution of anti-S100B, 1:10 dilution of anti-Pax7, 1:200 dilution of anti-MyoD) overnight at 4°C followed by secondary antibodies (1:300 dilution of AF555 anti-mouse, 1:300 dilution of AF647 anti-rabbit) overnight at 4°C. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (1.5 μg/mL) in PBS for 1 min at RT. Immunolabeled cells were imaged on a Zeiss epifluorescent microscope using a 10× objective. Single and double-positive cells were manually counted to calculate abundances. n=483 cells from young mice (94.4% Pax7<sup>+</sup>, 2.5% Pax7<sup>+</sup>S100β<sup>+</sup>) and n=880 cells from aged mice (92.5% Pax7<sup>+</sup>, 15.9% Pax7<sup>+</sup>S100β<sup>+</sup>), both sorted separately from two animals and immunostained in triplicate. Statistical comparison between groups was performed using two-sided, two-proportion z-test, where p-values less than 0.05 were considered significant. No significant difference was observed among Pax7<sup>+</sup> proportions between young and aged mice (z = 1.33, p = 0.1826), but the proportion of Pax7<sup>+</sup>S100β<sup>+</sup> cells was significantly different (z = −7.56, p = 4.16×10<sup>−14</sup>). Further, no significant difference was observed in Pax7 expression among sorted young and sorted SOD1<sup>-/-</sup> MuSCs (z = −0.87, p = 0.3846).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Sciatic nerve transection</title><p>Mice were anesthetized by inhalation of 1–3% isoflurane. The hindquarter was then carefully shaved, and depilation completed with generic Nair hair removal cream. The skin was wiped three times with chlorhexidine and 70% alcohol. Then a small skin incision (&lt;10 mm) was made 1 mm posterior and parallel to the femur, and the biceps femoris was bluntly split to expose the sciatic nerve. On the left leg, 1–2 mm sciatic nerve was then transected 5 mm proximal to its trifurcation, followed with realignment of the distal and proximal nerve ends and closure of the incision with wound clips (Autoclip, BD Clay Adams, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Sham surgery was performed on the contralateral leg where procedures were performed without nerve transection. Mice were given analgesic (0.5–1.0 mg/kg buprenorphine) and allowed to recover on a heating pad. The wound clips were removed 14 days after the SNT surgery. SNTs of S100-GFP mice were performed at Brown University. For these experiments, young adult (6 months of age), female S100β-GFP mice were deeply anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine intraperitoneal injection (10 mg xylazine and 90 mg ketamine per kg body weight). After anesthesia, a small animal trimmer and depilatory cream was used to remove the fur on one leg, the surgical site was disinfected with 70% ethanol, and a small skin incision was made. The sciatic nerve from one leg was cut near the hip and the incision closed with 4–0 nonfilament sutures. Analgesia (0.5–1 mg buprenorphine per kg body weight) was administered at time of anesthesia. The contralateral leg was left unoperated for each mouse. The TA and EDL muscles were harvested from injured and uninjured legs 28 days later for histological analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Single myofiber MuSC analysis</title><p>For nGFP localization, myofibers were purified by conventional collagenase digestion and trituration with fire polished glass pipettes as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>).

Purified single myofibers were fixed with 4% PFA for 3 min, washed with PBS and transferred to 5 mL polystyrene cell collection tubes for nGFP, Pax7, and AChR immunofluorescence.</p><p>For MuSC, NMJ, and myonuclear imaging from Pax7-TdTomato mice, myofibers were isolated from the periphery of the TA muscle. TAs were first fixed in anatomical position with 4% PFA, and fiber bundles were mechanically separated for immunostaining. Antibodies used for immunostaining included Hoechst 33342 (Life Technologies H3570) for nuclei, phalloidin conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647 (Thermo Fisher Scientific A22287) for F-actin, α-bungarotoxin conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific B13422) for α-AChR, and S100b (Thermo Fisher Scientific PA5-78161). Following immunostaining, single myofibers were carefully mechanically separated under a dissecting stereoscope using fine forceps; 20–30 myofibers were collected from each muscle for imaging and analysis, with a biological sample size of four mice per group. Myonuclei were identified as subsynaptic myonuclei if the nucleus was in direct contact with the post-synaptic AChR endplate. MuSCs were considered near the NMJ if they were within 250 µm of the NMJ. At least 20 NMJs were assessed per muscle, with four mice per group. 3D reconstructed MuSCs were created by taking z-stack images at 1 µm intervals on a Zeiss 700 Confocal Microscope. 3D renderings were generated using Volocity and voxel intensities were quantified on ImageJ.</p><p>For Pax7 and NMJ staining from S100B-GFP mice, freshly dissected TA muscles were separated into fiber bundles along the periphery of the muscle. Fiber bundles were pinned into petri dishes containing PDMS at the myotendinous junctions and treated with 0.02% collagenase type II at 37°C for 10 min to break up connective tissue and extracellular matrix. Pinned fiber bundles were then fixed with 4% PFA at RT for 5 min, then 1% SDS at RT for 15 min and citrate buffer (10 mM sodium citrate, 0.05% Tween-20, pH 6.0) at 37°C for 1 hr in order to retrieve antigens. Fiber bundles were unpinned and placed in 1.5 mL tubes with blocking buffer for two nights, mouse IgG (1:500) for 2 hr, Pax7 antibody (1:100) for three nights, and anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:250) as well as BTX for 2 hr, with 30 min PBS washing between all staining steps. Single myofibers were mechanically isolated using forceps and placed on slides with DAPI-containing mounting media for imaging. Cells were considered S100B+ if they co-expressed DAPI and S100B, and cells that co-expressed DAPI, S100B, and Pax7 were considered S100B+/Pax7+. We measured the Euclidean distance of at least 70 S100B+ cells from the NMJ in both young control and young SNT single muscle fibers to generate a distribution of distances of S100B+ and S100B+/Pax7+ cells from the NMJ.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization</title><p>MuSCs were enriched by FACS as described above and seeded onto 96-well glass bottom dishes (Greiner Sensoplate, Sigma, M4187-16EA) coated with 22.4 μg/mL CellTak.

The CellRanger count command was run with default parameters with the exception of the --<monospace>expect-cells</monospace> parameter which was set at 10,000. Filtered feature barcode data from all samples in HDF5 matrix format, both locally generated datasets and public 24-month TMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tabula Muris Consortium and Almanzar, 2020</xref>) datasets, were imported directly into LIGER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Welch et al., 2019</xref>) objects using the read10X import method. Only cells with a minimum of 300 genes expressed were retained during import. All cell counts provided in the main manuscript text are post-filtering counts. Seventeen datasets were generated in this manner: uninjured C57BL/6 WT female mice both young (3–4 months) and aged (20–24 months) datasets (seven datasets), and aged datasets at days 3 and 7 post injury (two datasets); Sod1<sup>-/-</sup> and SynTgSod1<sup>-/-</sup> rescue mouse datasets (3); public 24-month-old TMS skeletal muscle (2) datasets.

Five public bulk RNA-Seq datasets were aligned using Kallisto (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bray et al., 2016</xref>) and imported into R using tximport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Soneson et al., 2016</xref>). Transcript IDs were annotated with gene names using EnsDb.Mmusculus.v79, then samples were imported into DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Love et al., 2014</xref>) for differential expression analysis with design = ~celltype. Genes were filtered based on expression in at least five cells, and differential expression analysis was otherwise performed using default parameters. Volcano plots were generated using the R package EnhancedVolcano.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>RNA velocity analysis</title><p>CellRanger v3.1 (10× Genomics) was used to process raw data. The CellRanger count command was run with default parameters with the exception of the --<monospace>expect-cells parameter</monospace> which was set at 10,000. Loom files were generated from the CellRanger ‘outs’ folders using the velocyto (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">La Manno et al., 2018</xref>) run10x function with the CellRanger mm10 v3.0.0 genome annotation file. Loom files were imported into Seurat objects with the ReadVelocity and as.Seurat functions from the SeuratWrapper package. Five datasets were generated this way, including two uninjured WT aged (22–26 months) datasets, one aged dataset from each of 3 and 7 dpi, and one public dataset from age-matched (24 months) myonuclei. Datasets were aggregated using the Seurat merge function, followed by normalization and identification of variable features separately by dataset. Batch effects were corrected for using CCA (canonical correlation analysis) with the FindIntegrationAnchors (dims = 1:10, k.filter = 50, anchor.features = 5000) followed by IntegrateData Seurat functions. Integrated data was scaled, and dimension reduction was performed using PCA and UMAP with the first 30 dimensions. SNN graphs and cell clusters were generated from the PCA-reduced data. The MuSC, myonuclei, and NMJ clusters were subset, followed by further subsetting of the NMJ cluster to obtain only NMJ cells expressing Pax7, and re-merging and integrating (anchor.features = 2000, dims = 1:20) the Pax7+ NMJ cells with the MuSCs and myonuclei. Data scaling and dimensional reduction (dims = 1:30), and clustering (resolution = 0.5) were repeated before exporting to an h5ad file with the SaveH5Seurat and Convert functions.</p><p>In Jupyter-notebook, the h5ad file was read into an scVelo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bergen et al., 2020</xref>) AnnData object. Neighbors and moments were re-computed, followed by the velocities and velocity graph using default parameters. The velocity connection graph was generated with a threshold of 0.35.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Daniel Vincenz for assistance with artwork, the UM DNA Sequencing Core for assistance with single cell sequencing library preparation, Doug Millay for the single nuclei RNA sequencing datasets, Alex Shalek for critical advice regarding the single cell sequencing and data processing, Josh Welch for insights into bioinformatics analysis, Xia Jiang for technical assistance and members of the Aguilar, Brooks, and Jang laboratories.

and disease. It contributes to understanding the dynamics at the neuromuscular junction and associated nearby stem cells, which could lead to new therapeutics as well as improve our basic understanding of aging and neuromuscular diseases. Overall this paper identifies a potentially new subtype of muscle stem cell with potential to improve our ability to modulate or study muscle stem cell changes in neurodegenerative diseases or aging.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Muscle Stem Cell Response to Perturbations of the Neuromuscular Junction Are Attenuated With Aging&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Matt Kaeberlein as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors show that MuSCs near the NMJ adopt a modified phenotype during ageing and in Sod1 mutant model of neuromuscular degeneration. The main findings reported in this study are the following:</p><p>1) While total number of MuSCs was reduced in aged mice, NMJ-proximal MuSCs were comparable in young and aged mice. Synaptic myonuclei were also comparable in young and aged mice; 2) Muscle denervation induced by sciatic nerve transection (SNT) resulted in recruitment of MuSCs to the NMJ more efficiently in young than in aged mice; 3) scRNA-seq of MuSCs obtained from uninjured young and aged mice revealed expression of genes, such as Cadm1, Rapsn, and S100beta associated with neurite growth, NMJ maintenance, and repair in aged MuSCs; 4) Muscle injury induced a gene expression program distinct from that caused by muscle denervation; 5) scRNA-seq of MuSCs derived from superoxide dismutase Sod1-/- mice revealed commonalities between Sod1-/- and aged MuSCs gene programs; 6) Rescue experiments with synapsin driven Sod1 in motoneurons confirms the crosstalk between motoneuron, MuSC and synaptic myonuclei.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Although the study is interesting and the experiments well done, the manuscript is difficult to read. Adding a scheme that recapitulates the main results and the interactions between MuSC near the NMJ to illustrate the crosstalk between these different cell types would be helpful.</p><p>2) Supp Figure 1 and Figure 2. Aged mice have a 40% decrease in the overall number of MuSCs, compared to young mice. However, young and aged mice have a similar percentage of NMJ-proximal MuSCs, indicating a selective sparing of NMJ-proximal MuSC depletion in aged mice. Provided non-proximal NMJ MuSCs will migrate to the NMJ after SNT, it is expected that aged mice, having less non-proximal NMJ MuSCs that young mice, would accumulate less NMJ-proximal MuSCs. In Figure 2C, the percentage of MuSCs near NMJ is more in aged than in young. The authors should comment on these observations.</p><p>3) Figure 1D legend is mislabeled.</p><p>4) Figure 2- regarding the PAX7 cells near NMJs in young versus old stain with typical SC markers, are they quiescent or activated or myoblasts etc? How does this change +/- SNT?</p><p>5) Supp. Figure 2. Differentially expressed genes in the seven cell clusters should be reported.</p><p>6) Supp. Figure 2E Pax7+/S100b+ cells should be quantified.</p><p>7) Figure 3. What are the absolute expression levels for S100b, Rapsn, Chodl and other transcripts detected in aged non-MuSC and MuSC clusters? A minority of cells in the NMJ cluster expresses Pax7, Myf5, and Rapsn whereas S100b transcripts are detected in the vast majority of the cells (Figure 3D). Since the NMJ cluster derives from FACS-isolated MuSCs, what is the identity of S100b+/Pax7-/ cells?</p><p>8) The figure legend of Figure 3C is unclear – why are data from FACS in aged animals different from scRNA-seq aged data: it seems from the legend that the same cell population was compared either by IF or by RNA-seq. This should be better explained in the text. The differences observed are not clear; the sentence &quot;largest non-MuSCs cluster of FACS sorted MuSCs &quot;is confusing. Also, indicate clearly that the NMJ reclustering of Figure 3D was done with aged FSM (please change Sup 2F for 2E, and Sup 2E for 2D/rapsn).</p><p>9) Since the % of Pax7+S100B + observed in old mice is around 16%, and the % of SC near the NMJ in old mice 4%, does this mean that SCs outside the NMJ express S100B?</p><p>10) Do the Pax7+S100Beta+ SCs also express activated markers (MYF5, MYOD, MYOG) greater than Pax7+S100Beta- SCs ?</p><p>11) Stainings and qPCR with other SC markers in the Pax7+S100Beta subset should be included to confirm this subset is a true SC and not another lineage and validate sequencing data.</p><p>12) Conversely, are there other schwann cell markers expressed in the Pax7+S100Beta+ subset via IF or qPCR?</p><p>13) Figure 3E: Have cells from young animals been compared to cells from old animals? Please clarify.</p><p>14) Figure 3E. Is S100b present in the NMJ-associated stem cell transcripts?</p><p>15) In Figure 4B, what does the NMJ cluster in black represent: NMJ myonuclei as written? So, why does the RNA velocity not connect MuSCs with NMJ myonuclei?</p><p>16) In Figure 5d. The legend to the experiments described in Figure 5D reads: &quot; D) UMAP dimensional reduction of FACS-isolated MuSCs (FSMs) from young and aged WT mice…..&quot;. The UMAP reported in Figure5d identifies clusters assigned to MuSCs, Immune, Endo, MSC, SMC, and other cells types. Please explain how cell lineages (immune, smooth muscle, endothelial cells) other than MuSCs were FACS-purified using a scheme designed to selectively purify MuSCs? There is no overlap or contiguity between MuSCs and NMJ (and other cell types) indicating sharply distinct transcriptomes of different clusters.</p><p>17) Is Sod1 only expressed in motoneurons or also in their associated Schwann cells in the SynTgSod1model?</p><p>18) A better integration of the data from the two models, aging and Sod 1 -/-, should be included to decipher similarities/differences in these two models with regard to SC behavior.</p><p>19) What portion of the aged mice have similar defects in MNs or at the NMJ? In other words, how similar are the models?</p><p>20) The authors should comment on the mechanism/s by which MuSCs turn on NMJ transcripts. Are they acquired over time or immediately upon injury? Do they stay on or change over time?</p><p>21) The small letters of the names of the genes in Figure 5F are difficult to read.</p><p>22) Do the authors think that MuSCs near the NMJ stay in their initial location without moving along the myofiber in both young and old animals?</p><p>23) Is the Pax7+S100B+ phenotype of MuSC a transient state, or could it represent a signature of specialized MuSC?</p><p>24) Expansion ex vivo of Pax7+S100B-GFP+ MuSC should be performed to test the possibility that these myogenic stem cells have acquired the specific identity of NMJ MuSC.</p><p>25) In the genetic rescue of motor neurons in Sod1-/- mice, what is percentage of MN rescue seen when MN are provided, and is there a threshold effect?</p><p>26) If Pax7+S100Beta+ cells are lost or blocked in either model, does this alter rescue effects? In other words, is it responsible in part for phenotypes in models or bystander?</p><p>27) It has been proposed that a specific class of fibroblasts near the tips of the myofiber can acquire a myogenic identity and contribute to muscle growth (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.20.211342v1, https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.20.213199v1). Can the authors exclude the possibility that Schwann cells that share many common expressed genes with NMJ MuSC could be reprogrammed to adopt a myogenic fate at the NMJ, or vice versa?</p><p>28) Kimmel et al. (Development 2020) have reported that the transcriptomes of young and old MuSCs are hardly distinguishable. How do the MuSCs transcriptomes reported in this study compare with those reported by Kimmel et al.?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Murine Muscle Stem Cell Response to Perturbations of the Neuromuscular Junction Are Attenuated With Aging&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Matt Kaeberlein as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and two of the original reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1) Please specify whether the myofiber atrophy observed after SNT is linked to definitive muscle denervation, or if the SNT allows the re-innervation of the muscles during the 28 days following injury. In the first case, the accretion of SC near the NMJ may act to counteract the expected muscle atrophy following denervation (leading to denervated myofibers with an increased number of myonuclei), while in the second case the presence of newly accreted myonuclei near the NMJ could reflect a late re-innervation process.</p><p>The authors should explain this when presenting the SNT model used to alleviate ambiguities. Furthermore the re-innervation process is more impaired in old and Sod1-/- animals, which could lead to the decreased SyM observed. If this is the case, SNT should lead to a more severe muscle atrophy in old animals than in young animals; this should be referenced and discussed.</p><p>Concerning the Figure 1C: the authors should establish the number of myonuclei in the myofiber 28 days after nerve injury: from their picture there is a massive fusion of SC (Pax7-nGFP); It is quite unexpected that during atrophy induced by nerve section, there is such an increase of new myonuclei: please indicate their number.</p><p>The authors need to discuss nerve regrowth in their 28 days SNT paradigm Specifically, it important to indicate that this increase of new synaptic myonuclei is due to nerve regrowth.</p><p>2) In figure 2D, why is the myofiber around the NMJ after SNT not Tomato+ (accretion of SC expressing TdTomato), while Synaptic myonuclei (SyM) are GFP+ in Figure 1C? The authors write (line 135) that tamoxifen was administered after SNT, but no information concerning when tamoxifen was administered is provided: 1 day after SNT? 25 days after SNT? Please clarify.</p><p>3) Probes used to detect PolyA RNA (Figure 3E) are not indicated.</p><p>4) In Figure 3D, could the authors add a three color (Young/Tabula Muris/Aged) re-clustered UMAP diagram, to better identify Tabula Muris/young/aged Nrn1+ and S100b + cells?</p><p>5) Legend of Figure 3 Sup 2A: &quot;…not enough Pax7+S100B+ (young?) cells were captured…was young was omitted in the legend?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.66749.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Although the study is interesting and the experiments well done, the manuscript is difficult to read.

We agree that since aged mice have less MuSCs overall, we anticipated less would accumulate near the NMJ after nerve injury when compared to young MuSCs. However, we found the opposite behavior and attribute this variation to changes in the ability of young MuSCs to engraft into synaptic myonuclei compared to aged MuSCs. We enumerated synaptic myonuclei for both young and aged muscles and observed a statistically significant increase in the number of synaptic myonuclei for young muscle compared to aged. We elaborate further in the discussion on possible mechanisms that inhibit aged MuSCs from differentiating compared to young MuSCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 1D legend is mislabeled.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been amended and the correct label added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 2 – regarding the PAX7 cells near NMJs in young versus old stain with typical SC markers, are they quiescent or activated or myoblasts etc? How does this change +/- SNT?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful question. In our Pax7-tdTomato model, we administered tamoxifen chow 2 weeks following the SNT injury, which is after most MuSCs typically undergo activation and differentiation following a denervation injury (Borisov et al., 2005 and reference 44). This allowed us to visualize and quantify MuSCs expressing Pax7<sup>+</sup> 28 days following SNT, rather than MuSC progeny that had already undergone myogenesis. We performed immunostaining for MyoD on myofibers after SNT and did not observe appreciable expression above background. This result indicates that these MuSCs are quiescent satellite cells. In further support of these cells being quiescent, several studies have established that exposure to neurotrophic factors such as GDNF (Li et al. 2019 and reference 62) and BDNF (Mousavi et al. 2006 and reference 58) inhibits MuSC differentiation. This is discussed further in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Supp. Figure 2.

The quantifications for these images are in Figure 3c, and we have amended the figure captions of Figures 3c, 5e, and Figure 2 – Supp. Figure 2b and Figure 5 – Supp. Figure 2a to reflect this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 3. What are the absolute expression levels for S100b, Rapsn, Chodl and other transcripts detected in aged non-MuSC and MuSC clusters? A minority of cells in the NMJ cluster expresses Pax7, Myf5, and Rapsn whereas S100b transcripts are detected in the vast majority of the cells (Figure 3D). Since the NMJ cluster derives from FACS-isolated MuSCs, what is the identity of S100b+/Pax7-/ cells?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point brought up by the reviewer. To further validate the absolute expression levels of several synaptic genes in MuSCs, we have performed single molecule RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (smRNA-FISH) on FACS isolated MuSCs from young and aged muscle and observed excellent agreement with our sequencing data. This data is shown in a new Figure 3F and Figure 3 – Supp. Figure 2D. We have also modified Figure 3 – Supp. Figure 2 and added a new supplemental figure (Figure 3 – Supp. Figure 2C) that further details the expression of synaptic-associated genes in the NMJ and MuSC clusters for both MuSCs and non-MuSCs in the NMJ cluster (defined by cells that express Pax7 as MuSCs and cells that do not express Pax7 as non-MuSCs). We comment in the manuscript that we believe other cells in the NMJ cluster are most likely Schwann cells and/or glia.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The figure legend of Figure 3C is unclear – why are data from FACS in aged animals different from scRNA-seq aged data: it seems from the legend that the same cell population was compared either by IF or by RNA-seq. This should be better explained in the text. The differences observed are not clear; the sentence &quot;largest non-MuSCs cluster of FACS sorted MuSCs &quot;is confusing. Also, indicate clearly that the NMJ reclustering of Figure 3D was done with aged FSM (please change Sup 2F for 2E, and Sup 2E for 2D/rapsn).</p></disp-quote><p>We are very appreciative of the reviewer for bringing this to our attention. The stacked bar graphs in Figure 3c are comparing scRNA-Seq quantification and IF quantification of Pax7+ and Pax7+S100b+ cells among FACS enriched MuSCs from young and aged tissues. We have modified the x-axis labels on the figure as well as the descriptions of the results in the text. Additionally, we have re-worded the text to clarify that the majority of FSMs that did not cluster with the MuSC cluster instead clustered with cells expressing NMJ transcripts. Differences between IF and scRNA-Seq quantifications could be the result of differences in mRNA vs protein expression, and/or transcript abundance. Lastly, NMJ re-clustering was done with the entire NMJ cluster, and thus has both aged and young FACS enriched MuSCs. Since more aged FACS enriched MuSCs clustered with the original NMJ cluster, they are over-represented in the NMJ re-clustering compared to young FACS enriched MuSCs. We have clarified this in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Since the % of Pax7+S100B + observed in old mice is around 16%, and the % of SC near the NMJ in old mice 4%, does this mean that SCs outside the NMJ express S100B?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this to our attention. In our initial quantification of 4% MuSCs near the NMJ, we used stringent criteria to define “near” the NMJ as within 50 µm. However, we have quantified the data again using more representative criteria of MuSCs that can interact with the NMJ by considering MuSCs within 250 µm as near the NMJ or within the middle region of the myofiber. With this quantification, we observed approximately 18% of MuSCs in aged mice as near the NMJ. Furthermore, we performed immuno-staining for Pax7 on S100B-GFP myofibers isolated from young mice (6 months), and observed that the majority of S100B-expressing cells and all of the S100B<sup>+</sup>/Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells are localized near the NMJ prior to SNT. Following SNT, we observed most S100B+ and S100B<sup>+</sup>/Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells were still near the NMJ, but also a fraction of cells along the length of the myofiber, which is consistent with the known role of Schwann cells to guide regenerating axons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Do the Pax7+S100Beta+ SCs also express activated markers (MYF5, MYOD, MYOG) greater than Pax7+S100Beta- SCs ?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this excellent point. In the new Figure 3 – Supp. Figure 2A, we have quantified the expression level of myogenic markers for the Pax7+S100Beta+ MuSCs and Pax7+S100Beta- MuSCs and they are approximately comparable in expression level. We note however that these MuSCs were FACS isolated and the isolation of MuSCs by FACS will induce some level of activation (Machado et al. Cell Reports 2017 and van Velthoven et al., Cell Reports 2017).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Stainings and qPCR with other SC markers in the Pax7+S100Beta subset should be included to confirm this subset is a true SC and not another lineage and validate sequencing data.</p></disp-quote><p>We are very appreciative for this comment from the reviewer. To further validate a subset of aged MuSCs express synaptic transcripts, we performed smRNA-FISH on FACS isolated MuSCs. We observed expression of Pax7 at a similar level to other smFISH experiments (Kann, A., et al. Develop. 146, dev179259, 2020). Next, we quantified a subset of synaptic transcripts in young and aged MuSCs and observed SynCam (Cadm1), Rapsyn (Rapsn), Neuritin 1 (Nrn1) and Cholinergic Receptor Nicotinic Alpha 1 Subunit (Chrna1) were expressed at approximately comparable levels to those observed with our sequencing data (R=0.88). These cells also expressed MyoD1, indicating these cells are myogenic, and strongly expressed Fos, which is associated with activated MuSCs. Thus, this subset of cells express both markers of myogenic progenitors and synaptic transcripts. However, as noted above these MuSCs were FACS isolated, which induces activation.

We did not recover enough Pax7+S100b+ cells from young mice to do an appropriate comparison to aged Pax7+S100b+ cells.

We have added additional plots in Figure 3 – Supp. Figure 2C whereby NMJ cells were split based on Pax7 expression, and the expression of MuSC specific genes, co-expressed genes, including S100b, and Schwann cell specific genes was compared. We have also added two lines in the results on these observations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) In Figure 4B, what does the NMJ cluster in black represent: NMJ myonuclei as written? So, why does the RNA velocity not connect MuSCs with NMJ myonuclei?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. The NMJ cluster in black in Figure 4B (now Figure 5B) corresponds to cells that express NMJ-associated genes and Pax7 (Pax7+S100B+). The yellow cells in that cluster also express both NMJ-associated genes, but were captured in the snRNA-Seq dataset rather than the scRNA-Seq datasets. We have amended the cluster labels to further clarify this.</p><p>The RNA velocity trajectories do not connect the main MuSC cluster to the NMJ-Pax7+ cluster because of differences in the transcriptional landscape and splicing kinetics compared to the main MuSC and myonuclei clusters. Velocity-inferred cell connections are shown in Figure 4 – Supp. Figure 1 and do connect the MuSC cluster to the NMJ cells, though the connections are sparse compared to cell-cell connections within the MuSC cluster, reflecting this discrepancy in transcriptional profiles and splicing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) In Figure 5d. The legend to the experiments described in Figure 5D reads: &quot; D) UMAP dimensional reduction of FACS-isolated MuSCs (FSMs) from young and aged WT mice…..&quot;. The UMAP reported in Figure 5d identifies clusters assigned to MuSCs, Immune, Endo, MSC, SMC, and other cells types. Please explain how cell lineages (immune, smooth muscle, endothelial cells) other than MuSCs were FACS-purified using a scheme designed to selectively purify MuSCs? There is no overlap or contiguity between MuSCs and NMJ (and other cell types) indicating sharply distinct transcriptomes of different clusters.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point brought up by the reviewer and we have clarified this point in the text. Briefly, we used the Tabula Muris Senis limb muscle datasets from 24-month-old mice, which contained all mononucleated cells, to identify cells that were enriched using FACS and underwent scRNA-Seq but did not cluster with MuSCs. We posited that cells that were enriched with FACS and that do not cluster with the MuSCs were likely impurities that resulted from the FACS enrichment. To confirm our FACS enrichment of cells was not enriching other cell lineages, we immuno-stained and imaged FACS enriched cells for Pax7 in injured muscle. We observed ~95% of cells from the young muscle and ~90% of cells from the aged muscle express Pax7, which is consistent with previous reports that these markers isolate MuSCs (Maesner et al. Skeletal Muscle 6, 2016). These results are quantified in Figure 3C, and are consistent with the fraction of FACS enriched MuSCs that cluster with MuSCs profiled with scRNA-Seq. After 3 days post muscle injury with BaCl<sub>2</sub> injection, we observed 90.6% of FACS enriched cells and underwent scRNA-Seq cluster with MuSCs. After 7 days post muscle injury with BaCl<sub>2</sub> injection, we observed 94.6% of FACS enriched cells and underwent scRNA-Seq cluster with MuSCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) Is Sod1 only expressed in motoneurons or also in their associated Schwann cells in the SynTgSod1model?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment.

We performed an additional differential gene expression analysis comparing the MuSC scRNA-Seq cluster across datasets (young, aged, knockout and rescue) and have included it in Figure 5 – Supp. Figure 1e. Clustering analysis (BuildClusterTree) of the different models (Young, Aged, Sod1-/-, and SynTgSod1-/-) using all highly variable genes showed Aged and Sod1-/- MuSCs are transcriptionally the most similar, followed by SynTgSod1-/-, and Young MuSCs are the most transcriptionally distinct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). This is in line with the partial rejuvenation that we observed in SynTgSod1-/- NMJs compared to Sod1-/- NMJs. Both aged and Sod1-/- MuSCs displayed enrichments in stress response genes (Gadd45a, Jund) associated with muscle atrophy, as to where young MuSCs displayed more of an activated expression profile (Myod1, Fosl1). The SynTgSod1-/- MuSCs were enriched for genes associated with ribosomal activity and protein translation (Rack1, Nop53, Eef1g).</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Dendrogram of transcriptional similarity across models.</title><p>SOD1.KO: SOD1-/-, SOD1.Rescue: SynTgSod1-/-.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-66749-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19) What portion of the aged mice have similar defects in MNs or at the NMJ? In other words, how similar are the models?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this question. In our revised Figure 2 – Supp. Figure 1, we show quantification of NMJ fragmentation and structure in young and aged mice. We observed young and aged mice contained approximately similar numbers of post-synaptic myonuclei, and synaptic area and volume. However, aged NMJs were observed with increased fragmentation of acetyl choline receptors (AChRs, new Figure 2 – Supp. Figure 1e). These results indicate some similarity between the two models but increased NMJ degeneration in aged muscles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>20) The authors should comment on the mechanism/s by which MuSCs turn on NMJ transcripts. Are they acquired over time or immediately upon injury? Do they stay on or change over time?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. In our revised manuscript, we have performed additional analysis testing the hypothesis that MuSCs increase expression of NMJ-associated transcripts through chronic exposure to signaling that is normally restricted to the synapse such as from Schwann cells. We used a young (6 months) murine model that contains a fluorescent reporter for S100β (S100β–GFP, Figure 6a) and harvested uninjured myofibers/myobundles as well as 28 days after sciatic nerve transection from TA muscles (Figure 6b). We observed an increase in the number of <italic>S100β<sup>+</sup></italic> cells outside of nerve terminals after SNT, which was consistent with the known role of Schwann cells to guide regenerating axons. We also observed an increase in the number of Pax7+/S100β+ cells and these were co-localized with Pax7-/S100β+ cells indicating enhanced interactions between MuSCs and Schwann cells occur as a result of denervation. We speculate that the increase in expression of synaptic transcripts in MuSCs may be the result of increased exposure to neurotrophins. In further support of this, our datasets which are consistent with others (Hicks et al. Nature Cell Biol. 2018, Mousavi et al. J. Neurosci. 2006), show the subset of MuSCs that express synaptic transcripts also showed increased expression of neurotrophic receptors such as ERBB3 and NGFr (Figure 6 – Supp. Figure 1D). We hypothesize that the development of this fate does not occur immediately but rather in a gradual manner. This is due to our scRNA-Seq datasets after muscle injury, which do not show acquisition of a synaptic fate after 7 days. We comment further on these results in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>21) The small letters of the names of the genes in Figure 5F are difficult to read.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing this out. We have increased the text size for this figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>22) Do the authors think that MuSCs near the NMJ stay in their initial location without moving along the myofiber in both young and old animals?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point brought up by the reviewer. Previous research on MuSCs in vivo with intravital imaging (Webster et al. Cell Stem Cell 2016) has shown that MuSCs are immobile prior to injury. We do not have experimental results to show in uninjured muscle that MuSCs migrate towards the NMJ niche or are restrained from movement along a myofiber near the NMJ. We speculate that MuSCs would be drawn to the NMJ niche from trophic factors produced locally by Schwann cells, glia, and myonuclei such as glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT3), nerve growth factor (NGF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). We have not validated this hypothesis yet, and will test this further in future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>23) Is the Pax7+S100B+ phenotype of MuSC a transient state, or could it represent a signature of specialized MuSC?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank for the reviewer for this comment. We did not observe appreciable expression of S100B in the primary MuSC cluster generated through scRNA-Seq before or after muscle injury (Figure 3 – Supp. Figure 2a) and only observed S100B expression in NMJ associated cells. Thus, we hypothesize the population of MuSCs that are Pax7+S100B+ may be specialized for a synaptic fate. We performed a subset of experiments on MuSCs that increase expression of S100B in vitro (described further below); however, the hypothesis that S100B+ MuSCs take a synaptic fate has not been validated and we believe that such an experiment should be performed as part of a larger study designed to assess whether intrinsic or extrinsic factors primarily drive Pax7+S100B+ MuSC identity. For instance, it is possible that Pax7+S100B+ MuSCs may not retain nor acquire an NMJ identity without co-culturing with motor neurons, muscle fibers, Schwann cells and/or cell types together in addition to changing in response to neurodegeneration and/or aging.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>24) Expansion ex vivo of Pax7+S100B-GFP+ MuSC should be performed to test the possibility that these myogenic stem cells have acquired the specific identity of NMJ MuSC.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We do agree with the reviewer that culture experiments will provide additional insights about the identity of Pax7+S100B-GFP+ MuSCs. Given this subset of MuSCs was rare, we isolated primary MuSCs from young mice and activated S100B using a CRISPR-dCas9-SUNTAG transcriptional activator using short guide RNAs targeting the S100B locus (new Figure 6D-G). We first observed that increased activation of S100B induces apoptosis, which is consistent with previous observations (Sorci et al., J. Cell Physiol. 2004). Moreover, we detected increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reductions in fusion as a result of S100B overexpression. Given the longer time frames through which MuSCs were proposed to adopt a synaptic fate, it was difficult to expand these cells without significant cell death.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>25) In the genetic rescue of motor neurons in Sod1-/- mice, what is percentage of MN rescue seen when MN are provided, and is there a threshold effect?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment from the reviewer. Recently we published that overexpression of human Sod1 (hSod1) in neurons demonstrates a nearly complete rescue of innervation that is lost with the Sod1-/- model for age-matched animals (Su et al., Free Rad. Biol. And Med. 2021). We have not measured a threshold effect but recovery of hSod1 to ~20-25% of WT protein levels in motoneurons provides rescue. We have included this reference in our revised Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>26) If Pax7+S100Beta+ cells are lost or blocked in either model, does this alter rescue effects? In other words, is it responsible in part for phenotypes in models or bystander?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point brought up by the reviewer. The rescue in the Sod1-/- model occurs only in motor neurons and is independent of MuSCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>27) It has been proposed that a specific class of fibroblasts near the tips of the myofiber can acquire a myogenic identity and contribute to muscle growth (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.20.211342v1, https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.20.213199v1). Can the authors exclude the possibility that Schwann cells that share many common expressed genes with NMJ MuSC could be reprogrammed to adopt a myogenic fate at the NMJ, or vice versa?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point brought up about the reviewer. To our knowledge, Schwann cells have not been observed to express myogenic transcription factors such as Pax7, MyoD1 and Myf5 or postsynaptic proteins such as Rapsyn or AChRs, and our datasets show Pax7-S100B+ cells do not express these factors (Figure 3 – Supp. Figure 2C). Additionally, we do not observe an appreciable fraction of Pax7+S100B+ cells in young muscle, indicating de-differentiation of Schwann cells into an alternate lineage would only occur in old age or diseased muscle. Given aged Schwann cells have been shown to have impaired de-differentiation ability (Painter et al., Neuron 2014), we posit that reprogramming of Schwann cells into myogenic progenitors is unlikely. Conversely, muscle stem cells have been shown to express different neurotrophic factors in a similar manner as Schwann cells and have been shown to differentiate into alternate lineages such as brown adipocytes through increased expression of the methyltransferase Prdm16 (Seale et al., Nature 2008). Additionally, S100B overexpression has been shown to promote a myoblast–brown adipocyte transition (Morozzi et al. Cell Death Differ. 2017).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>28) Kimmel et al. (Development 2020) have reported that the transcriptomes of young and old MuSCs are hardly distinguishable.

In the first case, the accretion of SC near the NMJ may act to counteract the expected muscle atrophy following denervation (leading to denervated myofibers with an increased number of myonuclei), while in the second case the presence of newly accreted myonuclei near the NMJ could reflect a late re-innervation process.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank for the reviewer for this comment. Previously, we used the same SNT procedure to disrupt lower-limb NMJs (Liu et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2015). We observed this injury results in complete denervation of adult NMJs, and re-innervation occurs 4–6 weeks after SNT as measured by immunofluorescence (IF) and physiological measures. Other published reports (Williams and Valdez et al., Science 2009) that used the same SNT procedure observed a significant fraction of mouse adult NMJs are re-innervated 3-6 weeks after SNT, which is approximately consistent with our previous findings (Liu et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2015). Thus, we believe 4 weeks after SNT is a re-innervation phase whereby axon terminals return to myofibers and function is beginning to be restored.</p><p>Myonuclear accretion in the context of SNT could manifest as an increase in myonuclear number, turnover of myonuclei, or some combination of the two. Previously, we found a modest reduction of myonuclei 6 weeks after SNT that was exacerbated with MuSC depletion (supplemental data Liu et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2015). This result was consistent with previous work no loss of myonuclei in chronically denervated muscle (Bruusgaard et al., J. Clin. Investig. 2008). We concluded that this supported loss and some level of myonuclear turnover after SNT, and these data were published and discussed (Liu et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2015). We have included more details in the discussion in this regard.</p><p>To glean if engraftment of MuSCs occurs acutely after denervation or in response to a late re-innervation process, we performed lineage-tracing of MuSCs at different points after SNT. In Figure 1, we administered tamoxifen before SNT to facilitate tracing of the acute response of MuSCs to SNT. In Figure 2, we administered tamoxifen 14 days after SNT to be able to perform tracing of MuSCs in the late phases of re-innervation and discern MuSCs from the underlying fiber. We did not observe significant fusion of MuSCs &gt;14 days post SNT and myofibers were devoid of TdTomato+ signal. It is possible the fusion of MuSCs into NMJ proximal locations are attempting to prevent atrophy and we discuss this and other potential roles the cells may perform in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should explain this when presenting the SNT model used to alleviate ambiguities. Furthermore the re-innervation process is more impaired in old and Sod1-/- animals, which could lead to the decreased SyM observed. If this is the case, SNT should lead to a more severe muscle atrophy in old animals than in young animals; this should be referenced and discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment from the reviewer. We agree that aged animals have been shown to display impairments in re-innervation when compared to young animals and this may contribute to the reductions in SyM we have observed. We do also note that this effect may be driven by several factors beyond aged muscle, MuSCs and nerve such as diminished Schwann cell responses (Painter et al., Neuron 2014). Previously, we found that MuSC depletion led to a reduction in SyM number, but not complete loss of SyM 6 weeks after SNT. This loss of MuSC contribution to SyM was also associated with reduced re-innervation of adult NMJs after SNT (Liu et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2015). These studies coupled with our data showing fusion near the NMJ, as well as that a specific subset of MuSCs that express synaptic factors but do not engraft in old age and neurodegeneration suggest these cells are critical for re-innervation of muscle. We have included several additional references and sentences in the discussion about this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Concerning the Figure 1C: the authors should establish the number of myonuclei in the myofiber 28 days after nerve injury: from their picture there is a massive fusion of SC (Pax7-nGFP); It is quite unexpected that during atrophy induced by nerve section, there is such an increase of new myonuclei: please indicate their number.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the comments above regarding myonucler accretion. In regards to the fusion of MuSCs, we state in the manuscript that existing synaptic myonuclei and extra-synaptic myonuclei may incorporate nGFP after MuSC engraftment.

The mouse models in Figures 1 and 2 are derived from different lineage tracing systems (Pax7<sup>CreER</sup>-Rosa26<sup>nTnG</sup> for Figure 1 and Pax7<sup>CreER</sup>-Rosa26<sup>TdTomato</sup> for Figure 2). In Figure 2, we utilized young and aged mice that harbor a MuSC fluorescent reporter that permits lineage tracing of the entire cell rather than just the nucleus (Pax7<sup>CreER/+</sup>-Rosa26<sup>TdTomato/+</sup>), which was critical to quantify the distances between MuSCs and the NMJ. The mice were administered tamoxifen at 14 days post sciatic nerve transection (SNT). We have modified the text in the Results section and the supplemental information on the animal model to reflect this. We quantified the recombination efficiency of TdTomato in Pax7+ cells to be &gt;90% (data not shown).
