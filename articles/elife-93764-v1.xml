network. The clock is visible as tissue-level kinematic waves of gene expression that travel through the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) and arrest at the position of each forming segment. Here, we test how this hallmark wave pattern is driven by culturing single maturing PSM cells. We compare their cell-autonomous oscillatory and arrest dynamics to those we observe in the embryo at cellular resolution, finding similarity in the relative slowing of oscillations and arrest in concert with differentiation. This shows that cell-extrinsic signals are not required by the cells to instruct the developmental program underlying the wave pattern. We show that a cell-autonomous timing activity initiates during cell exit from the tailbud, then runs down in the anterior-ward cell flow in the PSM, thereby using elapsed time to provide positional information to the clock. Exogenous FGF lengthens the duration of the cell-intrinsic timer, indicating extrinsic factors in the embryo may regulate the segmentation clock via the timer. In sum, our work suggests that a noisy cell-autonomous, intrinsic timer drives the slowing and arrest of oscillations underlying the wave pattern, while extrinsic factors in the embryo tune this timer’s duration and precision. This is a new insight into the balance of cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic mechanisms driving tissue patterning in development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>segmentation clock</kwd><kwd>zebrafish</kwd><kwd>somitogenesis</kwd><kwd>intrinsic timer</kwd><kwd>cell tracking</kwd><kwd>primary cell culture</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001703</institution-id><institution>École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oates</surname><given-names>Andrew C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010438</institution-id><institution>Francis Crick Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oates</surname><given-names>Andrew C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oates</surname><given-names>Andrew C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.35802/098025</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oates</surname><given-names>Andrew C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LT000078/2016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Desai</surname><given-names>Ravi A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012763</institution-id><institution>Whitaker Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Desai</surname><given-names>Ravi A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

These segments, called somites, give rise to the metameric backbone, ribs and associated muscles of the adult body. The segmentation clock’s dynamics are visible in the embryo as tissue-level waves of gene expression that travel anteriorly through the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) until they arrest at the position of the newly forming somite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aulehla et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Delaune et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Masamizu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Palmeirim et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Soroldoni et al., 2014</xref>). Waves are produced by the slowing of oscillations in cells as they mature and flow anteriorly through the spatial reference frame of the PSM; this slowing creates a phase shift along the anteroposterior axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Delaune et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Morelli et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shih et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yoshioka-Kobayashi et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we investigate what drives the cellular-level slowing of oscillations and clock arrest; in particular, we wish to determine the balance of cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic factors in this patterning process.</p><p>Previous work has implicated both cell-intrinsic mechanisms and extrinsic signals in driving the slowing of oscillations and clock arrest. These mechanisms include morphogen signaling gradients across the PSM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ishimatsu et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diaz-Cuadros et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moreno and Kintner, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sawada et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Simsek and Özbudak, 2018</xref>), the decay of signaling factors carried anteriorly by PSM cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aulehla et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dubrulle and Pourquié, 2004</xref>), the counting of oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Palmeirim et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zákány et al., 2001</xref>), the comparison of oscillators’ phases within cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sonnen et al., 2018</xref>), and neighboring cells comparing their oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boareto et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murray et al., 2011</xref>). However, definitive evidence with respect to the slowing and stopping of oscillations in the embryo is lacking due to the experimental challenges of deconstructing the segmentation clock. The relative balance of cell-intrinsic versus -extrinsic information therefore remains an open question.</p><p>The classical test for intrinsic properties is to isolate cells from their neighbors and the tissue environment, then observe their autonomous behavior in culture. Cell culture systems derived from explanted primary material and induced stem cells have been developed with the aim to recapitulate clock dynamics and segmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Diaz-Cuadros and Pourquie, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pourquié, 2022</xref>). Isolated PSM cells have been shown to autonomously oscillate in various permissive culture conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oates, 2020</xref>). Isolated human and mouse PSM cells derived from stem cells showed autonomous, sustained oscillations upon inhibition of YAP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diaz-Cuadros et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matsuda et al., 2020a</xref>). Similarly, primary PSM cells from mouse showed sustained oscillations upon either YAP signaling inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hubaud et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yoshioka-Kobayashi et al., 2020</xref>) or use of a BSA-coated substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hubaud et al., 2017</xref>), and zebrafish primary PSM cells exhibited sustained noisy oscillations upon addition of FGF8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Webb et al., 2016</xref>). In none of these cases, however, was an oscillatory pattern observed for isolated cells that resembled the slowing frequency profile expected to underlie the in vivo wave pattern. Recently, we reported transient (non-steady-state) oscillations in zebrafish primary PSM cells cultured without signaling molecules, small molecule inhibitors, serum, or BSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Negrete et al., 2021</xref>), yet it remains unclear how these oscillations relate to the wave pattern in the embryo. Here, by quantitative comparison of dynamics in culture and in the intact zebrafish embryo, we show that isolated PSM cells have a cell-autonomous, intrinsic program capable of producing the wave pattern.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cell-autonomous transient dynamics in concert with PSM differentiation</title><p>To analyze transient dynamics from cells originating within a defined anteroposterior region of the PSM, we dissected out the posterior-most quarter of the PSM (PSM4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Retaining their initial local anteroposterior arrangement, cells from the PSM4 region predominantly contributed to two of four somites and differed by at most one Her1-YFP peak within a somite (N=2 embryos, n=128 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s11">Figure 1—figure supplement 11</xref>). To normalize for a general slowing of developmental time observed in zebrafish culture, as well as the overall longer periods of PSM4 cells in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Langenberg et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Webb et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matsuda et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s12">Figure 1—figure supplement 12</xref>), we used the number of peaks generated and the ratio of successive periods and peak intensities to compare cell dynamics, rather than absolute time. Cells in culture produced on average more peaks and showed increased variability in the number of peaks compared to cells in the embryo (mean ± SD = 4.4±1.6 peaks in culture, COV 0.36; 3.4±1.0 peaks in the embryo, COV 0.29; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,I</xref>), indicating a longer and more variable duration of the cell-autonomous transient dynamics. Because the cells tracked in the embryo originated from the same starting population as those in culture, these results suggest that the variability in culture is not due to a difference in initial heterogeneity within that cell population, but reflects an increase in the noise of the cell-autonomous dynamics.</p><p>The key dynamic of successive period slowing was shared between PSM4 cells in culture and in the embryo (81% of successive cycles slowed in culture vs 79% in the embryo; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and J</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s13">Figure 1—figure supplement 13C and E</xref>). However, a rise in intensity from one peak to the next was seen less often in culture (72% successive cycles in culture and 92% in the embryo; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and J</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s13">Figure 1—figure supplement 13B and D</xref>), and there was less of a correlation between intensity rise and slowing in the culture than in the embryo (57% of successive cycles both slow and rise in culture vs 73% in the embryo; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and J</xref>). These differences in accompanying intensity rise show that although the cell-autonomous program generates slowing oscillations, the amplitude of the oscillations is noisier, suggesting that this feature may be tuned by extrinsic factors in the tissue.</p><p>We next asked whether Her1-YFP arrest and Mesp-ba-mKate2 signal-onset in the culture reflected the spatiotemporal pattern of these events in a forming somite in the embryo.

Thus, in the embryo, clock arrest of all the cells that form a single somite does not occur simultaneously, but is nevertheless spatiotemporally limited within S-1.

We next asked whether this cell-autonomous timing depends on oscillations of the clock, potentially by using the accumulating cycles as a timer. To test this, we examined the timing of cell-autonomous Mesp-ba-mKate2 signal-onset in cells isolated from embryos with a genetic background lacking both <italic>her1</italic> and <italic>her7</italic> genes, a condition that disables the clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lleras Forero et al., 2018</xref>).

Thus, the timing of Mesp-ba-mKate2 signal-onset appears independent of the segmentation clock’s oscillations, suggesting that timing information that feeds into both the clock and differentiation across the PSM does not require clock oscillations.</p><p>Together, our data suggests that the slowing and arrest of oscillations underlying the wave pattern in embryos is driven cell-autonomously in differentiating PSM cells. However, the noisier dynamics of the cell-autonomous program suggest that extrinsic signals present in the embryo may adjust the time of clock arrest in concert with differentiation, and sharpen clock oscillatory dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>FGF extends the cell-autonomous clock and differentiation program in cultured posterior PSM cells</title><p>We next explored whether FGF, an extrinsic signal known to affect segmentation, interacts with the cell-autonomous program by culturing PSM4 cells in the presence of FGF8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

However, unlike amniotes, zebrafish do not possess an NMP population in the tailbud that contributes substantially to the tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Attardi et al., 2019</xref>). As we did with the PSM, we analyzed cells that survived over 5 hr post-dissociation, remained the only cell in the field of view, did not divide, and showed transient Her1-YFP dynamics. We found that single TB cells in culture oscillated with successive slowing, then arrested concurrent with Mesp-ba-mKate2 signal-onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). Moreover, TB and PSM4 dissected from the same embryos were found to arrest oscillations with similar timing, despite the more posterior origin of the TB cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). These results suggest that experimental removal from the TB starts the intrinsic timer such that its duration is equivalent to that of cells which have recently entered the PSM. We thus propose that TB cells have already expressed the cell-autonomous timing mechanism, but require a trigger associated with exit from the TB to start the timing activity.</p><p>If the timer starts upon TB exit, then we expected that cells in the embryo initiate slowing oscillations and amplitude rise when they transition into the PSM. Cells within the TB are known to mix and remain for a range of times before joining the PSM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mara et al., 2007</xref>). To compare the start of slowing oscillations in TB cells that join the PSM at different times, we backtracked individual cells located either within PSM4 or the most recently formed somite at the end of a 450min time-lapse movie (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). We observed that while in the TB, individual cells from both groups showed low-intensity, noisy Her1-YFP oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>), confirming that TB cells that will later become PSM in the zebrafish do oscillate. As the embryo developed, the group of cells backtracked from the recently formed somite were the first to join the PSM, at which time their oscillations slowed successively and increased in peak intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H, I</xref>). These dynamics continued as cells flowed anteriorly then arrested during somite formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F, H, I</xref>). In contrast, the group of cells backtracked from PSM4 exited the TB later and showed a corresponding delay in slowing, and intensity rise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–I</xref>). This tight correlation of the initiation of slowing oscillations in cells with their exit from the TB in the embryo supports the idea that exit from the TB starts the intrinsic timer.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The population-level behavior of the oscillators of the segmentation clock is the hallmark wave pattern. The role of short-range cell-cell signaling through the Delta-Notch pathway in the local synchronization of the oscillators is well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Venzin and Oates, 2020</xref>), providing local coherence to the wave pattern. However, the mechanism for the gradual slowing and stopping of the oscillators that creates the phase off-set required for waves at the tissue-level remains a topic of debate. Our results clearly implicate a cell-autonomous program of slowing and stopping as the basis for the tissue-level wave-pattern in the zebrafish, and show that a universal picture of the vertebrate segmentation clock that is centered on persistent cellular oscillators instructed by extrinsic signals is inadequate. Rather, our work highlights the importance of transient dynamics driven by a cell-autonomous timing mechanism.</p><p>How the balance of cell-intrinsic dynamics and extrinsic signaling plays out in other segmentation clock systems remains to be tested. However, the concept of a cell-intrinsic timer explains the long-known intrinsic properties of explanted PSM tissue from several species to segment with periodicity and AP directionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aulehla and Pourquié, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dubrulle et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Henry et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lauschke et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maroto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Palmeirim et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Palmeirim et al., 1998</xref>). Indeed, the long-standing ‘Clock and Wavefront’ model of the segmentation clock originally postulated an intracellular timing gradient as the mechanism behind the wavefront of cellular change interacting with the clock to determine somite position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cooke and Zeeman, 1976</xref>). Here, we have shown that both the clock and the wavefront, comprising just such an intracellular timing mechanism, are captured in a single cell running an autonomous program.</p><p>For simplicity, we have argued for a single timing mechanism. Curiously, we observed that in cells treated by FGF, the timing of arrest of oscillations and the onset of differentiation were dissociated in approximately 10% of cells. One interpretation of this result is that there are two (or more) parallel timing mechanisms underlying the normal tight linkage of clock arrest and differentiation, and elevated FGF signaling can cause these mechanisms to uncouple in a small set of cells. Another interpretation is that the clock arrest and onset of differentiation use different sensors of the same timer. Although these sensors react closely in time under normal circumstances, with a change in the timer’s dynamics caused by FGF (e.g. a lower slope of a timing gradient) the sensors react at different times in a small set of cells. Current evidence does not allow us to choose between these interpretations. A similar dissociation of clock arrest and differentiation timing has previously been inferred in the <italic>doppelkorn</italic> medaka mutant from gene expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Elmasri et al., 2004</xref>), suggesting the <italic>doppelkorn</italic> gene, when identified, may shed further light on the phenomenon.</p><p>The difference in duration and precision between cellular dynamics in the embryo and those in culture conditions distinguishes important roles of extrinsic signaling in the zebrafish segmentation clock. These roles are to regulate the length of the autonomous program and to increase the precision of the exit time in the population, so that all cells contributing to a single somite in the embryo stop oscillating within the period of somite formation. The ability of FGF to extend the duration of the program of cultured posterior PSM cells fits well with data from experiments in the embryo demonstrating that an increase or decrease in FGF activity can alter segment length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dubrulle et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sawada et al., 2001</xref>). Despite the increased duration in culture, FGF did not reduce the variability of the dynamics, implying that additional signals, or temporal signaling dynamics, are important for precision at the tissue level. How the timer is triggered upon the exit of a cell from the tailbud to the PSM is likewise not known, but our experiments suggest that the rapid decrease of external signals required for maintenance of a stable oscillatory state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hubaud and Pourquié, 2014</xref>), and normally restricted to the tailbud, would explain the observed dynamics. Whether other candidate signals such as Wnt and RA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aulehla and Pourquié, 2010</xref>), or signal dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sonnen et al., 2018</xref>), integrate into the control of intrinsic cell behavior to explain the timing and precision of embryonic segmentation can now be explored.</p><p>The intrinsic timer’s identity and how it is tuned by extrinsic signals during development remain intriguing questions. The molecular details of the timer are not constrained by our data here, and could involve a number of plausible intermediates such as transcription factor or microRNA cascades similar to those in timing of neuroblast differentiation or <italic>C. elegans</italic> molting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ambros, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brody and Odenwald, 2000</xref>) or phospho-timers as found in the circadian clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Diernfellner and Brunner, 2020</xref>). The latter mechanism would provide an attractive link to extrinsic signalling by FGF gradients in the PSM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sawada et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Simsek and Özbudak, 2018</xref>). A model for slowing and then stopping oscillations via the rise and fall of Her1 production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Negrete et al., 2021</xref>) implies that molecules controlling <italic>her1</italic> transcription, such as Tbx proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brend and Holley, 2009</xref>) and/or Her1 translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dill and Amacher, 2005</xref>) are involved as time-keeping factors. In this light, the activity of the Tbx-degrading factor Ripply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wanglar et al., 2014</xref>) may play a role in the threshold at which production falls, thereby rapidly stopping the oscillations. Other models posit that the slowing of Her oscillations arise due to an increase of time-delays in the negative feedback loop of the core clock circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ay et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yabe et al., 2023</xref>), suggesting that factors influencing the duration of pre-mRNA splicing, translation, or nuclear transport may be relevant. Whatever the identity, our results suggest that the timer exerts control over differentiation independent of the clock.</p><p>Organizing animal and plant tissues and microbial assemblies with oscillatory mechanisms in naturally occurring and synthetic systems is a rapidly evolving field of interest.

Although patterns in multicellular contexts can emerge from extrinsic signaling processes alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Danino et al., 2010</xref>), understanding the cell-intrinsic potential within these various systems is vital to interpreting and directing population level behavior. Our work combining isolated primary cell culture and single-cell resolution imaging of the corresponding developing tissue, reveals that cell-autonomous timing directs the tissue-level patterning of the clock, and offers new opportunities to study the balance of extrinsic and intrinsic control in oscillatory patterning systems.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Zebrafish and embryo care</title><p>Wildtype (WT) and transgenic (<italic>Tg</italic>) fish were maintained according to standard procedures in facilities at University College London (London, UK) and Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne EPFL (Lausanne, CH).

This produced a new coordinate system, where cells have a reference frame in the moving and growing embryo. Each notochord segment, corresponding to the area of projected tracked cells, was then aligned over time to create a kymograph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Using the X and Y coordinates in the projected notochord, a matrix was built where the rows are each notochord segment over time going from posterior to anterior. The columns correspond to a binned spatial region of the cell projection. The color code used for the Her1-YFP Kymograph was the time and position of the last peak of the cells (green). For Mesp-ba-mKate2, the signal-onset time and position (magenta) was used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Individual 15 somite-staged embryos were dechorionated in E3 then transferred into DPBS(-CaCl<sub>2</sub>, -MgCl<sub>2</sub>), where cells of interest were dissected out within 5 min. Using forceps (Dumont #5SF Forceps, straight, superfine, Fine Science Tools Item 11252–00) and a microknife (Needle Blade Microsurgical Knife Straight, Sharpoint, ref 78–6810), the skin and yolk were removed, leaving the trunk and tail intact. Holding the embryo in a lateral view, the TB was cut off posterior to the end of the notochord and the remaining AP axis up to the last formed somite boundary was quartered. PSM quarters from the desired AP level were then oriented in cross-section view so that PSM could be cut free of lateral tissue, neural tube and notochord. Dissected tissue was moved with F-127 Pluronics-coated pipette tips into coated tubes containing 50 μl DPBS(-CaCl<sub>2</sub>, - MgCl<sub>2</sub>). After a 5 min incubation in DPBS, the pieces were manually dissociated into single cells by brief pipetting and then transferred into wells of a 24-well glass bottom plate (Greiner Bio-One, 662896) that had been pre-coated with Protein A from <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (Sigma P6031; 100 ng/μl PA) and contained 800 μl culture media (Leibovitz’s L15 Medium, no phenol red, Thermo Fisher 21083027; 50 ng/μl Protein A; 0.01% Methyl Cellulose, Sigma 274429). Surface conditions were critical to successful cultures. For example, glass surfaces should not be acid-treated, and Protein A batches and strains exhibited substantial differences. Any undissociated clusters of cells were aspirated out of the culture well using a glass needle attached to a syringe. Embryos and cells were maintained around 28.5 °C throughout dissection and dissociation. In experiments involving FGF, we added FGF8 (423-F8b R&amp;D System) at 100 ng/ml to the culture media just prior to adding the dissociated cells.</p><p>Cells were allowed to settle in the well plate on the microscope stage at 28.5 °C and imaging positions were selected and focused in a 50–90 min window before imaging started. The time post-dissociation that imaging started was noted for each experiment in order for Her1-YFP last peak and Mesp-ba-mKate2 signal-onset timing to be compared relative to the time of dissociation rather than to the start of imaging.</p><p>To compare cells of different anteroposterior origins, PSM4 was dissected from each embryo alongside another PSM quarter of interest or TB, then cultured in an adjacent well and imaged at the same time. This provided an internal reference for arrest timing differences along the anteroposterior axis. In experiments comparing control and FGF-treated results, a starting pool of dissociated cells was split into two wells (±FGF).</p><p>Comparison of cell-autonomous Mesp-ba-mKate2 signal-onset timing in PSM4 cells from embryos that have a disabled clock (<italic>her1-/-; her7-/-;Tg(mesp-ba-mKate2</italic>)), with PSM4 cells from control (<italic>Tg(mesp-ba-mKate2</italic>)) embryos was also carried out in parallel.

Her1-YFP was detected using a Chroma 49003 filter, and Mesp-ba-mKate2 with Chroma 49008. Imaging parameters were as follows: YFP at 400ms exposure, 4x4 binning, 1 MHz (16-bit) read-out mode, EM Gain = 50, Conversion Gain = 1, 510 nm LED at 20% intensity; mKate2 at 1000ms exposure, 4x4 binning, 1 MHz (16-bit) read-out mode, EM Gain = 50, Conversion Gain = 1, 586 nm LED at 3% intensity; Bright field at arbitrary exposure time, no binning, 1 MHz (16-bit) read-out mode, EM Gain = 50, Conversion Gain = 1. Up to 120 positions with only one cell in the field of view were selected at the start of imaging per experiment. A single plane of bright field, YFP and mKate2 was captured at 10 min intervals for over 16 h using the perfect focus system. Cells remained in the center of the field of view without re-positioning throughout the movie. Temperature was controlled at 28.5 (±0.3 °C) using a stage-top incubator (Bold line, Okolab), and a light-blocking incubation chamber (Solent Scientific).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Cell culture image processing</title><p>Bright field images were passed through a custom MATLAB code for segmenting single cells. Contrast of the grayscale image of the first frame was enhanced using the adapthisteq built-in algorithm, then filtered using a guided filter (imguidedfilter, neighbourhood = 3 by 3 pixels and degree of smoothing = 0.001) to preserve cell edges (regions of high variance in pixel intensity) while filtering out noise. Next, a gradient image was generated by subtracting an eroded image (imerode, disk structuring element = 2 pixels) from a dilated (imdilate, disk structuring element = 2 pixels) image, providing a rough outline of potential cells. Otsu’s thresholding was applied to this, resulting in a binary image with several white regions (termed blobs) that represented potential cells. Given that cells were positioned approximately at the center of each image, the largest blob at the center of the image was segmented and pixel intensities in the rest of the image were set to zero (black). This served as a mask for further processing. The built-in activecontour algorithm (300 iterations, Chan-Vese method, smooth factor = 1, contraction bias = 0.1) was then applied on the gradient image with the mask serving as the initial state of the algorithm. The boundaries of the object region in the mask (in white) define the initial contour position used for contour evolution that ultimately segments the cell. Output from the algorithm represented the segmented cell. Fluorescent intensities from the segmented region were then determined for further analysis. Segmentation of each frame was confirmed manually and corrected when necessary.</p><p>Mesp-ba-Kate signal in <italic>her1-/-;her7-/-</italic> and control PSM4 cells in culture was detected as Maximum Intensity within a manually placed ROI around the cell in Fiji.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Her1-YFP intensity trace peaks and period</title><sec id="s4-11-1"><title>Cells in culture</title><p>The high signal to noise of the intensity traces allowed the oscillatory region to be determined by visual inspection.

The authors distinguish cells isolated from the tailbud and different areas in the PSM. They suggest that the cell-autonomous timer is initiated, as cells exit the tailbud.</p><p>This is also relevant for the comparison of single cells isolated from the embryo and cells within the embryo. The dissection will always be less precise and cells within the PSM4 region could contain tailbud cells (as also indicated in Figure 1A), while in the analysis of live imaging data cells can be selected more precisely based on their location. This could therefore contribute to the difference in noise between isolated single cells and cells in the embryo. This could also explain why there are &quot;on average more peaks&quot; in isolated cells (p. 6, l. 7).</p><p>This aspect should be considered in the interpretation of the data and mentioned at least in the discussion. (It does not contradict their finding that more anterior cells oscillate less often and differentiate earlier than more posterior ones.)</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer #1 rightly points out that selecting cells in a timelapse is more precise than manual dissection. Manual dissection is inherently variable but we believe in general it is not a major source of noise in our experiments. To control for this, we compared the results of 11 manual dissections of the posterior quarter of the PSM (PSM4) with those of the pooled PSM4 data. In general, we did not see large differences in the distributions of peak number or arrest timing that would markedly increase the variability of the pooled data above that of the individual dissections (Figure 1 – supplement figure 7). We have edited the text in the Results to highlight this control experiment (page 6, lines 13-17).</p><p>It is of course possible that we picked up adjacent TB cells when dissecting PSM4, however the reviewer’s assertion that inclusion of TB cells “could also explain why there are &quot;on average more peaks&quot; in isolated cells” is incorrect. Later in the paper we show that cells from the TB have almost identical distributions to PSM4 (mean ± SD, PSM4 4.36 ± 1.44; TB 4.26 ± 1.35; Figure 4 _ supplement 1). Thus, inadvertent inclusion of TB cells while dissecting would in fact not increase the number of peaks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Here, the authors focus on the question of how cells differentiate. The reverse question is not addressed at all. How do cells maintain their oscillatory state in the tailbud? One possibility is that cells need external signals to maintain that as indicated in Hubaud et al. 2014. In this regard, the definition of tailbud is also very vague. What is the role of neuromesodermal progenitors? The proposal that the timer is started when cells exit the tailbud is at this point a correlation and there is no functional proof, as long as we do not understand how cells maintain the tailbud state. These are points that should be considered in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer asks “How do cells maintain their oscillatory state in the tailbud?”. This is a very interesting question, but as recognized by the reviewer, beyond the scope of our current paper.</p><p>We now further emphasize the point “One possibility is that cells need external signals to maintain … as indicated in Hubaud et al. 2014” in the Discussion and added a reference to the review Hubaud and Pourquié 2014 (Signalling dynamics in vertebrate segmentation. Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol 15, 709–721 (2014). <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nrm3891">https://doi.org/10.1038/nrm3891</ext-link>) (page 18, lines 19-22).</p><p>To clarify the definition of the TB, we have stated more clearly in the results (page 15, lines 8-12) that we defined TB cells as all cells posterior to the notochord (minus skin) and analyzed those that survived</p><p>&gt;5 hours post-dissociation, did not divide, and showed transient Her1-YFP dynamics.</p><p>The reviewer asks: What is the role of neuromesodermal progenitors? In responding to this, we refer to Attardi et al., 2018 (Neuromesodermal progenitors are a conserved source of spinal cord with divergent growth dynamics. Development. 2018 Nov 9;145(21):dev166728. doi: 10.1242/dev.166728).</p><p>Around the stage of dissection in zebrafish in our work, there is a small remaining group of cells characterized as NMPs (Sox2 +, Tbxta+ expression) in the dorsal-posterior wall of the TB. These NMPs rarely divide and are not thought to act as a bipotential pool of progenitors for the elongating axis, as is the case in amniotes, rather contributing to the developing spinal cord. How this particular group of cells behaves in culture is unclear as we did not subdivide the TB tissue before culturing. It would be possible to specifically investigate these NMPs regarding a role in TB oscillations, but given the results of Attardi et al., 2018 (small number of cells, low bipotentiality), we argue that it would not be significant for the conclusions of the current work. To indicate this, we included a sentence and a citation of this paper in the results towards the beginning of the section on the tail bud (page 15, lines 8-12).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors observe that the number of oscillations in single cells ex vivo is more variable than in the embryo. This is presumably due to synchronization between neighbouring cells via Notch signalling in the embryo. Would it be possible to add low doses of Notch inhibitor to interfere with efficient synchronization, while at the same time keeping single cell oscillations high enough to be able to quantify them?</p></disp-quote><p>It is a formal possibility that Delta-Notch signaling may have some impact on the variability in the number of oscillations. However, we argue that the significant amount of cell tracking work required to carry out the suggested experiments would not be justified, considering what has been previously shown in the literature. If Delta-Notch signaling was a major factor controlling the variability of the intrinsic program that we describe, then we would expect that in Delta-Notch mutants the anterior- posterior limits of cyclic gene expression in the PSM would extend beyond those seen in wildtype embryos. Specifically, we might expect to see her1 expression extending more anteriorly in mutants to account for the dramatic increase in the number of cells that have 5, 6, 7 and 8 cycles in culture (Fig. 1E versus Fig. 1I). However, as shown in Holley et al., 2002 (Fig. 5A, B; her1 and the notch pathway function within the oscillator mechanism that regulates zebrafish somitogenesis. Development. 2002 Mar;129(5):1175-83. doi: 10.1242/dev.129.5.1175), the anterior limit of her1 expression in the PSM in DeltaD mutants (aei) is not different to WT. Thus, Delta-Notch signaling may exert a limited control over the number of oscillations, but likely not in excess of one cycle difference.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the same direction, it would be interesting to test if variation is decreased, when the number of isolated cells is increased, i.e. if cells are cultured in groups of 2, 3 or 4 cells, for instance.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great proposal – however the culture setup used here is a wide-field system that doesn’t allow us to accurately follow more than one cell at a time. Cells that adhere to each other tend to crawl over each other, blurring their identity in Z. This is also why we excluded dividing cells in culture from the analysis. Experiments carried out with a customized optical setup will be needed to investigate this in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It seems that the initiation of Mesp2 expression is rather reproducible and less noisy (+/- 2 oscillation cycles), while the number of oscillations varies considerably (and the number of cells continuing to oscillate after Mesp2 expression is too low to account for that). How can the authors explain this apparent discrepancy?</p></disp-quote><p>The observed tight linkage of the Mesp onset and Her1 arrest argue for a single timing mechanism that is upstream of both gene expression events; indeed, this is one of the key implications of the paper. However, the infrequent dissociation of these events observed in FGF-treated cells suggests that more than one timing pathway could be involved, although there are other interpretations. We’ve added more discussion in the text on one vs multi-timers (page 17, lines 19-23 – page 18, line 1 - 8)., see next point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The observation that some cells continue oscillating despite the upregulation of Mesp2 should be discussed further and potential mechanism described, such as incomplete differentiation.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an infrequent (5 out of 54 cells) and interesting feature of PSM4 cells in the presence of FGF. We imagine that this disassociation of clock arrest from mesp on-set timing could be the result of alterations in the thresholds in the sensing mechanisms controlling these two processes. Alternatively - as reviewer 2 argues - it might reflect multiple timing mechanisms at work.

Their main conclusion is that a cell-autonomous timer operates in these cells and that additional external signals are integrated to tune cellular dynamics. Combined, this is underlying the precision required for proper embryonic segmentation, in vivo. I think this work stands out for its very thorough, quantitative, single-cell real-time imaging approach, both in vitro and also in vivo. A very significant progress and investment in method development, at the level of the imaging setup and also image analysis, was required to achieve this highly demanding task. This work provides new insight into the biology underlying embryo axis segmentation.</p><p>The work is very well presented and accessible. I think most of the conclusions are well supported. Here a my comments and suggestions:</p><p>The authors state that &quot;We compare their cell-autonomous oscillatory and arrest dynamics to those we observe in the embryo at cellular resolution, finding remarkable agreement.&quot;</p><p>I think this statement needs to be better placed in context. In absolute terms, the period of oscillations and the timing of differentiation are actually very different in vitro, compared to in vitro. While oscillations have a period of ~30 minutes in vivo, oscillations take twice as long in vitro. Likewise, while the last oscillation is seen after 143 minutes in vivo, the timing of differentiation is very significantly prolonged, i.e.more than doubled, to 373min in vitro (Supplementary Figure 1-9). I understand what the authors mean with 'remarkable agreement', but this statement is at the risk of being misleading. I think the in vitro to in vivo differences (in absolute time scales) needs to be stated more explicitly. In fact, the drastic change in absolute timescales, while preserving the relative ones, i.e. the number of oscillations a cell is showing before onset of differentiation remains relatively invariant, is a remarkable finding that I think merits more consideration (see below).</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the text in the abstract (page 1, line 28) to clarify that the agreement is in the relative slowing, intensity increases and peak numbers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One timer vs. many timers</p><p>The authors show that the oscillation clock slowing down and the timing of differentiation, i.e. the time it takes to activate the gene mesp, are in principle dissociable processes. In physiological conditions, these are however linked. We are hence dealing with several processes, each controlled in time (and thereby space). Rather than suggesting the presence of ‘a timer’, I think the presence of multiple timing mechanisms would reflect the phenomenology better. I would hence suggest separating the questions more consistently, for instance into the following three:</p><p><italic>a.</italic> what underlies the slowing down of oscillations?</p><p><italic>b.</italic> what controls the timing of onset of differentiation?</p><p><italic>c.</italic> and finally, how are these processes linked?</p><p>Currently, these are discussed somewhat interchangeably, for instance here: “Other models posit that the slowing of Her oscillations arise due to an increase of time-delays in the negative feedback loop of the core clock circuit (Yabe, Uriu, and Takada 2023; Ay et al. 2014), suggesting that factors influencing the duration of pre-mRNA splicing, translation, or nuclear transport may be relevant. Whatever the identity, our results indicate the timer ought to exert control over differentiation independent of the clock.”(page 14). In the first part, the slowing down of oscillations is discussed and then the authors conclude on 'the timer', which however is the one timing differentiation, not the slowing down. I think this could be somewhat misleading.</p></disp-quote><p>To help distinguish the clock’s slowing &amp; arrest from differentiation, we have clarified the text in how we describe our experiments using her1-/-; her7-/- cells (page 10, lines 9-20).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>From this and previous studies, we learn/know that without clock oscillations, the onset of differentiation still occurs. For instance in clock mutant embryos (mouse, zebrafish), mesp onset is still occurring, albeit slightly delayed and not in a periodic but smooth progression. This timing of differentiation can occur without a clock and it is this timer the authors refer to &quot;Whatever the identity, our results indicate the timer ought to exert control over differentiation independent of the clock.&quot; (page 14). This 'timer' is related to what has been previously termed 'the wavefront' in the classic Clock and Wavefront model from 1976, i.e. a &quot;timing gradient' and smooth progression of cellular change. The experimental evidence showing it is cell-autonomous by the time it has been laid down,, using single cell measurements, is an important finding, and I would suggest to connect it more clearly to the concept of a wavefront, as per model from 1976.</p></disp-quote><p>We have been explicit about the connection to the clock &amp; wavefront in the discussion (page 17, line 12-17).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding question a., clearly, the timer for the slowing down of oscillations is operating in single cells, an important finding of this study. It is remarkable to note in this context that while the overall, absolute timescale of slowing down is entirely changed by going from in vivo to in vitro, the relative slowing down of oscillations, per cycle, is very much comparable, both in vivo and in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now pointed out the relative nature of this phenomenon in the abstract, page 1, line 28.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To me, while this study does not address the nature of this timer directly, the findings imply that the cell-autonomous timer that controls slowing down is, in fact, linked to the oscillations themselves. We have previously discussed such a timer, i.e. a 'self-referential oscillator' mechanism (in mouse embryos, see Lauschke et al., 2013) and it seems the new exciting findings shown here in zebrafish provide important additional evidence in this direction. I would suggest commenting on this potential conceptual link, especially for those readers interested to see general patterns.</p></disp-quote><p>While we posit that the timer provides positional info to the clock to slow oscillations and instruct its arrest – we do not believe that “the findings imply that the cell-autonomous timer that controls slowing down is, in fact, linked to [i.e., governed by] the oscillations themselves.”. As we show, in her1-/-; her7-/- embryos lacking oscillations, the timing / positional information across the PSM still exists as read-out by Mesp expression. Is this different positional information than that used by the clock? – possibly – but given the tight linkage between Mesp onset and the timing/positioning of clock arrest, both cell-autonomously and in the embryo, we argue that the simplest explanation is that the timing/positional information used by the clock and differentiation are the same. Please see page 10, lines 9-20, as well as the discussion (page 17, lines 19-23; page 18. Lines 1-8).</p><p>We agree that the timer must communicate to the clock– but this does not mean it is dependent on the clock for positional information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding question c., i.e. how the two timing mechanisms are functionally linked, I think concluding that &quot;Whatever the identity, our results indicate the timer ought to exert control over differentiation independent of the clock.&quot; (page 14), might be a bit of an oversimplification. It is correct that the timer of differentiation is operating without a clock, however, physiologically, the link to the clock (and hence the dependence of the timescale of clock slowing down), is also evident. As the author states, without clock input, the precision of when and where differentiation occurs is impacted. I would hence emphasize the need to answer question c., more clearly, not to give the impression that the timing of differentiation does not integrate the clock, which above statement could be interpreted to say.</p></disp-quote><p>As far as we can tell, we do not state that “without clock input, the precision of when and where differentiation occurs is impacted”, and we certainly do not want to give this impression. In contrast, as mentioned above, the her1-/-; her7-/- mutant embryo studies indicate that the lack of a clock signal does not change the differentiation timing, i.e. it does not integrate the clock. Of course, in the formation of a real somite in the embryo, the clock’s input might be expected to cause a given cell to differentiate a little earlier or later so as to be coordinated with its neighbors, for example, along a boundary. But this magnitude of timing difference is within one clock cycle at most, and does not match the large variation seen in the cultured cells that spans over many clock cycles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A very interesting finding presented here is that in some rare examples, the arrest of oscillations and onset of differentiation (i.e. mesp) can become dissociated. Again, this shows we deal here with interacting, but independent modules. Just as a comment, there is an interesting medaka mutant, called doppelkorn (Elmasri et al. 2004), which shows a reminiscent phenotype &quot;the Medaka dpk mutant shows an expansion of the her7 expression domain, with apparently normal mesp expression levels in the anterior PSM.&quot;. The authors might want to refer to this potential in vivo analogue to their single cell phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, we had forgotten this result. Although we do not agree that this result necessarily means there are two interacting modules, we have included a citation to the paper, along with a discussion of alternative explanations for the dissociation (page 18, lines 2-14).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One strength of the presented in vitro system is that it enables precise control and experimental perturbations. A very informative set of experiments would be to test the dependence of the cell-autonomous timing mechanisms (plural) seen in isolated cells on ongoing signalling cues, for instance via Fgf and Wnt signaling. The inhibition of these pathways with well-characterised inhibitors, in single cells, would provide important additional insight into the nature of the timing mechanisms, their dependence on signaling and potentially even into how these timers are functionally interdependent.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and in future experiments we are taking advantage of this in vitro system to directly investigate the effect of signaling cues on the intrinsic timing mechanism.</p></body></sub-article></article>
