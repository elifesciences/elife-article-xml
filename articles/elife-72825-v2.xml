Typically, animals heterozygous for a mutation are crossed to produce offspring with different genotypes. Resultant embryos are grouped by genotype to compare homozygous mutant embryos to heterozygous and wild-type siblings. Genes that are differentially expressed between the groups are assumed to reveal insights into the pathways affected by the mutation. Here we show that in zebrafish, differentially expressed genes are often over-represented on the same chromosome as the mutation due to different levels of expression of alleles from different genetic backgrounds. Using an incross of haplotype-resolved wild-type fish, we found evidence of widespread allele-specific expression, which appears as differential expression when comparing embryos homozygous for a region of the genome to their siblings. When analysing mutant transcriptomes, this means that the differential expression of genes on the same chromosome as a mutation of interest may not be caused by that mutation. Typically, the genomic location of a differentially expressed gene is not considered when interpreting its importance with respect to the phenotype. This could lead to pathways being erroneously implicated or overlooked due to the noise of spurious differentially expressed genes on the same chromosome as the mutation. These observations have implications for the interpretation of RNA-seq experiments involving outbred animals and non-inbred model organisms.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>zebrafish</kwd><kwd>RNA-seq</kwd><kwd>differential expression</kwd><kwd>allele-specific expression</kwd><kwd>mutants</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/L003775/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wilson</surname><given-names>Stephen W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/T020164/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wilson</surname><given-names>Stephen W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>095722/Z/11/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wilson</surname><given-names>Stephen W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>206194</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>Richard J</given-names></name><name><surname>Busch-Nentwich</surname><given-names>Elisabeth M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Allele-specific gene expression can affect the results and interpretation of transcriptomic analyses in zebrafish mutants and has broader implications for work in other outbred organisms.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Large-scale genetic screens to identify gene function by randomly introducing mutations have been a staple of zebrafish genetics for several decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Driever et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haffter et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kettleborough et al., 2013</xref>). The advent of RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) has enabled investigators to estimate the location of such mutations in the genome, while also providing information regarding gene expression levels and affected cellular pathways in the mutants. The bioinformatics pipelines which process RNA-seq data to generate gene expression information focus on transcript abundance, differential splicing, and gene set enrichments, and, in general, genomic location is not considered when assessing genes that are differentially expressed (DE) in a mutant context. Here, we report that physical location can impact a gene’s likelihood of being DE in mutant zebrafish.</p><p>In the typical protocol for introducing random point mutations, male zebrafish from a laboratory wild-type strain are treated with <italic>N</italic>-ethyl-<italic>N</italic>-nitrosourea (ENU) to mutagenise sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kettleborough et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mullins et al., 1994</xref>). The mutagenised fish (G0) are mated with wild-type females to produce F1 offspring, each heterozygous at random novel mutation sites. F1 fish are outcrossed with wild types to produce clutches of F2 offspring, which are subsequently incrossed to produce F3 embryos. The F3 clutches contain the novel mutations in Mendelian ratios, and in a forward genetics approach are screened for recessive phenotypes of interest which appear in approximately 25% of embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mullins et al., 1994</xref>). These embryos are referred to as ‘mutants’ whereas those without phenotypes are ‘siblings’.</p><p>Mutant embryos are homozygous for a novel allele (the ‘causative mutation’) and due to genetic linkage, they are likely to be homozygous for alleles physically nearby on the chromosome. The location encompassing the causative mutation therefore lies in a region which is highly homozygous in mutants, yet heterozygous in siblings. This is referred to as linkage disequilibrium (LD). The region of high LD can be mapped using high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics pipelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mackay and Schulte-Merker, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Minevich et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Obholzer et al., 2012</xref>) whereas prior efforts involved painstaking genotyping of simple sequence length polymorphisms and genome walks using bacterial or P1 artificial chromosome libraries or subsequently, microarrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stickney et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>All mapping processes rely on identification of polymorphic loci throughout the genome. Laboratory zebrafish strains have a high degree of intra-strain polymorphism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guryev et al., 2006</xref>), but mapping is aided by the introduction of alleles from other strains. Thus, mutagenised males are often paired with females from a different strain. As a result, in a mapping cross, alleles in the mutants and siblings are inherited from two different strains. This remains true throughout the multiple generations that a mutant line is maintained in a laboratory.</p><p>In this study, we report that the highly polymorphic nature of zebrafish strains can lead to gene expression differences between mutant and sibling embryos through allele-specific expression (ASE). The effect of ASE is well documented across many species, and can be tissue- and condition-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ayroles et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doss et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Battle et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim-Hellmuth et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Storey et al., 2005</xref>). Here, this phenomenon manifests as a cluster of DE genes located near to the causative mutation site in many different unrelated mutant lines. The differential transcript levels of these local genes are likely due to expression differences between wild-type strains rather than altered transcription due to the mutation. We confirm the high prevalence of ASE in zebrafish in the SAT line which is derived from only two haplotypes. This observation has implications for researchers attempting to use differential expression to explain phenotypes of interest, not only in zebrafish, but also in other outbred model organisms, as these local genes may simply be a red herring.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Differentially expressed genes are often enriched on the mutant chromosome</title><p>To map the causal mutations for a number of different mutants from forward genetic screens, we used RNA-seq and LD mapping, based on Cloudmap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Minevich et al., 2012</xref>). A representative LD mapping plot (taken from the mutant line <italic>u426</italic>) is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. We observed a high degree of LD on chromosome 7 at approximately 22 Mbp, suggesting the phenotype-causing mutation is near this position. DESeq2 reported 209 genes as DE (adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05) between mutants and siblings. Annotating the LD mapping plot with the position of these genes showed a cluster of DE genes near the LD mapping peak on chromosome 7. Indeed, we found 15 DE genes in an arbitrarily sized 20 Mbp window centred on the mapping peak at 22 Mbp, representing 7% of all DE genes. For comparison, a 20 Mbp window randomly sampled (1000 iterations) from the zebrafish genome contains approximately 1.4% of known genes.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Linkage disequilibrium (LD) mapping plot of up- and downregulated genes in <italic>u426</italic> mutants shows a cluster of such genes local to the mutation site on chromosome 7.</title><p>The plots for each of the 25 chromosomes shows the allele balance (proportion of reads containing the alternative allele) of each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) locus along with its physical position.

In the most extreme case (the sample <italic>nl14</italic>), the likelihood of finding a DE gene near to the mutation site was over 100-fold higher than the likelihood of finding one at a random other location in the genome.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Summary of logistic regression results for RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysed mutant lines.</title><p>Causative mutation shows the gene and location of the mutation site in lines where this has been confirmed empirically, otherwise the location is estimated from linkage disequilibrium (LD) data.

Of these, 44 were on the chromosome carrying the mutation being investigated in the experiment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Of the other 16, 7 had an enrichment on chromosome 9. This was driven by expression of γ-crystallin genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>), which are expressed in the lens and present in a cluster on chromosome 9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Greiling et al., 2009</xref>) that we have previously observed as being co-regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">White et al., 2017</xref>). This suggests that the eyes are affected in some of the analysed mutants. Whether there was an enrichment of DE genes on the mutant chromosome did not depend on the total number of DE genes found in the experiment, although experiments with very high numbers of DE genes tended not to show an enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>In one experiment, we noticed that the differential expression of some genes was linked to one of the wild-type chromosomes in the experiment. This experiment was an intercross of two different <italic>sox10</italic> alleles, <italic>t3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dutton et al., 2001</xref>) and <italic>baz1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carney et al., 2006</xref>) sampled at 24 hr post-fertilisation (hpf). Embryos were genotyped for both <italic>sox10</italic> alleles, which allowed us to also track the wild-type chromosomes in the cross. We noticed that two of the genotypes had expression levels for some genes on the same chromosome as <italic>sox10</italic> that were different from the other two genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The groups with higher expression shared the wild-type chromosome from the <italic>baz1</italic>/+ parent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, yellow chromosome) whereas the others shared the chromosome carrying the <italic>baz1</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, blue chromosome). One explanation for this is that there is higher expression from the <italic>si:ch73–308m11.1</italic> allele on the wild-type chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, yellow chromosome), which led us to hypothesise that the enrichment of DE genes on the mutant chromosome is not necessarily dependent on the mutant gene.</p><p>Our hypothesis is that ASE, that is, polymorphism-driven variation in expression levels of genes, is common across the genome.

We used the SAT line, which was generated from an intercross of one fully sequenced double haploid AB fish and one fully sequenced double haploid Tübingen fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Howe et al., 2013</xref>). This means that for any position in the genome there are up to two possible alleles.

We used the exome sequence of the SAT parent fish for this cross to call SNPs and identify regions that are either homozygous for the AB haplotype, homozygous for the Tübingen haplotype, or heterozygous. Using the RNA-seq reads and SNPs identified in the parental exome data, we genotyped the embryos at locations that distinguish the AB and Tübingen haplotypes. Aggregating these data in 1 Mbp regions allowed us to determine the haplotypes of each individual embryo. We identified regions of the parental genomes where at least two genotypes, and thus potentially ASE, are possible in the offspring (informative regions) and where we had sufficient read depth to unambiguously identify the haplotypes in the offspring. We grouped the 96 RNA-seq samples according to their haplotype in that region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>). Across the genome, this resulted in 82 different groupings of embryos according to local genotype. Embryos that had evidence of a recombination event within the informative region were assigned to a genotype group according to the largest contiguous section of the region.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Allele-specific expression is common in wild-type embryos.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental design.

To do this, we ran GO enrichment on two different gene lists for each experiment. The first list comprised all the DE genes and the second excluded genes on the same chromosome as the mutation. The gene harbouring the mutation was not removed if it was DE. It is important to note that removing all the genes on the same chromosome potentially removes genes that are misregulated due to the mutation as well as those caused by mutation-independent ASE; for almost all experiments it is not possible to distinguish between the two without further experimental analyses (see next section). The enrichment of GO terms from the two lists was compared using the Jaccard similarity coefficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jaccard, 1912</xref>).</p><p>These analyses showed that ASE could affect enriched GO terms, but that this effect was very variable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Ten genes showed expression patterns as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, where increased expression was linked to the presence of a specific allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and C</xref>). Only one gene (ENSDARG00000110416) located on another chromosome, encoding an miRNA, showed a similar pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

To gain mechanistic insight into gene regulatory events affected by a particular mutation, it is paramount to distinguish specific responses due to altered function of the mutated genes from other causes that change transcript abundance, such as developmental delay or technical artefacts such as batch effects. In this work, we describe a previously under-appreciated effect of ASE on the transcriptomes of zebrafish mutants. In 51 out of 124 transcriptional profiling experiments comparing zebrafish mutants and siblings at different stages of development, we found a statistically significant enrichment of DE genes on the same chromosome as the mutated gene. In a previous study using RNA-seq to map ENU mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miller et al., 2013</xref>), it was noted that very few genes were detected as being DE in regions linked to the mutation. This difference is likely the result of methodological differences between the two studies, the most significant of which is the sample size. Miller et al. used one mutant and one wild-type sample, whereas our study has a median sample size of 10 per condition.</p><p>The physical arrangement of genes in an organism’s genome is not random. Co-expression of functionally related genes using shared regulatory elements and/or transcription factors provides an evolutionary pressure to keep these genes clustered in physical proximity within a chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thévenin et al., 2014</xref>). Consequently, it is possible that a mutation affecting one gene could alter expression levels of nearby genes if they form a functionally related cluster. However, the neighbouring DE genes in the tested mutant lines showed no obvious functional connections. Of note, 7/16 chromosomal enrichments that were not linked to the mutated genes affected a chromosome 9 cluster of crystallin genes that are expressed in the eye. Instead we found that the enrichments were driven by ASE, which has been widely demonstrated across different tissues and organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Battle et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim-Hellmuth et al., 2020</xref>) and can play a role in developmental and disease processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Libioulle et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moffatt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nicolae et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>ASE is often tissue-dependent and the average log<sub>2</sub>(fold change) between alleles in human ASE is about 0.6 as measured in different tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Battle et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we have observed ASE at similar magnitudes even when averaged across all tissues through whole embryo RNA-seq. This suggests that the expression differences between alleles would be even larger when looking at individual tissues.</p><p>Zebrafish wild-type ‘strains’ are not strains in the same sense as the well-characterised inbred lines in mouse or medaka, for example. Zebrafish are highly polymorphic, such that ASE is evident even in lines that were not outcrossed to another genetic background before the experiment. Consequently, ASE could potentially impact the penetrance or expressivity of phenotypes caused by the same mutation in different genetic backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sanders and Whitlock, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sheehan-Rooney et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Young et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sheehan-Rooney et al., 2013</xref>, showed that the expression of <italic>ahsa1a</italic> differed by more than threefold in two different backgrounds (WIK and EkkWill) and was responsible for a difference in severity of the phenotype caused by a mutation in <italic>gata3</italic>. The effect of ASE is expected to be much less pronounced in RNA-seq data from inbred mouse strains in which allelic polymorphism is much less common. Indeed, in our work on RNA-seq data from mouse knockouts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collins et al., 2019</xref>), we did not observe enrichment of DE genes on the mutant chromosome. However, ASE should be considered when working with wild mouse strains, crosses between different genetic backgrounds, or indeed with any organism that isn’t fully inbred.</p><p>Given that ASE can lead to differential expression between mutants and siblings, can we correct for it in transcript profiling experiments? The solution is not as simple as removing any DE genes in the same region of the chromosome as the mutation being studied. This is because the DE genes on the same chromosome as the mutation are likely to be a mix of genuine responses to the mutation and linkage of ASE unrelated to the mutation. One way to resolve this would be to use two different mutant alleles of the same gene to generate compound heterozygotes and enable tracking of parental alleles. This would allow genotyping for both alleles and the ability therefore to also identify the different wild-type chromosomes in the cross. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, this makes it possible to distinguish between potential genuine responses to the mutation and spurious ones. Another possibility would be to identify an informative SNP in the wild-type alleles of the mutant gene being studied to allow genotyping of both the mutation and the wild-type alleles. There are also complementary approaches to investigate gene function that avoid the confounding effects of ASE. Transgenic overexpression of the gene of interest could validate true target gene responses and should leave ASE genes unaffected. Alternatively, analysing morpholino- or CRISPR/Cas9-injected G0 embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eisen and Smith, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kroll et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wu et al., 2018</xref>) should avoid the ASE effect as the injected embryos will have a mix of background alleles. Note that although using G0 CRISPR/Cas9 mutants avoids the effect of ASE, F2 fish carrying stable CRISPR/Cas9-induced mutations will again show the effects of ASE when comparing homozygous mutants to siblings.</p><p>All these methods involve extra effort and expense, as well as having their own specific caveats and drawbacks (such as off-targets effects and mosaicism), and so would need careful consideration with respect to the need to validate specific gene expression changes for the conclusions of the study. As a first step, we recommend that, whatever analysis pipeline is used, the output of DE genes contains the locations of the genes, making it possible to easily see which genes are on the same chromosome as the mutation and therefore candidates for ASE.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

id="s4-1"><title>RNA-seq and LD mapping</title><p>Eight independent mutant fish lines under study by groups at UCL (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zebrafishucl.org/">zebrafishucl.org</ext-link>) were analysed by RNA-seq in order to simultaneously gain gene expression data and to measure alleles across the genome in order to help map the causative mutation. Seven of these lines were the product of ENU random mutagenesis, one was created by a random viral insertion, and one by a targeted CRISPR insertion. An additional sample was taken from the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armant et al., 2016</xref>) at random by searching Pubmed for papers where RNA-seq data had been uploaded to the European Nucleotide Archive.</p><p>In preparation for RNA-seq, embryos or larvae were sorted into two groups based on their phenotypes (mutant and sibling), each comprising three pools of at least 15 individuals. RNA was extracted from these six samples and sequenced using the IIlumina NextSeq platform (2 × 75 bp reads, approximately 75 million reads per sample). Reads were aligned to the GRCz10 genome using HISAT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2019</xref>). To measure differential expression, transcripts were counted from the aligned RNA-seq reads using featureCounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liao et al., 2014</xref>) and compared using DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Love et al., 2014</xref>). A gene was considered DE if the adjusted p-value from DESeq2 was below 0.05.</p><p>To perform LD mapping, the three samples in each group were analysed as a single pooled sample for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by BCFtools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li, 2011</xref>), calculating the allele ratio at each SNP location. SNPs which appeared in only one of the two genotype pools were filtered out, as were those with a quality score below 100. The absolute difference between a given SNP’s mutant and sibling allele ratio indicates the degree of segregation of that allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mackay and Schulte-Merker, 2014</xref>). These values can be smoothed using LOESS, producing maps of the genome showing regions of high LD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Minevich et al., 2012</xref>). The physical location of each gene’s start codon in the GRCz10 genome assembly was downloaded from Ensembl BioMart and appended to the DESeq2 table. The LD value was estimated at each gene’s position based on interpolation of the LOESS-smoothed SNP data. Finally, a logistic regression model was used to test the effect of LD on a gene’s probability of being DE. This was performed using the Logit function of the Python module statsmodels.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>DeTCT sequencing</title><p>DeTCT libraries were generated, sequenced, and analysed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Collins et al., 2015</xref>). The resulting genomic regions and putative 3′ ends were filtered using DeTCT’s filter_output (v0.2.0)script (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/iansealy/DETCT/blob/master/script/filter_output.pl">https://github.com/iansealy/DETCT/blob/master/script/filter_output.pl</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sealy, 2020</xref>) in its <monospace>--strict</monospace> mode. <monospace>--strict</monospace> mode removes 3’ ends in coding sequence, transposons, if nearby sequence is enriched for As or if not near a primary hexamer. Regions not associated with 3′ ends are also removed. Differential expression analysis was done using DeTCT’s run_pipeline (v0.2.0)script (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/iansealy/DETCT/blob/master/script/run_pipeline.pl">https://github.com/iansealy/DETCT/blob/master/script/run_pipeline.pl</ext-link>) using DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Love et al., 2014</xref>) with an adjusted p-value cut-off of 0.05. Sequence data were deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) under accessions ERP001656, ERP004581, ERP006132, ERP003802, ERP004579, ERP005517, ERP008771, ERP005564, ERP009868, ERP006133, ERP009078, and ERP013835.

Whole genome sequencing data (SRA Study: ERP000232) was downloaded from the European Nucleotide Archive. Exome sequencing on parents for the wild-type SAT cross was done as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kettleborough et al., 2013</xref>). Reads were mapped to the GRCz11 genome assembly using BWA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li and Durbin, 2010</xref>, v0.5.10) and duplicates were marked with biobambam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tischler and Leonard, 2014</xref>). SNPs were called using a modified version of the 1000 Genomes Project variant calling pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abecasis et al., 2010</xref>). Initial calls were done by SAMtools mpileup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li, 2011</xref>), QCALL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Le and Durbin, 2011</xref>), and the GATK Unified Genotyper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DePristo et al., 2011</xref>). SNPs not called by all three callers were removed from the analysis, along with any SNP that did not pass a caller’s standard filters. Additionally, SNPs were removed where the genotype quality was lower than 100 for GATK and lower than 50 for QCALL and SAMtools mpileup and where the mean read depth per sample was less than 10. These SNP calls were then filtered for positions that are informative of the parental background in the SAT cross, that is, ones that are homozygous reference in one double haploid fish and homozygous alternate in the other.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>RNA-seq of wild-type SAT embryos</title><p>RNA was extracted from 5 dpf larvae as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wali et al., 2022</xref>). Briefly, RNA was extracted from individual embryos by mechanical lysis in RLT buffer (Qiagen) containing 1 μl of 14.3 M β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). The lysate was combined with 1.8 volumes of Agencourt RNAClean XP (Beckman Coulter) beads and allowed to bind for 10 min. The plate was applied to a plate magnet (Invitrogen) until the solution cleared and the supernatant was removed without disturbing the beads. This was followed by washing the beads three times with 70% ethanol. After the last wash, the pellet was allowed to air-dry for 10 min and then resuspended in 50 μl of RNAse-free water. RNA was eluted from the beads by applying the plate to the magnetic rack. Samples were DNase-I treated to remove genomic DNA. RNA was quantified using Quant-IT RNA assay (Invitrogen). Stranded RNA-seq libraries were constructed using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded RNA protocol after treatment with Ribozero. Libraries were pooled and sequenced on six Illumina HiSeq 2500 lanes in 75 bp paired-end mode. Sequence data were deposited in ENA under accession ERP011556. Reads for each sample were aggregated across lanes (median reads per embryo = 18.1 M) and mapped to the GRCz11 zebrafish genome assembly using TopHat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2013</xref>, v2.0.13, options: <monospace>--library-type</monospace> fr-firststrand). The data were assessed for technical quality (GC-content, insert size, proper pairs, etc.) using QoRTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hartley and Mullikin, 2015</xref>). Counts for genes were produced using htseq-count (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anders et al., 2015</xref>, v0.6.0 options: <monospace>--stranded </monospace>= reverse) with the Ensembl v97 annotation as a reference. Differential expression analysis was done in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">R Development Core Team, 2019</xref>) with DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Love et al., 2014</xref>) using a cut-off for adjusted p-values of 0.05.</p><p>The samples were genotyped at the positions that were determined to be informative using the double haploid sequence using GATK’s SplitNCigarReads tool followed by the HaplotypeCaller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Poplin et al., 2017</xref>) on the RNA-seq data. The genotype calls were converted to their strain of origin (either DHAB or DHTu) and haplotypes were called by taking the most frequent genotype call in 1 Mbp windows. Any haplotypes that were not consistent with the parental haplotypes were removed.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Formal analysis, Software, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Software, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Supervision, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Supervision, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Linkage disequilibrium (LD) mapping plots for the remaining eight lines.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="pdf" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-72825-supp1-v2.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Chromosome enrichment results.</title><p>Binomial test results for each chromosome in each experiment.</p></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-72825-supp2-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Differentially expressed genes on chromosome 9 from seven experiments that show an enrichment of differentially expressed genes on chromosome 9.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-72825-supp3-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp4"><label>Supplementary file 4.</label><caption><title>Summary of differential expression numbers by genomic region in wild-type SAT RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq).</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-72825-supp4-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp5"><label>Supplementary file 5.</label><caption><title>Summary information of DeTCT experiments.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-72825-supp5-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-72825-transrepform1-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>Sequencing data have been deposited in ENA under the accessions shown in the Materials and Methods.

White and colleagues tested the hypothesis that genes in linkage with a mutant allele might show allele-specific expression differences and thus potentially confound the interpretation of mutant effects. Using a variety of mutant and wild-type alleles with sophisticated analysis of RNA-seq data in zebrafish embryos they demonstrate over-representation of expression changes of genes in linkage with the mutant allele on the same chromosome. The authors provide Gene Ontology analyses to demonstrate how the allele-specific expression differences may impact on the interpretation of differential gene expression caused by a mutation. The data are extensive, carefully analysed and of sufficient depth and quality to support their main claim of frequent occurrence of allele-specific gene expression in outcross experiments. The findings of this study will be of interest to geneticists working with zebrafish strains or with strains of other polymorphic species.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72825.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Muller</surname><given-names>Ferenc</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03angcq70</institution-id><institution>Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences College of Medical and Dental Sciences University of Birmingham</institution></institution-wrap><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Burgess</surname><given-names>Shawn M</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00baak391</institution-id><institution>National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Muller</surname><given-names>Ferenc</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.08.06.455380">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.06.455380v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Ferenc Muller as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #3, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Shawn M Burgess (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The reviewers agreed that the authors need to strengthen the claim of the importance of misjudgement of differentially expressed genes in interpretation of RNA-seq data in order to draw conclusions on mutant gene function. The authors need to demonstrate using one of their analysed mutants (e.g. sox10 or lama1) how downstream conclusions on the function of the mutated gene drawn from the DE gene analysis may be affected if the allele-specific expression of genes in LD were not removed from the DE gene list. Such analysis does not require any wet lab work and could involve one of any of the following examples of non-comprehensive options of meta-analyses such as assessment of anatomy term enrichment, various forms of GO analysis, genetic or biochemical pathway analysis etc. of gene lists with and without what they call 'the red herrings'.</p><p>2) The authors need to discuss the publication by Miller et al., (Genome Research 2013) in the context of the distinct findings of the current manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In the discussion, I think it would be reasonable to make some more and generally declarative statements about what researchers should to either avoid these issues, control for them, or correct them.</p><p>One such argument might be to recommend an &quot;orthogonal&quot; KO approach such as morpholino or CRISPR mutagenesis directly in the injected embryos, and compare transcriptional profiling between approaches.

For a more comprehensive view we have performed an analysis across experiments. This new section (Figure 4, Lines 188-216) looks at the effect on GO enrichments when genes on the same chromosome as the mutation are removed compared with the full gene list. We find that in the same way as the effect of ASE is variable from experiment to experiment, so is the result of including or excluding the potential red herring genes. As can be expected, longer lists of differentially expressed (DE) genes are more resilient to the effect, although substantial changes to GO enrichments can also occur with long DE gene lists.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors need to discuss the publication by Miller et al., (Genome Research 2013) in the context of the distinct findings of the current manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a section to the Discussion (Lines 253-257) and also edited the Discussion slightly for brevity and clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In the discussion, I think it would be reasonable to make some more and generally declarative statements about what researchers should to either avoid these issues, control for them, or correct them.</p><p>One such argument might be to recommend an &quot;orthogonal&quot; KO approach such as morpholino or CRISPR mutagenesis directly in the injected embryos, and compare transcriptional profiling between approaches.

Using either of these techniques would mean that the ASE is effectively averaged out by the mixed genetic background of the injected embryos. We have added this to the Discussion (Lines 303-310) and made it clear that incrossing stable CRISPR lines (rather than studying injected G0 embryos) would still be subject to the effect of ASE.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>These are small concerns and do not impact my general enthusiasm for the manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>It would strengthen the paper to analyze the impact of the possibly misinterpreted differentially expressed genes near the mutant locus on the conclusions drawn from the RNA seq datasets.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a section to the results as detailed above (Lines 188-216).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>(1.)

Indeed, we cite an example of a mutation (<italic>gata3<sup>b1075</sup></italic>) with different severity in two different backgrounds, where the severity was associated with a difference in expression of a gene (<italic>ahsa1a</italic>) which acts as a suppressor of the phenotype.
