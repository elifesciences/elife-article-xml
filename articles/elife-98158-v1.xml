-Acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) is a negatively charged nine-carbon amino sugar that is often the peripheral sugar in human cell-surface glycoconjugates. Some bacteria scavenge, import, and metabolize Neu5Ac or redeploy it on their cell surfaces for immune evasion. The import of Neu5Ac by many bacteria is mediated by tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic (TRAP) transporters. We have previously reported the structures of SiaQM, a membrane-embedded component of the <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> TRAP transport system, (Currie et al., 2024). However, none of the published structures contain Neu5Ac bound to SiaQM. This information is critical for defining the transport mechanism and for further structure-activity relationship studies. Here, we report the structures of <italic>Fusobacterium nucleatum</italic> SiaQM with and without Neu5Ac. Both structures are in an inward (cytoplasmic side) facing conformation. The Neu5Ac-bound structure reveals the interactions of Neu5Ac with the transporter and its relationship with the Na<sup>+</sup> binding sites. Two of the Na<sup>+</sup>-binding sites are similar to those described previously. We identify a third metal-binding site that is further away and buried in the elevator domain. Ser300 and Ser345 interact with the C1-carboxylate group of Neu5Ac. Proteoliposome-based transport assays showed that Ser300-Neu5Ac interaction is critical for transport, whereas Ser345 is dispensable. Neu5Ac primarily interacts with residues in the elevator domain of the protein, thereby supporting the elevator with an operator mechanism. The residues interacting with Neu5Ac are conserved, providing fundamental information required to design inhibitors against this class of proteins.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>TRAP transporter</kwd><kwd>Neu5Ac binding</kwd><kwd>Sodium ion</kwd><kwd>sialic acid transport</kwd><kwd>Fusobacterium</kwd><kwd>cryo-EM</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009053</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IA/E/16/1/502999</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goyal</surname><given-names>Parveen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DBT/PR12422/MED/31/287/2014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ramaswamy</surname><given-names>Subramanian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BT/IN/Sweden/41/2013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ramaswamy</surname><given-names>Subramanian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009193</institution-id><institution>Marsden Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UOC1506</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dobson</surname><given-names>Renwick CJ</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009193</institution-id><institution>Marsden Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UOC2211</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dobson</surname><given-names>Renwick CJ</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003524</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UOCX1706</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dobson</surname><given-names>Renwick CJ</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

Neu5Ac and <italic>N</italic>-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) are the most prevalent forms in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lewis and Lewis, 2012</xref>). A dynamic interplay between genetics, environmental cues, and cell signaling orchestrates the intricate regulation of sialic acid synthesis in mammals. These sugars frequently occupy terminal positions in glycolipids and glycoproteins and play pivotal roles in cell-cell interactions such as signaling, adhesion, and recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen and Varki, 2010</xref>). Notably, a frameshift mutation disrupts the CMP-Neu5Ac hydrolase (CMAH) gene and leads to the loss of enzymatic activity, resulting in Neu5Ac being the sole outermost sugar in humans. Conversely, primates possessing a functional CMP-Neu5Ac hydrolase, Neu5Gc is typically found as the outermost sugar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chou et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>This evolutionary divergence has profound consequences for the interactions between humans and pathogenic agents, including bacteria, parasites, and viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Varki, 2009</xref>). While commensal bacteria harness Neu5Ac as a carbon source, pathogenic bacteria, such as <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> (<italic>Hi</italic>) and <italic>Fusobacterium nucleatum</italic> (<italic>Fn</italic>), evolved the ability to add Neu5Ac as the outermost sugar in their cell surface glycol-conjugates and use molecular mimicry to evade the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bell et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Severi et al., 2007</xref>). Sialic acid is abundant in many niches [e.g. Neu5Ac] in human serum is 1.6–2.2 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sillanaukee et al., 1999</xref>). However, the concentration of free sialic acid is often low (approximately 0.2% of the total), and much of the sialic acid is conjugated to other macromolecules on the cell surface and is, therefore, not immediately available. Secreted sialidases from bacteria cleave Neu5Ac from mucins and other biomolecules within their niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sillanaukee et al., 1999</xref>). Cleaved Neu5Ac is transported into the periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria via porin-like <italic>β−</italic>barrel proteins. NanC from <italic>E. coli</italic> is the best-studied porin specific for sialic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wirth et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Our groups have made significant strides in elucidating the structural intricacies of the proteins involved in sequestration, uptake, catabolism, and incorporation of Neu5Ac by bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bose et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coombes et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Currie et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davies et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Horne et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kumar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Manjunath et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">North et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gangi Setty et al., 2018</xref>). Bacteria rely on specialized Neu5Ac transporters within their cytosolic membranes, and four distinct classes of Neu5Ac transporters have been identified: sodium solute symporters (SSS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">North et al., 2018</xref>), major facilitator superfamily (MFS), ATP-binding cassette (ABC), and TRAP transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davies et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Peter et al., 2022</xref>). TRAP transporters that manifest as two- or three-component systems consisting of a substrate-binding protein (SiaP) and transmembrane protein (SiaQM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rosa et al., 2018</xref>) are of particular interest due to their absence in eukaryotes. Deleting the sialic acid transporter abolishes Neu5Ac uptake, rendering bacteria incapable of incorporating Neu5Ac into lipopolysaccharides. Without a SiaQM transporter, bacteria form defective biofilms, have a lower cell density, and experience higher cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2005</xref>). Additionally, amino acids, C4-dicarboxylates, aromatic substrates, and alpha-keto acids are also transported by TRAP transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vetting et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The first structures of SiaP were obtained from <italic>H. influenzae</italic> in an unliganded form and bound to Neu5Ac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Johnston et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Müller et al., 2006</xref>). The binding of Neu5Ac to SiaP results in the closure of the two domains of the protein and the mechanism has been described as a ‘Venus fly trap’ mechanism, a common phenomenon observed in many ligand-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Felder et al., 1999</xref>). Structural and thermodynamic analyses of SiaP from <italic>F. nucleatum</italic>, <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, and <italic>P. multocida</italic> have revealed a conserved binding site, dissociation constant of Neu5Ac in the nanomolar range, and enthalpically driven substrate binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gangi Setty et al., 2018</xref>). Using smFRET on <italic>Vc</italic>SiaP, Peter and co-workers showed that conformational switching is strictly substrate-induced and that binding of the substrate stabilizes the interactions between the two domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Peter et al., 2021</xref>). All the SiaP structures show the presence of a conserved Arginine that binds to the C1-carboxylate of Neu5Ac, and this Arg residue is critical as the high electrostatic affinity may be important to have a strong binding affinity that sequesters the small amounts that reach the bacterial periplasmic space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Glaenzer et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The second component of the TRAP transporter is the transmembrane protein SiaQM, which is characterized by two distinct domains: the Q-domain and M-domain. Two SiaQM transporter structures have been reported by cryo-EM, one from <italic>H. influenzae</italic> (<italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM) ranging from 2.95 to 4.70 Å resolution and another from <italic>Protobacterium profundum</italic> (<italic>Pp</italic>SiaQM) at 2.97 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Currie et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davies et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Peter et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The first structure of <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM (4.7 Å resolution) demonstrated that it is composed of 15 transmembrane helices (TM) and two helical hairpins. <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM likely functions as a monomeric unit, although a dimeric form has recently been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Currie et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Peter et al., 2022</xref>). Similarly, <italic>Pp</italic>SiaQM is composed of 16 TM helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davies et al., 2023</xref>). Based on these structures, an elevator-type mechanism has been proposed for TRAP transporters to move substrates from the periplasm to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Peter et al., 2024</xref>). Apart from the dimeric HiSiaQM structure, the other two structures determined used a megabody bound to SiaQM for cryo-EM analysis. In both cases, the megabody was bound to the extracellular side of the QM complex, featuring a deep open cavity on the cytosolic side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). This observation suggested that the transporter was captured in an inward-facing conformation, although the higher resolution dimeric HiSiaQM structure, even without a fiducial megabody, is also in the inward-facing conformation. Notably, the transport of Neu5Ac by TRAP transporters requires at least two sodium ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Currie et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davies et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mulligan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mulligan et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In sialic acid-rich environments such as the gut and saliva, bacterial virulence often correlates with their capacity to utilize Neu5Ac as a carbon source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Almagro-Moreno and Boyd, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Corfield, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haines-Menges et al., 2015</xref>). Although inhibitors targeting viral sialidases (neuraminidases) have been developed as antiviral agents (e.g. oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glanz et al., 2018</xref>), no drug currently targets bacterial infections by inhibiting sialic acid sequestration, uptake, catabolism, or incorporation. Human analogs of TRAP transporters are notably absent, underscoring their potential as promising therapeutic targets for combatting bacterial infections.</p><p>Both <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM and <italic>Pp</italic>SiaQM structures lack information on the Neu5Ac binding site, which was identified based on modeling studies that relied on the ligand-bound structure of <italic>Vc</italic>INDY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kinz-Thompson et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, only the structures of SiaQM in the elevator-down conformation (inward-facing) have been reported, and further conformations along the transport cycle remains to be elucidated. The conformation of Neu5Ac bound to the transport domain may provide clues as to how it is received from the substrate-binding protein. In this study, we present the cryo-EM structures of SiaQM from <italic>F. nucleatum</italic>, both in its unliganded form and Neu5Ac bound form.

Structurally, the M-domain can be divided into an outer variable scaffold domain and a centrally conserved transport domain. The scaffold domain is composed of six TM helices and serves as a support for the transport domain. It also interacts with the Q-domain to form a structurally rigid domain. The Q and scaffold domains are the least conserved among the SiaQM domains, suggesting that they are not directly involved in substrate transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether substrate binding resulted in conformational changes, we solved the structure of the ligand-bound form of <italic>Fn</italic>SiaQM. The superposition of the two structures revealed a high degree of similarity with an RMSD of 0.3 Å over all Cα atoms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). A comparison of the binding site residues revealed that they are in a similar conformation. The transporter has a large cytoplasmic facing open cavity, suggesting that the unliganded as well as Neu5Ac bound structures are in an inward-open conformations. The nomenclature used for labeling the secondary structures uses a description of the published <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM structure with similar architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Currie et al., 2024</xref>). The elevator part of the domain has one helix-loop-helix motif called HP1 (HPin), which is directed towards the cytoplasmic side. A structurally homologous helix-loop-helix domain, HP2 (HPout), is present on the periplasmic side. The arrangement of TM helices have been described in detail in <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM and <italic>Pp</italic>SiaQM structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davies et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Peter et al., 2022</xref>). Interestingly, this domain has twofold inverted symmetry, as found in other TRAP transporters. The entire domain is populated with highly conserved residues, suggesting that it may play a direct role in substrate transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). A single molecule of Neu5Ac is bound to the aperture formed by HP1 and HP2 in the central core transport domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The Neu5Ac binding site has a large solvent-exposed vestibule towards the cytoplasmic side, while its periplasmic side is sealed off. Cryo-EM map shows the presence of multiple densities that could be modeled as lipids, possibly preventing the substrate from leaving the transporter. However, the densities are not well defined to model them as specific lipids, hence they have not been modeled. We describe this as the ‘inward-facing open state’ with the substrate-bound. While, both the HP1 and HP2 loops have been hypothesized to be involved in gating, in the human neutral amino acid transporter (ASCT2), (which also uses the elevator mechanism), only the HP2 loops have been shown to undergo conformational changes to enable substrate binding and release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garaeva et al., 2019</xref>). Hence, it is suggested that there is a single gate that controls substrate binding. Superposition of the <italic>Pp</italic>SiaQM and <italic>Hi</italic>SiaQM structures do not reveal any change in these loop structures upon substrate binding. For TRAP transporters, the substrate is delivered to the QM protein by the P protein; hence, these loop changes may not play a role in ligand binding or release. This may support the idea that there is minimal substrate specificity within SiaQM and that it will transport the cargo delivered by SiaP, which is more selective.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Sodium ion binding site</title><p>The transport of molecules across the membrane by TRAP transporters depends on Na<sup>+</sup> transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Currie et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davies et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mulligan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mulligan et al., 2009</xref>).

Hence, we conservatively designated this site as a metal-binding site. The coordinated movement of different Na<sup>+</sup> ions is expected to provide the energy to create conformational changes that lead to the movement of Neu5Ac from the periplasm to the cytoplasm. While we found two Na<sup>+</sup>-binding sites and a third metal-binding site, it is not clear how the movement of these sites can cause the conformational changes required for the motion of the elevator along with the ligand. It is also unclear what the function of the third metal-binding site is beyond the mutagenesis data, which suggests that the lack of this site results in a loss of function.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Lipid binding to FnSiaQM</title><p>We have modeled two phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) lipids in the maps of unliganded <italic>Fn</italic>SiaQM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).

The carboxylate oxygens of the C1 atom of Neu5Ac interact with Ser300 and Ser345 and the main chain of Ala301 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Ser 345 OG is 3.5 Å away from the C1-carboxylate oxygen – a distance that would result in a weak interaction between the two groups.

The N5 atom of the <italic>N</italic>-acetyl group of the sugar interacts with Asp521. These interactions are conserved even if Neu5Ac is converted into Neu5Gc, as the addition of an extra hydroxyl group at the C11 position does not break this interaction, and there is sufficient cavity space for modifications in C11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

However, relatively fewer polar interactions stabilize Neu5Ac binding to the open binding pocket of SiaQM, and the affinity is probably poor.

A view of the structure of Neu5Ac bound SiaQM from the periplasmic side towards the bound Neu5Ac shows that the sugar is bound in the cavity, the entrance of which is repulsive to the binding of a negatively charged sugar like Neu5Ac. This likely prevents Neu5Ac from binding to the SiaQM from the cytoplasmic side. The structure of the protein in the outward-facing conformation is unknown, which will reveal how Neu5Ac is transferred from SiaP to SiaQM. While mechanistic questions require further investigation, the precise definition of the binding pocket provided in this work is a starting point for structure-based drug discovery.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Construct design</title><p>The gene sequence encoding the TRAP transporter from <italic>F. nucleatum</italic> (NCBI Reference Sequence: WP_005902322.1) was synthesized and cloned into a pBAD vector by GeneArt.

All the figures were either made in UCSF Chimera or PyMOL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">DeLano, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>). The final details of the data collection, processing, and results of model building and refinement are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3-9"><title>Reconstitution of FnSiaQM into proteoliposomes</title><p>Purified <italic>Fn</italic>SiaQM was reconstituted using a detergent removal method performed in batches following previously described procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wahlgren et al., 2018</xref>). In summary, 50  μg <italic>Fn</italic>SiaQM was combined with 120  μL of 10% C<sub>12</sub>E<sub>8</sub> detergent and 100  μL of 10% egg yolk phospholipids (w/v) in the form of sonicated liposomes. To this mixture, 50  mM K<sup>+</sup>-gluconate and 20  mM HEPES/Tris (pH 7.0) were added to a final volume of 700  μL. The reconstitution blend was then exposed to 0.5  g of Amberlite XAD-4 resin while continuously stirred at 1200 rev/min at 23 °C for 40 min.</p></sec><sec id="s3-10"><title>Transport measurements and transport assay</title><p>Following reconstitution, 600  μL of proteoliposomes were loaded onto a Sephadex G-75 column (0.7  cm diameter  × 15  cm height) pre-equilibrated with 20  mM HEPES/Tris (pH 7.0) containing 100  mM sucrose to balance the internal osmolarity. Valinomycin (0.75  μg/mg phospholipid) prepared in ethanol was introduced into the eluted proteoliposomes to create a K<sup>+</sup> diffusion potential. Following a 10  s incubation with valinomycin, transport was initiated by adding 5  μM [<sup>3</sup>H]-Neu5Ac, 0.5 μM <italic>Fn</italic>SiaP, and 10 mM Na<sup>+</sup>-gluconate to 100  μL of liposomes. The initial transport rate was determined by halting the reaction after 15  min, which fell within the initial linear range of [<sup>3</sup>H]-Neu5Ac uptake into the proteoliposomes, as established through the time-course experiments.</p><p>The transport assay was concluded by loading each proteoliposome sample (100  μL) onto a Sephadex G-75 column (0.6  cm diameter  × 8  cm height) to eliminate external radioactivity. The experimental values were corrected by subtracting the control, i.e., the radioactivity taken up in liposomes reconstituted in the absence of protein. The radioactivity associated with the control samples, i.e., empty liposomes was less than 10% with respect to proteoliposomes. Proteoliposomes were eluted using 1  mL of 50  mM NaCl and the collected eluate was mixed with 4  mL of scintillation mixture, followed by vortexing and counting. Data analysis was conducted using Grafit software (version 5.0.13) using the first-order equation for time-course analysis. As specified in the figure legend, all measurements are presented as mean±s.d. from at least three independent experiments.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information"

This is one of most mechanistically fascinating transporter families, by means of its QM domain (the domain reported in his manuscript) operating as a monomeric 'elevator', and its P domain functioning as a substrate-binding 'operator' that is required to deliver the substrate to the QM domain; together, this is termed an 'elevator with an operator' mechanism. Remarkably, previous structures had not demonstrated the substrate Neu5Ac bound. In addition, they confirm the previously reported Na+ binding sites, and report a new metal binding site in the transporter, which seems to be mechanistically relevant. Finally, they mutate the substrate binding site and use proteoliposomal uptake assays to show the mechanistic relevance of the proposed substrate binding residues.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The structures are of good quality, the presentation of the structural data has improved, the functional data is robust, the text is well-written, and the authors are appropriately careful with their interpretations. Determination of a substrate bound structure is an important achievement and fills an important gap in the 'elevator with an operator' mechanism.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Although the possibility of the third metal site is compelling, I do not feel it is appropriate to model in a publicly deposited PDB structure without directly confirming experimentally. The authors do not extensively test the binding sites due to technical limitations of producing relevant mutants; however, their model is consistent with genetic assays of previously characterized orthologs, which will be of benefit to the field.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.98158.4.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Goyal</surname><given-names>Parveen</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bangalore</named-content></addr-line><country>India</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Dhanabalan</surname><given-names>KanagaVijayan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Purdue University West Lafayette</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">West Lafayette</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Scalise</surname><given-names>Mariafrancesca</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Calabria</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Arcavacata di Rende</named-content></addr-line><country>Italy</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Friemann</surname><given-names>Rosmarie</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Gothenburg</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Gothenburg</named-content></addr-line><country>Sweden</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Indiveri</surname><given-names>Cesare</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Calabria</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Arcavacata di Rende,</named-content></addr-line><country>Italy</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Dobson</surname><given-names>Renwick CJ</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Canterbury</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Christchurch</named-content></addr-line><country>New Zealand</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Vinothkumar</surname><given-names>Kutti R</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>National Centre for Biological Sciences</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bangalore</named-content></addr-line><country>India</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Subramanian</surname><given-names>Ramaswamy</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Purdue University West Lafayette</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">West Lafayette</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript reports the substrate-bound structure of SiaQM from F. nucleatum, which is the membrane component of a Neu5Ac-specific Tripartite ATP-dependent Periplasmic (TRAP) transporter. Until recently, there was no experimentally derived structural information regarding the membrane components of TRAP transporter, limiting our understanding of the transport mechanism. Since 2022, there have been 3 different studies reporting the structures of the membrane components of Neu5Ac-specific TRAP transporters. While it was possible to narrow down the binding site location by comparing the structures to proteins of the same fold, a structure with substrate bound has been missing. In this work, the authors report the Na+-bound state and the Na+ plus Neu5Ac state of FnSiaQM, revealing information regarding substrate coordination. In previous studies, 2 Na+ ion sites were identified. Here, the authors also tentatively assign a 3rd Na+ site. The authors reconstitute the transporter to assess the effects of mutating the binding site residues they identified in their structures. Of the 2 positions tested, only one of them appears to be critical to substrate binding.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The main strength of this work is the capture of the substrate bound state of SiaQM, which provides insight into an important part of the transport cycle.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The main weakness is the lack of experimental validation of the structural findings. The authors identified the Neu5Ac binding site, but only test 2 residues for their involvement in substrate interactions, which is quite limited. However, comparison with previous mutagenesis studies on homologues supports the location of the Neu5Ac binding site. The authors tentatively identified a 3rd Na+ binding site, which if true would be an impactful finding, but this site was not sufficiently experimentally tested for its contribution to Na+ dependent transport. This lack of experimental validation prevents the authors from unequivocally assigning this site as a Na+ binding site. However, the reporting of these new data is important as it will facilitate follow up studies by the authors or other researchers.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>Overall, the authors have done a good job of addressing the reviewers' comments. It's good to know that the authors are working on the characterisation of the potential metal binding site mutants - characterizing just a few of these will provide much-needed experimental support for this potential Na+ site.</p><p>The new MD simulations provide additional support for the new Na+ site and could be included.</p><p>However, as the authors know, direct experimental characterisation of mutants is the ideal evidence of the Na+ site.</p><p>Aside from the characterisation of mutants, which seems to be held up by technical issues, the only remaining issue is the comparison of the Na+- and Na+/Neu5Ac-bound states with ASCT2. It still does not make sense to me why the authors are not directly comparing their Na+ only and Na+/Neu5Ac states with the structures of VcINDY in the Na+-only and Na+/succinate bound states. These VcINDY structures also revealed no conformational changes in the HP loops upon binding succinate, as the authors see for SiaQM. Therefore, this comparison is very supportive. It is understood that the similarity to the DASS structure is mentioned on p.17, but it is also interesting and useful to note that TRAP and DASS transporters also share a lack of substrateinduced local conformational changes, to the extent these things have been measured.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the summary weakness that experimental data to support the third Na binding site is critical.</p><p>Based on the reviewer’s suggestion, we added the following in the main text and a supplementary figure comparing the Na ion binding sites between VcINDY and SiaQM. Page 13.</p><p>“These two sodium ion binding sites are also conserved in the structure of VcINDY (Supplementary Figure 7) (Sauer et al., 2022). In both cases, the sodium ions are bound at the helix-loop-helix ends of HP1 and HP2. The binding sites utilize both side chains and main chain carbonyl groups. The number of main chain carbonyl interactions suggests that they are critical, and using main chain rather than side chain interactions minimizes the likelihood of point mutations affecting the binding.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>The manuscript by Goyal et al report substrate-bound and substrate-free structures of a tripartite ATP independent periplasmic (TRAP) transporter from a previously uncharacterized homolog, F. nucleatum. This is one of most mechanistically fascinating transporter families, by means of its QM domain (the domain reported in his manuscript) operating as a monomeric 'elevator', and its P domain functioning as a substrate-binding 'operator' that is required to deliver the substrate to the QM domain; together, this is termed an 'elevator with an operator' mechanism.</p><p>Remarkably, previous structures had not demonstrated the substrate Neu5Ac bound. In addition, they confirm the previously reported Na+ binding sites, and report a new metal binding site in the transporter, which seems to be mechanistically relevant. Finally, they mutate the substrate binding site and use proteoliposomal uptake assays to show the mechanistic relevance of the proposed substrate binding residues.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The structures are of good quality, the presentation of the structural data has improved, the functional data is robust, the text is well-written, and the authors are appropriately careful with their interpretations. Determination of a substrate bound structure is an important achievement and fills an important gap in the 'elevator with an operator' mechanism.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Although the possibility of the third metal site is compelling, I do not feel it is appropriate to model in a publicly deposited PDB structure without directly confirming experimentally. The authors do not extensively test the binding sites due to technical limitations of producing relevant mutants; however, their model is consistent with genetic assays of previously characterized orthologs, which will be of benefit to the field. Finally, some clarifications of EM processing would be useful to readers, and it would be nice to have a figure visualizing the unmodeled lipid densities - this would be important to contextualize to their proposed mechanism.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>I appreciate the authors' responses to our critiques; the revised manuscript is much improved and has addressed most of my concerns. I look forward to seeing their follow up experiments testing mutational e=ects. I think MD simulations of ion-binding sites on their own are supportive but by themselves not su=icient to prove the existence of a functional Na+-binding site. Some clarifications in the methods/supplements would satisfy my concerns about data processing and analysis.</p><p>- Unliganded map: were the 141,272 particles used for one class of ab initio? This is unusual, usually multiple ab initio classes are used to further eliminate junk particles. The authors themselves use 6 classes for the substrate-bound dataset.</p></disp-quote><p>We classified the particles into multiple 3-D classes. There was no improvement in statistics or maps on splitting these further. Hence, we did not pursue that further.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Substrate-bound map: how did the four 'identical' classes independently refine? Are similar Na+/substate densities found in each separate class?</p></disp-quote><p>The other classes refined to worse than 4.5 Å resolution. We stopped characterizing them past that point. We were hoping to see multiple conformations that are diLerent – and hopefully a class where only two sodium ions could be bound. However, any interpretation at 4.5 Å would be unreliable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Both maps: all ab initio classes prior to final refinement should be displayed in the supplementary workflow, this is common for EM processing diagrams.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree it is common – however, unless there is a good reason to discuss the other classes, we are not convinced of the value of crowding the figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- What specific refinement package and version of Phenix are the authors using? It seems unusual that it is not possible to refine without a metal in Phenix real-space refinement, I have seen many structures where there is no issue refining without critical ions/waters. The authors should double check that they are using the appropriate scattering table for cryo-EM, which should be &quot;electron&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for the confusion – we did not mean to say we cannot refine without a metal. If we want to add something to the density, we cannot refine it without suggesting a metal or solvent. The site without anything added will refine without any issues but in the absence of additional verification, we cannot be sure of the identity of the ions. We are confident of the metal binding site – but not confident of the exact metal bound. We used Sodium as our first hypothesis.</p><p>We don’t think the scattering factors will help in the identification of the ions. Servalcat as part of CCP-EM can produce diLerence maps and we believe that for identification of ions, it will require higher resolution (&lt;2.5 Å) but at this resolution, we can say that there is a nonprotein density but not more than that. We were using “electron” (which we believe is default with phenix.real_space_refine). The refinement was performed using standard protocols and appropriate scattering factors (Phenix version 1.19x), and we have previously used similar refinement protocols for other maps/models (Example -Vinothkumar KR, Arya CK, Ramanathan G, Subramanian R. 2021.

A common way to show this is to show the density proximal to protein chains in one color, and the remaining densities in a contrasting color (Figure 1 somewhat demonstrates this but it is di=icult to tell). I think this would be a nice figure to show the presence and location of unmodeled densities.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified supplementary figure 3 to include unmodelled densities in panels G and H for both structures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Small detail, &quot;uniform&quot; is misspelled as &quot;unifrom&quot; in supplementary Figure 3.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you.
