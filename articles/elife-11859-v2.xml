crucial to ciliogenesis and cilia maintenance. Active Arl3 is involved in targeting and releasing lipidated cargo proteins from their carriers PDE6δ and UNC119a/b to the cilium. However, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) which activates Arl3 is unknown. Here we show that the ciliary G-protein Arl13B mutated in Joubert syndrome is the GEF for Arl3, and its function is conserved in evolution. The GEF activity of Arl13B is mediated by the G-domain plus an additional C-terminal helix. The switch regions of Arl13B are involved in the interaction with Arl3. Overexpression of Arl13B in mammalian cell lines leads to an increased Arl3·GTP level, whereas Arl13B Joubert-Syndrome patient mutations impair GEF activity and thus Arl3 activation. We anticipate that through Arl13B’s exclusive ciliary localization, Arl3 activation is spatially restricted and thereby an Arl3·GTP compartment generated where ciliary cargo is specifically released.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11859.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11859.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11859.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most types of cells in humans and other animals have slender, hair-like structures known as cilia that project out of the cell surface. These structures sense and respond to signals from the external environment and are crucial for organisms to develop normally. Defects in cilia can lead to many serious conditions such as Joubert syndrome, which affects the development of the brain and other organs in humans.</p><p>The Arl family of “G-proteins” play important roles in the formation and operation of cilia. They contain a section called a G-protein domain whose activity can be switched on by interactions with other proteins called guanine nucleotide exchange factors (or GEFs for short). A member of the Arl family called Arl3 is found in higher amounts in cilia than in other parts of the cell. It is involved in the transport of proteins to the cilia from other parts of the cell, but it is not known which GEFs are able to activate it.</p><p>Here, Gotthardt, Lokaj et al. used several biochemical techniques to show that another member of the Arl family called Arl13B actually acts as a GEF to activate Arl3 in cilia. Arl13B is only found in cilia and the GEF activity relies on its G-protein domain and another element at one end called a C-terminal helix. Previous studies have shown that mutations in the gene that encodes Arl13B can cause Joubert syndrome in humans. Gotthardt, Lokaj et al. found that mutant forms of Arl13B had significantly lower GEF activity than normal Arl13B proteins.</p><p>Together, Gotthardt, Lokaj et al.’s findings provide an explanation for why Arl3 is only activated in cilia even though it is found throughout the cell. Further work is needed to understand how the activity of Arl13B is regulated.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11859.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11859.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic></kwd><kwd>G-protein</kwd><kwd>Arf-like proteins</kwd><kwd>Guanine nucleotide exchange factor</kwd><kwd>cilium</kwd><kwd>protein trafficking</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ARCID 268782</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gotthardt</surname><given-names>Katja</given-names></name><name><surname>Lokaj</surname><given-names>Mandy</given-names></name><name><surname>Koerner</surname><given-names>Carolin</given-names></name><name><surname>Wittinghofer</surname><given-names>Alfred</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GI 770/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Falk</surname><given-names>Nathalie</given-names></name><name><surname>Gießl</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hertha und Helmut Schmauser Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id/><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Falk</surname><given-names>Nathalie</given-names></name><name><surname>Gießl</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Universitaetsbund Erlangen-Nuernberg E.V.</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id/><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Falk</surname><given-names>Nathalie</given-names></name><name><surname>Gießl</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The ciliary G-protein Arl13B – which is often mutated in Joubert syndrome – is the Guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the G-protein Arl3 and exclusively localizes to cilia.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Primary cilia are highly conserved organelles essential for developmental signalling pathways and cellular homeostasis. The small G-proteins of the Arl family Arl3, Arl6 and Arl13B have been shown to be important in the trafficking of ciliary proteins and structural integrity of the cilium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2012</xref>). Mutations in Arl proteins or their regulators can lead to cilia dysfunction causing ciliopathies such as Joubert syndrome (JS), Bardet–Biedl syndrome (BBS), or retinitis pigmentosa (RP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cantagrel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chiang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schwahn et al., 1998</xref>). Different ciliopathies are characterized by overlapping phenotypes such as renal cysts, polydactyly, brain malfunction, situs inversus, and vision impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Waters and Beales, 2011</xref>). Mutations in Arl6 –the first member of the Arl family found mutated in a human ciliopathy – cause BBS, whereas mutations in Arl13B lead to JS. JS in particular is characterized by a brain malformation with a characteristic molar tooth sign combined with polydactyly and kidney cysts. Although no mutations in Arl3 have been identified so far in ciliopathies Arl3<sup>(-/-)</sup> mice exhibit a ciliopathy related phenotype and die by 3 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schrick et al., 2006</xref>). One of the X-linked RP genes is RP2, which functions as a GTPase activating protein (GAP) specific for Arl3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Veltel et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>As most small G-proteins Arl3 cycles between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound forms and in the latter it binds specifically to effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cherfils and Zeghouf, 2013</xref>). Effectors of Arl3 are the carrier proteins PDE6δ, which binds farnesylated and geranylgeranylated cargo, and Unc119a/b, which binds myristoylated cargo. Binding of activated Arl3 to the cargo-carrier complex induces conformational changes leading to the release of the cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ismail et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wright et al., 2011</xref>). A close structural homologue of Arl3 is Arl2, which binds to the same set of effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Van Valkenburgh et al., 2001</xref>). However, while Arl2 and Arl3 can release cargo such as Ras or RheB, only Arl3 is able to release ciliary cargo such as INPP5E, NPHP3, and GNAT-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ismail et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Thomas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wright et al., 2011</xref>). The highly conserved Arl3 − only present in ciliated organisms – localizes throughout the cell and is enriched in the primary cilium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avidor-Reiss et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blacque et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhou et al., 2006</xref>). While RP2 functions as an Arl3 GAP and is thus important for the import of lipidated cargo by recycling Arl3 and its effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schwarz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wright et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>), the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that activates Arl3 remains unknown. We had anticipated that in order for Arl3 to mediate cargo release inside cilia, an Arl3-specific GEF should be localized there as well.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To identify regulatory proteins of Arl3 we employed a yeast-2-hybrid (Y2H) screen using the fast cycling mutant Arl3△N<sup>D129N</sup> as bait. The homologous mutation which in Ras was shown to decrease nucleotide and to increase GEF affinity while maintaining its ability to bind to effectors was used by us to identify the GEF for the plant specific ROP proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berken et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cool et al., 1999</xref>). Screening a mouse retinal cDNA Y2H library identified several clones growing on selective media. Sequence analysis revealed Arl13B (residues 1–270) in addition to known Arl3 effectors such as PDE6δ and Unc119a. Intriguingly, in a parallel screen with mouse Arl13B<sup>20-278</sup> as bait Arl3 was found as rescuing clone. The interaction between Arl3 and Arl13B was further verified by directed 1:1 Y2H analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Arl13B is an unusual Arl protein containing a C-terminal coiled-coil and proline rich region in addition to its G-domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The data show that the interaction is mediated by Arl13B’s G-domain and part of the coiled-coil region. To investigate the specificity of the Arl13B-Arl3 interaction we tested the related constructs of Arl2 and Arl6 neither of which enabled growth on selective medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11859.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The interaction between ADP-ribosylation-factor-like (Arl) 13B (Arl13B) and Arl3 was identified in a yeast-2-hybrid (Y2H) screen.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Y2H interactions between Arl3ΔN D129N -pBD and Arl13B 1-–270-pAD and between Arl13B 20- – 278-pBD and Arl3-pAD.

The dissociation of a fluorescent GDP-analogue (mantGDP) from <italic>Cr</italic>Arl3 in the presence of excess of unlabelled GTP was monitored after adding <italic>Cr</italic>Arl13B·GTP.

The observed rate constants of mantGDP-dissociation showed a hyperbolic dependence on <italic>Cr</italic>Arl13B concentration, with a maximum release rate of 0.86 × 10<sup>-2</sup> sec. The K<sub>M</sub> for the reaction is 1.1 µM for <italic>Cr</italic>Arl13B·GTP and 155 µM for <italic>Cr</italic>Arl13B·GDP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) showing that <italic>Cr</italic>Arl13B·GTP has a higher affinity than <italic>Cr</italic>Arl13B·GDP. Since the in vitro determined maximal nucleotide release stimulation of 70-fold appears relatively slow but not unusual, it is quite conceivable that additional factors such as the presence of membranes or lipids enhance the GEF activity as shown for the Ras-GEF SOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gureasko et al., 2008</xref>) and other GEFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cabrera et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pasqualato et al., 2002</xref>). Since Arl3 has a high affinity to membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kapoor et al., 2015</xref>) and Arl13B is palmitoylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cevik et al., 2010</xref>) the reaction between them is thus most likely orchestrated on the ciliary membrane.</p><p>Next, we employed x-ray crystallography to elucidate the structural basis for the interaction. We thus co-crystallized <italic>Cr</italic>Arl13B·GppNHp and <italic>Cr</italic>Arl3·GDP in the presence of alkaline phosphatase in order to allow formation of nucleotide free <italic>Cr</italic>Arl3. Since <italic>Cr</italic>Arl13B requires bound nucleotide for stability (and most likely for activity) complex formation could not be performed with nucleotide free Arl3 GEF-substrate. The obtained crystals diffracted to 2.5Å and the structure was solved by molecular replacement showing one complex in the asymmetric unit (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). Although crystallization was done in the presence of alkaline phosphatase GppNHp was clearly visible in both active sites, suggesting that the structure represents the post-nucleotide-exchange state. The nucleotide dependency of <italic>Cr</italic>Ar13B’s GEF activity suggested that switch I and II contribute to the interface. The structure shows indeed that a major part of the interaction is mediated by switch I and II of <italic>Cr</italic>Arl13B which contact <italic>Cr</italic>Arl3 via α4<sup>Arl3</sup>, β6<sup>Arl3</sup>, and α5<sup>Arl3</sup> located opposite to the nucleotide binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, 3E</xref>).

In the crystal structure the nucleotide binding site of <italic>Cr</italic>Arl3 is not directly contacted by <italic>Cr</italic>Arl13B. We were not able to trap the interacting residues presumably due to the presence of nucleotide and/or the flexibility of the interacting residues of Arl13B. Considering the length of the C-terminus required for catalysis (see below) it is however suggestive that the mobile C-terminus of Arl13B is involved in the GEF reaction by contacting the relevant surface of Arl3. To examine the importance of this region for catalysis we prepared deletion constructs with differing length of the α6-helix (see red asterisks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Whereas the C-terminal deletion constructs △233(18–232) and △243(18–242) had no effect, a longer deletion to residue 220(18–219) showed a reduced stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Finally, the GEF activity of △213(18–212) and △203(18–202) was completely abolished. In support of their importance residues 212–228 are highly conserved among species and we would speculate that these residues contact Arl3 close to the nucleotide binding site.</p><p>We next decided to demonstrate the GEF activity of Arl13B in mammalian cells. Therefore we used a stably transfected murine inner medullary collecting duct 3 (IMCD3) cell line and transiently transfected HEK293 cells overexpressing human Arl13B-GFP. To quantify Arl3 activation, Arl3·GTP was affinity-precipitated with the effector GST-PDE6δ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Linari et al., 1999</xref>) and analysed by immunoblot. The level of endogenous Arl3·GTP was strikingly increased in cells overexpressing Arl13B compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Furthermore, the level of GTP-bound Arl3-Flag depended on the Arl13B concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Consistent with the Y2H data the Arl2·GTP level was not affected by overexpressed Arl13B indicating selectivity for Arl3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Interface mutations in Arl13B which disrupted the in vitro exchange activity were also tested in HEK293 cells. Consistently, cells transfected with Arl13B<sup>K216E/R219E</sup>, Arl13B<sup>Y55A</sup> or Arl13B<sup>Y85A</sup> did not markedly increase the Arl3·GTP level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). Intriguingly, the Arl3·GTP level in cells overexpressing the Joubert mutant variants Arl13B<sup>R79Q</sup> and Arl13B<sup>R200C</sup> was lower than those expressing Arl13B<sup>wt</sup>. Consistent with the biochemical data the R79Q mutation impaired Arl3 activation was more pronounced than R200C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>). Finally, we were able to purify human Arl13B (18–278) from insect cells in reasonable amounts to test its GEF activity.

Here we describe a molecular function for Arl13B acting as GEF for Arl3 whereby the nucleotide state of Arl13B determines its catalytic activity in this activation cascade.</p><p>Our results have important implications for the regulation of sorting and transport processes into cilia. It has been shown earlier that Arl3 but not Arl2 can release ciliary cargo from the transport proteins PDE6δ and Unc119 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ismail et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wright et al., 2011</xref>). One would predict that Arl3, which is enriched in cilia but also in other microtubule dense structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grayson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhou et al., 2006</xref>), is only activated inside cilia where Arl13B exclusively resides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blacque et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caspary et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Duldulao et al., 2009</xref>) in order to avoid release of ciliary prenylated and myristoylated cargo in the cytoplasm, where other cargo such as Ras, RheB, or Src kinases can be released by Arl2. The observation that expression of constitutive active ARL-3 (Q70L/Q72L) in <italic>Lieshmania donovani</italic> and in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> resulted in decreased flagellum length and in impaired ciliogenesis might be explained by Arl3-GTP being located all over the cell and by subsequent mistargeting of proteins destined for the cilium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cuvillier et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The different subcellular localization of Arl3-GAP and GEF resembles very closely the Ran driven nucleocytoplasmic transport system. Nucleocytoplasmic transport through the nuclear pore is regulated by a Ran gradient across the nuclear pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Stewart, 2007</xref>). This gradient is regulated by the Ran-GEF RCC1, which is retained inside the nucleus, and by the major form of Ran-GAP, which is located at the exit side of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), by binding to RanBP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mahajan et al., 1997</xref>). Import cargo bound to importins is released from the carrier by Ran·GTP. The export complex formed by the exportin-cargo complex is in turn stabilized by Ran·GTP and dissociated after exit from the NPC and hydrolysis of GTP. Since the Arl3 specific GAP RP2 is absent from primary cilia and enriched in the preciliary region as observed by us and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blacque et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Evans et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grayson et al., 2002</xref>), we can assume that a similar Arl3·GTP gradient exists across the transition zone and that the Arl3·GTP compartment inside cilia creates a driving force for the transport of prenylated and myristoylated proteins which are allosterically released by Arl3·GTP from their carrier proteins PDE6δ and Unc119a/b (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> for a schematic overview). The Ran-GEF RCC1 is retained in the nucleus through its interaction with nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nemergut et al., 2001</xref>). In the case of Arl13B, the N-terminal palmitoylation site, but also the other domains seem to be indispensable for its ciliary localization and retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cevik et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Duldulao et al., 2009</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11859.013</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>The targeting cycle of Arl3 dependent ciliary cargo.</title><p>In the cilium where Arl13B resides Arl3 gets activated. Through the exclusive localization of Arl13B (Arl3-GEF [guanine nucleotide exchange factor]) inside and retinitis pigmentosa 2 (RP2) (Arl3-GAP) outside the cilium an Arl3·GTP gradient is generated across the transition zone. The carriers PDEδ and Unc119a/b bound to ciliary lipidated cargo reach the cilium where Arl3·GTP binds to the carrier proteins and releases the cargo. RP2 -– enriched in the preciliary region – stimulates the hydrolysis of Arl3·GTP which leads to the dissociation of the carrier proteins from Arl3·GDP.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11859.013">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11859.013</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-11859-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>Since Arl13B’s GEF activity is higher in the GTP-bound conformation one may ask if and how the nucleotide status of Arl13B itself is regulated. We have shown before that the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis activity of Arl13B is very low and that the protein active site does not contain a catalytic glutamine residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Miertzschke et al., 2014</xref>). Although we cannot exclude that an Arl13B specific GAP would supply catalytic residues an alternative explanation would be that Arl13B in the absence of GTP hydrolysis is mostly in the GTP-bound form. This does not exclude the existence of an Arl13B-GEF which is presently unknown.</p><p>Since both the mutations of the Arl3-GAP RP2 in RP and the Arl3-GEF Arl13B in JSyndrome lead to ciliary defects and ciliopathies, we conclude that the amount of Arl3·GTP needs to be precisely regulated and that both an increase and a decrease of Arl3·GTP is not tolerated for proper function of the cilium.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast techniques</title><p>Mouse retina cDNA library was generated according to 'Mate&amp;Plate' Library System User Manual (Clonetech), cloned into pGADT7 (short: pAD) and introduced into <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Y187.

Your article has been reviewed by Richard Aldrich (Senior editor), David Clapham (Reviewing editor), and three peer reviewers. One of the three reviewers, DickGörlich (reviewer# 3), has agreed to reveal his identity.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Gotthardt et al. identifies Arl13b as the GEF for Arl3 and describes a comprehensive interaction, activity and structural investigation of the two proteins. Arl13b is a G-protein residing in the cilium and is often used as a marker to visualize cilia. However, the molecular function of Arl13b is not known. Arl3 is another G-protein that is required for proper cilium function and is specifically involved in the transport of lipidated cargo proteins to the cilium. The authors of the manuscript carried out yeast-2-hybrid analysis using a mouse retinal cDNA library whereby they identified an interaction between Arl3 and Arl13b. Using recombinantly purified <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> proteins, for which the solubility was apparently better, it is convincingly shown that Arl13b is indeed a GEF for Arl3. The crystal structure of the complex is also presented and numerous structure-based or disease causing mutations are tested for their impact on GEF activity. The crystal structure represents the post-catalytic state of the complex (Arl3 in a GTP-analog bound state) and thus does not reveal any direct mechanistic insights into the GEF mechanism. The structure does however reveal the molecular basis for Arl3-Arl13b interaction and suggest that residues following a coiled-coil region of Arl13b may be responsible for interaction with the Arl3 G-site, a notion that is confirmed using truncated Arl13b protein in GEF assays. Finally, the manuscript presents the impact of over-expression of WT or mutant Arl13b on the level of Arl3-GTP in different human cell lines and also demonstrates GEF activity for the human proteins pointing to an evolutionarily conserved mechanism.</p><p>Essential revision:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and corresponding legend are confusing.
