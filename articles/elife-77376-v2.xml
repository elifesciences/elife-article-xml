migration, and differentiation. Despite their hydrophobic nature, Wnt proteins exert their function over long distances to induce paracrine signalling. Recent studies have identified several factors involved in Wnt secretion; however, our understanding of how Wnt ligands are transported between cells to interact with their cognate receptors is still debated. Here, we demonstrate that gastric cancer cells utilise cytonemes to transport Wnt3 intercellularly to promote proliferation and cell survival. Furthermore, we identify the membrane-bound scaffolding protein Flotillin-2 (Flot2), frequently overexpressed in gastric cancer, as a modulator of these cytonemes. Together with the Wnt co-receptor and cytoneme initiator Ror2, Flot2 determines the number and length of Wnt3 cytonemes in gastric cancer. Finally, we show that Flotillins are also necessary for Wnt8a cytonemes during zebrafish embryogenesis, suggesting a conserved mechanism for Flotillin-mediated Wnt transport on cytonemes in development and disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Wnt</kwd><kwd>cytoneme</kwd><kwd>gastric cancer</kwd><kwd>signalling</kwd><kwd>plasma membrane</kwd><kwd>lipid rafts</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/N0137941/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Routledge</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name><name><surname>Scholpp</surname><given-names>Steffen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/S007970/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scholpp</surname><given-names>Steffen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/S016295/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scholpp</surname><given-names>Steffen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/R026424/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Phesse</surname><given-names>Toby J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Signalling filopodia, also known as cytonemes, are a crucial transport mechanism of Wnt3 in gastric cancer and their emergence is controlled by Flot2.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Wnt/β-catenin signalling activity has been well-characterised in the glands of the gastrointestinal epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clevers, 2013</xref>). In these intestinal crypts, the expression of Wnt/β-catenin target genes occurs in a gradient, with the highest activity at the base of the crypt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Muñoz et al., 2012</xref>). Here, Paneth cells are located between the intestinal stem cells and regulate proliferation by producing high levels of Wnt3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sato et al., 2011</xref>). Genomic analysis suggests that in about 50% of gastric tumours, the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is deregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koushyar et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In many gastric carcinomas, Wnt3 expression is elevated compared with normal gastric epithelium, leading to increased proliferation in the tumour mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Voloshanenko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). In development, Wnt proteins can spread over a distance of many cells despite their hydrophobic nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Routledge and Scholpp, 2019</xref>). However, how lipid-modified Wnt3 is disseminated in gastric tumour tissues is unclear.</p><p>Recently, thin and actin-rich membranous protrusions known as cytonemes have been identified as crucial for transporting essential signalling components between cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kornberg and Roy, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang and Scholpp, 2019</xref>). For example, in zebrafish embryogenesis, cytonemes are highly dynamic. They have been reported to transport Wnt components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stanganello et al., 2015</xref>), while in the chick limb bud, cytonemes transport Shh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sanders et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, Wnt/PCP signalling in the source cell facilitates the emergence of long and stable Wnt-transporting cytonemes, promoting paracrine Wnt signal activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mattes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brunt et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Similar to Wnt3, Flot2 is linked to tumour development and proliferation, and its expression is increased in gastric cancer (GC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhu et al., 2013</xref>). Flotillins are highly conserved, membrane-bound scaffolding proteins, which cluster in detergent-resistant, cholesterol-rich regions of the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stuermer et al., 2001</xref>). These Flotillin microdomains act as platforms to facilitate protein-protein interactions and regulate growth factor signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banning, 2014</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> Flotillin-2/Reggie-1 (Flot2) promotes long-range spreading and signalling of the lipophilic ligands, Wingless (Wg) and Hedgehog (Hh) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Katanaev et al., 2008</xref>), and Flot2 can promote the formation of Hh cytonemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bischoff et al., 2013</xref>). In cancer cell lines, Flot2 also facilitates the formation of filopodia-like protrusions via direct regulation of the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Neumann-Giesen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gauthier-Rouvière et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we found that human GC cells use cytonemes to disseminate Wnt3 proteins intercellularly. We further detected that these Wnt3-bearing cytonemes are dependent on Flot2 function. Our data suggest that the Flot2 function is required for intracellular trafficking and signalling of the Wnt co-receptor Ror2, a key regulator of cytoneme formation. In accordance with our results in GC cells, we identified Flotillins as modulators of Wnt8a cytoneme emergence in zebrafish development, suggesting a conserved role for Flot2 in Wnt cytoneme emergence in vertebrates.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Gastric cancer cells utilise cytonemes for paracrine Wnt3 signalling</title><p>First, we examined the gastric adenocarcinoma cell lines MKN-28, MKN-7, and AGS and compared these to a gastric epithelial cell line HFE-145 for their potential to form actin-based protrusions. All GC cells form many dynamic actin-based filopodia, and AGS cells display the longest filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Next, we asked if GC cells use these filopodial protrusions to mobilise Wnt3 ligands. Using our advanced filopodia fixation and immunohistochemistry (IHC) protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rogers and Scholpp, 2021</xref>), we observed that HFE-145 have numerous protrusions, which are decorated with Wnt3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In the cancer cell lines, Wnt3 localisation was enriched on these filopodia and more often detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). Specifically, the AGS line shows an increased number of Wnt3 cytonemes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>); therefore, we used AGS in the further analysis. Over-expression of Wnt3 in AGS led to an even further increased Wnt3 staining on more filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). With the same fixation protocol and imaging settings, we could not detect Wnt3 localisation at the plasma membrane and on filopodia after treatment of AGS cells with the porcupine (PORCN) inhibitor IWP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), suggesting that PORCN-dependent palmitoylation is essential for localisation of Wnt3 on these actin-based protrusions. Similar to the endogenous protein, we found that Wnt3-mCherry is transported along filopodia and localises to their tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Gastric epithelial normal and cancer cell lines utilise cytonemes to transport Wnt3 intercellularly.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Confocal images of normal gastric epithelial cell line (HFE-145) and gastric cancer (GC) cell lines (MKN-28, MKN-7, and AGS) expressing LifeAct-GFP to visualise actin-based structures.

In particular, Myosin-X (MyoX) is localised to the tips of the filopodia and is known to facilitate filopodia growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berg and Cheney, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bohil et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, MyoX has been shown to be involved in Shh cytoneme function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hall et al., 2021</xref>). IHC analysis revealed that AGS cytonemes are decorated with MyoX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). After covalent attachment of a mono-unsaturated palmitoleate, Wnts can bind to Evi/Wntless in the ER to facilitate intracellular transport to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartscherer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bänziger et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, we asked if Evi/Wntless is also localised on Wnt3 signalling filopodia. First, we observed that Evi/Wntless could be found on many filopodia of AGS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Furthermore, we found that Wnt3 and Evi/Wntless co-localise on these filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). We conclude that Wnt3 can be loaded on the filopodia-like protrusion, which we termed cytonemes, based on their definition as signalling filopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kornberg and Roy, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mattes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang and Scholpp, 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Wnt3 cytonemes regulate paracrine Wnt/β-catenin signalling in gastric cancer cells</title><p>Next, we assessed the functional impact of Wnt3 cytonemes on paracrine Wnt signalling in GC cells by performing a cocultivation assay of Wnt-producing AGS cells and Wnt-receiving HFE-145 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Here, HFE-145 cells were transfected with the Wnt SuperTOPFlash (STF) reporter, while AGS cells were transfected with GFP-tagged constructs to manipulate Wnt3 cytonemes. Indeed, increased Wnt3 can be detected in HFE-145 expressing the reporter in co-culture with AGS cells compared to HFE-145 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To specifically block cytoneme formation, we used a dominant-negative mutant of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate p53 (IRSp53). IRSp53 is a multidomain BAR protein which binds active Cdc42 and N-Wasp to promote filopodia formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kast et al., 2014</xref>). Here, the mutated protein IRSp53<sup>4K</sup> blocks filopodia formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B, C</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Meyen et al., 2015</xref>) without interfering with autocrine Wnt signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stanganello et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brunt et al., 2021</xref>). Expression of IRSp53<sup>4K</sup>-GFP in AGS cells significantly reduced paracrine Wnt STF reporter activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). Transfection of Wnt3 in the source cells doubled STF reporter activity in the cocultivated HFE-145 cells, which could be attenuated significantly by the cotransfection of IRSp53<sup>4K</sup>-GFP. Our data suggest that cytonemes are vital for paracrine Wnt/β-catenin signal activation. Therefore, we conclude that Wnt3 protein can be disseminated via IRSp53-dependent cytonemes in GC cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Wnt3 cytonemes regulate paracrine Wnt/β-catenin signalling and proliferation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental protocol for measuring paracrine Wnt signalling activation.

To assess the impact of paracrine Wnt signalling on cell proliferation, the number of HFE-145 cells after co-cultivation with AGS cells was counted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Here, we found that transfection of Wnt3 in AGS cells caused a substantial increase in HFE-145 cell number. Consistently, blockage of cytoneme formation in AGS cells and Wnt3 overexpressing AGS cells by IRSp53<sup>4K</sup> cotransfection reduced HFE-145 cell number significantly. Next, we confirmed that the observed alteration in cell numbers is based on proliferation by performing a BrdU incorporation assay to quantify actively proliferating cells with newly synthesised DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We over-expressed Wnt3 in AGS cells and co-cultivated them with HFE-145 cells (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Here, we found a significant increase in the percentage of BrdU-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). Consistently, we observed that blockage of cytoneme formation by over-expressing IRSp53<sup>4K</sup> caused a reduction in proliferating cells. In Wnt3 over-expressing conditions, IRSp53<sup>4K</sup> showed a modest attenuation of proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), suggesting that HFE-145 cells, which are not expressing IRSp53<sup>4K</sup>, can still form cytonemes, and may also be contributing to the proliferative rates.</p><p>The single-cell colony formation (CF) assay tests the ability of cancer stem cells to generate a new colony from a single cell. We performed this CF assay to determine if paracrine Wnt3 was being transmitted by cytonemes to functionally regulate the ability of receiving AGS cells to activate cancer stem cell activity. Therefore, we transfected AGS cells with Wnt3 and IRSp53<sup>4K</sup>, mixed these cells with AGS cells stably transfected with red fluorescent protein (RFP) and maintained the co-cultivation for two days to allow Wnt3 signalling between the co-cultured cells. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was used to purify and isolate individual red-fluorescent AGS cells (Wnt3-receivers) for CF over the following 8–10 days. We observed that Wnt3-transfected AGS cells induced more colonies in the receiving cells than control AGS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref>). In addition, we found that inhibition of cytoneme formation via co-expression of IRSp53<sup>4K</sup> in Wnt3-positive AGS cells leads to a significant reduction of induced colonies compared to Wnt3 expression only. Our data provide the first evidence that Wnt3 localises to cytonemes and cytoneme-delivered Wnt3 can induce paracrine Wnt/β-catenin transduction cascade to promote cancer stem cell activity and proliferation of GC cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Flot2 expression level correlates with cytoneme phenotypes in gastric cancer cells</title><p>To compare the molecular mechanism concerning the cytoneme-mediated Wnt3 dissemination in gastric epithelium cells and GC cells, we investigated the function of Flot2, a scaffolding protein, which enhances the generation of filopodia-like structures in various cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Neumann-Giesen et al., 2004</xref>) and is highly expressed in GC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhu et al., 2013</xref>). We found that AGS cells express 2.1-fold Flot2 mRNA and 2.7-fold higher levels of Flot2 protein than HFE-145 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Of all the GC cell lines, AGS cells express the most elevated Flot2 mRNA and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), which coincides with an increased number of filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We next asked whether Flot2 is involved in the generation of filopodia in gastric epithelial cells as well as in GC cells. We found that Flot2 can induce a significant increase in the number and length of filopodia in HFE-145, similar to the ones observed in AGS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Expression of Flot2 in AGS does not further increase the average filopodia length due to promoting an increase in both longer and shorter filopodia, which averages a similar length to wildtype (WT). Next, we blocked the Flot2 function by using the dominant-negative Flot2 mutant ∆N-Flot2-GFP, which lacks its N-terminus and cannot localise to the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Neumann-Giesen et al., 2004</xref>). In addition to its inhibitory function, ∆N-Flot2-GFP removes endogenous Flot2 from the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We also used a siRNA-mediated knock-down of Flot2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Consistently, transfection of ∆N-Flot2-GFP or Flot2 siRNA significantly decreased the filopodia length and number in both cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>). Control AGS cells, as well as AGS and HFE-145 cells transfected with Flot2, display about 20% of filopodia with a length over 10 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Concordantly, a reduction of Flot2 function led to an increase of short filopodia with a maximum length of 4 µm. A Pearson’s χ2 test confirmed significance in the distribution of filopodia lengths following Flot2 manipulation. Additionally, cells with perturbed Flot2 function have more lamellipodia, suggesting a change in actin cytoskeletal dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Thus, we conclude that Flot2 enhances the formation and elongation of filopodia and thus might explain the differences of the cytoneme phenotype in the Flot2 low-expressing HFE-145 cells versus the GC cells displaying high levels of Flot2 expression.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Flotillin-2 is over-expressed and promotes filopodia formation and elongation in gastric cancer cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Flot2 protein levels in HFE-145 and AGS cells as quantified by Western blot after normalising to beta-actin levels (n=3) and by RT-qPCR after normalising to Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as a housekeeping gene (n=4).

First, we performed a co-cultivation assay of AGS cells and HFE-145 cells as done previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We observed that the expression of Flot2 in the AGS cells slightly increased the expression of the STF mCherry reporter in the neighbouring HFE-145 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>). Consistently, ∆N-Flot2-GFP reduced paracrine Wnt signal activation in HFE-145. Strikingly, co-expression of Flot2 and Wnt3 significantly enhanced the STF reporter expression and, thus, paracrine Wnt signal activation. This increase is reduced upon coexpression of Wnt3 with ∆N-Flot2-GFP. Even more striking, the expression of the cytoneme antagonist IRSp53<sup>4K</sup> led to a significant reduction of paracrine Wnt signalling activation in Wnt3 and Flot2 expressing cells. We could not find changes in Wnt3 expression or subcellular localisation in cells expressing ΔN-Flot2 or Flot2 siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). Thus, our results suggest that Flot2 significantly increases the number of Wnt3 cytonemes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>) and this increase led to a massive upregulation of paracrine Wnt signal activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>).</p><p>Next, we determined the impact of these changes in Wnt signal activation on cell numbers in Wnt-receiving HFE-145 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). We found that Flot2 expression caused a significant increase in HFE-145 cell number, while ∆N-Flot2 caused a decrease. Following a similar trend to the STF reporter, coexpression of Flot2 with Wnt3 resulted in the greatest increase, whereas the Wnt3-induced proliferation was attenuated by coexpression with ∆N-Flot2-GFP. Similarly, IRSp53<sup>4K</sup> attenuated cell number increases in the presence of Wnt3/Flot2, suggesting Flot2 significantly impacts proliferation in a cytoneme-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). A BrdU-based cell proliferation assay confirmed the effects of Flot2-Wnt3 signalling on proliferation. We found that coexpression of Flot2 and Wnt3 produced the greatest increase in BrdU incorporation into newly synthesised DNA of actively proliferating cells. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Consistently, IRSp53<sup>4K</sup> reduced BrdU labelling and thus proliferation. We cannot rule out that the modest inhibition of paracrine Wnt signal activation and proliferation by ∆N-Flot2-GFP at endogenous Wnt3 levels may be due to Wnt3 transport via a Flot2-independent mechanism.</p><p>We further tested the requirement for Flot2-controlled cytonemes in Wnt3 spreading in a CF assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). After reverse transfection of AGS with Wnt3, Flot2, and IRSp53<sup>4K</sup>, we performed a paracrine CF assay as described previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The FACS isolated Wnt3 receiving GC cells were used for CF over the following 8–10 days. Quantification of the colonies revealed a significant increase in stemness of AGS cells when prior co-cultivated with Wnt3-expressing AGS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I and J</xref>). To test for the requirement for Flot2 in cytoneme-mediated Wnt3 transport, we co-transfected the Wnt3-producing cells with Flot2. Indeed, we find that Wnt3/Flot2 expression increases the number of colonies and thus promotes stemness even further. Consistently, blockage of cytoneme formation via co-expression of IRSp53<sup>4K</sup> reduced the number of colonies. Congruently, blockage of Flot2 function by expressing dominant-negative Flot2 (∆N-Flot2-GFP) reduced the number of colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>). These data suggest that Flot2-dependent cytonemes are vital regulators of paracrine transport for Wnt3 signalling, controlling the activity of GC stem cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Flot2 influences intracellular transport and membrane localisation of Ror2</title><p>Next, we addressed the underlying mechanism for Flot2-mediated cytoneme formation. Previously, the Wnt co-receptor Ror2 has been shown to be critical for Wnt-mediated cytoneme formation and signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mattes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brunt et al., 2021</xref>). Since Ror2 has been shown to localise lipid rafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sammar et al., 2009</xref>), we hypothesised that Flot2 could interact with Ror2 to promote cytoneme formation. To test this hypothesis, we analysed first the intracellular distribution and found colocalisation of Ror2 and Flot2, particularly at clusters at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), most likely Flot2 positive microdomains. Overexpression of tagged versions of Flot2 and Ror2 led to a similar colocalisation at the membrane and, consequently, the formation of long cytonemes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Strikingly, we found that siRNA-mediated knock-down of Flot2 resulted in a substantial reduction in Ror2 membrane localisation and its intracellular accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Consistently, we found that inhibiting Flot2 function (using ∆N-Flot2-GFP) also led to a loss of Ror2 membrane localisation and, subsequently, Ror2 accumulated in the perinuclear region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). These experiments suggest that Ror2 requires Flot2 for proper membrane localisation. To further assess the change in subcellular localisation, we mapped the localisation of Ror2 with regard to a set of organelle markers and found that upon siRNA-mediated Flot2 knock-down, Ror2-mCherry localisation significantly increases in the Golgi apparatus without a noticeable change in the other organelles investigated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B-E</xref>).

During cytoneme outgrowth, Ror2 needs to activate the Wnt/PCP pathway, including downstream activation of JNK signalling, to induce polymerisation of the cytoneme actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martinez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brunt et al., 2021</xref>). Since Flot2 is required for Ror2 membrane localisation, we investigated if Flot2 function can be linked to Ror2/PCP signalling. Therefore, we generated an AGS cell line stably expressing a reporter of JNK signalling, the JNK kinase translocation reporter (JNK KTR-mCherry) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Regot et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miura et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brunt et al., 2021</xref>). JNK-KTR-mCherry localises to the nucleus (N) in its dephosphorylated state (low JNK activity). Upon activation by phosphorylation, it shuttles to the cytoplasm (C, high JNK activity). The C:N ratio can then be calculated as an indicator of JNK signalling. AGS cells display low basal levels of JNK activity, indicative of low basal Wnt/PCP signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g and h</xref>). Expression of either Flot2 or Ror2 significantly increases JNK signalling, and co-expression of Flot2 /Ror2 further enhances JNK signalling activation, suggesting a synergistic effect. In accordance with a synergistic function, we demonstrated that blockage of Flot2 function in Ror2 positive AGS cells by co-expression of a ∆N-Flot2 can significantly reduce PCP/JNK signalling. This data set suggests that Flot2 is required for Ror2-induced JNK signalling. In parallel, we observed that Flot2 represses the autocrine β-catenin signalling pathway, which is consistent with previous observations suggesting a mutually repressive nature of the Wnt/PCP and Wnt/β-catenin pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F, G</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">van Amerongen and Nusse, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Niehrs, 2012</xref>).

For this reason, AGS cells were transfected with WT or mutant Flot2 and Ror2 constructs. Membrane-mCherry expression was used to visualise and quantify cytonemes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I–K</xref>). Expression of Ror2 alone increased the average cytoneme length while having no significant effect on cytoneme number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J and K</xref>). However, co-expression of Flot2 with Ror2 enhanced this phenotype; increasing cytoneme length. Consistently, blockage of Flot2 function upon expression of the dominant-negative ∆N-Flot2-GFP decreased the number and length of cytonemes in Ror2 expressing AGS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J and K</xref>). To test whether Flot2 requires Ror2 for cytoneme formation, a mutant construct of Ror2 missing the Wnt-interacting CRD domain (∆CRD-Ror2) was used, which cannot bind to Wnt ligands and thus transduce a Wnt signal. When expressed in AGS cells, ∆CRD-Ror2 significantly reduced the average length and number of cytonemes. We found that this phenotype can be partially rescued by the expression of Flot2, which moderately restores the average cytoneme length and number, suggesting that Flot2 acts downstream of Ror2-inducing cytonemes, potentially via its ability to enhance actin polymerisation. Taken together, these results show that Flot2 is required for the membrane localisation of Ror2. Furthermore, Flot2 facilitates Ror2-mediated Wnt/PCP signalling and, consequently, the promotion of Wnt cytonemes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Wnt8a cytonemes in zebrafish development require Flot2 function</title><p>To evaluate whether the role of Flot2 in forming Wnt cytonemes is conserved, we addressed Flotillin function during zebrafish development. The Flotillins are highly expressed in early zebrafish development and can be visualised on the tips of cellular protrusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Von Philipsborn et al., 2005</xref>). Previous work from our lab has shown that cytonemes are essential for the dissemination of Wnt8a in zebrafish embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stanganello et al., 2015</xref>) and that these cytonemes can be regulated by the Ror2/PCP pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mattes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brunt et al., 2021</xref>). To map the subcellular localisation of Flot2 in zebrafish epiblast cells, we generated small cell clones expressing a fluorescence tagged Flot2 during zebrafish gastrulation and analysed the expression of Flot2 at 6hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We found that human Flot2-GFP displayed strong membrane localisation and was localised to filopodia, including their tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Flot2-GFP could also be seen clustering together with Wnt8a-mCherry on cytonemes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), analogous to the co-localisation seen with Wnt3 in GC cells. Next, we altered Flot2 function during zebrafish embryogenesis and observed that the expression of Flot2 significantly increased the average cytoneme length and cumulative length while having no significant effect on cytoneme number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–F</xref>).

Wnt8a is a key Wnt morphogen in determining the positions of the boundaries of the brain anlage, and alteration of Wnt8a cytonemes perturbs brain anlage patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mattes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brunt et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, we altered Wnt expression levels together with Flot2 levels during neural plate patterning and found that the expression of low levels of Wnt8a results in an anterior shift of the boundaries of the brain anlage and reduces the combined forebrain (FB) and midbrain (MB) length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J and K</xref>). Such a posteriorisation was also observed upon injection of Flot2-GFP. An even more pronounced shift of the position of brain anlage boundaries occurred upon co-injection of Flot2-GFP and Wnt8a, suggesting a synergistic effect of Flot2 and Wnt8a during posteriorisation of the neural plate patterning. In some cases, the anterior <italic>pax6</italic> positive expression domain, most likely the FB anlage, was completely lacking, which was recorded as ‘0’. Consistently, blockage of Flot2 function by expression of the dominant-negative ∆N-Flot2-GFP attenuated the alteration in patterning. As well as perturbing the length of the primordia of the FB/MB, alteration of Wnt8a signalling can cause defects in the early zebrafish embryo, which can include complete loss of the FB primordium and underdeveloped or missing eyes. We then categorised the developmental defects and found that embryos co-expressing Flot2 and Wnt8a significantly increased the number of embryos with severe defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L</xref>).</p><p>Together, these data suggest Flotillin can enhance the length and number of Wnt8a cytonemes and thus alter the Wnt8a signalling gradient, leading to a posteriorisation of the zebrafish brain anlage. These findings are concurrent with our results in GC cells showing Flot2 enhances paracrine Wnt signal activation. In both systems, Flot2 also co-localises with the Wnt ligands, Wnt3, and Wnt8a, and promotes cytoneme formation, which suggests a conserved role for Flotillin in promoting cytoneme-mediated Wnt dissemination in vertebrate tissue.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Wnt/β-catenin pathway activity, in addition to other stemness signals, is required to maintain the gastrointestinal crypt microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sato et al., 2011</xref>). Wnt3 is an essential short-range signal at the crypt base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farin et al., 2012</xref>), showing a strongly reduced diffusion capability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Farin et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, our study of gastric epithelial cells indicates that Wnt3 remains membrane-tethered during transport and signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In support of these observations, experiments in <italic>Drosophila</italic> using an artificially membrane-tethered form of Wg showed that free diffusion is not necessary, as without the ability of free diffusion, <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing patterning was almost completely unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexandre et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we provide evidence that gastric epithelial cells can load Wnt3 on cytonemes for intercellular distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In gastrointestinal adenomas and differentiated carcinomas, Wnt3 and Wnt cargo receptor Evi/Wntless are significantly increased and crucial for cancer cell proliferation and colony formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Voloshanenko et al., 2013</xref>), and we show that Wnt3 and Evi/Wntless co-localise on cytonemes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Furthermore, the Wnt receptor Fzd7, which can bind Wnt3, transmits oncogenic Wnt signalling to drive the proliferation of gastric tumours in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flanagan, 2019</xref>). In conclusion, elevated levels of Wnt3 are essential for quickly proliferating gastrointestinal cancers; however, it is unclear how this hydrophobic ligand is disseminated within a tumour’s context. In many cancer cells, the number of filopodia is increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Machesky and Li, 2010</xref>), and LGR5<sup>+</sup> intestinal stem cells form long cytonemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Snyder et al., 2015</xref>). Our data suggest that the cancer stem cell-like AGS cells form a similarly high number of long filopodia, and we assign a fresh function to these filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We propose that enhanced Wnt3 expression and an increase of cytonemes lead to augmented Wnt3 dissemination and signalling within GC cells, as well as increased cell proliferation and activity of cancer stem cells—a prerequisite for adenoma formation. In support of our hypothesis, in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> cytoneme-mediated FGFR signalling is similarly required for tumour growth and malignancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fereres et al., 2019</xref>). However, the underlying molecular mechanism increasing cytoneme emergence in cancers is unclear.</p><p>Flotillins are upregulated in many tumours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gauthier-Rouvière et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhu et al., 2013</xref>). Our data suggest that Flot2 expression correlates with enhanced cytoneme formation in GC. These results concur with previous studies demonstrating the ability of Flot2 to enhance filopodial phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hazarika et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Neumann-Giesen et al., 2004</xref>). We further show that increased Flot2-function leads to a further Wnt ligand dissemination in GC cells as well as in zebrafish embryogenesis. These observations are in concert with data in <italic>Drosophila</italic> showing that Flot2 promotes long-range Wg signalling in the wing imaginal disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Katanaev et al., 2008</xref>). Consequently, blockage of Flot2 function reduces paracrine Wnt signalling significantly—despite the high levels of Wnt3 expressed in GC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Consequently, Flot2 function correlates positively with colony formation, suggesting that Flot2-dependent Wnt3 cytonemes are essential in promoting proliferation and activity of gastric cancer stem cells. We, therefore, speculate that GC cells require not only increased Wnt3 expression levels for tumour maintenance but that increased Flot2 expression allows more effective ligand dissemination in the tumour tissue.</p><p>Previously, Wnt/PCP signalling has been recognised as a key regulator of Wnt cytoneme emergence in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mattes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brunt et al., 2021</xref>), where the receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor Ror2 has been implicated in activating this signalling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ho et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, autocrine Ror2/PCP signalling leads to the induction of Wnt cytonemes in zebrafish gastrula and mouse myofibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mattes et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we provide evidence that Ror2 is similarly required for Wnt cytoneme formation in GC via the activation of Wnt/PCP/JNK signalling. However, we found that GC cells display more and longer filopodia despite sequencing data indicating that Ror2 expression is reduced in GC tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2014</xref>). We, therefore, suggest that the low levels of Ror2 seen in GC are functionally compensated by high levels of Flot2, which works synergistically to induce long cytonemes.</p><p>Surprisingly, we also found that Flot2 function is a prerequisite for Ror2-mediated Wnt/PCP signalling, as blocking Flot2 function reduces Ror2 membrane localisation, signalling, and cytoneme induction. In accordance with our findings, it has been suggested that Flot2 can influence receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signalling by providing a signalling microdomain at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banning, 2014</xref>). Furthermore, there is good evidence that Flotillins influence EGF, FGF, and MAPK signalling; however, Flotillins have contradictory effects depending on the experimental setting and the tissue context, and a unifying explanation is missing to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amaddii et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banning, 2014</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesise that Flot2—in addition to its function in organising microdomains at the membrane—is a critical regulator of intracellular protein transport. Thus, we suggest that the Flot2 function is a prerequisite for activating the Wnt/PCP-dependent cytonemes; however, further functional roles for Flot2 might exist and might also be modulated in a cell-type-specific manner.</p><p>As a mechanistic explanation, we suggest that Flot2 regulates intracellular trafficking of the Wnt/PCP co-receptor and RTK Ror2 from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane for cytoneme induction. On the one hand, this is consistent with reports highlighting Flot2 as a regulator of membrane invagination and trafficking between endocytic compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frick et al., 2007</xref>). In particular, it has been observed that cargo, including Flot2 itself, accumulates in the Golgi complex of HeLa, Jurkat, and PC12 cells when Flot2 function is obstructed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Langhorst et al., 2008</xref>). Consistently, we found that ectopic Flot2 expression leads to effective transport of Ror2 to the plasma membrane and, thus, to enhanced cytoneme formation in the source cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Consequently, paracrine Wnt/β-catenin signalling is facilitated in neighbouring receiving cells. In accordance, we found that blockage of Flot2-induced cytonemes—without interfering with Wnt3 expression and secretion—can significantly reduce paracrine Wnt activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This suggests that Wnt3 uses mainly Flot2/Ror2 dependent cytonemes for intercellular transport. Whether the canonical Wnt3 is a transient passenger on these cytonemes, directly binding to Ror2 or binding to Evi/Wntless, remains to be answered. However, there is indeed some evidence that Wnt3 can bind to Ror2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Billiard et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, Wnt8a is a further example of a Wnt/β-catenin ligand interacting with not only multiple frizzled receptors but also both Ror2 and Lrp6 co-receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mattes et al., 2018</xref>). Clarifying whether Wnt3 displays similar capabilities will aid our molecular understanding of its cytoneme localisation.</p><p>However, Flot2 may not be limited to promoting Wnt transport; this function of Flot2 in cytoneme-mediated transport may represent a conserved role since Flot2 has previously been shown to enhance Hh cytoneme formation and gradients in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">González-Méndez et al., 2017</xref>). It would be interesting to investigate whether Hh and the receptors involved in Hh cytoneme formation, such as Ihog also localise to Flot2 microdomains and Flot2-dependent cytonemes, which would suggest a more general function for Flot2 in promoting morphogen transport.</p><p>It has been suggested that elevated Wnt/β-catenin signalling activity correlates with stem cell signatures in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reya and Clevers, 2005</xref>). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that GC cells generate a 'niche'-like environment that allows them to maintain stemness. A crucial factor for maintaining the GC stem cell niche is elevated Wnt3 signalling. We show that GC stem cells can form a cytoneme-mediated network allowing a fast and precise exchange of Wnt3. As an underlying mechanism, we, therefore, suggest that Flot2 is crucial in modulating cytoneme emergence in the niche to facilitate long-range Wnt3 transport. Indeed, the expression levels of both Wnt3 and Flot2 correlate with the degree of intestinal tumour progression with poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Merlos-Suárez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). We propose that despite the presence of pathway-activating mutations in APC or β-catenin, the survival of gastrointestinal cancer cells remains dependent on Wnt ligand distribution on Flot2-controlled cytonemes. Thus, besides directly interfering with the Wnt signalling pathway, regulating Flot2-mediated Wnt cytonemes in the cancer stem cell niche could provide a novel strategy for combatting Wnt-related cancers.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids and antibodies</title><p>The following plasmids were used in transfections and/or microinjections: pCS2 + membrane-mCherry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mattes et al., 2018</xref>), pCAG-mGFP membrane-bound GFP (Addgene 14757), pEGFP-N1 Flot2-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Neumann-Giesen et al., 2004</xref>), pEGFP-N1 ΔN-Flot2-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Neumann-Giesen et al., 2004</xref>), 7×TRE SuperTOPFlash-NLS-mCherry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moro et al., 2012</xref>), JNK KTR-mCherry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Regot et al., 2014</xref>), pCS2 + LifeAct GFP, pCS2 + Rab5 GFP (Jim Smith Group), Rab7-eGFP (from Rüdiger Rudolf), pEGFP-N1 LAMP1-mTurq2 (Addgene #98828), IRSp534K-mCherry/GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stanganello et al., 2015</xref>), pCS2 + Wnt8a-mCherry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stanganello et al., 2015</xref>), pCS2 + Ror2-mCherry (cloned in with ClaI and XbaI), pEGFP-N3 mRor2-∆CRD-GFP (XhoI-XhoI mRor2 insert taken from pcDNA-mRor2, subcloned into SalI site of pEGFP-N3 vector), pCS2 + Ror2-eBFP2 (cloned by inserting eBFP2 into pCS2 + Ror2 plasmid using XbaI and SnaBI), pCS2 + Wnt3-mCherry (cloned from Addgene plasmid pcDNA3.2-Wnt3 (#35909) into pCS2±mCherry vector using ClaI and XbaI).</p><p>The following primary antibodies were used for immunofluorescence and/or Western blots: anti-Wnt3 (Abcam 116222), anti-Flotillin-2 (Abcam 96507), anti-Flotillin-2 (Abcam ab113661), anti-Ror2 (Santa Cruz H-1), anti-beta-actin (Proteintech 60008–1-Ig), anti-Myosin-X (Santa Cruz C-1), and anti-Evi (EMD Milipore YJ5).

We termed this cell line ‘receiver cells’. On the other hand, the AGS ‘producer’ cells were reverse transfected with the indicated plasmids. Twenty four hours after transfection, the AGS producers were co-cultured with AGS-RFP receivers (1:1) for 2 days. Next, AGS-RFP cells were sorted by FACS using an Aria (Becton Dickinson) flow cytometer. DAPI staining was used for dead cell exclusion. The AGS-RFP cells were then seeded for colony-forming assays (500 events/well in 12-well plates).

Selected gRNAs were also BLAST-checked to confirm a lack of off-target gene interaction. Cas9 protein was considered likely to be the most biologically active component of the experimental injection mixture and, therefore, the most appropriate injection control for use when assessing multiple candidate genes.</p><p>Prior to injection, gene-specific crRNA and tracrRNA (Integrated DNA Technologies Inc Coralville, United States) were diluted to a final concentration of 12 μM in nuclease-free duplex buffer and the resultant gRNA mixture incubated at 95°C for 5 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Winter et al., 2022</xref>). Immediately prior to use, 5 μl of the gRNA mixture was mixed with Cas9-NLS protein (final concentration of 5 μM. New England Biolabs, Ipswich, United States), 2 M KCl (final concentration of 300 mM), and 0.5% v/v Phenol red solution (Sigma Aldrich Ltd. Poole, United Kingdom) in a total volume of 10 μl.

Embryos were left to develop signal staining for 2 hr in the dark (RT) prior to NTMT and PBST washes and 30 min refix in 4% PFA (RT). Two final washes in PBST were performed before storing embryos in 70% glycerol.

Filopodia length was measured from the tip of the filopodia to the base, where it contacted the main cell body. In the case of branching protrusions, one branch (the longest) would be measured. Quantifications of Western blot images was performed by measuring the mean grey value of bands (after subtracting background) and normalising to loading controls. Quantification of qPCR data used the Pfaffl equation to calculate fold-change expression from Ct values, after normalising to GAPDH. PCC quantifications were performed using the ‘Coloc-2’ plugin in Fiji. A region of interest was drawn around the desired cell and PCC was measured with no threshold. All experiments/conditions were repeated at least in biological triplicates. Significance was tested using Student’s t-test (parametric) against the relative controls. Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was applied. Pearson’s χ2 test (non-parametric) was used to calculate whether the distribution of filopodia lengths differed significantly between the control cell lines and the transfected constructs. Error bars on bar charts show standard error of the mean (SEM).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Zebrafish care and all experimental procedures were carried out in accordance with the European Communities Council Directive (2010/63/EU) and Animals Scientific Procedures Act (ASPA) 1986.

Does the IRSp534K mutant have any effect on Wnt secretion into culture media?</p><p>The IRSp534K cells shown in Sup Figure 1A look very unhealthy, so might IRSp534K be having off-target effects – like cell death? The membrane blebs are concerning.

Same question for Figure 2E-F.</p><p>Line 117: Is cytonemal a word?</p><p>Figure 3B: The extensions in HFE-145 that are increased upon Flot2 expression look more cytoneme-like than the extensions in AGS cells. Many of the AGS cell extensions look like retraction fibers. How are cytonemes being distinguished from retraction fibers? Please indicate in the figure what is a cytoneme and what is not. Were only cytoneme-like extensions quantified in C-E?</p><p>Figure 4B: Line 143 states that the authors want to determine whether Flot2 is specific to Wnt cytonemes and not just filopodia, so they look for Wnt3 and Flot2 localizing to the same extensions. Line 147 states that Wnt3 and Flot2 colocalize on cytonemes, but the wording is vague. Is the suggestion that Wnt3 and Flot2 are colocalizing as a protein complex, or is it that they are both present in the same cytonemes but not necessarily in complex? If the former, please provide colocalization coefficients. Same question for 4D. Even if Wnt3 and Flot2 do colocalize, this will not confirm Flot2 is dedicated to Wnt cytonemes. To make this conclusion, the authors will need to determine whether Flot2 does or does not colocalize with other signaling proteins that are transported along cytonemes. The authors cannot rule out that Flot2 is a general modulator of cytoneme transport.</p><p>Figure 5A: Quantification of colocalization is needed. Figure 5B: Does the arrow indicate a Flot2 punctum in a cytoneme, or is it simply indicating the cytoneme? Figures 5C-D: Quantification of changes in cytoneme formation and images of more than one cell for each condition are needed to gauge the extent to which cellular extensions are impacted by Ror2 and Flot2 gain/loss.</p><p>Figure 5I: Please add arrows to indicate examples of what were counted as cytonemes vs. non-cytoneme cell extensions that are present.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Line 112: authors say &quot;that co-expression of Wnt3 together with IRSp534k led to a significant downregulation of actively proliferating cells&quot; however, quantification in fig2F appears to show a very weak effect and whether the difference between +Wnt3 and +Wnt3/IRSp534K is significant is not clear. The p-values comparing various treatments (as given in 2d) should also be given for 2f.</p><p>2) Line 143: The authors say that they investigated if Flot2 specifically regulates Wnt3 cytonemes. However, they only show that Flot2 and Wnt3 colocalize on cytonemes, which does not directly suggest that Flot2 perturbation will only affect Wnt3 containing cytonemes.</p><p>3) Figure 4: It is intriguing to see that treatment of the control AGS cells with ΔN-Flot2, did not completely abolish the Wnt signalling activity or cell numbers/BrDU incorporation; even though it led to a significant reduction in the cytoneme numbers and length (Figure 3). As the GC cells are supposed to have higher Wnt3, which is suggested to enhance their proliferation, is it possible that the lack of a strong phenotype could be because of alternative mechanisms of Wnt3 release which remained unaffected by ΔN-Flot2 treatment?</p><p>4) Figure 5C and d are quite confusing. The text in lines 189-190 says &quot;Consistently, expression of a dominant-negative form of Flot2 resulted in a strong reduction of cytonemes (Figure 5c) &quot; while Figure 5C is marked as Flot2 siRNA. Mentioned in line 180, &quot;we observed a similar phenotype after knock-down of Flot2 – a reduction of cytonemes and removal of Ror2 from the membrane (Figure 5d)&quot; while Fig5d is about DN-Flot2.</p><p>5) Line 283: I think authors should rephrase the statement about <italic>Drosophila</italic> Wg being not diffusible, as there are several studies that have shown the long-range movement of endogenous Wg via a collection of extracellular carriers. Whereas the function of membrane-tethered Wg by JP Vincent group was shown via an artificially made Wg fusion protein and not for endogenous Wg.</p><p>6) Line 339-341: With the statement &quot;Consistently, we found that ectopic Flot2 expression leads to an effective transport from Ror2 to the plasma membrane and thus, to enhanced Wnt3 cytoneme formation in the source cells (Figure 5)&quot; authors are implying that they found Ror2 to be the mediator of Wnt3 transport on cytonemes. However, the experiments analysing the direct effect of Ror2 manipulation on Wnt3 transport have not been shown in Figure 5 and this conclusion appears to be based on their interaction shown by other studies.</p><p>Other comments:</p><p>Fig3E: Y-axis label should be added.</p><p>Line170: &quot;whereas the Wnt3-induced signalling was attenuated by co-expression with ΔN-Flot2-GFP&quot;. This sentence is confusing as the data in Figure 4g is about the cell number and not signalling readout.</p><p>Line 171: &quot;Similarly, IRSp534L attenuated increases seen in the presence…&quot; appears to be an incomplete sentence.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;The scaffolding protein Flot2 promotes cytoneme-based transport of Wnt3 in gastric cancer&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Didier Stainier (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been greatly improved but there are a few remaining issues that need to be addressed:</p><p>1) Please address text changes recommended by reviewer 3.</p><p>2) Please address the open concerns of reviewer 1, as outlined below.</p><p>As two reviewers had difficulties finding and understanding changes referred to in supplementary figures, please make sure the remaining changes are highlighted and the labeling of figures is consistent within text and letter.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have improved the manuscript significantly.</p><p>There are a few issues remain that should be addressed.</p><p>General issues:</p><p>1. The naming system of the supplementary figures is very confusing. Most supplementary figures are not labeled, and some figures were mislabeled. The J editorial support team suggested downloading each figure and renaming them according to the file title. Even by doing that, many figures cannot be located. It seems that supplementary figures are associated with the main figures. The supp Figure 1 for Figure 2 is named Figure 2 supp Figure 1. Two supplementary figures for Figure 4, designated as Figure 4 suppl Figure 1, and Figure 4 suppl Figure 2. These names were used in the main text but not in the response letter.</p><p>For example,</p><p>1) Supp. Figure 1E: seems to be Figure 3 suppl figure 1C.</p><p>2) Supp. Figure 1C: seems to be Figure Suppl Figure 1A</p><p>3) Supp. Figure 2D: I found this panel in Figure 3 suppl figure 1D.</p><p>4) Supp. Figure 2E: cannot be located.</p><p>5) Figure 6D, E; Supp. Figure 3d: Supp. Figure 3d was not found.</p><p>6) One supplemental figure is labeled as supplementary figure 6. Is it correct?</p><p>Please review the manuscript, label all figures, and cite figures properly. Otherwise, the manuscript is impossible to be understood.</p><p>2. The responses were extensive, but the authors did not describe or label where the changes were, which makes the evaluation very challenging.</p><p>Specific issues:</p><p>The following issues were not addressed adequately:</p><p>1) The authors did not address this issue: &quot;Figure 2D shows Relative number of HFE cells per image&quot;.</p><p>Did the authors use the number from the control as the base? Is it more meaningful if the actual values are used?</p><p>Additionally, is it possible to image Wnt3 is being transported to the receiving cells?&quot;</p><p>The authors did not address if a video is provided. The Wnt3 staining in Figure 2 Suppl Figure 1A is messy. Are all GFP staining Wnt3 signals? Where was Wnt3 expressed? Which cells are the recipient cells?</p><p>2) &quot;Figure 2E: The BrdU stains are brightfield images and do not use any fluorescence. Therefore, there are no channels to split. &quot;</p><p>Could authors show large images for better visualization if this is the case?</p><p>3) &quot;we performed antibody staining against Wnt3 after Flot2 KD (and in DN-Flot2-expressing cells) to assess its localisation (Supp. Figure 2).&quot;</p><p>This figure cannot be located. Is it Figure 3, suppl Figure 1C?</p><p>4) &quot;For clarification, we have added time-lapse images of Flot2-GFP/Wnt3-mCh expressing cells (Supp. Figure 2G), where Flot2 and Wnt3 can be seen travelling together intracellularly.&quot;</p><p>Is it Figure 4, supp. Figure 2B? This figure cannot be located. Time-lapse was not provided. The still images reveal little information. Also, why did Flot2 and Wnt3 travel together intracellularly? Figure 4, supp. Figure 2A shows that wnt3 binds Flot2-GFP expressing cell protrusions. Did the authors describe and discuss that in the text?</p><p>5) &quot;We have therefore improved the resolution of the images and added an analysis of AGS cells expressing Ror2-BFP, Flot2-GFP, and membrane-mCherry, which shows the membrane localisation of Flot2 and Ror2 (Supp. Figure 3a).&quot;</p><p>This figure cannot be located.</p><p>6) &quot;The nuclei and cell boundaries are not clear; the markers for these should be included to give confidence where and how the quantification was conducted. &quot; We have marked the nuclei as well as the adjacent cytoplasm with asterisks – to show the localisation in which the fluorescence of KTR-mCherry was measured.</p><p>Labeling did not solve the issue as it is impossible to see some cells' nuclei and cell boundaries.</p><p>7) Figure 5:</p><p>a) Figure 5A: Flot2 expression doesn't seem to be at the membrane. The staining is very different from Figure 5B, and Figure 5-supplement 1A. Could the authors explain it?</p><p>b) Page 8, line 237. &quot;Flot2 resulted in a substantial reduction in Ror2 membrane localisation and its intracellular accumulation&quot;. Did the authors want to describe that intracellular accumulation is increased? Additionally, there is significant labeling in intracellular areas in Figure 5A.</p><p>c) Supp. Figure 3 cannot be located.

How was Wnt8a-mchery expressed?</p><p>b) Figure 6J: DNA injection results in mosaic labeling, which is good for imaging, but this is not a reliable method for comparing the functional consequences from such injection.</p><p>c) Fig6 K, L: Please specify which groups were used to compare DNFlot2/wnt8a (p&lt;0.001 in K, ns in L). These data were not described in the text.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript has improved significantly after the revision and the authors have provided a satisfactory response to the comments. However, the revisions done on a comment were not visible in the revised document.</p><p>(Comment Nr. 8) Line 337 -339: Authors claim that they have reworded the statement related to diffusion; &quot;experiments in <italic>Drosophila</italic> suggest that Wg is similarly not freely diffusible as flies with a membrane-tethered form of Wg develop largely normal&quot;, however, it remains unchanged in the revised version.</p><p>I don't think Alexandre et al. 2014 suggested that endogenous Wg is not freely diffusible. They used an artificially designed NRT-Wg fusion protein to show the maintenance of signaling in the absence of a long-range gradient and a near normal patterning of the wing with delayed development.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77376.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Figure 1A: Only single cells are shown to represent each of the cell types assayed.

Additionally, since this is a co-cultivation, a DAPI stain or DIC image would also stain AGS cells. Therefore, we cannot distinguish between untransfected HFE or AGS cells and therefore reliably include these in the cell count. Whilst this is a limited method, counting cells based on TCF reporter expression is the most reliable for co-cultivation. Furthermore, the BrdU assay and the new colony formation assays were also used to validate further the trends observed using this method, so we are confident in these results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2C: How is the relative reporter activity determined?

To support this finding, we have used a colony-forming assay to show further the positive influence of overexpression of Wnt3 on the ability to form colonies of neighbouring cells can be abrogated by blockage of cytonemes.

However, they only show that Flot2 and Wnt3 colocalize on cytonemes, which does not directly suggest that Flot2 perturbation will only affect Wnt3 containing cytonemes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this comment and have changed the word &quot;specifically&quot; to &quot;actively&quot; to clarify that we are not claiming Flot2 does not regulate other Wnt proteins or cytonemes, but that it is involved in Wnt3 cytonemes rather than generally affecting filopodia.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 4: It is intriguing to see that treatment of the control AGS cells with ΔN-Flot2, did not completely abolish the Wnt signalling activity or cell numbers/BrDU incorporation; even though it led to a significant reduction in the cytoneme numbers and length (Figure 3). As the GC cells are supposed to have higher Wnt3, which is suggested to enhance their proliferation, is it possible that the lack of a strong phenotype could be because of alternative mechanisms of Wnt3 release which remained unaffected by ΔN-Flot2 treatment?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that – in addition to cytonemes – other mechanisms such as Wnt3 on exosomes could be important for ligand dissemination. Therefore, we have added the following sentence to reflect this point raised: &quot;We cannot rule out that the modest inhibition of paracrine Wnt signal activation and proliferation by ∆N-Flot2-GFP at endogenous Wnt3 levels may be due to secretion of Wnt3 via cytoneme-independent mechanisms. Alternatively, compensation by Flot1 may still transport low levels of Wnt3 but not higher levels seen with Wnt3 overexpression.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 5C and d are quite confusing. The text in lines 189-190 says &quot;Consistently, expression of a dominant-negative form of Flot2 resulted in a strong reduction of cytonemes (Figure 5c) &quot; while Figure 5C is marked as Flot2 siRNA. Mentioned in line 180, &quot;we observed a similar phenotype after knock-down of Flot2 – a reduction of cytonemes and removal of Ror2 from the membrane (Figure 5d)&quot; while Fig5d is about DN-Flot2.</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected the text's figure references and reworded them to make them clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Line 283: I think authors should rephrase the statement about <italic>Drosophila</italic> Wg being not diffusible, as there are several studies that have shown the long-range movement of endogenous Wg via a collection of extracellular carriers. Whereas the function of membrane-tethered Wg by JP Vincent group was shown via an artificially made Wg fusion protein and not for endogenous Wg.</p></disp-quote><p>We have reworded the statement about diffusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Line 339-341: With the statement &quot;Consistently, we found that ectopic Flot2 expression leads to an effective transport from Ror2 to the plasma membrane and thus, to enhanced Wnt3 cytoneme formation in the source cells (Figure 5)&quot; authors are implying that they found Ror2 to be the mediator of Wnt3 transport on cytonemes. However, the experiments analysing the direct effect of Ror2 manipulation on Wnt3 transport have not been shown in Figure 5 and this conclusion appears to be based on their interaction shown by other studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the word &quot;Wnt3&quot; from this sentence as we have not explicitly evaluated the percentage of these cytonemes which are Wnt3-positive or bearing other Wnt proteins, which is likely since AGS cells express multiple Wnt proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other comments:</p><p>Fig3E: Y-axis label should be added.</p></disp-quote><p>A label for the Y-axis on Figure 3E has been added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line170: &quot;whereas the Wnt3-induced signalling was attenuated by co-expression with ΔN-Flot2-GFP&quot;.

The naming system of the supplementary figures is very confusing. Most supplementary figures are not labeled, and some figures were mislabeled. The J editorial support team suggested downloading each figure and renaming them according to the file title. Even by doing that, many figures cannot be located. It seems that supplementary figures are associated with the main figures. The supp Figure 1 for Figure 2 is named Figure 2 supp Figure 1. Two supplementary figures for Figure 4, designated as Figure 4 suppl Figure 1, and Figure 4 suppl Figure 2.

Otherwise, the manuscript is impossible to be understood.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusing labelling in the ‘Responses to reviewers‘ -file. We have updated the labelling for the figure supplements as suggested. For example, we ordered them and cited them sequentially, e.g., Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 2—figure supplement 1, Figure 2—figure supplement 2, Figure 3, Figure 3—figure supplement 1. We have now changed all names accordingly in all documents. We have also added the names to the PDFs for clarification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The responses were extensive, but the authors did not describe or label where the changes were, which makes the evaluation very challenging.</p></disp-quote><p>We have marked all changes in red in the accompanying manuscript file ‘Manuscript with changes’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific issues:</p><p>The following issues were not addressed adequately:</p><p>1) The authors did not address this issue: &quot;Figure 2D shows Relative number of HFE cells per image&quot;.</p><p>Did the authors use the number from the control as the base?

This figure cannot be located. Time-lapse was not provided. The still images reveal little information. Also, why did Flot2 and Wnt3 travel together intracellularly?

Our data suggest that Wnt3 and Flot2 co-localise at the plasma membrane (Figure 4B-D), and we also find co-localisation intracellularly (Figure4—figure supplement 1A). Furthermore, wnt3-mCherry and Flot2-GFP can be observed together in moving clusters within a cell (Figure4—figure supplement 1A, B). This has been explained in the main text (Line 174-182).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) &quot;We have therefore improved the resolution of the images and added an analysis of AGS cells expressing Ror2-BFP, Flot2-GFP, and membrane-mCherry, which shows the membrane localisation of Flot2 and Ror2 (Supp. Figure 3a).&quot;</p><p>This figure cannot be located.</p></disp-quote><p>This mistake has been corrected (see comments above).

Did the authors want to describe that intracellular accumulation is increased? Additionally, there is significant labeling in intracellular areas in Figure 5A.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the siRNA-mediated knock-down of Flot2 leads to a relocation of Ror2 from the plasma membrane (Figure 5B) to intracellular sites (Figure 5C, arrows). This observation is supported by the data shown in Figure 5D, in which Ror2 is similarly localised to intracellular areas after co-expression of a dominant-negative form of Flot2. The reviewer is correct that in Figure 5A, Ror2 and Flot2 can be found at the membrane and intracellular sites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Supp. Figure 3 cannot be located.

Mosaic labelling is an essential aspect of this approach. By doing so, we generate small, individual cell clones which can act as focal Wnt8a sources. We alter the spreading of Wnt8a from these small sources by changing the emergence of cytonemes. Reduced cytoneme formation partially rescues the AP phenotype after focal activation of Wnt8a.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Fig6 K, L: Please specify which groups were used to compare DNFlot2/wnt8a (p&lt;0.001 in K, ns in L).
