if Bach2 is also involved in the development of innate immune cells, such as natural killer (NK) cells. Here, we followed the expression of Bach2 during murine NK cell development, finding that it peaked in immature CD27<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells and decreased upon further maturation. Bach2 showed an organ and tissue-specific expression pattern in NK cells. Bach2 expression positively correlated with the expression of transcription factor TCF1 and negatively correlated with genes encoding NK effector molecules and those involved in the cell cycle. Lack of Bach2 expression caused changes in chromatin accessibility of corresponding genes. In the end, Bach2 deficiency resulted in increased proportions of terminally differentiated NK cells with increased production of granzymes and cytokines. NK cell-mediated control of tumor metastasis was also augmented in the absence of Bach2. Therefore, Bach2 is a key checkpoint protein regulating NK terminal maturation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>NK cells</kwd><kwd>Bach2</kwd><kwd>development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-AI129545</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yokoyama</surname><given-names>Wayne M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000051</institution-id><institution>National Human Genome Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-HG007175</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Ting</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000051</institution-id><institution>National Human Genome Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01-HG009391</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Ting</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000051</institution-id><institution>National Human Genome Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U41-HG010972</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Ting</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Deficiency of the transcriptional repressor, Bach2, results in more mature mouse natural killer cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphoid cells that have spontaneous cytolytic activity against tumor cells and virus-infected cells. The development of NK cells occurs in bone marrow (BM) as well as in secondary lymphoid tissues in both humans and mice. Multipotent hematopoietic stem cells give rise to common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs) that can differentiate into all types of lymphocytes. NK cell precursors (NKP) are then derived and later express IL-2R/IL-15R β chain (CD122), defining refined NK progenitors (rNKp) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carotta et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fathman et al., 2011</xref>). At this stage in the mouse, commitment to NK cell development occurs, followed by the acquisition of the germline-encoded NK receptors NK1.1 and NKp46, and the cells become immature NK cells. Mature NK cells develop when they gain the expression of DX5 (CD49b), cytotoxic activity, and capacity to produce interferon-γ (IFNγ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2002</xref>). Mature NK cells can be further defined based upon the differential expression of CD27 and CD11b. Starting from double-negative cells being the most immature cells regarding their functionality, the cells upregulate the expression of CD27 then CD11b to become CD27<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>-</sup> (CD27<sup>+</sup> cells) then CD27<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> (double-positive) respectively, which undergo homeostatic expansion. Finally, the double-positive cells lose the expression of CD27 and retain expression of CD11b to become terminally differentiated NK cells (CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells) with increased cytotoxic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chiossone et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The commitment, development, and function of NK cells are distinctly regulated by multiple transcription factors, which are reflected by the expression of many unique surface markers at different stages of NK cell development. Eomesodermin has been identified as a unique factor required for NK development, distinct from ILC1s which share many similarities in surface makers with NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gordon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Intlekofer et al., 2005</xref>). Kruppel-like factor 2 intrinsically regulates NK cell homeostasis by limiting early-stage NK cell proliferation and guiding them toward trans-presented IL-15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rabacal et al., 2016</xref>). IRF8 is required for the effector functions of NK cells against viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2018</xref>). T-bet has a broader function in various cells including T cells, ILC1s, and NK cells, and positively regulates the terminal maturation of NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Townsend et al., 2004</xref>). Similarly, Zeb2 promotes NK terminal differentiation and may function downstream of T-bet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van Helden et al., 2015</xref>). Blimp-1 is expressed throughout NK cell maturation and is required for NK homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kallies et al., 2011</xref>). TCF1 (encoded by <italic>Tcf7</italic>) participates in the development of NK cells and its downregulation is required for NK terminal maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jeevan-Raj et al., 2017</xref>). A multi-tissue single-cell analysis divided NK cells into two major groups based on TCF1 levels: high expression of TCF1 correlated with genes expressed in immature NK cells including <italic>Cd27</italic>, <italic>Xcl1</italic>, and <italic>Kit</italic> while TCF1 was inversely correlated with the expression of genes involved in effector function such as <italic>Gzmb</italic>, <italic>Gzma</italic>, <italic>Ccl5</italic>, and <italic>Klrg1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McFarland et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, the expression of unique transcription factors at specific developmental stages of the cells appears to generate distinct gene regulatory circuitries.</p><p>These gene regulatory circuits provide ‘fingerprints’ that may be more reliable to reveal the developmental and functional disparities among phenotypically similar cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Collins et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, they provide insight into how the development of immune cells, including NK cells, occurs. Therefore, it is important to further clarify the expression pattern and function of unique transcription factors for NK cells during their development.</p><p>The transcription factor, BTB domain And CNC Homolog 2 (Bach2), was identified as a transcriptional repressor. It forms a heterodimer with Maf family proteins and binds to a DNA motif called T-MARE (TGCTGA G/C TCAGCA), a Maf recognition element (MARE), to regulate gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Muto et al., 1998</xref>). The regulatory function of Bach2 is mediated through its interaction with the super-enhancers (SEs), and its aberrant expression is associated with a variety of autoimmune diseases as well as cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Afzali et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marroquí et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roychoudhuri et al., 2016b</xref>). In physiological conditions, Bach2 has been shown to participate in cell development, as previously examined in the adaptive immune system. Bach2 is expressed in CLP and represses genes of myeloid lineage to promote the development of cells in the lymphoid lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Itoh-Nakadai et al., 2014</xref>). Bach2 was first shown to be a B cell-intrinsic transcription factor that regulates B cell development through inhibiting the expression of Blimp-1 (encoded by <italic>Prdm1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Muto et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ochiai et al., 2006</xref>). The rapid upregulation of Blimp-1 mediated by Bach2 deficiency promotes the terminal differentiation of B cells toward plasma cells even prior to class-switch recombination (CSR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Muto et al., 2004</xref>). Bach2 is also critical in regulating the plasticity of T cells. Under homeostatic conditions, Bach2 maintains T cells in a naïve state, preventing the generation of effector T cells by inhibiting the expression of effector molecules downstream of TCR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roychoudhuri et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tsukumo et al., 2013</xref>). Bach2 expression is reduced during T cell polarization while higher expression of Bach2 in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation promotes the formation of regulatory T cells by repressing genes related to effector differentiation within helper T cell lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lahmann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roychoudhuri et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Roychoudhuri et al., 2013</xref>). Regaining the expression of Bach2 after differentiation downregulated pro-inflammatory signals and differentiation into T cell memory cell lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Herndler-Brandstetter et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, the development and function of the adaptive immune cells are critically controlled by the expression of Bach2 and its associated regulatory circuits.</p><p>The role of Bach2 in NK cells has not been characterized. Here, we found that, at steady state, Bach2 was differentially expressed during NK cell development and terminal maturation. Its deficiency in NK cells resulted in a significantly increased expression of genes involved in NK cytotoxicity. Along with this, NK cells lacking Bach2 expression were more terminally differentiated and demonstrated better control of tumor metastasis. Thus, Bach2 serves as a checkpoint in the terminal maturation of NK cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Bach2 is expressed at different levels in NK cells at different developmental stages</title><p>To characterize the role of Bach2 in NK cell function, we first examined Bach2 expression during different stages of NK development. We used a <italic>Bach2</italic><sup>Flag</sup> reporter mouse in which a 3xFlag tag was fused at the N-terminus of Bach2 protein as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Herndler-Brandstetter et al., 2018</xref>). Bach2 expression was detected in CLPs and expression was relatively reduced in pre-NK progenitor cells and rNKp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), reflecting the critical role of Bach2 in the development of lymphoid cells from CLPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Itoh-Nakadai et al., 2014</xref>). During NK specification downstream of CLP, the expression of Bach2 was at a relatively lower level compared to CLPs. At the rNKp stage (CD122<sup>+</sup>CD127<sup>+</sup>), developing NK cells begin to acquire expression of the NK cell markers, NK1.1 and NKp46 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fathman et al., 2011</xref>). Bach2 was homogenously expressed by these NK cells in both the BM and spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). At this stage, NK cells further undergo maturation by acquiring the expression of CD49b (DX5). In both the BM and spleen, Bach2 expression was detected in both immature (DX5<sup>–</sup>NK1.1<sup>+</sup>) and mature (DX5<sup>+</sup>NK1.1<sup>+</sup>) NK cells while mature NK cells had even higher Bach2 expression than the immature NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We further subdivided NK cell maturation by surface expression of CD27 and CD11b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chiossone et al., 2009</xref>). Surprisingly, the expression of Bach2 was lowest in the most mature CD27<sup>-</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells compared with the other two stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This observation was further confirmed by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Thus, during NK cell terminal differentiation, Bach2 may function mainly in the relatively immature stages.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>BTB domain And CNC Homolog 2 (Bach2) expression at different natural killer (NK) cell developmental stages by analysis of Bach2<sup>Flag</sup> knock-in mouse.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Histogram plots of Bach2<sup>Flag</sup> expression (red) in common lymphoid progenitor (CLP), pre-NK progenitor (pre-NK), and refined NK progenitor (rNKp) as compared to cells from wild-type (WT) mice (gray fill).

Prior studies indicated IRF8-mediated signaling is required for NK cell maturation and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mace et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting increased accessibility of IRF8-regulated genes in Bach2 deficiency thus may result in bias toward NK cell development. Interestingly, we found that the enriched binding motifs by Bach1, Bach2, Fra2 (Fos-related Antigen 2, an AP-1 transcription factor subunit), and AP-1 in upregulated DARs all contained a common binding sequence (5’-TGA(C/G)TCA-3’) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, Bach2 has been reported to share this common binding sequence with the AP-1 transcription factor family and compete with AP-1 factors for the access to the target genes due to the similarity in their binding motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roychoudhuri et al., 2016a</xref>). Indeed, we found the direct target genes of Bach2 in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, such as <italic>Irf8</italic>, <italic>Ccl3</italic>, <italic>Ccl4</italic>, and <italic>Gzmb</italic>, showed elevated expression in Bach2<sup>cKO</sup> NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Also, there was increased JunD occupancy in the absence of Bach2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>) in NK cells. Thus, these data suggest that Bach2 in NK cells may also compete for AP-1-binding sites to regulate target genes and that the deficiency of Bach2 may increase accessibility for AP-1 transcription factors (such as JunD) to occupy the shared motif.</p><p>The motifs enriched in downregulated DARs were mostly TCF/LEF family protein-binding motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), especially the binding motif for TCF1 (encoded by <italic>Tcf7</italic>) that was also one of the top downregulated genes in Bach2<sup>cKO</sup> NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>).

Thus, the reduced accessibility of <italic>Tcf7</italic> targeted motifs in the absence of Bach2 reinforced our findings that Bach2 acted as a checkpoint protein to maintain the stemness of NK cells.</p><p>As a transcription repressor, Bach2 functions through interacting with other transcription factors or repressing the expression of downstream target genes. For example, Blimp-1 has been widely studied as a direct target of Bach2 in B cell and T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kometani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Muto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ochiai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Roychoudhuri et al., 2013</xref>). To explore the transcription factors affected by Bach2 deficiency, we analyzed the differentially expressed genes in RNA-seq and lowered the threshold (FDR &lt; 0.05 and log2 fold change &gt; 0.2) to include more transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Most of these differentially expressed transcription factors formed an intricate interaction network linked by Bach2 shown by the STRING database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Bach2 closely interacted with several transcription factors in the list such as Blimp-1 (encoded by <italic>Prdm1</italic>), TCF1 (encoded by <italic>Tcf7</italic>), BCL6, IRF8, and Fosl2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Since Bach2 functions as transcription repressor in NK cells, the upregulation of the transcripts of <italic>Prdm1</italic> and <italic>Irf8</italic> in Bach2-deficient NK cells indicates they may be targets of Bach2 in wild-type (WT) NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). By ATAC-seq we found that both <italic>Prdm1</italic> and <italic>Irf8</italic> genes displayed increased accessibility with Bach2 deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Furthermore, there were Bach2-binding motifs in the DARs, suggesting a direct regulatory function of Bach2 on <italic>Prdm1</italic> and <italic>Irf8</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In Bach2-deficient NK cells, <italic>Prdm1</italic> and <italic>Irf8</italic> were shown to be upregulated at RNA level by both RNA-seq and qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). However, at the protein level, we failed to detect the corresponding changes of Blimp-1 compared between NK cells from Bach2<sup>cKO</sup> and control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). While this may reflect differences in kinetics of mRNA versus protein expression, Blimp-1 has been shown to be a target of Bach2 in development of functional B cells and T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kometani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Muto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ochiai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Roychoudhuri et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting another possibility that the regulatory circuit may be different between Bach2 and Blimp-1 in NK cells. Surprisingly, we found that IRF8 was significantly upregulated in Bach2-deficient NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Given that the loss of IRF8 resulted in impaired terminal maturation of NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mace et al., 2017</xref>), Bach2 may repress the expression of IRF8 directly or indirectly to affect NK cell development. Overall, our data showed that Bach2 deficiency increased accessibility across the genome in NK cells and Bach2 may directly compete for AP-1-binding sites as a repressor or function in an indirect manner through interaction with other transcription factors.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Bach2 restrained terminal maturation of NK cells</title><p>Our genomics and transcriptomics analyses, coupled with the expression pattern of Bach2 during NK cell development, suggested that Bach2 restricted the terminal maturation of immature NK cells.

Since it had been shown that NK cells effectively cleared disseminated tumor cells from the lung within 24 hr of tumor inoculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ichise et al., 2022</xref>), we tested the NK function in vivo in the lung 24 hr after tumor injection in Bach2<sup>cKO</sup> mice. We observed increased NK cells in the lung in Bach2<sup>cKO</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) similar to the phenotype at steady state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). We did not detect more proliferating NK cells in the lungs in Bach2<sup>cKO</sup> mice after tumor injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>), suggesting that NK cell migration may cause the increased lung NK cell numbers in Bach2<sup>cKO</sup> mice. NK cells also displayed a biased maturation profile toward CD27<sup>-</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) as well as increased proportion of KLRG1<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) in Bach2<sup>cKO</sup> mice compared to control mice after tumor challenge.

Thus, the increased NK cell number with higher percentage of mature CD27<sup>-</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> subset with elevated KLRG1 expression may be responsible for the lower metastatic colonies in the lung in Bach2<sup>cKO</sup> mice. In summary, NK cells in Bach2-deficient mice are more efficient in controlling tumor progression and metastasis in the lung.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we found that Bach2 is highly expressed in functional immature NK cells (CD27<sup>+</sup> cells) and gradually downregulates its expression at the terminal stage of NK maturation (CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells). In line with this, we demonstrated that Bach2 deficiency caused a biased NK cell development toward terminal differentiation in an NK cell-intrinsic manner. Bach2-deficient NK cells also displayed increased cytotoxic gene expression and chromatin accessibility and were more potent in controlling tumor metastases.</p><p>Bach2 plays a critical role in the development of lymphoid cells: its presence in CLP repressed the expression of genes important for myeloid cells, promoting the development of T and B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Itoh-Nakadai et al., 2014</xref>). However, in the BM, the expression of Bach2 increased after commitment of stem cells to the B cell lineage with its expression high in pre-pro B cells, pro-B cells, pre-B cells, and immature B cells. Bach2 served as a checkpoint protein in B cells that inhibited the expression of the immunoglobulin heavy chain of activated p53 by competing with BCL6 for functional VDJ rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Muto et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Swaminathan et al., 2013</xref>). Bach2 also suppressed the differentiation of activated B cells to plasma cells by inhibiting the expression of Blimp-1 (encoded by <italic>Prdm1</italic> gene), which allowed CSR and somatic hypermutation to take place before becoming plasma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kometani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Muto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ochiai et al., 2006</xref>). Here, we also detected a relatively high expression of Bach2 in CLP but there was a reduction in pre-NK progenitors and refined NK progenitors. We showed that Bach2 started to gain its expression in NK cells after the acquisition of germline-encoded NK receptors such as NK1.1 and NKp46, a stage when NK cells displayed an effector program. The differential expression pattern of Bach2 in the early stage between NK cell development and B cell development indicated a divergent trajectory of CLP for the commitment of B cells and NK cells.</p><p>Bach2 was specifically highly expressed in CD27<sup>+</sup> cells but not in CD11b<sup>+</sup> terminal differentiated cells. Interestingly, maturing NK cells upregulate CD27 transiently followed by the upregulation of CD11b and KLRG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chiossone et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huntington et al., 2007</xref>). During this transition, NK cells lose their homeostatic expansion capacity but acquire cytotoxic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chiossone et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huntington et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting the main role of Bach2 is to suppress the functional development of the most mature NK cells. Indeed, when we examined the differential gene expression and genome accessibility in the context of Bach2 deficiency specifically in mature NK cells, we detected an upregulation of a series of genes related to cell proliferation, immune effector molecules, and cell apoptosis. In contrast, genes associated with cell development and homeostasis were downregulated with Bach2 deficiency, suggesting that Bach2 might be required for NK cell self-renewal at steady state.</p><p>The Bach2-regulated genes we detected with differential expression patterns in NK cells correlated very well with the gene signatures observed in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, their cytotoxic counterparts in the adaptive immune system. One of the genes, <italic>Tcf7</italic>, was particularly interesting and may be important for the mechanism of the regulation of NK development by Bach2. <italic>Tcf7</italic> (encoding TCF1) is highly expressed in naïve T cells, decreased in effector T cells, and regained its expression in memory cells, showing its role in maintaining pluripotency of the T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Willinger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhao et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, Bach2 also maintained T cells in a naïve status under homeostatic conditions, preventing the generation of effector T cells through inhibiting the expression of effector molecules downstream of TCR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roychoudhuri et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tsukumo et al., 2013</xref>). On the other hand, TCF1 was recently shown to be a hallmark of stem-like precursor exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells with self-renewal capability and can differentiate into terminal effector-like exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells which lacked TCF1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Utzschneider et al., 2020</xref>). It was shown that Bach2 also played a positive role in maintaining the pool of these stem-like precursors exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells as enforced overexpression of Bach2 resulted in the cells retaining this stem-like condition while knockout of Bach2 led to terminal differentiation of the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yao et al., 2021</xref>). Our data in NK cells also showed the link between Bach2 and TCF1 as Bach2 deficiency caused downregulation of TCF1 transcription. More importantly, TCF1 has been previously shown to participate in NK development and its downregulation was required for NK cell terminal maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jeevan-Raj et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that Bach2 and TCF1 may interact in regulating NK cell development.</p><p>Given that Bach2 is a transcriptional repressor through its interaction with SEs and TCF1 was downregulated in the absence of Bach2, it is possible that Bach2 may indirectly regulate TCF1 expression. Although RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and flow cytometry all showed a trend for the downregulation of TCF1, it is still unknown how TCF1 is regulated by Bach2. Unlike CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in which Bach2 may antagonize RUNX3 to induce TCF1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yao et al., 2021</xref>), we did not detect changes in RUNX3 expression in NK cells, indicating a different regulatory circuit between Bach2 and TCF1 in NK cells. Another potential interaction between Bach2 and TCF1 is through BCL6. We found that BCL6 was downregulated in Bach2<sup>cKO</sup> NK cells while BCL6 was recently reported to directly bind the regulatory region of <italic>Tcf7</italic> and promoted its expression in memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2019</xref>), indicating that Bach2 can induce BCL6 expression (a similar positive correlation was found in B cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2014</xref>) and promote TCF1 expression. Thus, the pathways for Bach2 to regulate TCF1 may incorporate pathways shared by both B cells and T cells but since we only detected a minor decrease of TCF1 at the protein level in Bach2-deficient NK cells, to what extent Bach2-TCF1 regulation impacts NK development requires further investigation.</p><p>Regarding how Bach2 functions in NK cells as compared to other lymphoid cells, Blimp-1 was uncovered to be the target of Bach2 in both B cells and T cells to regulate cell differentiation and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ochiai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Roychoudhuri et al., 2013</xref>). Regulome analysis of human NK cells also proposed that Bach2-mediated gene suppression relied upon inhibiting Blimp-1 expression, and Blimp-1 repressed the TCF1-LEF1-MYC-induced homeostatic expansion of NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Collins et al., 2019</xref>). However, in our data, we did not detect changes in Blimp-1 protein expression except for a slight upregulation at the mRNA level in Bach2-deficient NK cells, indicating <italic>Prdm1</italic> is not the major target of Bach2 in regulating NK cell differentiation. Interestingly, IRF8 may be potentially regulated by Bach2 to promote NK cell maturation. IRF8 expression was significantly upregulated in Bach2-deficient NK cells and the chromatin at the <italic>Irf8</italic> locus showed increased accessibility. Bach2 may repress IRF8 transcription directly since we found Bach2-binding motifs within the intron region. On the other hand, Bach2 may interact with other transcription factors to regulate IRF8 expression indirectly. A recent study shows that there are three MafK-binding sites within the <italic>Irf8</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fourier et al., 2020</xref>). As Bach2 has been shown to act together with MafK to bind to the MAREs and negatively regulate B cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Muto et al., 1998</xref>), it is possible that a similar mechanism may occur in NK cell regulation by Bach2.</p><p>It is of great interest to explore other gene regulatory circuits that control NK cell developmental stages. While Bach2 negatively regulates downstream factors to restrain NK terminal differentiation, the expression and function of Bach2 are expected to be tightly regulated by upstream transcription factors. Studies in B cells showed that the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) inhibits FoxO1 to reduce Bach2 mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tamahara et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, FoxO1 was found to directly bind within and proximal to the Bach2 gene locus in CD8 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Delpoux et al., 2021</xref>). Upon T cell activation, FoxO1 induces the Bach2 transcripts to compete with AP-1 factors for AP-1-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Delpoux et al., 2021</xref>). In NK cells, FoxO1 suppresses NK cell maturation by repressing T-bet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deng et al., 2015</xref>) and mTORC2 was also found to regulate T-bet expression through Akt<sup>S473</sup>- FoxO1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). When mTORC2 was knocked out, the expression of T-bet was impaired. However, Bach2 was upregulated at the mRNA level as a target of FoxO1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). Together, these data suggest that Bach2 may be the downstream target of an mTORC2-AKT- FoxO1 axis in NK cells, which will need further evaluation.</p><p>Human NK cells encompass two major subsets, known as CD56<sup>dim</sup> and CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells. CD62L (encoded by <italic>Sell</italic>) and CCR7 were shown to be highly expressed by CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells and drove their migration to secondary lymphoid tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Campbell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frey et al., 1998</xref>). CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells also expressed high levels of c-Kit for their homeostatic proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Matos et al., 1993</xref>). In agreement with this, <italic>Sell</italic>, <italic>Ccr7</italic>, and <italic>Kit</italic> genes were all downregulated in Bach2-deficient NK cells in our data in mice. In contrast, CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells displayed a high density of CX3CR1 for the migration to tissues and higher cytotoxic activity by increased expression of perforin and various granzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Campbell et al., 2001</xref>), which resembled our Bach2-deficient NK phenotypes in mice. More importantly, Bach2 has been demonstrated to be highly expressed by CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells and with low expression in CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Holmes et al., 2021</xref>). In murine NK cells, Bach2 also shows preferential expression in immature CD27<sup>+</sup> subsets compared to mature CD11b<sup>+</sup> subsets. Therefore, the function of Bach2 may be conserved between human and mouse for its regulatory circuitries but this still needs further exploration.</p><p>NK cells are currently being studied in clinical trials as potential targets for cancer immunotherapy. Our study shows that, in mice, Bach2 functions as a checkpoint to restrain NK cell cytotoxicity and Bach2 deficiency leads to enhanced NK cell-mediated control of B16 melanoma metastases. Studies in humans have also suggested that Bach2 may play a similar role in human NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Collins et al., 2019</xref>). As a result, our study suggests that Bach2 may be a novel target for checkpoint inhibition of NK cells for cancer immunotherapy.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice and cell line</title><p>WT C57BL/6 (B6) mice and <italic>Rag1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratories. <italic>Bach2</italic><sup>Flag</sup> knock-in mice have been described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Herndler-Brandstetter et al., 2018</xref>) as have <italic>Bach2</italic><sup>flox/flox</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kometani et al., 2013</xref>).

Beta-Actin Rabbit antibody (4967S) and anti-rabbit IgG HRP-linked antibody (7074S) were purchased from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>RNA-seq and qPCR</title><p>NK cells from the spleen were enriched by the EasySep Mouse NK cell isolation kit (STEMCELL Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Enriched cells were then sorted into CD3<sup>-</sup>CD19<sup>-</sup>NK1.1<sup>+</sup>NKp46<sup>+</sup> cells. RNA was purified by PureLink RNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen, 12183018A). RNA-seq was performed by the Genome Technology Access Center at Washington University School of Medicine. NovaSeq 6000 was used for sequencing. RNA-seq reads were then aligned to the Ensembl release 76 primary assembly with STAR v2.5.1a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>). Gene counts were derived from the number of uniquely aligned unambiguous reads by Subread/featureCount v1.4.6-p5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liao et al., 2014</xref>). Low expressing genes were filtered with the criteria of cmp &gt; 1 in at least three samples. Two outliers were removed. RUVr method (k=1) in RUVseq R package was used to remove batch effect. Differential gene expression was determined using the EdgeR R package with FDR &lt; 0.01 and log2 fold change &gt; 1.5 as the thresholds. Heatmaps were generated with pheatmap R package. PCA was performed by prcomp function of R. Gene set enrichment pathways analysis was done using the Broad Institute’s GSEA software by comparing signature databases from GSE83978 and GSE77857. For qPCR, cDNA was synthesized by ProtoScript II Reverse Transcriptase (NEB, M0368S, Ipswich). Pre-designed primers for indicated genes were obtained from IDT. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed by PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) on a StepOnePlus real-time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Relative gene expression was normalized to beta-actin and calculated by the ΔΔCt method.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>ATAC-seq and analyses</title><p>NK cells from the spleen were enriched by the EasySep Mouse NK cell isolation kit (STEMCELL Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Enriched cells were then sorted into CD3<sup>-</sup>CD19<sup>-</sup>NK1.1<sup>+</sup>NKp46<sup>+</sup> cells. ATAC-seq libraries were generated using the omni-ATAC protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Corces et al., 2017</xref>); 150K NK cells were used as input for each sample. All ATAC libraries were barcoded, pooled, and sequenced using 75 bp paired-end read to a depth of at least 30 million. Quality control of ATAC data was performed using the AIAP pipeline (v1.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). All libraries received the highest possible score (total score = 10). ATAC peaks for each sample were called as a part of the AIAP pipeline, using macs2 with FDR cutoff at 0.01. After manual inspection of the peaks called, we further filtered the resulting narrowPeak files for peaks with −log10FDR≥9. To call DARs, we merged all overlapping peaks to create a union peak set. We then formed a peak-sample matrix with each entry corresponding to the number of Tn5 insertion sites in each peak for each sample. Tn5 insertion sites were also calculated as a part of the AIAP pipeline. DARs were called using DESeq2 (v1.26.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Love et al., 2014</xref>) with default parameters with the cutoff of ‘log2 fold change≥0.5 and FDR≤0.05’. For motif enrichment in DARs, we separately generated background peaks for up (Bach2<sup>cKO</sup> &gt; Control) and down (Control &gt; Bach2<sup>cKO</sup>) DARs. For each DAR, we selected without replacement its 10 closest non-DARs in the Euclidean space constructed from WT samples as background peaks. We used HOMER (v4.11.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>) for motif enrichment in DARs relative to background peaks (findMotifsGenome.pl up_DAR.bed mm10.fa out_dir -bg up_DAR_background.bed -nomotif -size given). To annotate Bach2 motifs in DARs, we downloaded the Bach2 motif (MA1101.1) from the JASPAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Castro-Mondragon et al., 2022</xref>) motif database, and used FIMO (v5.4.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grant et al., 2011</xref>) to scan DARs for the presence of this motif with a p-value cutoff at 0.0005. ATAC signal was visualized using WashU Epigenome Browser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>B16F10 metastasis assay</title><p>B16F10 cells were maintained in R10 (RPMI 1640 medium [Gibco] containing 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% L-glutamine, 55 μM 2-mercaptoethanol). Before injection, 2.5×10<sup>5</sup> B16F10 cells were resuspended in 300 µl PBS, and intravenously injected into mice.

Splenocytes were stimulated with 1 μg/ml precoated antibody against NK1.1 (PK136), 100 ng/ml IL-15 (PeproTech), or 20 ng/ml IL-12 p70 (PeproTech) plus 20 ng/ml IL-18 (MBL, Woburn, MA). BFA (Biolegend) was added after 1 hr. After 6 hr of stimulation, cells were harvested for IFNγ detection by flow cytometry.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>NK cell cytotoxicity assay</title><p>Lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells were produced by passing splenocytes through nylon wool column then cultured in R10 with 800 U/ml IL-2 supernatant (homemade) for 7 days. Adherent LAK cells from day 4, day 6, and day 7 were checked for the purity by flow cytometry for CD3<sup>-</sup>CD19<sup>-</sup>NK1.1<sup>+</sup> cells. B16F10 cells were labeled by 40 µM calcein-AM (Biolegend) as target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Neri et al., 2001</xref>). LAK cells were then co-cultured with target cells at different effector to target ratios for 4 hr. Target cells alone were treated with 2% Triton for maximal release. Cell-free supernatants were harvested and fluorescence (excitation: 488 nm; emission: 520 nm) determined on Synergy H1 plate reader (Center for Human Immunology and Immunotherapy Programs, Washington University School of Medicine). The specific killing efficiency was calculated as {(experimental release – spontaneous release)/(maximal release – spontaneous release)} * 100.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 9 software.

revisions, shown below. We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The Transcription Factor Bach2 Negatively Regulates Natural Killer Cell Maturation and Function&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Satyajit Rath as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Strengthen the information around the reproducibility and robustness of experimental design, replication and validation and expand the functional assessment of the phenotype.</p><p>2. Provide a deeper analysis of the mechanistic and bioinformatic data.</p><p>3. Strengthen the analyses of the tumour model including strengthening controls and deeper analyses of NK cell phenotypes.</p><p>Overall, revision of this work could significantly improve the quality of the study for the community.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Specific points that should be addressed:</p><p>1. Figure 1F: With the reduction of Bach2 expression between 2 and 12-week old mice, this seems to be correlated with Bach2 expression within the populations – this data has not been shown. Is it possible to show this data in the supplementary Figure 1?</p><p>2. Does this switch imply that reduction in Bach2 expression is necessary to make mature NK cells?</p><p>3. Did the authors analyse the conditional mice for deletion efficiency? Could these data be provided?</p><p>4. NcrCreBach2 mice were generated. The floxed mice were used as controls. It is unclear if NcrCre mice were also used as controls as their expression of NKp46 is diminished compared with wild-type mice, and thus likely Bach2 floxed mice. If NcrCre mice were not used, could the authors provide an explanation for this and indicate in the paper the implications (although it is appreciated that with corrected gating, this should not be an issue).</p><p>5. Although the repertoire was not drastically affected, CD94 was altered 'considerably' but was not ablated.</p><p>6. The authors provide a nice analysis of the deficient and wildtype cells but have not undertaken extensive confirmation of changes nor explored the molecular relationships or interactions that are driving the changes they see. The work would be much stronger with a much deeper analysis of these features.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Data presentation could be improved. First of all, all bar graphs should be replaced by scatter plots as in Figure 1G so that the biological replicates and variation could be clearly shown. In Figure 1, there should be statistics accompanying FACS plots. In Figure 3, there is no information on the group size of each experiment so it is difficult to judge the conclusion. For example, Figure 3A shows no significant difference in subsets in BM but the FACS plots suggest there was some difference. Would it be an issue of small group size? If so, larger group sizes (n&gt;5) are preferred.</p><p>In the tumor model, more characterization of NK cells in the lung could be helpful. Were there any changes in numbers for total NK cells or specific subsets between WT and KO NK cells? What were the levels of effector functional changes of KO NK cells, as compared to WT NK cells?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript raises the following concerns requiring significant changes:</p><p>(i) NK cell number is not changed in the spleen of KO mice, but what about other sites – particularly BM, lymph node, liver and lung? Are the subset changes also observed in these peripheral sites? Characterisation of the lung is particularly important as differences in lung homing could explain the augmented lung metastasis control seen in KO mice.</p><p>(ii) Related to the above point, does NK cell BACH2 expression change in key peripheral tissue sites (eg. lungs, LN, liver)?</p><p>(iii) There is no assessment of NK cell function in KO mice. Do KO NK cells exhibit superior ex vivo killing capacity and cytokine production? This is critical for understanding why KO mice better control tumours.</p><p>(iv) The RNAseq data suggests that KO NK cells are more proliferative. Are there more Ki67+ cells and/or is there more EdU incorporation within KO NK cells? This could again be relevant to the proliferative response to tumour challenge.</p><p>(v) The phenotype of KO NK cells within the lung early during the response to tumour challenge also needs to be examined to clarify whether there are any KO-specific changes in NK cell number and/or phenotype stimulated by lung metastases.</p><p>(vi) Mechanistic data and bioinformatic analysis are minimal. Ideally, WT vs KO ATAC-seq data should be included as BACH2 is known to influence the binding of other key TFs (eg. RUNX3, BATF) via changes in accessibility. However, even cross-referencing the RNAseq data with published data from CD8s, a cell type that the authors propose BACH2 functions similarly within, would add significant value. For example, how many of the DE genes are known as direct Bach2 targets within CD8s (using data from Roychoudhuri et al., NI 2016)? How many of these targets were also identified as bound by Jun factors in the same paper (ie. could AP-1 antagonism explain some of the gene expression changes)?</p><p>(vii) In general, a more in-depth discussion of how published BACH2 regulated pathways (ie. BATF, Blimp1, RUNX3, AP-1, etc) could explain the KO phenotype is needed. As noted above, despite superficial similarities between the NK cell and CD8 KO phenotype, the lack of difference in BATF and Blimp1 expression within KO NK cells argues that there may be significant mechanistic differences in how BACH2 operates within these two cell types.</p><p>(viii) Given the importance of the tumour control data to the paper, more mice are needed in the Ctrl group in Figure 4B, as two significant outliers appear to be skewing/exaggerating the Ctrl average. Also, 3 mice per group in the PK136 experiments is not enough for publication – at least 5-6 mice per group are needed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77294.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Specific points that should be addressed:</p><p>1. Figure 1F: With the reduction of Bach2 expression between 2 and 12-week old mice, this seems to be correlated with Bach2 expression within the populations – this data has not been shown. Is it possible to show this data in the supplementary Figure 1?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. Accordingly, we have directly compared the expression of Bach2 (by fold change of MFI) within populations of NK cells between 2-week and 12-week-old mice. In Figure 1—figure supplement 1D, we showed that, in 2-week-old mice, Bach2 has significantly higher expression within each subset compared to 12-week-old mice. Changes are described on lines 155-157.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Does this switch imply that reduction in Bach2 expression is necessary to make mature NK cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We think the reduction of Bach2’s expression might be necessary to make mature NK cells. On the one hand, there are negative correlations between the expression of Bach2 with age and maturation status (Figure 1D and 1F). Also, Bach2 in NK cells functions to repress the expression of effector genes (Figure 2D), which are critical for maturation of NK cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Did the authors analyse the conditional mice for deletion efficiency? Could these data be provided?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we have analyzed the deletion efficiency in conditional mice by qPCR and added on lines 170-172. In Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, we detected <italic>Bach2</italic> mRNA expression by 3 pairs of primers. Primers targeting exon 1-2 which includes part of deleted region give no signal while primers targeting exon 3-4 and exon 4-5 as internal controls show normal expression levels. Since the start codon is within deletion region, there will be no translation of Bach2 protein.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. NcrCreBach2 mice were generated. The floxed mice were used as controls. It is unclear if NcrCre mice were also used as controls as their expression of NKp46 is diminished compared with wild-type mice, and thus likely Bach2 floxed mice. If NcrCre mice were not used, could the authors provide an explanation for this and indicate in the paper the implications (although it is appreciated that with corrected gating, this should not be an issue).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your kind reminder. As you have pointed out, we dealt this situation with proper gating. In Figure 2—figure supplement 1C, we showed that there was slightly lower NKp46 expression in Bach2<sup>cKO</sup> (<italic>Bach2</italic><sup>flox/flox</sup> <italic>NKp46</italic>-iCre) mice compared to control (<italic>Bach2</italic><sup>flox/flox</sup>) mice. However, with proper gating, all the NKp46 positive cells are included.</p><p>Additionally, a previous study (Narni-Mancinelli, E., Chaix, J., Fenis, A., Kerdiles, Y. M., Yessaad, N., Reynders, A., Gregoire, C., Luche, H., Ugolini, S., Tomasello, E., Walzer, T., and Vivier, E. (2011).

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 108(45), 18324–18329. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1112064108) showed that Ncr-Cre does not affect the maturation of NK cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Although the repertoire was not drastically affected, CD94 was altered 'considerably' but was not ablated.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. The reduction of CD94 may be irrelevant to the development and function of NK cells based on a previous study (Orr, M. T., Wu, J., Fang, M., Sigal, L. J., Spee, P., Egebjerg, T., Dissen, E., Fossum, S., Phillips, J. H., and Lanier, L. L. (2010). Development and function of CD94-deficient natural killer cells. PloS one, 5(12), e15184. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0015184). It showed that the deficiency of CD94 has no role on NK maturation and many functions. Therefore, we did not specifically explore this within the scope of our current study. In the revised paper, we discussed this point on lines 172-177.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The authors provide a nice analysis of the deficient and wildtype cells but have not undertaken extensive confirmation of changes nor explored the molecular relationships or interactions that are driving the changes they see. The work would be much stronger with a much deeper analysis of these features.</p></disp-quote><p>We have taken this comment to heart by performing additional experiments and have revised the manuscript accordingly.</p><p>In Figure 2, we performed qPCR (Figure 2C and 2D) and flow cytometry (Figure 2E and 2F) to confirm the differential expression of target genes. Also, we included more biological replicates to make it more reliable.</p><p>In Figure 3—figure supplement 1C and 1D, we extracted all transcription factors that have differential expression with Bach2 deficiency from RNA-seq data and explored the potential interactions between them and found potential targets of Bach2. Changes are described on lines 274-283.</p><p>In Figure 3, we performed ATAC-seq to compare the differential accessible regions (DARs) between Bach2<sup>cKO</sup> mice and control mice. With ATAC-seq data, we checked if there are DARs around the genes for potential Bach2 target transcription factors and if there is a Bach2 binding motif within the DARs. Also, we used flow cytometry to validate the expression of potential Bach2 targets. Changes are described on lines 283-299.</p><p>In Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and 1B, we compared our RNA-seq data with published data on Bach2 from CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (Roychoudhuri, R., Clever, D., Li, P., Wakabayashi, Y., Quinn, K. M., Klebanoff, C. A., Ji, Y., Sukumar, M., Eil, R. L., Yu, Z., Spolski, R., Palmer, D. C., Pan, J. H., Patel, S. J., Macallan, D. C., Fabozzi, G., Shih, H.

Nature immunology, 17(7), 851–860. https://doi.org/10.1038/ni.3441). We pulled out the differentially expressed genes that have been identified as direct Bach2 targets (TCR-induced and non-induced) in CD8 cells and compared the differences between average JunD binding at these Bach2 binding sites with differences in mRNA expression. Changes were added to lines 255-261.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Data presentation could be improved.

Do KO NK cells exhibit superior ex vivo killing capacity and cytokine production? This is critical for understanding why KO mice better control tumours.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. In the revised manuscript, we have included functional assessment data.</p><p>In Figure 5—figure supplement 1A, we showed Bach2-deficient NK cells show similar ex vivo killing against B16F10 cells compared to WT NK cells. In Figure 5—figure supplement 1B, we showed that there is a similar percentage of IFNγ-producing NK cells when comparing Bach2-deficient NK cells and control NK cells upon cytokine stimulation. Changes are described on lines 347-352.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(iv) The RNAseq data suggests that KO NK cells are more proliferative. Are there more Ki67+ cells and/or is there more EdU incorporation within KO NK cells? This could again be relevant to the proliferative response to tumour challenge.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. In Figure 2—figure supplement 1E, we showed at steady state, there is a similar percentage of Ki67+ cells in Bach2 deficient NK cells and WT NK cells (on lines 213-216). In Figure 5—figure supplement 1D, we showed that after 24h of B16F10 tumour challenge, the percentage of Ki67+ cells are comparable between Bach2-deficient and WT NK cells (on lines 359-361).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(v) The phenotype of KO NK cells within the lung early during the response to tumour challenge also needs to be examined to clarify whether there are any KO-specific changes in NK cell number and/or phenotype stimulated by lung metastases.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestions. We have added the data to Figure 5.</p><p>In Figure 5C to 5E, we showed that there is a higher number of total NK cells, higher percentage of CD27-CD11b+ population and higher percentage of KLRG1+ NK cells in Bach2 knockout mice after 24h of tumor challenge, suggesting the higher percentage of mature NK cells (CD11b+) with elevated KLRG1 expression may contribute to lower metastases colonies in Bach2<sup>cKO</sup> mice. We discussed this point on lines 355-368.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(vi) Mechanistic data and bioinformatic analysis are minimal. Ideally, WT vs KO ATAC-seq data should be included as BACH2 is known to influence the binding of other key TFs (eg. RUNX3, BATF) via changes in accessibility. However, even cross-referencing the RNAseq data with published data from CD8s, a cell type that the authors propose BACH2 functions similarly within, would add significant value. For example, how many of the DE genes are known as direct Bach2 targets within CD8s (using data from Roychoudhuri et al., NI 2016)? How many of these targets were also identified as bound by Jun factors in the same paper (ie. could AP-1 antagonism explain some of the gene expression changes)?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestions. We performed an ATAC-seq experiment to address this point, now shown in Figure 3. The data showed that AP-1 factor binding motif was enriched in upregulated DARs.</p><p>Also, we cross-referenced our RNA-seq data to the public data from CD8s (Roychoudhuri, R., Clever, D., Li, P., Wakabayashi, Y., Quinn, K. M., Klebanoff, C. A., Ji, Y., Sukumar, M., Eil, R. L., Yu, Z., Spolski, R., Palmer, D. C., Pan, J. H., Patel, S. J., Macallan, D. C., Fabozzi, G., Shih, H.

The data are added to Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and 1B in which we compared our RNA-seq data with RNA-seq data from CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p><p>There were 193 differentially expressed genes identified to be direct target of Bach2 in CD8 cells (including 24 TCR-induced genes and 169 non TCR-induced genes). We showed the data of TCR-induced genes in Figure 3—figure supplement 1A. We also compared the differences between average JunD binding at these Bach2 binding sites with differences in mRNA expression in Figure 3—figure supplement 1B. Our data showed that there was indeed increased JunD occupancy in the absence of Bach2 in NK cells.</p><p>The data are described in detail on lines 236-269.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(vii) In general, a more in-depth discussion of how published BACH2 regulated pathways (ie. BATF, Blimp1, RUNX3, AP-1, etc) could explain the KO phenotype is needed. As noted above, despite superficial similarities between the NK cell and CD8 KO phenotype, the lack of difference in BATF and Blimp1 expression within KO NK cells argues that there may be significant mechanistic differences in how BACH2 operates within these two cell types.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. Accordingly, we have done more in-depth analyses of our RNA-seq data.</p><p>In Figure 3—figure supplement 1C, we extracted all transcription factors that have differential expression with Bach2 deficiency from RNA-seq data and explored the potential interactions between them and found potential targets of Bach2. For example, <italic>Prdm1</italic> turns out to be significantly upregulated however with only a slight fold-change in Bach2-deficient NK cells. Besides, we have found that <italic>Irf8</italic> is significantly upregulated in Bach2-deficient NK cells. In Figure 3—figure supplement 1D, we explored the interaction between these differentially expressed transcription factors in STRING database and found <italic>Prdm1</italic>, <italic>Irf8</italic> to be potential targets of Bach2. In Figure 3D and 3E, we have used flow cytometry to validate the protein expression change of Blimp-1 and IRF8. In Figure 3, we performed ATAC-seq to compare the differential accessible regions (DARs) between Bach2<sup>cKO</sup> mice and control mice. With ATAC-seq data, we checked if there are DARs around the genes <italic>Prdm1</italic> and <italic>Irf8</italic> as potential Bach2 target transcription factors and if there are Bach2 binding motifs within the DARs. Changes in detail are added on lines 271-299.</p><p>On lines 433-443, we also discussed that with regard to RUNX3 and TCF1, there might be different mechanisms of how Bach2 regulates cell development and differentiation between CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and NK cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(viii) Given the importance of the tumour control data to the paper, more mice are needed in the Ctrl group in Figure 4B, as two significant outliers appear to be skewing/exaggerating the Ctrl average. Also, 3 mice per group in the PK136 experiments is not enough for publication – at least 5-6 mice per group are needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have repeated the experiment and added more biological replicates as revised in Figure 5B.</p></body></sub-article></article>
