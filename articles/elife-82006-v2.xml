A broad spectrum of epigenetic mechanisms is likely to cause the epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) and mesenchymal-to-epithelial (MET) transitions necessary to allow local dissemination and distant metastasis. Here, we report on the role played by alternative splicing (AS) in eliciting phenotypic plasticity in epithelial malignancies with focus on colon cancer. By taking advantage of the coexistence of subpopulations of fully epithelial (EpCAM<sup>hi</sup>) and quasi-mesenchymal and highly metastatic (EpCAM<sup>lo</sup>) cells in conventional human cancer cell lines, we here show that the differential expression of <italic>ESRP1</italic> and other RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) downstream of the EMT master regulator <italic>ZEB1</italic> alters the AS pattern of a broad spectrum of targets including <italic>CD44</italic> and <italic>NUMB</italic>, thus resulting in the generation of specific isoforms functionally associated with increased invasion and metastasis. Additional functional and clinical validation studies indicate that both the newly identified RBPs and the CD44s and NUMB2/4 splicing isoforms promote local invasion and distant metastasis and are associated with poor survival in colon cancer. The systematic elucidation of the spectrum of EMT-related RBPs and AS targets in epithelial cancers, apart from the insights in the mechanisms underlying phenotypic plasticity, will lead to the identification of novel and tumor-specific therapeutic targets.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>EMT</kwd><kwd>RNA-binding protein</kwd><kwd>ESRP1</kwd><kwd>CD44</kwd><kwd>NUMB</kwd><kwd>CMS4</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004543</institution-id><institution>China Scholarship Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>201806300047</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Tong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The identification of alternative splicing targets and upstream RNA-binding proteins that underlie EMT and metastasis in colon cancer stratifies patients according to their overall survival and provide new insights on the function of specific isoforms along the migrating cancer stem cell sequence.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Colon cancer still represents one of the major causes of cancer-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. Apart from its high incidence, the adenoma-carcinoma sequence along which colon cancer progresses has served as a classic model to elucidate the underlying genetic alterations representative of virtually all of the hallmarks of cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hanahan, 2022</xref>), possibly with the only exception of ‘<italic>activating invasion and metastasis (unlocking phenotypic plasticity; non-mutational epigenetic reprogramming</italic>)’. As also reported in other epithelial cancers, the several steps of the invasion-metastasis cascade are not caused by genetic alterations but rather by transient morphological and gene expression changes of epigenetic nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernards and Weinberg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Reiter et al., 2018</xref>). In this context, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and its reverse mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) likely represent the main mechanisms underlying local dissemination and distant metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Thiery et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brabletz et al., 2005</xref>). EMT is triggered at the invasive front of the primary colon carcinoma in cells earmarked by nuclear β-catenin and enhanced Wnt signaling, as the result of their physical and paracrine interactions with the microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fodde and Brabletz, 2007</xref>). The acquisition of quasi-mesenchymal features allows local invasion and dissemination through the surrounding stromal compartment. Of note, EMT/MET should not be regarded as binary processes in view of the existence of metastable hybrid E/M states (partial EMT [pEMT]) endowed with phenotypic plasticity and likely to underlie the reversible morphological and functional transitions necessary to successfully complete the invasion-metastasis cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Teeuwssen and Fodde, 2019</xref>).</p><p>The molecular basis of the epigenetic changes underlying EMT and MET is likely to encompass a broad spectrum of mechanisms ranging from chromatin remodeling and histone modifications to promoter DNA methylation, non-coding RNAs (e.g. microRNAs), and alternative splicing (AS). The inclusion/exclusion of specific exons in mature mRNAs results in different protein isoforms with distinct biological functions. AS occurs in 92–94% of human genes leading to enriched protein density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blencowe, 2006</xref>). Several sequence-specific RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) have been identified which bind pre-mRNAs to control AS in context-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fu and Ares, 2014</xref>). Multiple cancer-specific AS variants have been found to underlie progression and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kahles et al., 2018</xref>). Likewise, AS has been suggested to play key roles in EMT/MET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roy Burman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oltean and Bates, 2014</xref>) and phenotypic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biamonti et al., 2019</xref>) in cancer by expression changes in RBP-encoding genes and their consequences for the modulation of downstream AS targets.</p><p>The <italic>ESRP1</italic> (epithelial splicing regulatory protein 1) gene encodes for an epithelial-specific RBP and splicing regulator shown to play a central role in EMT by modulating AS of EMT-associated genes including <italic>FGFR2</italic>, Mena, <italic>CD44,</italic> and p120-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Thiery et al., 2009</xref>). Relevant to the present study, ESRP1 was reported to regulate the EMT from CD44v (variable) to CD44s (standard) isoforms in breast and lung cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yae et al., 2012</xref>). As for colon cancer, whether ESRP1 regulates AS of CD44 and other target genes downstream of EMT/MET activation during invasion and metastasis is yet poorly understood.</p><p>Recently, we identified and thoroughly characterized subpopulations of CD44<sup>hi</sup>/EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> cells (here referred to as EpCAM<sup>lo</sup>) that coexist within immortalized colon cancer cell lines with their epithelial counterparts (CD44<sup>hi</sup>/EpCAM<sup>hi</sup>; for brevity EpCAM<sup>hi</sup>) through stochastic state transitions governed by phenotypic plasticity and pEMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sacchetti et al., 2021</xref>). Accordingly, EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> cells feature highly invasive and metastatic capacities. Here, we took advantage of these in vitro models of phenotypic plasticity to test the hypothesis according to which AS driven by upstream RBPs underlie EMT (and MET). Among the identified AS targets, specific CD44 and NUMB isoforms were shown to play specific and unexpected roles in stemness and cancer. Moreover, we provide an extensive list of additional EMT-related RBPs and AS targets and show that many are conserved in other epithelial malignancies. Likewise, RBPs and AS targets differentially expressed among distinct carcinoma types are likely to reflect the distinct modalities through which these malignant cells metastasize.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Differential expression of RBPs in the quasi-mesenchymal and highly metastatic EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> colon cancer cells affects AS of a broad spectrum of downstream target genes</title><p>As previously reported, the EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> subpopulation of colon cancer cells is earmarked by increased expression of the <italic>ZEB1</italic> transcription factor, responsible for EMT activation and for their quasi-mesenchymal and highly metastatic phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sacchetti et al., 2021</xref>).

After dimension reduction with principal component analysis (PCA), the samples separated by group (i.e. CD44s-OE, CD44v6-OE, and controls) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Notably, the CD44s-OE samples showed most distinct expression in both cell lines when compared to the parental and CD44v6-OE cell lines. In HCT116, the CD44v6 samples shared most similarity with the CD44s samples, while in SW480, the CD44v6 samples were most similar to the parental cell line. Thus, we observed both an isoform-independent effect, presumably as the result of the ectopic CD44 expression (and most dominantly visible in HCT116), and an isoform-dependent effect as depicted by the separation of CD44s and CD44v6 samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). As expected, differential expression analysis of the CD44s and v6 isoforms overexpressing samples compared with the parental cell lines revealed an overall upregulation of gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Next, in order to identify which genes are specifically upregulated by the different CD44 isoforms, we performed differential expression analysis between the CD44s samples and the CD44v6 samples. To this aim, we employed k-means clustering on the scaled expression values to separate genes specific for the CD44s isoform (e.g. <italic>SPARC, ZEB1, VIM</italic>), the CD44v6 isoform (e.g. <italic>IL32, TACSTD2, CSF2</italic>), and genes that were indiscriminative for the CD44v6 isoform or the parental cell lines (e.g. <italic>MAL2, ESRP1, CDH1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Finally, to identify the most distinct differences in signaling pathways and GO functional categories, we performed a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) by comparing the CD44s- with the CD44v6-OE samples in the individual cell lines. Among the significantly altered pathways (normalized enrichment score [NES] &gt;1, pval &lt;0.05), EMT was the only one upregulated in CD44s vs. CD44v6 in both cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–D</xref>). Additional pathways and GO categories activated by CD44s appeared to be cell line specific, for example, Wnt β-catenin signaling (HCT116) and oxidative phosphorylation (SW480). Of note, the detailed GSEA evidenced how several inflammatory (TNF/NFκB; IL6/JAK/STAT3; IFα/γ; ILK2/STAT5) and signaling (KRAS, MYC, E2F) pathways were common to both CD44s and v6, presumably as the result of the ectopic CD44 expression, regardless of the isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>RNAseq analysis of CD44s- and CD44v6-expressing colon cancer cells reveals a broad spectrum of downstream alternative splicing (AS) targets and biological functions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Principal component analysis (PCA) of RNAseq profiles from CD44s- and CD44v6-OE HCT116 and SW480 cell lines.

The CD44v6 isoform is required for c-MET activation by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF, or scatter factor) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Orian-Rousseau et al., 2002</xref>) and as such plays an essential role in triggering EMT at the invasive front where tumor cells are exposed to these TME-secreted factors. Our own immunoprecipitation studies confirmed that CD44v6 but not CD44s binds to cMET in response to HGF stimulation (<italic>data not shown</italic>). Therefore, HGF/SF stimulation of colon cancer cells along the invasive front will trigger the acquisition of quasi-mesenchymal characteristics and the AS-driven switch from CD44v6 to CD44s, the latter unable to bind HGF and as such controlling the extension of EMT activation. The reverse switch will take place upon the activation of the MET necessary for the colonization of the distal metastatic site. From this perspective, both CD44 isoforms are essential for the completion of the invasion-metastasis cascade.</p><p>The functional relevance of the CD44s isoforms has been highlighted in malignancies other than colon cancer, namely in prostate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lu et al., 2015</xref>) and breast cancer where it activates, among others, PDGFRβ/Stat3 and Akt signaling to promote EMT and CSC traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2019a</xref>). GO analysis of the RNAseq profiles from colon cancer cells ectopically expressing CD44s highlighted a broader spectrum of signaling pathways likely to underlie EMT. Accordingly, analysis of RNAseq data from primary colon cancers stratified for their CD44s expression revealed an equally broad spectrum of downstream EMT-related biological processes. Of note, among the DEGs identified upon CD44s ectopic expression which correlate with <italic>ZEB1</italic><sup>hi</sup>/<italic>ESRP1</italic><sup>lo</sup> (and CMS4) colon cancers, the <italic>SPARC</italic> gene, a pEMT marker in the EpCAM<sup>hi/lo</sup> state transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sacchetti et al., 2021</xref>), was found.</p><p>Expression of NUMB2/4 isoforms both in cells lines and in patient-derived colon tumors is associated with signaling pathways and GO categories largely overlapping with those linked to CD44s (and CD44v6 with NUMB1/3), possibly suggesting synergism between AS at these genes. Accordingly, NUMB is involved in a broad spectrum of cellular phenotypes in homeostasis and in cancer where it mainly function as a tumor suppressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pece et al., 2011</xref>). NUMB inhibits EMT by suppressing the Notch signaling pathway. As such, downregulation of NUMB can induce an EMT phenotype in isoform-specific fashion. Analysis of colon cancer cells individually overexpressing each of the four isoforms revealed an increased basal Notch signaling in NUMB2 and -4, as shown by the expression of the ‘universal’ targets <italic>HES1</italic> and <italic>HEY1</italic>. Instead, ectopic expression of NUMB1/3 resulted in increased transcriptional levels of the more atypical Notch signaling target <italic>ID2</italic>. Although the functional consequences of the NUMB2/4 (and 1/3) isoforms on Notch regulation of EMT are yet unclear, it seems plausible that the complex network of AS targets activated downstream of the RBP-coding DEGs, including CD44, NUMB, and many others as shown here, will eventually lead to the ‘just-right’ level of plasticity needed to allow both the ‘mesenchymalization’ during local invasion and systemic dissemination, and the reacquisition of epithelial features at the distant site of metastasis.</p><p>Overall, it appears that AS substantially contributes to the epigenetic mechanisms that underlie EMT/MET in cancer metastasis. From this perspective, several aspects of our study are novel: first, the identification of colon cancer-specific AS target genes paralleled by the corresponding RBPs which, when stratified according to the CMS classification of colon cancers, reveal notable differences and consequences on patients’ survival. Moreover, the results of the functional analysis of AS at the CD44 gene contrast what previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Todaro et al., 2014</xref>) and shed new light on the relevance of the standard and v6 isoforms in the migrating CSC model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brabletz et al., 2005</xref>). Comparison of the RBP/AS analysis among colon, cervical, and ovarian cancer highlights how, although the majority of AS targets are common to different types of malignancies in RBP-specific fashion, notable differences also exist possibly in reflection of the specific modalities of local dissemination and distal metastasis formation in different cancers. Also, the use of immortalized cell lines for the analysis of epithelial and quasi-mesenchymal tumor cell subpopulations represents an original approach yet based on an ‘old-fashioned’ laboratory reagent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sacchetti et al., 2021</xref>). Finally, the systematic elucidation of the RBPs and AS targets which underlie phenotypic plasticity in different types of cancer will provide novel tumor-specific targets for therapeutic intervention based on small molecule inhibitors and even RNA vaccination.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

Tumors were stratified on <italic>ZEB1</italic> expression levels using a log rank test top optimize overall survival differences (thresholds: 8.3, 8.6). Next, ESRP1 expression was used to purify the groups into ZEB1<sup>hi</sup>ESRP1<sup>lo</sup> and ZEB1<sup>lo</sup>ESRP1<sup>hi</sup> (thresholds: 11.6, 11.8). Survival analysis was done using the Kaplan-Meier method with the survival and survminer packages in R. Correlation analysis was done by computing the Pearson correlation between the isoforms and whole gene expression levels as processed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guinney et al., 2015</xref>. Likewise, association between isoform expression and pathway activity was evaluated by computing the Pearson correlation between the isoforms and the average scaled expression values of the pathways, as defined in the HallMark gene set from the molecular signature database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liberzon et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Resources, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Resources, Supervision, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All mice experiments were implemented according to the Code of Practice for Animal Experiment in Cancer Research from the Netherlands Inspectorate for Health Protections, Commodities and Veterinary Public Health.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Erica Golemis as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors must more clearly articulate how this paper will move the field on from what is already known from previous work in other cancers and/or to articulate how the work specifically advances our knowledge related to colon cancer.</p><p>2) Include Western analyses of the over-expressing and knockdown cells to see how much these interventions changed expression of ESRP1 and ZEB1, and the different splice isoforms relative to the endogenous protein expression.</p><p>3) The authors should strengthen the impact of the manuscript by emphasising better that by looking at splicing regulation in all these previously understudied cancers (in terms of EMT) with these very informative quasi-mesenchymal cell lines, their data suggest previously reported changes in splicing environments play a broad and general role on EMT across cancer types.</p><p>4) Please ensure that the figures are described sequentially</p><p>5) There are several discrepancies in the data. For example, in supplementary figure 1B, the FACS data clearly demonstrates that knockdown of ESRP1 affects CD44 expression, contradicting the statement written on page 11 line 15 that ESRP1 only marginally affects CD44 expression. This is very evident in the SW480 cell line data. Moreover, the two hairpins used to downregulate ESRP1 show variable results- ESRP1 KD-1 negatively affects CD44 whereas ESRP1 KD-2 positively affects CD44. Finally as per the western blot analysis of ESRP1 knockdown performed in SW480 cells (figure 3B), CD44 v6 expression is promoted and CD44s is suppressed and in figure 3C and figure 3D, ESRP1 overexpression is leading to upregulation of both NUMB 1/3 and 2/4 isoforms in HCT116 and SW480 cells as per the Western blot analysis. These discrepancies should be described and carefully addressed. It may be that this is due to differences between cell lines.

Hypothesis was not detected using a word search in the current manuscript.</p><p>The quality of the science seems high. While the results support the conclusions, it would have been useful to have Western analyses of the over-expressing and knockdown cells to see how much these interventions changed expression of ESRP1 and ZEB1, and the different splice isoforms relative to the endogenous protein expression.</p><p>The extensive list of metastasis related RBPs and splicing targets mentioned at the end of the introduction could be more clearly presented as supplementary tables.</p><p>While this study mainly tackles the very important topic of colon cancer, it failed to fully articulate how general their conclusions might be. I thought the impact of this report could be increased if the authors could from the start put their study in a broader context. While reading it I had a feeling that the authors were showing similar outcomes in colon cancer to those already in the literature for cancers like breast. However, the results were actually broader, and generalised to include colon cancer, ovarian cancer or cervical. I wondered whether the authors could strengthen the impact of the manuscript by emphasising better that by looking at splicing regulation in all these previously understudied cancers (in terms of EMT) with these very informative quasi-mesenchymal cell lines, their data suggest previously reported changes in splicing environments play a broad and general role on EMT across cancer types. They do mention this broader context, but the data for other cancers that would increase the scope of these observations was supplementary, and the title itself only mentioned colon cancer.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>After careful evaluation of the manuscript, the authors are urged to address the following questions.</p><p>C1: The figures are not cited sequentially in the text. Authors are requested to reorganize their figure panels (both main and supplementary) so that the related experiments are arranged under one common figure panel.</p><p>C2: In figure 1D and figure 1E, alterations in ESRP1 expression affects transcription of Zeb1. Similarly, in supplementary figure 4C, CD44s, NUMB2, NUMB4 and NUMB2/4 isoform overexpression is also shown to affect Zeb1. As ESRP1, CD44 and NUMB are downstream targets of Zeb1, why is Zeb1 expression is affected upon modulating the expression or alternative splicing of its effector molecules?</p><p>C3: In supplementary figure 1B, the FACS data clearly demonstrates that knockdown of ESRP1 affects CD44 expression, contradicting the statement written on page 11 line 15 that ESRP1 only marginally affects CD44 expression. This is very evident especially from the SW480 cell line data. Moreover, the two hairpins used to downregulate ESRP1 show variable results- ESRP1 KD-1 negatively affects CD44 whereas ESRP1 KD-2 positively affects CD44.</p><p>C4: Why only exon skipping type of alternatively spliced events were selected for investigation needs justification. Furthermore, in RT-qPCR analyses, GAPDH is used as control. For understanding the relative abundance of specific spliced isoforms of CD44 and NUMB, their expression should also be normalized with Ct value of the constitutive exons of respective genes.</p><p>C5: There is severe inconsistency in the mRNA and protein data in figure 3. As per the western blot analysis of ESRP1 knockdown performed in SW480 cells (figure 3B), CD44 v6 expression is promoted and CD44s is suppressed. Moreover, the knockdown efficiency should also be demonstrated by providing data of ESRP1 bands. In figure 3C and figure 3D, ESRP1 overexpression is leading to upregulation of both NUMB 1/3 and 2/4 isoforms in HCT116 and SW480 cells as per the western blot analysis.</p><p>C6: As the contributions of CD44v6 and CD44s in influencing EMT are vastly different, why HCT116 CD44v6 OE cells are more similar to HCT116 CD44s OE cells (than the parental cells which are naturally more epithelial in nature)?

Notwithstanding the latter, our contribution does represent a concrete advancement in our understanding of the relative role played by alternative splicing as one of the main mechanisms underlying EMT/MET in epithelial cancers in general and in colon cancer in particular. There are several reasons for this: first, our study is not limited to the identification of downstream AS target genes but it also extends to the upstream RNA-binding proteins (not only the well-studied ESRP1) which, when stratified according to the CMS classification of colon cancers, reveals notable differences and consequences on patients’ survival. And even when it comes to the individual AS targets chosen for validation and more in-depth functional analysis, our results sharply contrast with what previously reported in the literature on the role of the CD44 standard and v6 isoforms, and of the less characterized NUMB1/3 vs. 2/4 isoforms in EMT. Comparison with our own –admittedly limited- AS analysis of cervical and ovarian cancers, and with additional data from the public domain, highlights how, although the majority of AS targets are common to different types of malignancies in RBP-specific fashion, notable differences also exist possibly in reflection of the specific modalities of local dissemination and distal metastasis formation in different cancers. Last, the use of immortalized cell lines for the sorting of epithelial and quasi-mesenchymal tumor cell subpopulations represents an entirely novel approach yet based on an “old-fashioned” laboratory reagent.</p><p>In view of the above, it is not easy to concisely highlight how our manuscript will move the field on from what is already known in other cancers. Nonetheless, we have tried to clarify these issues in the Introduction and Discussion sections of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Include Western analyses of the over-expressing and knockdown cells to see how much these interventions changed expression of ESRP1 and ZEB1, and the different splice isoforms relative to the endogenous protein expression.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, western blots have been added next to the previously included RTqPCRs analyses, to show how <italic>ESRP1</italic> and <italic>ZEB1</italic> ablation and overexpression affect each other at the protein level.

In the revised manuscript the figures are now described sequentially.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) There are several discrepancies in the data. For example, in supplementary figure 1B, the FACS data clearly demonstrates that knockdown of ESRP1 affects CD44 expression, contradicting the statement written on page 11 line 15 that ESRP1 only marginally affects CD44 expression. This is very evident in the SW480 cell line data.

These discrepancies should be described and carefully addressed. It may be that this is due to differences between cell lines. Hence, additional models should be added to determine the extent of variability across cell types.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the reviewers for having spotted these discrepancies in the data which are exclusively the result of our own mistakes in the figures’ illustrations.</p><p>As for Figure 1F (<italic>ESRP1</italic> OE) compared with Figure 1—figure supplement 1B (<italic>ESRP1</italic> KD), it is evident that the former gives rise to much clearer results than the latter. This said, the statement according to which both OE and KD of <italic>ESRP1</italic> have limited quantitative effects on CD44 expression levels (the height of the cloud of cells along the y-axis remains approx. the same between parental and OE/KD samples) is correct. This is in contrast with EpCAM (the x-axis) where the increase in expression levels is evident in the OE clones. The opposite effect is not as evident in the KD clones where, as also pointed out by the reviewers, variable results are observed between individual clones (see KD1 vs KD2 in SW480). FACS analysis of a large number of individual clones (not shown), does confirm that the KD reagents are not very efficient especially in the SW480 cell line (see Figure 1E). In the revised manuscript, we have now added the FACS analysis of the pooled KD1 and KD2 transfections which do not suffer from the intra clones variability and accordingly depicts a more coherent behavior in both cell lines (i.e. significant EpCAM downregulation; see Figure 1—figure supplement 1B). If preferred, we can also add a supplementary figure showing tens of clones to highlight the variability of the results at the individual clone level. Apart from the variable efficacy of the shRNA reagents in the two cell lines, these data are interpreted as the result of the interference of RBPs other than ESRP1 in the regulation of EMT/MET in the cell lines. Overexpression of ESRP1 instead, has dominant effects and results in more clear differences (mainly in EpCAM) with the parental lines.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, the sentence on page 11 of the revised manuscript now reads: “Of note, ESRP1-overexpression in the HCT116 and SW480 cell lines resulted in the dramatic reduction of their EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> subpopulations and the expansion of the epithelial bulk (EpCAM<sup>hi</sup>), as shown by FACS analysis (Figure 1F, Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). However, ESRP1 knockdown (KD) gave rise to less clear and extremely variable results among the individual clones analyzed by FACS, in particular in the SW480 cell line. More coherent and representative result were obtained with the pools of the KD transfections (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B). These results suggest that RNA binding proteins other than ESRP1 are likely to be involved in the alternative splicing regulation of the EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> colon cancer subpopulation.”</p><p>As for the western analysis of the <italic>ESRP1</italic> KD in SW480 cells, we again apologize for our own mistake while preparing Figure 3B: in the last panel (far right) the plus and minus signs relative to the Dox-driven induction have been inverted thus leading to the apparently opposite effects than expected. This has now been corrected in the revised manuscript. We also added bar plot graphs to Figure 3A-D and Figure 3—figure supplement 1H showing the ratio between NUMB1/3 and NUMB2/4, as analyzed by ImageJ on the western blot bands.</p><p>We truly apologize for the confusion we generated and are grateful to the reviewers and editors for having pointed out to us these discrepancies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Please justify normalize specific spliced isoforms of CD44 and NUMB to their constitutive exons of respective genes.</p></disp-quote><p>The normalization of the specific isoforms with GAPDH is justified by our previous analysis of its constant expression levels throughout the samples. However, to satisfy the reviewer’s request, we have now modified the manuscript so that all normalizations of the expression values of the various CD44 and NUMB isoforms have been calculated based on their constitutive exons (see Figure 2, Figure 3, and Figure 3—figure supplement 1).

Thus, CD44v6-OE shows more similarity to the parental line. In HCT116, however, this picture is different. The overexpression of both isoforms leads to a considerable transcriptome differences (visible in the first principal component). Nonetheless, pathway analysis still reveals changes in EMT across the isoform groups. Thus, it appears that the isoform-independent effect of CD44 is bigger in HCT116 compared to SW480. In SW480, the effect of EMT is in agreement with the first principal component. In HCT116, this is association is less clear, indicating that additional pathways impact the overexpression of CD44 independent of the particular isoform.</p></body></sub-article></article>
