(VL)<italic>,</italic> a brain structure mediating the acquisition of long-term memory in this behaviorally advanced mollusk. Serial section electron microscopy revealed new types of interneurons, cellular components of extensive modulatory systems, and multiple synaptic motifs. The sensory input to the VL is conveyed via~1.8 × 10<sup>6</sup> axons that sparsely innervate two parallel and interconnected feedforward networks formed by the two types of amacrine interneurons (AM), simple AMs (SAMs) and complex AMs (CAMs). SAMs make up 89.3% of the~25 × 10<sup>6</sup>VL cells, each receiving a synaptic input from only a single input neuron on its non-bifurcating primary neurite, suggesting that each input neuron is represented in only~12 ± 3.4SAMs. This synaptic site is likely a ‘memory site’ as it is endowed with LTP. The CAMs, a newly described AM type, comprise 1.6% of the VL cells. Their bifurcating neurites integrate multiple inputs from the input axons and SAMs. While the SAM network appears to feedforward sparse ‘memorizable’ sensory representations to the VL output layer, the CAMs appear to monitor global activity and feedforward a balancing inhibition for ‘sharpening’ the stimulus-specific VL output. While sharing morphological and wiring features with circuits supporting associative learning in other animals, the VL has evolved a unique circuit that enables associative learning based on feedforward information flow.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>caphalopods</kwd><kwd>learning</kwd><kwd>memory</kwd><kwd>connectome</kwd><kwd>invertebrate</kwd><kwd>octopus</kwd><kwd>feedforward</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGP0042/2019-102</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hochner</surname><given-names>Binyamin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1928/15</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hochner</surname><given-names>Binyamin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5U24 NS109102</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lichtman</surname><given-names>Jeff William</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01 NS108637</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lichtman</surname><given-names>Jeff William</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Aharon and Ephraim Katzir Study Grants</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bidel</surname><given-names>Flavie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Connectomics of the octopus 'fan-out fan-in’ learning network reveals that the intermediate layer uses approximately 22×10<sup>6</sup> excitatory interneurons, each can store a single sensory input, while approximately 400×10<sup>3</sup> integrating inhibitory interneurons adjust the network output level.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The advanced learning capabilities of cephalopod mollusks like <italic>Octopus vulgaris</italic> are comparable to those of some vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sanders, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mather, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Zarrella et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Schnell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hanlon and Messenger, 2018</xref>).

The VL, the highest structure in the hierarchy of the octopus' central nervous system, is regarded as a high-order integrative center involved in visually evoked associative learning and memory acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boycott and Young, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sanders, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Young, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fiorito and Chichery, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hochner, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hochner, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hochner, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Shomrat et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Shigeno et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Turchetti-Maia et al., 2017</xref>). It contains 25 × 10<sup>6</sup> neurons, about half the neurons in the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Young, 1963</xref>). This number is not much smaller than the number of neurons in the human hippocampus (~40 × 10<sup>6</sup>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">West and Gundersen, 1990</xref>) and about four orders of magnitude greater than the number of neurons in the mushroom body of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aso et al., 2014</xref>) and three orders of magnitude greater than that in the locust mushroom body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jortner et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Extensive neuroanatomical data on the VL were provided by the work of J. Z. Young and E. G. Gray in the 1960–70’s using light and electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gray and Young, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gray, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Young, 1971</xref>). Based on estimated neuron numbers, they proposed that the VL network is extremely simple, composed of only two types of morphologically distinguishable neurons: 25 × 10<sup>6</sup> small AM and 65 × 10<sup>3</sup> large efferent neurons (LN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Young, 1963</xref>). The main sensory input to the VL is conveyed via 1.8 × 10<sup>6</sup> axons projecting from the median superior frontal lobe (SFL). These axons compose the SFL-VL tract that runs in the outer neuropil of the five VL lobuli. Each of these axons makes <italic>en passant</italic> synapses with a then unknown number of the AMs. These 25 × 10<sup>6</sup> AMs converge sharply at a ratio of about 400:1 to innervate the LNs, whose axons were assumed to be the only output of the VL. Young pointed out that the pattern of SFL innervation of the AMs resembles the connectivity matrix in other learning and memory networks like the insect mushroom body and the mammalian hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Young, 1995</xref>).</p><p>This gross connectivity scheme provided insights that guided more recent physiological studies on the VL. Physiological experiments in the brain-slice preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hochner et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hochner et al., 2006</xref>) revealed that the <italic>en passant</italic> SFL-to-AM innervation is glutamatergic. It shows a robust activity-dependent NMDA-independent long-term potentiation (LTP) of glutamate release from the SFL presynaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hochner et al., 2003</xref>). The AM-to-LN connections are excitatory cholinergic synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Shomrat et al., 2011</xref>). Recently it was discovered that LTP at the SFL-to-AM synapse is maintained by a novel nitric oxide (NO)-dependent ‘molecular switch’ mechanism in which NO itself reactivates the enzyme producing NO, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Turchetti-Maia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Turchetti-Maia et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Although Gray and Young provided a detailed description of the main neuronal elements constituting the VL network, the inability to reconstruct individual neurites limited the possibility of providing a comprehensive circuit connectivity. Indeed, their observations reported unclassified cell types, thus suggesting that the VL network is composed of more than the three neuronal elements (SFL, AM, and LN). Previous findings from our group also hinted that the VL is more complex. First, intracellular recording from LNs revealed that some receive inhibitory inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Shomrat et al., 2011</xref>). Second, a recent wide-ranging histolabeling study suggested that the AMs may be divided into at least two groups, one cholinergic and the other GABAergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Stern‐Mentch et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>To understand the octopus VL circuitry at a higher resolution, our current study utilized recent advances in the ability to elucidate synaptic wiring diagrams at the nanoscale level using electron microscopy (EM). Widely applied to various species and tissues this methodology has contributed much to understanding the organization of neural networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kasthuri et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Morgan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Ryan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Motta et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Macrina et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Meirovitch et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bae et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Verasztó et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Witvliet et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Shapson-Coe et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Winding et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Loomba et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Karlupia et al., 2023</xref>). Here, we sought to produce a synapse-level wiring diagram of a small volume (260 × 390 × 27 µm) of one lateral lobule of the <italic>Octopus vulgaris</italic> VL from serial EM by tracing out all pre- and postsynaptic partners of dozens of main afferents of the VL (SFL projecting axons) and AMs. Indeed, although we found that the gross anatomical organization of octopus VL fits the previous anatomical and physiological model described above, the nanoscale analysis revealed new types of neurons and connections that profoundly deepen our understanding of the functional organization of the octopus VL and how it implements associative learning and memory.</p><p>First, our data show that the AM interneurons are divided into two distinct groups, in contrast to previously thought. The majority (~89.3%) of the VL cell bodies are SAMs that send a single non-bifurcating neurite into the neuropil. A small fraction (~1.6%) forms a group of newly discovered CAM with a branching dendritic tree. Second, we found that each SAM receives only one synaptic input from a single SFL axon. We propose that this synaptic connection may serve as a ‘memory site,’ as it shows a robust activity-dependent LTP following tetanization of the SFL axonal tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Shomrat et al., 2011</xref>). Third, the SFL-to-SAM expansion format suggests that each of the 1.8 × 10<sup>6</sup> SFL neurons is represented extremely sparsely in only around 12 of the 22.3 × 10<sup>6</sup> SAMs. Fourth, in sharp contrast to the SAMs, the CAMs integrate dozens to hundreds of inputs, suggesting that these interneurons integrate broader incoming SFL activity. As the SAMs and CAMs converge onto the same output layer of LN processes, our findings suggest the VL is comprised of two interconnected feedforward networks - one excitatory, originating from the SAMs (each representing one SFL) and a second, likely inhibitory parallel feedforward network, originating from the CAMs (each representing several SFL axons). We demonstrate that distinct groups of SAMs and CAMs neurites fasciculate together to form a columnar organization in which each column constitutes a canonical microcircuit that may function as an ‘association module,’ associating sensory features transmitted by the SFL. Lastly, we describe an additional afferent to the VL and two extrinsic putative neuromodulation systems. These interact with the feedforward networks and thus are likely involved in regulating the activity state of the network and in conveying reward and punishment signals.</p><p>Although our volume comprises only a small part of the lateral lobule, the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gray and Young, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gray, 1970</xref>), and our exploration of a small volume of a VL median lobule suggest that the synaptic motifs involved in the fast transmission network are reiterated across the entire VL. This putative consistency is aligned with physiological studies that suggest the principal synaptic connectivity properties are independent of the location in the VL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hochner et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Shomrat et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesize that the general network organization is conserved across the entire VL, while neuromodulatory systems and anatomical compartmentalization may provide different functional roles for different VL areas or lobuli.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The VL dataset and analysis</title><p>The region of interest (ROI) lay in the lateral lobule of the VL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

For the characterization of the seven cell types, we reconstructed at least 30 processes per cell type throughout the volume and annotated all their pre- and postsynaptic sites. Additionally, a subset of cellular compartments and organelles (i.e. cell bodies, nuclei, and presynaptic varicosities) were separately segmented to allow morphological quantification. The core of our connectivity reconstruction included annotation and neurite reconstructions of all the synaptic partners of a subset of randomly selected ‘seed’ cells (similar to the approach taken by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Morgan et al., 2016</xref>): SFL axons (35 of the 84 reconstructed SFL axons) and SAM cells (28 of the 108 reconstructed SAMs).</p><p>We divided the analysis according to the three VL regions: (1) the outer cell body cortex; (2) the central neuropil, and (3) the SFL tract, or outer neuropil, where axons projecting from the SFL are arranged in a tract forming a ring around the outer zone of neuropil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gray and Young, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Young, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Stern‐Mentch et al., 2022</xref>).

The VL wiring diagram is characterized by two parallel and interconnected feedforward networks in which two afferents, the parallel SFL axons (green) that convey secondary visual features and a fiber that Gray speculated is associated with ‘pain’ (CIN-dark pink) innervate two distinct populations of amacrine interneurons, the simple amacrines (SAMs - yellow) and the newly discovered complex amacrines (CAMs - cyan). The large neuron processes (LN-magenta) provide the convergence element of the VL fan-in connectivity architecture and are the only VL output. Additionally, the circuit is supplied by a large network of likely modulatory processes: the ‘ascending fibers’ (AF-orange) and the neuromodulatory fibers (NM-brown). The connectivity among neurons in the VL is feedforward; neural activity is transmitted in one direction between populations of neurons without any feedback sub-circuitry among neurites (p&lt;0.05 – see Methods, Analysis of feed-forwardness), except for a few bidirectional (reciprocal) synapses between AFs (modulatory).

These bundles form a <italic>quasi-</italic>columnar organization toward the neuropil (Figure 6A and B and Figure 7A). The SAMs and CAMs differ in connectivity, morphology, and ultrastructure (Figure 6A and B). The SAMs are monopolar interneurons with a single non-bifurcating neurite. Their cell bodies are small (mean ± SD; 207.7 ± 26.1 μm<sup>3</sup>; n=69) and contain almost no cytoplasm. In contrast, the CAMs have a complex bifurcating dendritic tree, a larger cell body (mean ± SD; 337.2 ± 41.6 μm<sup>3</sup>; n=16), and cytoplasmic volume (Figure 4). Unexpectedly, we found that each SAM receives input from only one SFL axon (see below). In contrast, each CAM integrates synaptic inputs from a dozen to hundreds of SFL axons and SAMs (Figure 6B). Both the CAMs and SAMs consistently converged onto the LN processes (Figure 7). Overall, the transmission from the main afferents (SFL axons) is entirely mediated via the SAMs and CAMs to their shared target neurons - the dendritic processes of the LNs.</p><p>A second group of afferent axons innervated exclusively the CAMs. We termed these ‘CAM-input-neurons’ (CIN; Figure 8). Even though CIN function has yet to be established, their ultrastructure is reminiscent of the nerve endings which Gray and Young speculated may carry ‘pain’ signals to the VL. They described them as having neurofilaments ending shortly before the synaptic boutons, which were filled with small vesicles - a structure we also identified here. We also identified that the putative fast transmission circuit (panels framed with a solid line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) is embedded in an intricate mesh of processes consisting of two types of putative neuromodulatory elements (NM and AF, panels framed with a dashed line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), each with distinct morphology, ultrastructure, and cell-specific connections.</p><p>First, the ‘neuromodulatory fibers’ (NMs) manifest a large variety of processes with large varicosities filled with large vesicles (60–200 nm) that often do not show the typical structure of a synaptic connection (detailed below). Second, the ‘ascending fibers’ (AFs) climb from the neuropil up to the cortex through the AM tracts joining the dense bundle of primarily SAM and CAM neurites (Figure 9). A stereotyped feature of all AFs was their ‘menorah’-shaped bifurcating pattern and their intense innervation by the SAMs. The ultrastructure and connectivity of these neurons revealed two distinct subcategories, one likely neuromodulatory (AF-Nm, Figure 9C) and the other as yet undefined (AF-Mix, Figure 9D). Both the AF-Nm boutons and the NM boutons were filled with large vesicles and usually lacked synaptic outputs, suggesting that these are release sites of neuromodulators or neuropeptides involved in extrasynaptic volume transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bentley et al., 2016</xref>). Since none of the AF and NM neurites were associated with a reconstructed cell body, we hypothesize that AFs and NMs are external to the VL and may belong to the widespread ascending fibers entering the VL from below that have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Young, 1971</xref>).</p><p>Overall, the seven cell types form a feedforward neural network in the VL with fast synaptic transmission from one cell type to another, based on synaptic direction. The lack of connectivity ‘loops’ indicates forward transmission in the VL without feedback. The only possible exception was the AFs, which displayed several synaptic contacts (&gt;10) with other AFs (AF-to-AF, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Analysis at the single neurite level, including the entire wiring diagram, showed that the number of synapses involved in feedback circuitry in the ROI (i.e. cycles of information flow based on synaptic direction) was significantly smaller than chance (p&lt;0.05). This was assessed from random wiring diagrams built from the same set of neurites and synapses as in our ROI but randomizing the directionality of the pre- and postsynaptic neurons for each pair of connected neurons (see Methods). The few feedback circuitry cycles found in the ROI were all associated with bidirectional (reciprocal) synapses between pairs of AFs, which themselves were rare (n=4). Note that extrasynaptic neuromodulatory transmission in the VL, which is not included in the connectivity analysis, could form feedback information flow orchestrated with the directional fast transmission network (see Discussion).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Each SFL axon innervates the SAMs and CAMs via specialized bouton types</title><p>A set of 35 seed SFLs (afferents) was used for a detailed description of the connectivity pattern of the SFLs and their postsynaptic targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Second, an average of 66 ± 11% of the synapses (109/161 synapses; N=35 SFL) of each SFL axon were made on CAM dendritic endings. These CAM endings were a variety of twig-like structures formed by variably long (approximately 1–30 µm) thin protrusions emerging from thicker CAM dendritic branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Assuming that the VL is roughly composed of 25 × 10<sup>6</sup> cell bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Young, 1963</xref>), the above proportions extrapolated over the VL give an estimate of ~22.3 ± 1.2 × 10<sup>6</sup> SAMs and an estimate that the cortex contains far fewer than 1.4 × 10<sup>6</sup> CAMs. As we did not observe any false negatives or false positives associated with CAMs, the total number is likely close to the classifier’s best estimate of 400 × 10<sup>3</sup> CAMs, which can be further analyzed once this sparse set of cells is sampled in larger EM volumes. Assuming the SFL axons do not bifurcate in the SFL tract, then due to the one-to-one SFL-to-SAM innervation pattern, the 1.8 × 10<sup>6</sup> SFL axons fan-out onto the SAMs at an expansion ratio of about 1-to-12.

Among these arrangements, the SAM palm, packed with vesicles, appears to be a unique bifunctional pre- and postsynaptic compartment, as most of the SAM palms formed serial synaptic connections (82%), receiving a synapse from a single SFL bouton and providing a synapse to 1–3 postsynaptic compartments, often twig endings of distinct CAMs. Analyzing a large population of ‘long’ SAM neurites (SAMs whose primary neurite was fully contained in the SFL tract; N=56) revealed that each SAM exhibited only a single palm along its inwardly directed primary neurite (N=46/56), rarely two palms (N=2/56) (Figure 6C) and each palm received input from only one SFL large presynaptic bouton (50/50 palms received a single SFL input).</p><p>To better understand the structural properties of this unique palm structure, we prepared a smaller dataset of 16 × 16 × 3.5 µm from a median lobule and imaged it at 1 nm/pixel (high magnification dataset; see Methods).

This compartment included numerous elongated mitochondria and a large network of electron-lucent tubular organelles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These organelles were at times small, disconnected units (cisternae, Cis) or large and continuous, likely part of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).

We also occasionally observed what appeared to be exocytosis at the ER membrane, suggesting the possibility of a Golgi-like extended role in the synaptic vesicle machinery. It is still not clear whether the Cis (up to 15 observed in one palm) were part of the larger ER network or were isolated entities that could, for instance, play a role in keeping vesicles close to the active zone, like synaptic ribbons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dowling et al., 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Parsons and Sterling, 2003</xref>) or the T-bar in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>The SAMs distribute their single SFL input onto the LNs, CAMs, and AF</title><p>We next focused on a detailed reconstruction and proofreading of 28 SAM seed cells (see one SAM segmented in <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video1">Figure 6—video 1</xref>).

In the neuropil and the SFL tract, these synapses were arranged in a rosette-like structure in which 2–5 adjacent SAMs synapsed locally onto the same AF bouton (Figure 9).

We termed one class ‘AF-neuromodulatory’ (AF-Nm; n=14). In this class, on the 468 boutons reconstructed, we annotated 1460 postsynaptic sites and only three presynaptic sites, with a median of 3.2 postsynaptic sites per bouton. Each bouton formed a rosette structure of axo-axonal synapses where several SAMs made adjacent synapses onto one AF bouton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). The postsynaptic sites were filled mostly with large dense core vesicles (60–80 nm), suggesting a neuromodulatory nature. The synaptic inputs of the SAMs to the AF-Nm boutons suggest SAMs-induced local extrasynaptic release of neuromodulator (see Discussion). The AFs seemed morphologically equivalent to the serotonergic processes ascending into the cell cortex found in immunohistological studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Shomrat et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Shigeno and Ragsdale, 2015</xref>) and also to tyrosine hydroxylase (catecholaminergic) labeled processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Stern‐Mentch et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, the second class of AF, the AF-mix (N=18), was more diverse with boutons filled with vesicles of varying shape and size (30–90 nm; N=519), including small dark core vesicles, flat clear core vesicles, and larger vesicles.

The diverse nature of the synaptic vesicles in the two subtypes suggests that they convey different neuromodulatory signals, and the reciprocal connection with the SAMs hints at their involvement in the SAM-induced local release of neuromodulators (see Discussion).</p></sec><sec id="s2-11"><title>The ubiquitous NM appear to be involved in global neuromodulatory signaling via extrasynaptic transmission</title><p>A large variety of processes displayed the largest dense vesicles (60–200 nm) in our dataset, similar to neuromodulatory vesicles in other invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Messenger, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Witvliet et al., 2021</xref>).

At least three distinct profiles were clearly distinguishable by vesicle size and appearance, showing either a low density of clear core vesicles, a high density of clear core vesicles, or very large dense core vesicles. The boutons of each process contained mainly one type of vesicle, which were also present at a much lower density within the fiber. Reconstructions of NM processes (N=88) showed that most of the boutons had neither inputs nor outputs (464/632), suggesting that they were neuromodulatory afferents that exert their effects through extrasynaptic volume transmission. Yet, these cells occasionally synapsed with a variety of postsynaptic partners, including CAMs, SAMs AFs, NMs themselves, and LNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Multisynaptic contacts were occasionally observed, for instance, with CAMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>), but the density of synaptic sites per bouton was rather low; 52 presynaptic sites and 250 postsynaptic sites on 632 boutons. Accordingly, we hypothesize that the NM processes are primarily involved in extrasynaptic transmission and thus may convey a global modulatory signal.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The novel connectivity and anatomical features discovered here profoundly advance our understanding of the functional organization of the learning and memory circuits in the VL of <italic>Octopus vulgaris</italic>.

The SAMs are highly input specific as each received <italic>en passant</italic> input from only a single SFL axon via large presynaptic boutons (LB) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A1</xref>). If the pattern of one-to-one innervation is maintained throughout the whole SFL tract and if, as generally believed and as found here, the SFL axons bifurcate very rarely, then every SFL neuron is represented by only around 12 ± 3.46 SAMs (22 × 10<sup>6</sup> SAMs/1.8 × 10<sup>6</sup> SFL axons). Moreover, the LBs seem to be sparsely distributed along the SFL axon (1.03 ± 0.73 LBs per 100 µm; see Results), suggesting that each SFL neuron is represented in the SAMs in a highly sparse and non-overlapping fashion, as suggested for the spacing of axonal varicosities in mammal’s hippocampus and cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Shepherd et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lanore et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The finding that a single SFL input innervates each SAM is unprecedented for memory acquisition circuits like the cerebellum and the mushroom body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Laurent, 2002</xref>). These networks are organized in a fan-out (i.e. expansive) architecture in which low-dimensional sensory information is represented in a relatively small number of neurons in an input layer (e.g. different odors are represented in the ~50 glomeruli of the fly antennal lobe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Keene and Waddell, 2007</xref>). To further process the sensory information, the neurons of the input layer project into a much larger number of interneurons in an intermediate or mixing layer (e.g. the 2000 Kenyon cells in the fly mushroom body), where the dense low-dimensional representation at the input layer is transformed into a high-dimensional and sparse representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Babadi and Sompolinsky, 2014</xref>). The connectivity scheme that theoretically determines the optimal level of increase of dimension takes into account the number of neurons in the input layer relative to those in the intermediate layer (i.e. expansion ratio) and two quantitative interconnection parameters: (1) how many input neurons converge onto each neuron in the intermediate layer; and (2) how many neurons in the intermediate layer are innervated by a single neuron in the input layer (i.e. divergence) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Litwin-Kumar et al., 2017</xref>). As each neuron in the intermediate layer responds to a (possibly random) combination of several inputs (e.g. Kenyon cells represent a combination of several (~6) odors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Li et al., 2020</xref>), each neuron in the intermediate layer now represents a distinct multidimensional combination of several sensory features (e.g. a dimension that classifies a multi-odors object like a distinct food source). As the SAMs receive only one input, a priori<italic>,</italic> they cannot participate in such higher-order representation of the SFL input but merely expand it 12 times in the SAMs layer.</p><p>We, therefore, suggest that as each SAM represents just a single SFL axon, the SAMs may be viewed as relaying their SFL inputs directly into the LN and CAM dendritic processes. This suggests, a priori, that the SAMs, especially with their linear input/output relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Shomrat et al., 2011</xref>), are computationally redundant. However, the SFL LB-to-SAM synapse is also the site of short- and long-term synaptic plasticity. Thus, we propose that, while the SAMs appear architecturally redundant, they still may provide a dedicated synaptic site for scaling specific sensory input at the connection between the presynaptic large bouton of the SFL axon and the postsynaptic palm of the SAM neurite. Indeed, as we discuss below, our findings raise the possibility that ensembles of SAMs are organized in ‘association modules’ that enable them to participate both in processing sensory information and in forming combinatorial associations during learning.</p><p>Our second novel discovery is that the AMs included a small group of a new class of AM neurons, only 1.6% of the AMs in the VL cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These neurons showed a bifurcating dendritic structure and were, therefore, termed complex AMs (CAMs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The primary neurite segments of the SAMs and CAMs travel together in the AM bundles within the VL cortex, but the non-bifurcating SAM neuritic trunks cross the SFL tract to pass into the inner neuropil, while the CAM neurites bifurcate substantially within the SFL tract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The CAMs receive inputs <italic>en passant</italic> from multiple SFL axons either directly or indirectly via a serial connection from the SAMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Thus, while each SAM represents a single SFL neuron, the CAMs integrate information from dozens to hundreds of SFL neurons together with multiple inputs from nearby SAMs. In addition, as discussed below, the CAMs receive inputs from afferents from a yet unidentified origin, which exclusively innervate CAMs (CIN, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The SFL axons innervate the SAMs and CAMs via different classes of presynaptic boutons</title><p>SAMs and CAMs are innervated by SFL axons via small (SFL SB) or extremely large boutons (SFL LB – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The LBs are always associated with at least one SAM palm and more commonly innervate a CAM twig within a dyadic or triadic arrangement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). By contrast, SBs are always associated with a single postsynaptic CAM compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This suggests that the two different types of SFL axon terminals are functionally specialized. Such functional segregation is also seen in the hippocampal mossy fiber connections where small boutons target GABAergic interneurons, whereas large boutons contact CA3 pyramidal cells and hilar mossy cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acsády et al., 1998</xref>). The latter large synapse shares several synaptic features with the octopus VL synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hochner et al., 2003</xref>) – NMDA-independent, presynaptically expressed LTP and an extremely large range of presynaptic short-and long-term synaptic gain modulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Nicoll and Schmitz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Henze et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hainmueller and Bartos, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Restivo et al., 2015</xref>).

This raises the question of the role of such apparently non-integrating interneurons. Physiological results indicate that the glutamatergic SFL-AM synapse is the site of activity-dependent LTP in the VL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hochner et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Shomrat et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Turchetti-Maia et al., 2018</xref>). The large volume of the SFL-LB relative to that of the SFL-SB found here (on average sixfold larger) suggests that the recorded synaptic field potential (fPSP) mainly reflects the synaptic input from the SFL LB to the SAMs. The morphological dimensions of the SAMs revealed here (e.g. a 166 µm long 0.5 µm diameter neuritic trunk emerging from a 7 µm diameter cell body) together with previous electrophysiological measurements (&gt;1 GΩ input resistance measured at the cell body), suggest that the inexcitable SAMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hochner et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hochner et al., 2006</xref>) are electrotonically compact (estimated length constant λ&gt;147 µm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hochner and Spira, 1987</xref>), so that the glutaminergic excitatory postsynaptic potential from the SFL LB input site is likely sufficient to activate voltage-dependent transmitter release down the SAM neurite without needing a propagating action potential. These inexcitable properties, which differ drastically from the excitable properties of the insect Kenyon cells (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Demmer and Kloppenburg, 2009</xref>), nicely explain the linear input/output relationship of the SAMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Shomrat et al., 2011</xref>). Since the activity-dependent changes at the SFL-SAM synapse involve pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms (see below), we suggest that, rather than being simple relay interneurons, the SAMs provide a synaptic ‘gain-control relay’ of the SFL-LB input into the CAMs and LNs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>The CAMs as a putative feedforward inhibitory neural network balancing the parallel SAM feedforward excitatory neural network</title><p>The newly discovered CAMs comprise only 1.6% of the VL cortex.

Also, inhibitory CAMs would explain the IPSPs or EPSP followed with a short delay by an IPSP recorded in some of the LNs in response to SFL tract stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Although the CAMs show morphological diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">3</xref>), they share similar connectivity, integrating multiple inputs from the SFL axons, SAMs, and CAM-specific inputs (CIN) in their bifurcating dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The CAMs innervate the LN dendritic processes only sparsely, unlike the dense LN innervation by the SAMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and D</xref>). This innervation pattern suggests that the LNs integrate stimulus-specific excitatory inputs from many SAMs, while the CAMs, which integrate ubiquitous and nonselective inputs, are optimally located for inhibitory balancing the overall SAMs excitatory inputs.</p><p>If the CAMs are indeed inhibitory interneurons, then our results strongly suggest the VL network is organized into two interconnected parallel feedforward networks, in which the SFL axons convey sensory inputs that ‘fans-out’ onto SAMs (in ~1/12 ratio) and ‘fan-in’ (~4/1) onto the CAMs. Both the SAMs and CAMs feedforward onto the LNs in the VL readout layer (schematically shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). This type of organization may sharpen the stimulus-specific SAM inputs to the LNs by subtracting the global or background activity monitored by the inhibitory CAMs. This type of organization may highlight a universal inhibitory balancing organization in networks with different functions. A similar organization is found in cortical circuits representing sparse, odor-specific, activity where the sparse activity is generated through summing unbalanced widespread and broadly tuned inhibition with odor-specific excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Poo and Isaacson, 2009</xref>). In the octopus VL, such a sharpening mechanism may ensure recognition of learned visual scenarios even under variable light intensities. Theoretical studies have demonstrated the importance of implementing feedforward inhibition parallel to the feedforward excitation to balance the stable propagation of an activity wave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Litvak et al., 2003</xref>). Feedforward inhibition also appears important for balancing networks’ input/output relationships to avoid attraction of network activity into either up or down states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferrante et al., 2009</xref>). Finally, long-term balancing inhibition is believed to be important in ensuring network homeostasis, especially in networks involved in learning and memory, like the hippocampus, where activity balances may be perturbated by long-term activity-dependent plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Turrigiano and Nelson, 2004</xref>).</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of the currently known circuit architecture of the vertical lobe (VL).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fast transmitter connectivity.

This circuit motif, schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref> <italic>inset</italic>, suggests a mechanism for mediation of activity-dependent local release neuromodulation, which in turn heterosynaptically mediates synaptic plasticity of the adjacent neuronal elements.</p><p>This hypothesis seems particularly relevant for the interaction of the SAMs with the AF-Nm system, especially if our identification of the AF-Nm as serotonergic is correct.

This arrangement raises the intriguing possibility that during LTP induction the strongly activated SAMs evoke the local release of 5-HT from the AF-Nm bouton, which, in turn, through extrasynaptic transmission, activates metabotropic 5-HT receptors in the SAM. The coincidence of 5-HT with the activity-dependent mechanism in the SAM, could trigger a biochemical cascade that activates NOS only in the SAMs strongly activated by their SFL inputs. The finding that 5-HT induces short-term synaptic facilitation and reinforces the activity-dependent LTP induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Shomrat et al., 2010</xref>), supports the feasibility of a 5-HT-mediated ‘self-LTP’ induction mechanism.</p><p>The suggested 5-HT involvement in the modulation of transmitter release in the VL resembles the heterosynaptic 5-HT-induced facilitation of transmitter release in the defensive reflex of the gastropods mollusk <italic>Aplysia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hochner et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ghirardi et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bailey et al., 2000</xref>) and points to an evolutionary conservation of molluscan serotonergic neuromodulation mechanisms.

Training on these discriminative tasks involves the activation of a supervising ‘teaching’ signal in the form of a reward (such as food) for a correct choice or a punishment (such as an electric shock) for an incorrect choice. These teaching signals are likely transmitted into the VL neuropil via action potentials propagating along the neuromodulatory processes.

The AF-Nm processes, which interact more intensely with SAMs than the AF-mix, maybe mostly involved in mediating the intrinsic SAMs-induced local extrasynaptic release of the AF-Nm neuromodulator (most likely 5-HT). The AF-Mix, on the other hand, with its occasional synaptic outputs to the SAMs and boutons filled with a mix of smaller vesicles, may better fit the role of transmitting a global supervision signal that comes from outside the VL, where propagating action potentials evoke global neuromodulators release.</p><p>The idea that the AF fibers transmit a global serotonergic teaching signal fits well with the context-dependent flexibility of octopus attack behavior. We propose that during training on an avoidance task, the AF systems transmit a serotonergic ‘punishment’ signal into the VL. This 5-HT signal, evoked by a noxious stimulus to the arms, facilitates the induction of a long-term association between the visual features that characterize the target which was negatively rewarded (e.g. brightness and shape) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Shomrat et al., 2010</xref>). As a result, after training (which in <italic>Octopus vulgaris</italic> will take about ten trials; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Shomrat et al., 2008</xref>) the ‘trained’ group of SAMs will ‘remember’ to respond strongly to the ‘memorized’ features, resulting in a stronger activation of LNs in the VL output layer. As the LNs are GABAergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Stern‐Mentch et al., 2022</xref>) the memorized association will produce a sufficiently strong VL inhibitory output to override the reflexive tendency of the octopus to initiate its stereotypic attack behavior (see details <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Shomrat et al., 2008</xref> tentative octopus L&amp;M model in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Turchetti-Maia et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The rich and widely distributed neuromodulatory processes (NMs) intermingle with the fast transmitter feedforward network (schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>).

Their exceptionally large boutons, frequently lacking typical release sites, are filled with a variety of large dense-core vesicles of the type usually storing and releasing neuropeptides and non-classical neurotransmitters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Zhu et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Leng and Ludwig, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">van den Pol, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Witvliet et al., 2021</xref>).

Especially interesting is that tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) - labeled processes show a wide distribution in the VL neuropil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Stern‐Mentch et al., 2022</xref>), similar to that of the NM processes (schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>), suggestive of a catecholaminergic neuromodulatory innervation, most likely dopaminergic. Uniquely for the catecholaminergic system, a group of large TH-positive cell bodies is organized in what appears to be a ‘deep nucleus’ located at the border between the SFL and VL. This suggests that, in contrast to the external source of the serotonergic signals of the AF, dopamine may convey internal neuromodulatory signals within the SFL-VL system (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Stern‐Mentch et al., 2022</xref>).

Such combinatorial coding is a common feature in association networks such as the insect and mammalian olfactory systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Malnic et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lledo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Galizia and Szyszka, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Turner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gruntman and Turner, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kurian et al., 2021</xref>).

This suggests that each of VL association module associates many (i.e. several hundreds of SAMs) random combinations of visual features that are represented in the 1.8x10<sup>6</sup> SFL neurons.

Accordingly, the question arises whether the neuronal network described here can be generalized to the five VL lobuli. Several lines of evidence suggest that the generalization is highly plausible for the connectome of the fast transmission circuitry (i.e. SFL-to-SAM, SFL-to-CAM, SAM-to-CAM, SAM-to-LN, CAM-to-LN, CIN-to-CAM). First, these synaptic motifs were widely observed in the small dataset from a middle VL lobule of the same animal. Second, morphological, histological, and immunobiological analysis have revealed shared features across the five lobuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gray and Young, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gray, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Stern‐Mentch et al., 2022</xref>) and by and largely present a grossly similar distribution of the main neurotransmitters (GABA, glutamate, and acetylcholine) across lobuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Stern‐Mentch et al., 2022</xref>). Third, physiological studies have shown that the principal synaptic connectivity properties are shared by all VL lobuli. The glutamatergic connection of the SFL-to-AM, the site of LTP, and the cholinergic AMs-to-LN connections demonstrate similar properties in all five lobuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hochner et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Shomrat et al., 2011</xref>).

We constrained the tracing to the membrane probabilities layer generated by mEMbrain using the ‘constrained painting’ function in VAST, which restricted the tracing to connected components of pixels far from cellular membranes. This ML-aided tracing allowed the annotator to ignore the location of the cellular membranes and work in a skeletonization mode if the initial painting stroke overlapped intracellular space. Tests on small volumes suggested a~5–10 x faster annotation in this mode than manual painting without constraints, while retaining the accuracy of careful pixel annotation.

This membrane-constrained ML-aided reconstruction was used to quickly reconstruct all the synaptic partners of one LN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) and one AF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Criteria for cell classification</title><p>Our morphological reconstruction included segments of 516 cells and a wiring length of more than 12.8 cm. Only neurons that were sufficiently contained within the reconstructed volume were classified. Processes that could not be followed across the volume or were not wholly contained within it were considered orphan fragments and fell into the ‘unmarked category’ with other uncharacterized profiles.</p><sec id="s4-10-1"><title>Afferent axons</title><p>Classified as afferent axons were processes of constant radius (as opposed to dendrites that often taper), with exclusively presynaptic boutons filled with synaptic vesicles &lt;60 nm and with no connection to a cell body. Two processes met these features: the SFL axons see Results; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and the CIN (see Results; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). These were classified according to several established criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gray and Young, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gray, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Young, 1971</xref>): the axon projected into the VL lobule within the outer zone of the neuropil, made <italic>en passant</italic> synapses with AM neurons and at the ultrastructural level their varicosities showed an electron-lucent cytoplasm with average synaptic vesicle size of 59.7 ± 1.5 nm, and numerous round mitochondria. Unlike the SFL, CIN was found in the SFL and in the neuropil. These displayed the smallest vesicles in our dataset (38.2 ± 0.9 nm) and synapsed exclusively with clear postsynaptic profiles. Additionally, CIN fibers showed a high concentration of neurofilaments which ended where the synaptic vesicles appeared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gray, 1970</xref>). The high neurofilament content of these processes led <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gray, 1970</xref> to suggest that these were pain fibers. Both afferents could be easily identified with only electron micrographs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-2"><title>VL interneurons</title><p>Neurons were classified as VL interneurons if they received input from the SFL and/or were previously described as intrinsic to the lobes. All partners of the SFL axons were the AM cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gray and Young, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gray, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Young, 1971</xref>). However, we discovered two types of AMs: SAM and CAM (see Results; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The SAMs showed a single inwardly directed trunk that cannot be defined either as an axon or dendrite. Their ultrastructural signature was easily identifiable through the presence of synaptic vesicles (49.5 ± 1.3 nm) along the length of this trunk and the presence of specific ultrastructural components such as cisternae and the transport endoplasmic reticulum at every presynaptic site. Unlike the SAMs, the CAMs displayed a strict segregation between a dendritic compartment located within the SFL tract and their axonal process within the neuropil. Their dendritic tree was lightly or heavily branched, with one or multiple axons arising from it. Their dendritic arborizations displayed a classical electron-lucent postsynaptic profile filled with polyribosomes. Unlike the SAMs, the CAM presynaptic sites in the neuropil displayed a clearer cytoplasm with no specific ultrastructure and smaller vesicles than the SAMs (42.6 ± 1.1 nm).</p><p>We also observed putative interneurons displaying a bifunctional neurite, with both pre- and postsynaptic sites identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Previously undescribed and poorly represented in our dataset and apparently poorly involved in the major cell network, all such cells were considered as unmarked cells in the data analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-3"><title>Efferent fibers</title><p>Only the LNs fell into this category. Their cell bodies (diameter &gt;15 µm; n=14) lay mostly in the inner zones of the cortex and their large trunks ran radially into the neuropil (see Results; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). While most of the LNs were poorly contained in the reconstructed volume, some gave off dendritic collaterals within the SFL tract area where they were solely postsynaptic to the SAMs and unmarked process. Their dendrites showed a variable diameter along their length and displayed a typical clear postsynaptic profile. In the neuropil, we classified all clear postsynaptic profiles with convoluted arborizations heavily innervated by the AMs as LN processes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-4"><title>Neuromodulatory neurons</title><p>Based on known invertebrate modulatory synapses, processes were classified as modulatory if they contained mostly large vesicles (&gt;60 nm), either dark or clear. We distinguished two types of neuromodulatory processes (see Results; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). First, the AF with a distinctive morphology - a menorah–shaped tree climb from the neuropil to the cortex while intermingling with SAM trunks. The AF displayed boutons filled either with dense core vesicles with an average size of 74.9 ± 1.6 nm (AF-Nm) or a mix of smaller vesicle types that could be round, flattened, or irregularly shaped (AF-mix). Various subtypes of AF-mix were observed. The AF-Nm neurons were heavily innervated by the SAMs without any sign of presynaptic specialization. In contrast, the AF-mix was innervated to a lesser extent by the SAMs and displayed some presynaptic sites as well as occasionally reciprocal contacts.</p><p>The second type was NMs which were dispersed more globally in the VL neuropil and within the SFL tract and lacked a general orientation. Several subtypes were characterized by the homogeneity of the vesicle types found along their length. Most of their boutons lacked any sign of synaptic connection but the few pre- or postsynaptic sites observed were unorthodox. These NM processes displayed the largest vesicles in the entire dataset with diameters up to 200 nm (mean ± SD; 96.3 ± 3.5 nm) within their bouton and an accumulation of much smaller vesicles was observed at their rather rare presynaptic sites.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-5"><title>Glia</title><p>Cells were classified as glia if they showed clearly distinguishable gliofibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gray and Young, 1964</xref>) and/or did not receive any synapses. At least two types of protoplasmic glia were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). (1) radial glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Young, 1971</xref>) were full of gliofibrils and characterized by long radial processes and arborizations infiltrating the neuronal cell cortex. These cells appear to isolate neuronal types from each other. (2) The astrocyte-like glia had many gliofibrils within their processes, which showed an increased tortuosity densely infiltrating the SFL tract. Here they appeared to wrap distinct synaptic areas. Through repeating folds, this cell type appears to maximize self-contacts characterized by the apposition of their membranes and accumulation of electron-dense materials on both sides, possible sites for protein exchange. One astrocyte-like cell with its cell body located near a cell island was partially reconstructed; it covered an extensive area within the SFL tract. (3) Fibrous glia with cell bodies in the inner cortex were also observed; these did not receive any synapses in the reconstructed volume.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-6"><title>Others</title><p>Cells were classified as others only if their cell body was reconstructed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure Supplement 1B</xref>). These cells were nested in each other in the inner cortex forming a type of horizontal layer. There were at least two types of cells in this arrangement. First, the base was formed by elongated cell bodies whose nuclei showed bumpy irregular membranes often with nuclear folds. These cell bodies appeared to have very small projections, and, like the glia, they lacked synaptic connections. Above these elongated cells were more classically spherical cell bodies which appeared somewhat ‘immature.’ Their trunks, extending radially into the neuropil, often lacked synaptic connection and terminated early with filopodia typical of axon growth cones. Their fibers were rich in grayish filaments that could be filamentous actin, suggesting that this may be a site of plastic reorganization. Because of the similarity of this arrangement with neurogenic niches observed in the mammalian dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the subventricular zone, these cells resemble ‘progenitor-like cells.’ We saw no sign of cell division.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Identification and analysis of synapses</title><p>Chemical synapses were identified by features common to invertebrate synapses - the presence of a cluster of synaptic vesicles or ‘cloud’ associated with an active zone near the presynaptic membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gray, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">White et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Ryan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Meinertzhagen, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Witvliet et al., 2021</xref>). Although the active zone in our dataset was not as electron-dense as in other invertebrate systems, a pale active zone was still identifiable through careful observation. Synapses were annotated if the accumulation of synaptic vesicles persisted through at least 3 sections in a row (90 nm). We distinguished between traditional chemical synapses (fast transmission) with 30–60 nm synaptic vesicles and synapses of modulatory neurons with mostly large vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Witvliet et al., 2021</xref>). Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gray and Young, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gray, 1970</xref>), we did not find evidence of electrical connections (gap junction) or any clear postsynaptic density (PSD) at any chemical synapse within the vertical lobe. However, in the connectomics dataset, we observed a rather global membrane thickening at synaptic sites. This may be partly due to a lack of resolution and the observed global overstaining.</p><p>The high magnification dataset was used to confirm the synaptic nature of the connections observed in the connectomics dataset and the absence of PSD. The absence of PSD made it difficult to annotate polyadic varicosities (one cluster of vesicles could be associated with two postsynaptic targets). In ambiguous cases only the most likely partners were identified (larger surface contact), leading to a likely underestimation of the overall number of synapses. Because most of the cells were not fully contained in the reconstructed volume, it was not possible to assess the full collection of synapses between a given presynaptic and postsynaptic neuron. For this reason, we refer to a ‘synaptic site,’ a single anatomical release site or a single synapse. Multiple synaptic sites from the same cell were classified as a single input. Additionally, because cells had different lengths of arbor in the reconstructed volume, we expressed most of the results as a synaptic fraction and number of synaptic sites per 100 µm.</p><p>Although multiple annotators would have been ideal, due to project constraints and the difficulty of training people in an entirely new dataset where most synapses were being described for the first time, all synaptic annotations were made by a single annotator, giving consistency across annotations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Clustering of cells based on connectivity</title><p>As described above, the reconstructed cells and processes of the vertical lobe were classified based primarily on morphological criteria. We combined this classification with unsupervised clustering to obtain a visual summary of the connectivity patterns found in the lobe. First, we produced a cell-type wiring diagram connecting the 7 main cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The nodes of this graph comprise cell types, and the weighted edges between pairs of cell types represent the number of synapses between the processes that belonged to these cell types. We used a spring model to minimize the distances between the pairs of nodes (representing pairs of cell types) that corresponded to a relatively larger number of synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fruchterman and Reingold, 1991</xref>). This diagram revealed that synapses within a cell type are rare in the vertical lobe (mainly in ascending fibers; see Results). In addition, visually inspecting this diagram clarified that the connectivity was highly structured and far from an ‘all-to-all’ connectivity. Each cell type was connected to a small number of other cell types (see Results). This observation led us to consider the common inputs and common outputs of specific processes (described below).</p><p>We also discovered that besides these uncommon within-type synapses, there were no connectivity cycles in the cell-type wiring diagram. This observation led us to analyze the possible cycles in the wiring diagram while considering individual neurites (see the above Criteria for cell classification). We used an unsupervised approach to visualize the connectivity among individual processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This was done by considering the adjacency matrix <bold>A<sub>NxN</sub></bold> whose (<bold>i, j</bold>) entries represent the number of synapses from the presynaptic neuron <bold>i</bold> to the postsynaptic neuron <bold>j,</bold> considering <bold>N</bold> neurons (<bold>N</bold>=362). As specific groups of cells tended to synapse on other specific subsets of cells, a stereotypy observed from the cell-type diagram, we considered the number of shared inputs and shared outputs between individual processes, mathematically represented by the common output and common input symmetric matrices, <bold>A*A’</bold> (<bold>presynaptic</bold>) and <bold>A’*A</bold> (<bold>postsynaptic</bold>), respectively. The presynaptic matrix represents how many common targets exist for pairs of neurons, and the postsynaptic matrix represents how many common inputs exist for pairs of neurons. To visualize the tendencies of neurons to share inputs or outputs, we considered the matrix <bold>A*A’+A’*A</bold> which sums for every pair of neurons the number of shared inputs and outputs, using subspace embedding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Koren, 2005</xref>) and 100 dimensions, heuristically picking a dimension that yielded sufficient separation between individual nodes (nearby dimension produced visually similar outcomes). This embedding of the neurons in the plane resulted in a close positioning with other neurons with a similarity of inputs and outputs (summed). The position of the entire layout and its orientation is arbitrary and not used to derive biological observations. To combine the cell type- and neuron-based diagrams, each neuron was located based on its location in the type-based wiring diagram, shifted by its location in the neuron-based wiring diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Analysis of feed-forwardness</title><p>The cell type-based wiring diagram analysis revealed that connectivity cycles were rare and neural activity propagated in only one direction in the VL, analyzed among populations of cells belonging to the seven cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). To determine if there were cyclic synaptic information flows in the reconstructed circuit at the level of individual neurites, we used graph algorithms that detect directed cycles in directed graphs. Topological sorting algorithms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barth et al., 2004</xref>) that determine a linear order in cycle-free directed graphs were used to detect cycles in the graph. A topological sorting is a sequence of nodes each of which is possibly connected only to nodes proceeding in the list. Hence, we inspected all the edges in the topological sorting that went backward. We found a few edges (n=4) that violated the forwardness of the circuit and each of these cases was related to a reciprocal synapse between a pair of nodes associated with a single synaptic site between the cells. We then calculated the probability of observing this level of forwardness in random graphs that agreed with the wiring diagram, i.e., having the same set of neurons and synapses as in the data, but in which the direction of synaptic transmission was randomized (n=10,000 random connectomes). This showed that the level of forwardness in the data is unlikely to occur by chance (p&lt;0.05).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Classification of cell types from cell body morphology</title><p>Our reconstruction revealed that the SAM, CAM, and LN cell bodies lay in the VL cortex along with several other cell types: glia, others, and mix cells (Others; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We noticed, consistently with early studies, that the LNs had extremely large cell bodies and that the newly discovered CAMs tended to have slightly larger cell bodies than the SAMs. We tested whether these observations could be used to classify cell types directly from the morphology of their cell bodies. We used 110 cells whose somata were contained in the volume and their processes were distinctly characterized in the neuropil by an expert annotator: 7 LNs (6.36%), 69 SAMs (62.73%), 16 CAMs (14.55%) and 18 others (16.36%). The selection of this subset of cells was agnostic to the details of the classification process described here. For each of these cells, we considered the volume of the cell body as the number of annotated voxels multiplied by the volume unit of a voxel, and the volume, surface area, and sphericity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Wadell, 1935</xref>) of the ellipsoid best matching the geometry of the cell body. Ellipsoid approximations were computed from the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the voxel coordinates of the cell bodies.</p><p>Our tests showed that the information gained from these ellipsoids was sufficiently discriminative and hence the three parameters volumes, surface area, and sphericity were used for further analyses. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) were used to train, cross-validate and predict the three main cell classes found in the cortex: LN, SAM and CAM, and a 4th class, Other, to represent the seemingly small number of other cell types in the cortex (including glia, progenitor cells and possibly other cells of scarce representation). The min, max, mean and SD of these parameters were computed for each class as well as the training accuracy (see Results).</p><p>In addition, a set of 47 cells (each cell was annotated twice) was used to determine the accuracy of the SVMs and for leave-one-out cross-validation (see Results). Once the SVM model was determined from the training set, it was applied to a test set, comprising 1447 cells, that were densely annotated in the cortex (using mEMbrain and VAST as described above). The number and percentage of each of the four classes were calculated (see Results; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Wire-length calculation</title><p>To calculate the length of the processes (see Results; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), we used a thinning algorithm to map each volumetric object into a skeleton and used graph theory algorithms to measure the total length of skeletons. This was done by calculating the graph distance between skeleton nodes representing the end of the volumetric object (a leaf; a node that is connected to at most one other node, e.g. of the last node in a branch terminating at a synapse) and skeleton nodes representing branching (nodes that are connected to more than two other nodes, e.g., a branching point of a dendrite-like structure or axonal branching). The distances between adjacent skeletal nodes were defined using the Euclidean distance between the voxels in the 3D 26-neighb0rhood mask (a 3 × 3 cube around each voxel). We then summed up all these distances to measure the wire length of each process. Occasionally the thinning algorithm produces a biologically meaningless cycle due to topological holes in the annotated objects (either biological or imperfect annotation). We guaranteed that only the shortest paths between special skeletal nodes (bifurcations and leaves) were used for the wire-length calculation using minimum distance graph algorithms between leaf and bifurcation nodes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>SFL bouton volume calculation</title><p>Synaptic boutons are morphologically easy to identify, and they were accordingly individually segmented to allow volumetric measurements (see Results; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Volumes of boutons were estimated from the voxel counts of each bouton. A <italic>post hoc</italic> exact permutation test for independent samples compared the volumes of the SFL SB and SFL LB. The p-values were adjusted according to the sequential Bonferroni correction as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Holm, 1979</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Subcellular reconstruction</title><p>The geometry of the SFL large synaptic boutons and the postsynaptic structures they innervate were reconstructed at the subcellular level using the high magnification dataset (see Results; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Neuronal elements of interest were manually segmented on VAST. The labeled images and metadata containing the labels were exported and processed externally or accessed through the VAST API. Vesicles showing a clear synaptic center in each section were counted by outlining intracellular space containing vesicles (see more information below). Mitochondria were identified by the presence of an inner membrane with visible cristae. Transport endoplasm, large electron-lucent tubular organelles, spanned the reconstructed volume and appeared to be a continuous structure present throughout the length of the AM trunk. They showed large swellings at the presynaptic site, particularly at the ‘palm.’ Discontinuous thin lucent tubular organelles that sometimes appeared as dark lines were annotated as ‘cisternae’ (Cis). It is not clear whether the Cis (up to 15 observed in one palm) were part of the larger endoplasmic reticulum network or were isolated entities.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Counting, modeling, and measuring vesicles</title><p>An annotator painted all individual vesicles of several compartments using distinct colors per compartment. Distinct colors were used to annotate the active zones. The center of mass and areas of the vesicle cross-sections were used to approximate the centers and spherical representations of individual vesicles, from which spherical 3D mesh representations were computed. Occasionally, several vesicles of the same compartment were overlapped spatially. This required us to use distance transforms and watersheds to achieve the separation of vesicles. Vesicle counts were made only after they were separated in space. Due to the section thickness (30 nm), most of the vesicles were clearly appreciated in a single section, whereas only the largest vesicles (&gt;60 nm diameter) may have had a strong signal in two adjacent sections. The annotator attempted to avoid overrepresentation of a vesicle, when possible, but since this task is not unambiguous our counts likely represent an upper bound. Extremely small vesicle-like structures were not annotated since it was assumed that these structures were likely represented in adjacent sections.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Rendering</title><p>For the rendering of all the traced images, 3D surface meshes of labeled objects were generated from VAST using VastTools (written in MATLAB) and imported into 3D Studio Max 2020 (Autodesk Inc) to generate 3D renderings of all the traced objects.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Software, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Software, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Supplementary electrophysiological experiment</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Software, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Project administration</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All experimental animals were held and handle according to the guidelines for the EU Directive 2010/63/EU for cephalopod welfare in order to minimize the suffering and distress of the animals.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-84257-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The 'connectome dataset' is publicly available using (browser-based) Neuroglancer at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://lichtman.rc.fas.harvard.edu/octopus_connectomes">https://lichtman.rc.fas.harvard.edu/octopus_connectomes</ext-link> with 8 nm resolution as well as the connectomic segmentation of these data available in the same web-format.</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bidel</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Meirovitch</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Schalek</surname><given-names>RL</given-names></name><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>X</given-names></name><name><surname>Pavarino</surname><given-names>EC</given-names></name><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Peleg</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Shomrat</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Berger</surname><given-names>DR</given-names></name><name><surname>Shaked</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Lichtman</surname><given-names>JW</given-names></name><name><surname>Hochner</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2022">2022</year><data-title>Octopus vulgaris vertical EMme</data-title><source>Octopus connectomes</source><pub-id pub-id-type="accession" xlink:href="https://lichtman.rc.fas.harvard.edu/octopus_connectomes">octopus_connectomes</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP) grant no.

the octopus was mapped from volume electron microscopy. The acquisition of this pioneering data set was followed by a compelling analysis of the circuits supporting learning and memory, and therefore behavioural plasticity, on the basis of the newly mapped vertical lobe microcircuit and prior studies on long-term potentiation (LTP) in this animal. The data and findings establish an important point of comparison with analogous brain structures and memory mechanisms in other organisms, such as the vertebrate cerebellum and the arthropod mushroom body, and expand the set of known and mapped neural circuit architectures for learning and memory. The results will serve as the basis for further studies on the fascinating cephalopods and inspire further exploration in the design of artificial neural networks.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84257.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Cardona</surname><given-names>Albert</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/013meh722</institution-id><institution>University of Cambridge</institution></institution-wrap><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.10.03.510303">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.03.510303v2">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and John Huguenard as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>What a wonderful paper. We are very much looking forward to your revisions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please revise the claim that the connectome of a partial octopus brain vertical lobe gyrus is representative of all 5 gyri; there are published immunocytochemical evidence that suggests some gyri contain cell types not present in the others, and furthermore, the data sets presented here are limited to one of the gyri.</p><p>2) Please could you consider expanding the discussion, to further enlighten the reader with your thoughts on the purpose of the plasticity related to &quot;self-LTP&quot; and the SAM cell type, as well as contextualize the findings with what's known about the behaviors controlled by the vertical lobe. This would strengthen the manuscript and enable the reader to better place the significance and impact of the findings.</p><p>3) Careful proofreading would be most appreciated, as there are a number of typos to the point of being distracting.</p><p>4) Some figure legends would benefit from expanding the text that describes them. In general, it would be best if figure legends are as detailed as necessary for a reader to not have to rely on the main text. Space limitations aren't an issue.</p><p>Please see detailed reviewer comments below.</p><p>The reviewers thoroughly enjoyed reading your manuscript and have provided a number of detailed, constructive comments in the hope to assist you in strengthening the manuscript and clarifying its impact.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) In general, the manuscript needs proofreading. I'm putting this in because it's an issue throughout to the point of being distracting. I hope the authors address this by carefully going through the whole manuscript, not just a few things that I was able to catch.</p><p>Figure 3: Some spelling/grammatical mistakes (&quot;One SFL axons,&quot; &quot;tiradic Motif&quot;).</p><p>Line 251: &quot;relative aboundance the SAMs&quot; should be &quot;relative abundance of the SAMs&quot;.</p><p>Line 266-269: In one place it says the error on the validation set is smaller than 4.01%, another place 4.1%. In the Results, it says there are 47 cells used for validation, in the Methods it says 49.</p><p>Figure 4 caption: &quot;cell body geometry roundish, relatively smaller…&quot; Missing punctuation here?</p><p>Line 563: It's 50 billion granule cells, so it should be 50 x 10^9, not 10^12. And it's 50 billion neurons in the human cerebellum, not mouse.</p><p>Lines 612-613: There's a reference to Kandel et al. 2012, but no such reference in the bibliography. Same for Malenka 2003. I'm not going to go through every reference, but did the authors use a citation manager? If not, every reference must be checked by hand to make sure it's in the bibliography.</p><p>755: SMA should be SAM.</p><p>2) There are a lot of acronyms in this paper, and not all of them are necessary. There are already 7 cell type acronyms to keep in one's head, and I think these would be enough. A few examples that seem too much:</p><p>– LNp could just be &quot;LN processes.&quot;</p><p>– MB is introduced as an acronym for the mushroom body even though it's only used 4 times.</p><p>– LB and SB are borderline but personally, I think they could just be called large and small boutons.</p><p>– In Figure 10, &quot;OL&quot; is used in the figure, presumably for the optic lobe, but the acronym is never defined.</p><p>– Sometimes &quot;SFLs&quot; is used but &quot;SFL&quot; is introduced as a brain area, so I would use &quot;SFL axons&quot; instead of &quot;SFLs.&quot;</p><p>To help, full names along with acronyms, when possible, should be included in section titles, especially in the sections that focus on particular cell types.</p><p>3) When writing about LTP specificity and associativity in the Discussion, the terms should be defined here so the reader doesn't have to search through the references to understand the precise definition being used by the authors. Because the references are missing from the bibliography, I couldn't figure out what the definitions being used are. In general, I found this section rather technical. Related to a point from the public review, I would have hoped to see more discussion about exactly what signals are being used for supervision/&quot;associativity,&quot; rather than solely molecular mechanisms.</p><p>4) The figures are pixelated. They'd look much better in a vector graphics format (with embedded bitmaps for images that are not vectors). If bitmaps must be used for the figures, export them with a higher resolution, but in general the first option always looks best.</p><p>Other comments:</p><p>Line 169: &quot;the connectivity is strictly feedforward (p&lt;0.05).&quot; If a p-value is given here it should be described how it was attained. Later, it seems like the analysis is saying that the network is more feedforward than chance but not purely feedforward because of reciprocal synapses. If this is the case, then &quot;strictly feedforward&quot; is incorrect.</p><p>Lines 555-557: Unclear if &quot;expansion ratio&quot; here means the ratio of input neurons to connections, or input neurons to output neurons.</p><p>Figure 11: Why is &quot;average SFL axonal length&quot; written at the bottom of the figure? This number isn't referenced in the caption and doesn't seem relevant. Also, what is the 103 {plus minus} 73 μm distance meant to represent? In the caption, it says there are 1.03 {plus minus} 0.73 large boutons per 100 μm, which means that the typical distance between large boutons should be 100 μm divided by 1.03 {plus minus} 0.73, not multiplied by it. Also, the Σ in the figure isn't defined, I assume it just means the total number of large boutons per SFL axon.</p><p>Line 760-761: &quot;However, the processing power provided by the association module is computationally more elaborated than a single neuron can provide.&quot; This claim needs to be supported/explained. It seems like it is contradicted by the sentences before and after it, which seem to be saying that the system is equivalent to a single neuron with a complex dendritic tree. If the SAM input/output function is linear, this is true, as seems to be one of the points of Shomrat et al. 2011.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Line 16: While this study focused on a small portion of the anterior part of the lateral gyrus of the vertical lobe only, this sentence needs to be rephrased to avoid misunderstanding.</p><p>Line 41: The vertical lobe of Octopus vulgaris is not exceptionally large, actually quite small at the volumetric aspect. Based on Maddock and Young 1987, the volumetric estimate of the VL in the young adult (mantle length 80 mm) was 6.67 mm^3, approximately 4 % of CNS volume. In addition, the relevant citation to refer to the neuron number (Young 1963) is needed here and in some sections below.</p><p>Line 78-80: Rephrase this sentence as this study only showed the results based on a small proportion of the lateral gyrus. Given incomplete data on the rest of the lateral gyrus as well as the other 4 gyri, it is unclear if the present findings can represent an entire VL.</p><p>Line 105-121: Figure 1A, Correct the body axis label of this sagittal section where the current anterior end needs to be corrected as posterior where the subpedunculate lobe is located.</p><p>Also, considering this sagittal slice located close to the lateral side of the CNS, the location of the inferior frontal lobe (IFL) in Figure 1A is thus arguable.

Notably, these elongated and narrow pairs of segmentation did not show any specific morphological features within these colour-shaded areas. Similar issues can be frequently found elsewhere.

Therefore, we added a paragraph in the introduction (L106-113) and a Discussion section titled “How well does a partial connectome of a small portion of one VL lateral lobule represent the connectivity patterns across all five VL lobuli?” (L894-917) outlining what we believe is consistent across VL lobuli and what is likely lobule-dependent.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please could you consider expanding the discussion, to further enlighten the reader with your thoughts on the purpose of the plasticity related to &quot;self-LTP&quot; and the SAM cell type, as well as contextualize the findings with what's known about the behaviors controlled by the vertical lobe.

We have incorporated the feedback provided by reviewer #1 and carefully proofread the manuscript before resubmitting it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There are a lot of acronyms in this paper, and not all of them are necessary. There are already 7 cell type acronyms to keep in one's head, and I think these would be enough. A few examples that seem too much:</p><p>– LNp could just be &quot;LN processes.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We replaced LNp with LN (or LN processes) throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– MB is introduced as an acronym for the mushroom body even though it's only used 4 times.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not use the acronym MB anymore.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– LB and SB are borderline but personally, I think they could just be called large and small boutons.</p></disp-quote><p>&quot;LB&quot; and &quot;SB&quot; are frequently used throughout the manuscript and allow for shorter annotations in figures. Additionally, the acronyms provide an identity to the large and small boutons.

Because the references are missing from the bibliography, I couldn't figure out what the definitions being used are. In general, I found this section rather technical. Related to a point from the public review, I would have hoped to see more discussion about exactly what signals are being used for supervision/&quot;associativity,&quot; rather than solely molecular mechanisms.</p></disp-quote><p>We thoroughly checked the bibliography and added appropriate references. We clarified and simplified the section on LTP specificity and associativity, opting for a balanced description, including the molecular aspects of these mechanisms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The figures are pixelated. They'd look much better in a vector graphics format (with embedded bitmaps for images that are not vectors). If bitmaps must be used for the figures, export them with a higher resolution, but in general the first option always looks best.</p></disp-quote><p>We are thankful for this suggestion. Some of the figures embedded in the manuscript appeared quite pixelated. For this second submission, we saved all figures separately in vector graphics format (PDF). Plots and text should no longer appear pixelated. However, the 3D rendering resolution was previously optimized for practical work in Photoshop, and re-rendering these at this stage will be a large effort.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other comments:</p><p>Line 169: &quot;the connectivity is strictly feedforward (p&lt;0.05).&quot; If a p-value is given here it should be described how it was attained. Later, it seems like the analysis is saying that the network is more feedforward than chance but not purely feedforward because of reciprocal synapses. If this is the case, then &quot;strictly feedforward&quot; is incorrect.</p></disp-quote><p>The reciprocal synapses are the exception and not the rule but for better clarity we changed “strictly feedforward” to “feedforward”. We added to the figure caption a short explanation of how the p-value was obtained, and more information is found in the methods section under the paragraph titled “Analysis of feed-forwardness”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 555-557: Unclear if &quot;expansion ratio&quot; here means the ratio of input neurons to connections, or input neurons to output neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>We explain better the meaning of “expansion ratio” in a new section discussing the relevance of the finding of a single SFL input to each SAM in the context of other memory-storing networks.

This number isn't referenced in the caption and doesn't seem relevant. Also, what is the 103 {plus minus} 73 μm distance meant to represent? In the caption, it says there are 1.03 {plus minus} 0.73 large boutons per 100 μm, which means that the typical distance between large boutons should be 100 μm divided by 1.03 {plus minus} 0.73, not multiplied by it. Also, the Σ in the figure isn't defined, I assume it just means the total number of large boutons per SFL axon.</p></disp-quote><p>For clarity, these distances have been removed from the figure.

It seems like it is contradicted by the sentences before and after it, which seem to be saying that the system is equivalent to a single neuron with a complex dendritic tree. If the SAM input/output function is linear, this is true, as seems to be one of the points of Shomrat et al. 2011.</p></disp-quote><p>As pointed out by the reviewer, this claim was confusing and was accordingly removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Line 16: While this study focused on a small portion of the anterior part of the lateral gyrus of the vertical lobe only, this sentence needs to be rephrased to avoid misunderstanding.</p></disp-quote><p>We revised L17 to read as follows: &quot;We present the first analysis of the connectome of a small volume of the Octopus vulgaris vertical lobe (VL).” While we do not include “lateral lobule” in the summary, it is now specified throughout the manuscript, with new clarifications in the introduction and a section in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 41: The vertical lobe of Octopus vulgaris is not exceptionally large, actually quite small at the volumetric aspect.

This labeling was not aided by any semiautomatic tracing.</p><p>Although we initially intended to label only synaptic contacts and used this segmentation to assess synaptic contact size, we abandoned this idea as it appeared biased, as mentioned by the reviewer. Specifically, in the case of the SFL-SAM synapse, although it can be easily and confidently annotated, it is nearly impossible to distinguish between the physical contact and synaptic contact of the two elements (due to overstaining and lack of PSD). Thus, the narrow pair of segmentation is nothing more than an indication of a synapse localization with no intention to precisely label the synaptic contact size. Therefore, the segmentation of the synapse was used only to count the number of pre or post-synaptic contacts for a specific cell but not to assess synaptic size.</p><p>We intend to add annotations to the color segmentation that can be viewed online to make it clear for the reader.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 153: the subtitle needs to be rephrased to avoid a misleading impression of the VL connectome.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned earlier, we agree that to uncover the subtleties of the VL networks, the connectome of other VL lobes will have to be produced. However, we believe that at this stage, the general network revealed in this study should be qualitatively similar between the VL lobuli, at least for the fast transmission networks, as all the synaptic motifs reported in our study were also reported elsewhere (Gray and our own work). We could not identify any synaptic motif that was not uncovered in our sample, suggesting that the difference is likely to be mainly quantitative or related to the neuromodulation network.

We aimed to provide an initial estimate of the number of neurons as a first step toward understanding the cell diversity within the VL – a required task given the limited knowledge on this topic and the newly discovered cell types (specifically CAMs). Even though we acknowledge the limitation of using a small volume of EM, especially when separated from other tools, it was the first method that uncovered the CAM cell type.
