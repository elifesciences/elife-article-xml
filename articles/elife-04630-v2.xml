mechanisms remains unclear. In this study, we used Mss116, a yeast DEAD-box protein that utilizes ATP to locally unwind dsRNA, to investigate helicase specificity and mechanism. Our results define the molecular basis for the substrate specificity of a DEAD-box protein. Additionally, they show that Mss116 has ambiguous substrate-binding properties and interacts with all four NTPs and both RNA and DNA. The efficiency of unwinding correlates with the stability of the ‘closed-state’ helicase core, a complex with nucleotide and nucleic acid that forms as duplexes are unwound. Crystal structures reveal that core stability is modulated by family-specific interactions that favor certain substrates. This suggests how present-day helicases diversified from an ancestral core with broad specificity by retaining core closure as a common catalytic mechanism while optimizing substrate-binding interactions for different cellular functions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04630.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04630.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04630.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Living cells store their genetic material as DNA, which can be copied to make another molecule called RNA. DNA consists of two strands that are wound around each other in a double helix. RNA is made in a similar way to DNA, but it is usually present as a single strand that folds into a three-dimensional structure that is held in shape by regions of the molecule interacting with each other.</p><p>Before DNA and RNA can perform their essential tasks in cells, enzymes called helicases must separate the interacting strands. A large group of helicases, known as superfamily 1 and 2, are involved in virtually all aspects of the control of RNA and DNA structure. All of these helicases contain a region called the ‘helicase core’, but they work in different ways. For example, some move along the DNA or RNA strand whilst they unwind it, while others can unwind RNA without moving. It remains unclear how these helicases have evolved different ways to unwind DNA and RNA structures using the same helicase core.</p><p>Mallam et al. have now analyzed a helicase from yeast called Mss116, which belongs to superfamily 2. It is known from previous work that Mss116 binds to many different RNA molecules and—unlike most other helicases—it does not require any extra proteins to help. This makes it an ideal model to study the properties of a helicase core on its own.</p><p>Helicases use the energy released from breaking down molecules called nucleotides to pull apart the bonds that hold DNA and RNA strands together. The experiments found that for Mss116, a nucleotide called ATP is the best for providing the energy needed to unwind RNA but other nucleotides can work less efficiently. The experiments also show that in addition to RNA, Ms116 is able to unwind double-stranded DNA molecules that have a certain shape.</p><p>Using a technique called X-ray crystallography, Mallam et al. observed the structure of the Mss116 core when it is bound to RNA and DNA. While there are some shared points of contact between the helicase and the DNA or RNA, there are more points of contact between Mss116 and RNA than between Mss116 and DNA.</p><p>Mallam et al. propose that present-day helicases have diversified from enzymes that had broad specificity for RNA and DNA, by optimizing interactions that favor the binding of particular nucleotides and nucleic acids. These changes enabled the helicases to become a versatile set of tools that control the structure of RNA or DNA in different ways.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04630.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04630.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>RNA helicase</kwd><kwd>enzyme specificity</kwd><kwd>molecular evolution</kwd><kwd>RNA unwinding</kwd><kwd>DEAD-box protein</kwd><kwd>enzyme mechanism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM037951</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lambowitz</surname><given-names>Alan M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The core domains of an RNA helicase interact with a wide variety of NTPs and nucleic acids suggesting how related enzymes may have evolved to have diverse functions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Helicases of superfamilies (SFs) 1 and 2 use ATP or other NTPs to bind, unwind, or remodel RNA or DNA in essentially all facets of nucleic acid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Preugschat et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tanaka and Schwer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Singleton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fairman-Williams et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jarmoskaite and Russell, 2014</xref>).

The helicase core domains of Mss116 have modular roles in substrate loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mallam et al., 2012</xref>). D1 captures ATP in the open-state enzyme using the Q-motif, which coordinates the adenine base, and motifs I and II, which are the conserved triphosphate-binding loop and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-binding aspartic acid motifs, respectively, present in many other ATP-binding enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Walker et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rudolph et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schutz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mallam et al., 2012</xref>). D2 recognizes duplex RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mallam et al., 2012</xref>). When ATP and dsRNA are bound to D1 and D2, respectively, core closure occurs, leading to unwinding of the dsRNA bound to D2 by bending one RNA strand and displacing the other. During unwinding and formation of the closed-state helicase core complex, ATP bound to D1 makes additional interactions with motifs Va and VI in D2. The closed-state helicase core bound to ssRNA and ATP represents the ‘post-unwound’ state of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). ATP hydrolysis occurs in the closed state, followed by dissociation of P<sub>i</sub> and ADP, which leads to the reopening of the core and the release of the bound ssRNA, thereby regenerating the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Henn et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cao et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04630.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04630.003</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-04630-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig1s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04630.004</object-id><label>Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Crystal structures of helicases belonging to different SF1 and SF2 families.</title><p>Examples are taken from the helicase families shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>.

Mss116 functions as a general RNA chaperone in mitochondrial intron splicing by locally unwinding and disrupting stable but inactive RNA structures that impede RNA folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Del Campo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Potratz et al., 2011</xref>). As a general RNA chaperone, Mss116 binds diverse RNA substrates non-specifically and has high RNA helicase activity in the absence of partner proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Halls et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Del Campo et al., 2009</xref>). This makes it an ideal model system to study the properties of an isolated helicase core. The helicase core of Mss116 consists of two RecA-like domains (D1 and D2) that are in an extended ‘open state’ in the absence of substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mallam et al., 2011</xref>) and recognize ATP and duplex RNA in a modular manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mallam et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Upon substrate binding, the two core domains join to form a ‘closed state’ containing an ATPase active site, while conserved DEAD-box protein motifs in D1 promote the unwinding of short duplexes bound to D2 by excluding one RNA strand and bending the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The closed-state complex bound to ssRNA and ATP represents the ‘post-unwound’ state of the helicase core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). ATP hydrolysis is required for core reopening and enzyme turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cao et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we determined the structural and biochemical factors that govern how analogues of NTPs (ATP, CTP, GTP, and UTP) and different nucleic acids (single-stranded [ss] RNA, ssDNA, double-stranded [ds] RNA, A-form dsDNA, and B-form dsDNA) interact with the helicase core. In this way, we identify the core–substrate interactions that dictate the physiological specificity and mechanism of Mss116. Our results define the structural and biochemical determinants for the substrate specificity of a DEAD-box protein. Furthermore, they demonstrate that Mss116 has surprisingly ambiguous substrate binding and unwinding properties. Considered in the context of other SF1 and SF2 helicases, our findings show how small structural changes within conserved regions of these protein families can facilitate the emergence of specialized enzymes with new activities and cellular functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The biochemical basis for the ATP specificity of the helicase core of Mss116</title><p>We investigated how Mss116 specifies for ATP during local unwinding by comparing the ability of the helicase core (D1D2, residues 88–597) to use different nucleotides to catalyze RNA unwinding. First, we measured the concentration of different NTP analogues required by the helicase core to unwind an RNA duplex under equilibrium conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This was done by using a 12-base pair (bp) dsRNA, which was labeled with a fluorophore and quencher at its 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. A native gel-based assay was then used to monitor unwinding by the increase in fluorescence in a closed-state core containing a bound single strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We find that all of the non-hydrolyzable analogues NDP-BeF<sub>x</sub>, where N = A, C, G, or U, can promote the unwinding of a dsRNA. However, ADP-BeF<sub>x</sub> is the most efficient with at least sixfold higher concentrations of C-, G-, or U-analogues required for RNA duplex unwinding (<italic>K</italic><sub>1/2</sub> = 0.14, 0.8, 0.8, and 2.4 mM, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–E</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04630.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The biochemical basis for the ATP specificity of the helicase core of Mss116.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) dsRNA unwinding by the MBP-tagged helicase core measured under equilibrium conditions using a gel-based fluorescence assay to monitor the formation of a closed-state complex containing bound ssRNA at increasing concentrations of NDP-BeF<sub>x</sub>, N = A, C, G, or U (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The fraction of unwound duplex was obtained by normalizing the band intensities separately for each gel using the parameters from the fit to a one-site binding model, as the change in fluorescence upon unwinding is different under each condition. The extent of unwinding with UDP-BeF<sub>x</sub> was less than that for the other nucleotide analogs, and the maximum concentration of UDP-BeF<sub>x</sub> used in this assay was insufficient to drive unwinding to completion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Unwinding data for ATP were normalized using the parameters obtained from the fit to a first-order reaction with a single exponential. In the case of other nucleoside triphosphates where no unwinding was observed, data were normalized against the signal for a duplex fully unwound by ATP at the same concentration (see panel <bold>C</bold>, final lane). Assays were performed in a buffer containing 5 mM free Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Additional assays were performed at 0.5 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>, as previous data indicate that the unwinding activity of Mss116 increases at lower Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Halls et al., 2007</xref>).

In these experiments, an increase in fluorescence occurs upon unwinding of a labeled duplex and subsequent re-annealing to an unlabeled strand. This was measured by isolating the duplexes using native gel electrophoresis at various times after unwinding was initiated by the addition of NTP, where N = A, C, G, or U (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). These assays show that only ATP, and not other NTPs, catalyzes the unwinding of the dsRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B–D</xref>). This indicates that under our assay conditions, the diphosphate beryllium fluoride analogue is necessary to promote unwinding with nucleotide bases other than adenine. This difference likely reflects that the NDP-BeF<sub>x</sub> analogues form longer-lived, more stable complexes with RNA than do the corresponding NTPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We next examined how the stability of the ternary closed-state complex with ssRNA and the same NTP analogues correlates with the efficiency of duplex unwinding.

These structures show that the ATP-binding motifs I and VI make similar direct contacts to the phosphate groups of all four NTP analogs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Motif II (DEAD) is positioned identically in all structures and interacts indirectly via waters with the BeF<sub>3</sub> moiety, which corresponds to the ATP γ-phosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). However, each base interacts differently in the ATP-binding pocket. The purine bases (A and G) are stacked optimally with F126 in the Q-motif, which primarily confers ATP specificity in DEAD-box proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Linder and Jankowsky, 2011</xref>), whereas the pyrimidine bases (C and U) adopt a less favorable stacking orientation with this residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

In each case, core closure was retained as a catalytic mechanism using the interactions common to all NTP or nucleic acid substrates predicted from our results. However, the stability of the closed-state was further modulated by family-specific interactions that favor a particular NTP and nucleic acid. Thus, helicase families that display the most substrate ambiguity by utilizing all four NTPs and function on either DNA or RNA (for example the DEAH/RHA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tanaka and Schwer, 2005</xref>] and NS3/NPH-II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Preugschat et al., 1996</xref>] families; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) may contain a core that functions similarly to that of an ancestral helicase. Helicases that preferentially use ATP maintained the conserved interactions with nucleotide phosphate groups but acquired additional interactions with the adenine base that further stabilize the closed-state complex. Similarly, DEAD-box proteins, which act preferentially on RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fairman-Williams et al., 2010</xref>), maintained conserved interactions with the nucleic acid backbone but evolved specificity for A-form duplexes and additional stabilizing interactions with RNA 2′-OH groups in the closed state, as demonstrated here for Mss116. The lack of unwinding activity in some DEAD-box proteins may stem from structural changes in the helicase core that mitigate RNA bending or strand displacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Young et al., 2013</xref>). Helicase families that function on DNA (for example, the Swi/Snf, RecQ-like, and UvrD/Rep families) could have diversified by the preservation of conserved interactions with the nucleic acid backbone combined with the selection of additional interactions that favor B-form duplexes and/or disfavor nucleic acids with 2′-OH groups.</p><p>Similar inferences can be made from our data about the evolution of distinct mechanisms in SF1 and SF2 families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We propose that although core-closure was retained as a mode of catalysis, the differences in the stability of the closed-state complex between helicase families allowed the diversification of the observed helicase mechanism. Thus, the localized unwinding mechanism used by DEAD-box proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yang et al., 2007</xref>) likely evolved by the selection of a helicase core that is able to ‘clamp’ ssRNA and form a highly stable closed-state complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>). This mode of interaction compensates for the energy cost to locally unwind an RNA duplex, which is critical for DEAD-box protein function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Del Campo et al., 2009</xref>). In comparison, helicase cores that diverged to form less stable, more transient closed states with ssRNA or ssDNA would favor a mechanism that involved loading and translocating along a single strand (for example, NS3/NPH-II and RecQ-like helicases; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>Our data also demonstrate that the stability of the closed state depends upon interactions with nucleotides as well as nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The DEAH family of helicases are a potential example of a case where a sequence change in motif II compared to DEAD-box proteins (‘DEAH’ instead of ‘DEAD’) might result in a weaker interaction with the ATP γ-phosphate and favor the observed switch from localized to translocation-based unwinding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). More generally, ATP-dependent core closure to form a ternary complex with nucleic acid may have evolved from tighter to weaker binding as the helicase mechanism concurrently evolved from localized to translocation-based. This is in addition to structural features, such as extra terminal domains or β-hairpins within the helicase core, which favor translocation-based unwinding in some helicase families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fairman-Williams et al., 2010</xref>). Protein cofactors may also play a role in helicase substrate specificity, as illustrated for the DEAD-box protein Rok1, whose cofactor Rrp5 increases the specificity of the helicase core 10-fold for a pre-rRNA duplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Young et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Finally, other SF2 helicases have evolved to optimally accommodate dsRNA (e.g., RIG-I) or dsDNA (e.g., <italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus</italic> Swi2/Snf2) in a closed state complex and translocate with no observable unwinding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Durr et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Myong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiang et al., 2011</xref>). In these cases, subtle changes in the closed-state core, perhaps combined with additional flanking domains, enable the helicase to bind duplex nucleic acid without the need to overcome the energetic barrier to unwinding and lead to this distinct mechanism of action. It has been hypothesized that during evolution, progenitor enzymes of low activity and broad specificity diverge into families of more potent and highly specialized enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jensen, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Khersonsky and Tawfik, 2010</xref>). Taken together, our findings suggest how a progenitor helicase core that had broad specificity and used conserved motifs to recognize the phosphate groups of NTPs and the backbone of nucleic acids diverged to present day SF1 and SF2 helicases with different cellular functions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Oligonucleotides</title><p>Unlabeled self-complementary RNA or DNA oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies, IDT, Coralville, IO; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>) were annealed to form 12-bp RNA or DNA duplexes by heating solutions at 6 mM single strands in 100 mM potassium acetate, 30 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) at 94°C for 1 min and then slowly cooling to room temperature over 1 hr.

The protein concentration was chosen so that all of the duplex substrate is bound in the open state at equilibrium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Samples were analyzed in a non-denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel run at 4°C for 60 min. The fluorescence signal of the bound duplex substrate was quantified by using a Typhoon imager (GE Healthcare, UK) to measure the formation of a closed-state complex containing a single-stranded nucleic acid region, indicating duplex unwinding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The apparent fraction of unwound duplex at increasing concentrations of NDP-BeF<sub>x</sub> was quantified by using ImageJ and fit to a one-site binding model to estimate the concentration of nucleotide at the midpoint (<italic>K</italic><sub>1/2</sub>) of the unwinding reaction. In all cases, equilibrium was verified by additional assays for samples that were incubated for extended times (up to approximately 4 hr), which gave the same unwinding profiles as those incubated for 1 hr.</p><p>Kinetic-unwinding assays of 12-bp dsRNA, A-form DNA, and B-form DNA duplexes by the helicase core were performed with the same fluorophore–quencher labeled probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) in the presence of 5 mM NTP (N = A, C, G, or U). In these assays, a change in the fluorescence of the labeled duplex was seen upon unwinding and subsequent re-annealing to form a duplex with an unlabeled strand of the same sequence without a quencher present in excess (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Annealing of these duplexes occurs within the dead time of mixing at the concentration of substrates used in these experiments. D1D2 (2 μM) was mixed with NTP-Mg<sup>2+</sup> (5 mM), labeled duplex (125 nM), and unlabeled duplex (500 nM) at 22°C in a reaction medium containing 20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Reactions were terminated at appropriate time points with 1 volume of stop buffer (50 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, 10% glycerol) and run in a non-denaturing 20% polyacrylamide at 22°C for 60 min. The fluorescence signal of duplex substrate was quantified by using a Typhoon imager (GE Healthcare) to measure the extent of unwinding/re-annealing. The apparent fraction of unwound duplex at various time points was quantified by using ImageJ and (where appropriate) fit to a first-order reaction to estimate an observed first-order rate constant (<italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Single strand nucleic acid binding assays in the presence of nucleotide</title><p>Equilibrium binding of A<sub>10</sub>-RNA and A<sub>10</sub>-DNA to D1D2 in increasing concentrations of NDP-BeF<sub>x</sub> was measured by fluorescence anisotropy using MBP-tagged protein to increase the change in anisotropy upon binding. 5′ FAM-labeled A<sub>10</sub>-RNA or A<sub>10</sub>-DNA (10 nM; IDT) was incubated with protein (2 μM) and increasing concentrations of NDP-BeF<sub>x</sub> (N = A, C, G, or U; 0 to 10 mM) at 22°C for at least 1 hr in a reaction medium containing 20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 0.1 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin.

Using structural and biochemical approaches on the DEAD-box helicase Mss116 that functions as a chaperone for the process of mitochondrial intron splicing, they show that this helicase can, in principle, bind both RNA and DNA, and a variety of nucleotides, but with a significant preference for A over the others. Crystal structures are presented of the Mss116 construct in complex with Berylium Fluoride and ADP, CDP, GDP and UDP. These structures go some way to delineate specific interactions that confer specificity for the adenine base and RNA, and show that these specificities are caused by rather small tweaks in the helicase core. Their results also suggest that the gamma phosphate of ATP pays a critical role in maintaining a 'closed state' conformation when engaging the nucleotide and RNA. The authors also show that, in addition to the known ability to bind duplex RNA, Mss116 is capable of binding to A-form double stranded DNA, but not DNA in the more common B-form, while the isolated C-terminal RecA domain (D2) can bind the B-form. Crystal structures are also presented of Mss116 in complex with A10 RNA and A10 DNA, showing a similar mechanism of interaction for both substrates.</p><p>In general, the paper is well written and the methodology is sound, and the experimental work, encompassing X-ray crystallography and in vitro binding and unwinding assays, is comprehensive. The Discussion is instructive and insightful. The figures are excellent and are very easy on the eye. Although the results are perhaps not ground breaking, the paper provides new, and in some aspects surprising, insight for a large and ubiquitous family of enzymes with central biological roles. The manuscript will thus be of interest to a diverse readership. There are a number of minor comments on specific points that will hopefully be helpful for the authors to consider, outlined below.</p><p>1) Is it clear that Mss116 functions in vivo in isolation, or is the enzyme's activity directed and dependent upon other partner proteins? How might this bear on the central conclusion of the Abstract and Discussion, regarding the apparent family-specific specificity? Many of the DExD-box proteins seem to have partners that strongly affect their activity.</p><p>2) A surprising finding is the ability of Mss116 to unwind pure DNA duplexes, provided these adopt A-form geometry. The unwinding is shown with ADP-BeFx, a non-hydrolysable ATP analog. It would be important to check whether unwinding is also seen with ATP, as several recent papers suggest that DEAD-box helicases, which have previously been considered as pure RNA helicases, might function on DNA.</p><p>3) Unwinding of RNA with all four nucleotide diphosphate beryllium fluoride compounds is also surprising. Here, again, it would be instructive to test unwinding with the nucleotide triphosphates. These results might be influenced by the affinity of binding to the nucleotide rather than the ability of the helicase to hydrolyse a particular nucleotide and simultaneously unwind the duplex, for example. In addition, the different triphosphates have been tested in unwinding assays for many DEAD-box helicases, and it appears that no unwinding has been reported with NTPs other than ATP. It would thus be important to sort out whether one should have tested these NTPs over a larger concentration range than examined, or whether the use of the diphosphate beryllium fluoride compounds somehow biases these experiments, as has been suggested, too. If a bias were to be found, this would not invalidate any of the points made, but add a further important facet to the story.</p><p>4) The authors report K<sub>d</sub> values for ADP-BeFx binding to Mss116 in the micromolar range. Binding of ADP-BeFx to Mss116 and RNA has recently been described by Liu et al. (Biochemistry, 2014, 53, 423–433). Although no K<sub>d</sub> values were reported there, the ADP-BeFx complex with Mss116 was very long-lived. It might be prudent to specifically verify that equilibrium was reached for the K<sub>d</sub> measurements, even after incubation of 1h. In addition, the paper by Liu et al. should probably be cited.</p><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> it might be helpful to extend the cartoon to include the final step in the unwinding cycle where the ATP is hydrolysed, and then the helicase re-enters the open state upon departure of the ADP, Pi and RNA.</p><p>6) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, perhaps it would be better to have the binding assay (Figure B) first, then the unwinding assay (A).</p><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: Label G128 in Figure B? Is the Q133 oriented such that the carbonyl is forced to be pointed at the O6 of the GDP?

Many of the DExD-box proteins seem to have partners that strongly affect their activity</italic>.</p><p>Mss116 by itself displays high unwinding activity in the absence of partner proteins in vitro, and functional studies give no indication that Mss116’s helicase activity is directed by or dependent upon a partner protein in vivo. Instead, Mss116 functions as a general RNA chaperone that binds diverse RNA and RNP substrates non-specifically and resolves kinetic traps that impede RNA folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Del Campo et al., 2009</xref>). In vivo, Mss116 is required for the efficient splicing of all 13 yeast mitochondrial group I and group II introns, as well as the translation of certain mRNAs and mitochondrial RNA processing reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang et al., 2005</xref>). The introns whose splicing is promoted by Mss116 differ structurally and rely on different intron-encoded maturases or nuclear gene-encoded splicing factors for structural stabilization. In vitro, purified Mss116 can by itself promote splicing of group II introns or function in the presence of a heterologous splicing factor, the <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> mitochondrial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (CYT-18 protein), to promote the splicing of a <italic>N. crassa</italic> group I intron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Del Campo et al., 2009</xref>). The lack of specificity required for Mss116 function in vivo is further indicated by the finding that all phenotypic defects in an <italic>mss116</italic>Δ strains can be rescued by the expression of the <italic>N. crassa</italic> CYT-19 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang et al., 2005</xref>), a related DEAD-box that also functions as general RNA chaperone (Mohr et al., 2002).</p><p>In addition to its function as a general RNA chaperone, Mss116 co-purifies with the yeast mt RNA polymerase (Markov et al., 2009) and may function as a transcription elongation factor for this enzyme (Markov et al., 2014). However, this function does not require the helicase activity (i.e., the ATPase or RNA-unwinding activities) of Mss116.</p><p>To address this comment, we have modified the Introduction to state that Mss116 binds diverse RNA substrates non-specifically and displays high RNA helicase activity in the absence of partner proteins.</p><p><italic>2) A surprising finding is the ability of Mss116 to unwind pure DNA duplexes, provided these adopt A-form geometry. The unwinding is shown with ADP-BeFx, a non-hydrolysable ATP analog. It would be important to check whether unwinding is also seen with ATP, as several recent papers suggest that DEAD-box helicases, which have previously been considered as pure RNA helicases, might function on DNA</italic>.</p><p>We performed additional kinetic unwinding assays, which demonstrate that Mss116 can use ATP to unwind the RNA duplex and the A-DNA duplex substrates with observed first-order rate constants (<italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub>) of 0.46 and 0.15 min<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. However, we do not observe unwinding of the B-DNA duplex with ATP. This is the same unwinding trend that we observed with ADP-BeF<sub>x</sub>. The kinetic unwinding assays have been added to the Results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5– figure supplement 3</xref>) and to the Methods sections, along with references to recent papers suggesting DEAD-box helicases might function on DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kammel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tuteja et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) Unwinding of RNA with all four nucleotide diphosphate beryllium fluoride compounds is also surprising. Here, again, it would be instructive to test unwinding with the nucleotide triphosphates. These results might be influenced by the affinity of binding to the nucleotide, rather than the ability of the helicase to hydrolyse a particular nucleotide and simultaneously unwind the duplex, for example. In addition, the different triphosphates have been tested in unwinding assays for many DEAD-box helicases, and it appears that no unwinding has been reported with NTPs other than ATP. It would thus be important to sort out whether one should have tested these NTPs over a larger concentration range than examined, or whether the use of the diphosphate beryllium fluoride compounds somehow biases these experiments, as has been suggested, too. If a bias were to be found, this would not invalidate any of the points made, but add a further important facet to the story</italic>.</p><p>We performed kinetic unwinding assays, as in point 2, to compare the unwinding of the 12-bp RNA duplex catalyzed by ATP to CTP, GTP and UTP, which are documented in the Methods and reported in the Results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>). These assays demonstrate that NTPs other than ATP do not promote unwinding of the RNA duplex even with the other NTPs added at 5 mM concentration. We also performed these kinetic unwinding assays in a different buffer with 0.5 mM free Mg<sup>2+</sup>, as previous data indicates that the unwinding activity of Mss116 increases at lower Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Halls et al., 2007</xref>). However, we still found no unwinding for CTP, GTP or UTP under these conditions. These findings suggest that the closed state with ssRNA and nucleotide triphosphates other than ATP does not form and catalyse the unwinding of the RNA duplex used in these assays. Use of the diphosphate beryllium fluoride analogues is therefore necessary to access and stabilize the closed-states that promote unwinding with other nucleotide bases.</p><p><italic>4) The authors report K</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> <italic>values for ADP-BeFx binding to Mss116 in the micromolar range. Binding of ADP-BeF<sub>x</sub> to Mss116 and RNA has recently been described by Liu et al. (Biochemistry, 2014, 53, 423–433). Although no K</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> <italic>values were reported there, the ADP-BeF<sub>x</sub> complex with Mss116 was very long-lived.

In addition, the paper by Liu et al. should probably be cited</italic>.</p><p>We had verified that equilibrium was reached in all our experiments by carrying out assays for extend times (up to approximately 4 h), which gave the same binding or unwinding profiles as those incubated for 1 h. This information has been incorporated into the Methods section. We note that the protein (full-length Mss116 in Liu et al. versus the helicase core in our study), RNA substrates, and reaction conditions differ between the two studies. We have cited the paper by Liu et al. as example of the different behaviors of ATP analogues.</p><p><italic>5) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1D</italic></xref> <italic>it might be helpful to extend the cartoon to include the final step in the unwinding cycle where the ATP is hydrolysed, and then the helicase re-enters the open state upon departure of the ADP, P<sub>i</sub> and RNA</italic>.</p><p>We have added this step final step in the unwinding cycle to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>.</p><p><italic>6) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref><italic>, perhaps it would be better to have the binding assay (Figure B) first, then the unwinding assay (A)</italic>.</p><p>In the current version of the manuscript, the panels that display the unwinding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) appear in the figure in the order that they are mentioned in the text.</p><p><italic>7)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>: Label G128 in Figure B?

Protein cores that remain mostly in the open state under the SEC conditions have a A<sub>260</sub>/A<sub>280</sub> ratio much closer to that of the free protein.
