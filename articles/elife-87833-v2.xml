The actin cytoskeleton plays essential roles in BCR signaling. Upon encountering cell-surface antigens, actin-driven B-cell spreading amplifies signaling, while B-cell contraction following spreading leads to signal attenuation. However, the mechanism by which actin dynamics switch BCR signaling from amplification to attenuation is unknown. Here, we show that Arp2/3-mediated branched actin polymerization is required for mouse splenic B-cell contraction. Contracting B-cells generate centripetally moving actin foci from lamellipodial F-actin networks in the plasma membrane region contacting antigen-presenting surfaces. Actin polymerization driven by N-WASP, but not WASP, initiates these actin foci and facilitates non-muscle myosin II recruitment to the contact zone, creating actomyosin ring-like structures. B-cell contraction increases BCR molecular density in individual clusters, leading to decreased BCR phosphorylation. Increased BCR molecular density reduced levels of the stimulatory kinase Syk, the inhibitory phosphatase SHIP-1, and their phosphorylated forms in individual BCR clusters. These results suggest that N-WASP-activated Arp2/3, coordinating with myosin, generates centripetally moving foci and contractile actomyosin ring-like structures from lamellipodial networks, enabling contraction. B-cell contraction attenuates BCR signaling by pushing out both stimulatory kinases and inhibitory phosphatases from BCR clusters, providing novel insights into actin-facilitated signal attenuation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>actin cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>signal transduction</kwd><kwd>lymphocytes</kwd><kwd>B-cell receptor</kwd><kwd>N-WASP</kwd><kwd>Arp2/3</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI122205</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Upadhyaya</surname><given-names>Arpita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM064625</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Wenxia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>B-cells generate inner actomyosin foci from lamellipodial actin networks to drive cell contraction on antigen-presenting surfaces, which causes signaling molecule disassociation from B-cell receptor clusters and signal attenuation.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>B-cell-mediated antibody responses are essential for eliminating invading pathogens. BCRs expressed on the B-cell surface detect the presence of cognate antigens. The binding of antigens to the BCR leads to the activation of signaling cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Reth and Wienands, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dal Porto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kwak et al., 2019</xref>), which induce transcriptional programs that prepare B-cells for proliferation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kurosaki et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shlomchik et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). BCR signaling also induces rapid antigen internalization, processing, and presentation for T-cell recognition, which provides the second signal required for B-cell clonal expansion and differentiation to high-affinity antibody-secreting cells and memory B-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Song et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gitlin et al., 2014</xref>). BCR signaling is tightly regulated by various external and internal factors to activate antibody responses that are specific and also qualitatively and quantitatively matched to the encountered antigen.</p><p>Antigen-induced receptor reorganization activates BCRs at the B-cell surface. Antigen binding leads to BCR clustering at lipid rafts, which enables raft-resident kinases, such as the Src kinases Lyn and Fyn, to phosphorylate immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) in the cytoplasmic domains of the BCR signaling subunit CD79a/b heterodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Reth, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pierce, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sohn et al., 2008</xref>). Doubly phosphorylated ITAMs recruit and activate spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), which in turn activates multiple downstream signaling pathways, including phospholipase Cγ2 (PLCγ2), Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (Btk), Ras-GTPase, and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K), initiating signaling cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kurosaki, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dal Porto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tanaka and Baba, 2020</xref>). Signaling activation also induces the recruitment and activation of inhibitory phosphatases, such as SH2-containing tyrosine phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) and phosphatidylinositol-5 phosphatase-1 (SHIP-1), to BCR signaling complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brauweiler et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gross et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Franks and Cambier, 2018</xref>). SHIP-1 and SHP-1 negatively regulate BCR signaling by inactivating the plasma membrane docking lipids for stimulatory kinases, such as Btk and Akt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolland et al., 1998</xref>) and dephosphorylating the BCR and its downstream signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mizuno et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adachi et al., 2001</xref>), respectively. The interplay between the stimulatory kinases and the inhibitory phosphatases controls the balance of antibody responses against pathogens and self. Deficiencies in stimulatory kinases by mutations, such as Btk, cause X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kinnon et al., 1993</xref>), while deficiencies in the inhibitory phosphatases SHP-1 or SHIP-1 result in autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Leung et al., 2013</xref>). However, the mechanisms by which BCR signaling attenuation is initiated and regulated remain elusive.</p><p>B-cells encounter both soluble and membrane-associated antigens in vivo. Membrane-associated antigens include antigens on antigen-presenting cells, like follicular dendritic cells in B-cell follicles or germinal centers, and pathogenic cells, like bacteria, parasites, and cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Batista and Harwood, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Depoil et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gonzalez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cyster, 2010</xref>). The binding of multi-valent soluble antigen and membrane-associated antigen with any valency induces dynamic reorganization of surface BCRs into microclusters, triggering BCR signaling. Subsequently, surface BCRs continue moving to the plasma membrane region contacting antigen-presenting surfaces or to one B-cell pole in the case of soluble antigen, which leads to the growth and merger of BCR microclusters and the formation of immunological synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carrasco et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harwood and Batista, 2010</xref>) or supra-molecular activation complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Unanue and Karnovsky, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schreiner and Unanue, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tolar et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harwood and Batista, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Multiple mechanisms have been proposed for signaling initiation by antigen-induced surface BCR reorganization. The binding of surface BCRs to membrane-associated antigen has been shown to induce a conformational change in the BCR extracellular domain, exposing a proximal membrane region of membrane IgM that promotes receptor clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tolar et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shen et al., 2019</xref>). Antigen-binding also changes the conformation of the BCR cytoplasmic domains from a closed to an open form, facilitating the recruitment of signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tolar et al., 2005</xref>). Alternatively, antigen-BCR interaction can increase the molecular spacing of BCRs in clusters, facilitating BCR interaction with signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yang and Reth, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kläsener et al., 2014</xref>). The inhibitory phosphatases SHP-1 and SHIP-1 are also recruited to BCR clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adachi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Seeley-Fallen et al., 2014</xref>). However, the mechanisms underlying phosphatase recruitment and its relationship with BCR signaling activation complexes are unknown.</p><p>The actin cytoskeleton is essential for antigen-induced BCR reorganization on the B-cell surface in response to both soluble and membrane-associated antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harwood and Batista, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Song et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hoogeboom and Tolar, 2016</xref>). Early signaling of the BCR triggers transient actin depolymerization via Rap GTPase and its downstream target cofilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Freeman et al., 2011</xref>), which disassembles the existing cortical actin network that confines the lateral movement of surface BCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Treanor et al., 2010</xref>). Following this transient depolymerization, BCR signaling activates rapid actin polymerization through the actin nucleation-promoting factors Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein (WASP) and neuronal-WASP (N-WASP), modulating BCR mobility and leading to F-actin accumulation at BCR-antigen interaction sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rey-Suarez et al., 2020</xref>). Actin polymerization and treadmilling in B-cells stimulated by soluble antigens drive surface BCRs to cluster and move to one pole of the B-cell, forming a BCR cap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schreiner and Unanue, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2012a</xref>). Upon interacting with membrane-associated antigens, B-cells organize actin into two dynamic structures. One treadmills outwards, driving B-cell membrane spreading and expanding the B-cell membrane region contacting the antigen-presenting surface (contact zone), which enables more BCRs to engage antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolger-Munro et al., 2019</xref>). The other creates retrograde flow towards the center of the B-cell contact zone, driving the centripetal movement and growth of BCR microclusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2012b</xref>). Together, these processes amplify BCR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Batista et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harwood and Batista, 2011</xref>). The extent of B-cell spreading and the amount of BCR-antigen complexes gathered in the contact zone depend on BCR binding affinity and the density of antigen on the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fleire et al., 2006</xref>). Subsequent to spreading, B-cells contract, reducing the contact area, which drives BCR microclusters to merge into central clusters to form immunological synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fleire et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2013a</xref>).</p><p>The actin cytoskeleton closely interplays with BCR signaling. We have previously shown that mouse primary B-cells with Btk deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2011</xref>) or double knockouts of the actin nucleation-promoting factors WASP and N-WASP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2013a</xref>) fail to spread on antigen-presenting surfaces and establish stable interactions with membrane-associated antigen, drastically reducing BCR signaling. Btk can activate WASP and N-WASP through Vav, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor of Cdc42 and Rac, and phosphatidylinositol-5 kinase that generates phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate (PI4,5P<sub>2</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sharma et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Padrick and Rosen, 2010</xref>). Surprisingly, B-cell-specific knockout of N-WASP (cNKO) but not <italic>Wasp</italic> germline knockout (WKO) enhances B-cell spreading, delays B-cell contraction, and inhibits the centralization of BCR clusters at the contact zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2013a</xref>). Consistent with these findings, Bolger-Munro et al. have shown that knockdown of the actin nucleation factor Arp2/3 downstream of WASP and N-WASP disrupts the dynamic actin reorganization induced by membrane-associated antigen required for BCR microcluster growth and merger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolger-Munro et al., 2019</xref>). Using B-cell-specific and germline knockouts, we showed that in addition to N-WASP, the actin motor non-muscle myosin IIA (NMIIA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Seeley-Fallen et al., 2022</xref>) and the actin-binding adaptor protein Abp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Seeley-Fallen et al., 2014</xref>) are required for B-cell contraction and BCR central cluster formation. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2022</xref> recently showed that in the presence of the adhesion molecule ICAM on the antigen-presenting surface, B-cells form contractile actomyosin arcs, driving centripetal movement of BCR clusters in the B-cell contact zone. Together, these findings indicate a critical role of different actin networks in B-cell contraction and BCR signaling.</p><p>Our previous studies demonstrate that B-cell contraction is critical for BCR signaling attenuation. Delay or inhibition of B-cell contraction due to deficiencies in actin regulators, N-WASP, Abp1, or NMIIA, prolongs and/or increases BCR signaling by enhancing the activation of stimulatory kinases and suppressing the activation of inhibitory phosphatases, which elevates the production of autoantibody levels in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Seeley-Fallen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Seeley-Fallen et al., 2022</xref>). N-WASP and NMIIA are not known to interact with kinases and phosphatases directly. The growth, merger, and centralization of antigen-BCR complexes at the B-cell contact zone during the B-cell contraction phase are associated with reduced BCR signaling capability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2013a</xref>). These findings suggest that B-cell contraction is one of the mechanisms for inducing BCR signaling attenuation. However, how the actin cytoskeleton facilitates the transition of the spreading to the contraction phase and how B-cell contraction switches BCR signaling from amplification to attenuation is unknown.</p><p>This study explores the mechanisms by which the actin cytoskeleton remodels from spreading lamellipodia to contractile structures and by which B-cell contraction suppresses BCR signaling. Our results show that the contractile actomyosin structures responsible for B-cell contraction originate from branched actin at spreading lamellipodia. N-WASP/Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization prolongs the lifetime of the lamellipodial actin structures, enables NMIIA recruitment, and drives their movement to the center of the B-cell contact zone. B-cell contraction increases the molecular density within individual BCR-antigen clusters, which promotes the disassociation of both the stimulatory kinase Syk and the inhibitory phosphatases SHIP-1 from BCR clusters, leading to signal attenuation. Our study reveals a new mechanism underlying BCR signal downregulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Arp2/3, activated by N-WASP but not WASP, is required for B-cell contraction</title><p>Arp2/3-generated branched F-actin is known to drive lamellipodial expansion for B-cell spreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolger-Munro et al., 2019</xref>). However, whether branched F-actin is involved in the subsequent contraction phase is unknown. To address this, we perturbed the polymerization of branched F-actin using the Arp2/3 inhibitor CK-666 (50 µM) while using its inactive derivative CK-689 as a control. Pre-warmed splenic B-cells from WT C57BL/6 mice were incubated with monobiotinylated Fab’ fragment of anti-mouse IgM + G attached to planar lipid bilayers (Fab’-PLB) by biotin-streptavidin interaction and imaged live at 37 <sup>o</sup>C using interference reflection microscopy (IRM). The contact area of B-cells treated with CK-689 rapidly increased upon contacting Fab’-PLB and reached a maximum level at ≥0.5 min after the initial contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1A</xref>). Following maximal spreading, most B-cells reduced the area of their contact zone, indicating contraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1A</xref>). We classified a B-cell as contracting if its contact zone area is reduced by ≥5% for at least 10 s after reaching a maximum value. Based on the average timing for B-cell maximal spreading, we treated B-cells with CK-666 at the beginning of the incubation (Time 0), before B-cell spreading initiation, or at 2 min, when all B-cells had already spread. The effectiveness of CK-666 was detected by reduced Arp2/3 staining in the contact zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

We visualized F-actin by phalloidin staining and compared F-actin organization in the contact zone of B-cells at the spreading (2 min) and contraction (4 min) phases using TIRF. While B-cells in both spreading and contraction phases exhibited phalloidin staining outlining the contact zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref><italic>, green arrows</italic>), only B-cells in the contracting phase showed interior phalloidin patches brighter than the phalloidin staining at the periphery of the contact zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref><italic>, purple arrows</italic>). These F-actin patches were organized into a ring-like structure and resided ~1 μm behind the spreading front, surrounding an F-actin-poor center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref><italic>, purple arrows</italic>). Here, we refer to these F-actin patches as inner F-actin foci. We identified inner F-actin foci based on whether their peak fluorescence intensity (FI) was ≥twofold of the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of phalloidin in the no-foci area, had diameters of ≥250 nm, and were located 1 µm away from the edge of the contact zone. We found that such inner F-actin foci were detected in &gt;60% of B-cells in the contracting phase (4 min) but only in &lt;20% of B-cells in the spreading phase (2 min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Analysis of these kymographs showed that most F-actin foci were first detected closely behind lamellipodial F-actin networks. Following maximal spreading, these F-actin foci moved centripetally while increasing in intensity, becoming inner F-actin foci, in cells transitioning from spreading to contraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, top panel, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, such centripetally moving F-actin foci were not detected in B-cells that did not undergo contraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, middle panel) and WKO B-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, bottom panel).

To examine the temporal relationship between the generation of lamellipodia-derived inner F-actin foci and contraction, we plotted the percentage of kymographs with lamellipodia-derived inner F-actin foci over time with the spreading to contracting transition time set as 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

The clustering of AF546-Fab’ on PLB by B-cell binding reflects surface BCR clustering, as B-cell binding to transferrin (Tf)-tethered PLB does not cause surface BCRs to cluster and be phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2013a</xref>).

Inhibition of B-cell contraction by cNKO reduced the AF546-Fab’ peak FI in individual clusters, maintaining it within a relatively low range, where the MFI ratios of pCD79a to AF546-Fab’ increased with the AF546-Fab’ peak FI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>).

We measured MFI ratios of Syk relative to AF546-Fab’ in individual BCR clusters to reflect the relative amount of Syk associated with individual BCR clusters and analyzed their relationship with AF546-Fab’ peak FI (reflecting the molecular density within BCR clusters). AF546-Fab’ clusters were detected and analyzed as described above.

We previously showed that B-cell contraction after spreading on antigen-presenting surfaces promotes BCR signaling attenuation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Seeley-Fallen et al., 2022</xref>). However, how the actin cytoskeleton reorganizes as B-cells transition from spreading to contraction and how B-cell contraction downregulates BCR signaling have been elusive. Here, we demonstrate that inner F-actin foci formed at the contact zone distal to the lamellipodial F-actin network promote B-cells to switch from spreading to contraction. These inner foci are derived from the lamellipodial F-actin network that mediates spreading, are generated by N-WASP- but not WASP-activated Arp2/3-mediated branched actin polymerization, and facilitate NMII recruitment. N-WASP-activated actin polymerization coordinates with NMII to form actomyosin ring-like structures, enabling B-cell contraction. B-cell contraction increases BCR molecular density in existing clusters, which promotes the disassociation of both the stimulatory kinase Syk and the inhibitory phosphatase SHIP-1, leading to signaling attenuation.</p><p>One significant finding of this study is that Arp2/3-mediated polymerization of branched actin is required for B-cell contraction. Arp2/3-mediated branched actin polymerization is known to drive B-cell spreading and to create actin centripetal flow at the contact zone between B-cells and antigen-presenting surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolger-Munro et al., 2019</xref>). The actin structure that supports B- and T-cell spreading to form the immunological synapse with antigen-presenting cells is similar to lamellipodial F-actin networks found in adherent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bunnell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koestler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolger-Munro et al., 2019</xref>). Lamellipodial F-actin networks consist primarily of branched actin filaments polymerizing against the plasma membrane interspersed with bundled actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Krause and Gautreau, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Skau and Waterman, 2015</xref>). Contractile actin structures, such as stress fibers, are typically generated from bundled actin filaments, as observed in adherent and migrating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Levayer and Lecuit, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tojkander et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hammer et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we show that inner F-actin foci, generated by Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization, transition B-cells from spreading to contraction. Furthermore, these inner F-actin foci are directly derived from lamellipodial F-actin networks. Based on the observed dynamics, we infer that instead of polymerizing against the plasma membrane, Arp2/3 appears to nucleate actin polymerization in the opposite direction, sustaining actin foci and their movement away from the lamellipodia. The natural retraction of lamellipodia may contribute to B-cell contraction, but the requirement of inner actin foci argues against it as a primary mechanism for B-cell contraction. This study does not exclude the involvement of bundled actin filaments. Based on the requirement of formin-activated bundled actin filaments for lamellipodial F-actin networks and B-cell spreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2022</xref>), we can speculate that bundled actin filaments may play a role in the formation and movement of these inner F-actin foci, as well as in NMII recruitment.</p><p>Our work provides new insights into distinct functions of the actin nucleation-promoting factors WASP and N-WASP in controlling cell morphology and signaling. Immune cells, including B-cells, express both hematopoietic-specific WASP and the ubiquitous homolog of WASP, N-WASP. These two share high sequence homology, activation mechanism, and Arp2/3 activation function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Padrick and Rosen, 2010</xref>). We previously identified distinct functions of these two factors unique to B-cells. While both are required for B-cell spreading, N-WASP plays a unique role in B-cell contraction. <italic>Wasp</italic> and <italic>N-wasp</italic> double knockout B-cells fail to spread on antigen-presenting surfaces, but B-cell-specific <italic>N-wasp</italic> knockout enhances B-cell spreading and delays B-cell contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2013a</xref>). WASP and N-WASP appear to have a competitive relationship in B-cells, suppressing each other’s activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2013a</xref>). WASP is activated first during B-cell spreading and is primarily localized at the periphery of the B-cell contact zone. N-WASP is activated later during B-cell contraction and scattered across the B-cell contact zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2013a</xref>). Here, we reveal the exact role of N-WASP in B-cell contraction – to generate inner F-actin foci from lamellipodial F-actin networks by activating Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization. N-WASP- but not WASP-activated actin polymerization prolongs the relative lifetime of F-actin foci and facilitates their inward motion toward the center of the contact zone. The delayed activation time and the location in the interior of the contact zone likely give N-WASP a unique opportunity to generate inner F-actin foci. As cNKO only delays and reduces but does not block B-cell contraction and inner F-actin foci formation, other actin factors may be involved, such as the WASP-family verprolin-homologous protein (WAVE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rotty et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Our recently published data show that NMII is required for B-cell contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Seeley-Fallen et al., 2022</xref>). Activated NMII is recruited to the B-cell contact zone in a SHIP-1-dependent manner. NMII levels reach a plateau at the beginning of B-cell contraction, and NMII forms a peripheral ring surrounding the contact zone during B-cell contraction. Here, we further show that in addition to SHIP-1, N-WASP but not WASP is also involved in NMII recruitment and NMII ring-like structure formation, probably by initiating the generation of inner F-actin foci. Collectively, these findings suggest that SHIP-1 coordinates with N-WASP to recruit NMII. Our previous finding that SHIP-1 promotes B-cell contraction by facilitating N-WASP activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2013a</xref>) supports this notion. However, it is surprising that the recruitment of NMII activated by BCR signaling to the contact zone is associated with inhibitory signaling molecules. BCR downstream signaling, including Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes and Rho-family GTPase activation, likely activates NMII motor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vicente-Manzanares et al., 2009</xref>). The activation switches NMII from the incompetent folded conformation to the competent extended conformation, enabling NMII molecules to bind to F-actin and assemble into contractible bipolar filaments and stacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Matsumura, 2005</xref>). A denser F-actin organization has been shown to increase NMII filament stacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fenix and Burnette, 2018</xref>). Here, we showed that the inner F-actin foci generated by N-WASP-activated Arp2/3 are more stable and denser and thus likely promote NMII binding and stacking more efficiently than F-actin generated by WASP-activated Arp2/3. Indeed, our kymograph analysis revealed similar time windows and spatial locations for NMII accumulation and for generating inner F-actin foci from lamellipodial F-actin, supporting our hypothesis. While NMII recruitment is facilitated by inner F-actin foci, the motor activity of NMII is required for the formation of the ring-like structures of inner F-actin foci in return, likely by driving their centripetal movement, thereby providing mechanical feedback for actin reorganization. However, the structural organization of inner F-actin foci and recruited NMII and their coordinated dynamics require further analysis with higher-resolution microscopy techniques.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2022</xref> recently showed that B-cells generate actomyosin arcs when interacting with membrane-associated antigen in the presence of adhesion molecules expressed on professional antigen-presenting cells. In contrast to T-cells, B-cells can also respond to membrane-associated antigens without the help of adhesion molecules, when engaging antigens on pathogenic cells, like bacteria, parasites, and cancer cells. While the relationship between actomyosin arcs and inner F-actin foci remains to be explored, the coordinated formation of inner F-actin foci and NMII ring-like structures revealed in our study suggests that these structures are likely the precursors of actomyosin arcs. These structures can potentially be enhanced and matured by adhesion molecule interactions between B-cells and antigen-presenting membranes.</p><p>Our findings suggest an increase in the molecular density within BCR clusters or B-cell synapses as one of the mechanisms by which B-cell contraction promotes BCR signaling attenuation. During contraction, the molecular density of individual BCR clusters, measured by their MFI and peak FI of BCR clustered Fab’, increased faster than during the spreading and post-contraction phases. Surprisingly, increases in molecular density induced disassociation of both the stimulatory kinase Syk and the inhibitory phosphatase SHIP-1, contradicting the existing dogma of sequential association of stimulatory and inhibitory signaling molecules with the BCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Franks and Cambier, 2018</xref>). Interestingly, the disassociation of SHIP-1 is much more sensitive to BCR molecular density than Syk disassociation. Syk does not disassociate until the molecular density of BCR clusters reaches the top 10% range, while SHIP-1 disassociates from BCR clusters with increases over the entire detectable range of molecular densities. When B-cell contraction is inhibited, the molecular density of BCR clusters is reduced to a range with limited Syk disassociation and normal SHIP-1 disassociation, probably resulting in higher Syk to SHIP-1 molecular ratios in BCR clusters than contracting B-cells, increasing BCR signaling levels. The consistency of the data from AF546-Fab’ and pSyk or pSHIP-1 clusters supports this notion. However, the resolution of our widefield TIRF imaging limited our ability to examine nascent BCR clusters that actively recruit signaling molecules. Available antibodies did not allow us to simultaneously stain Syk and SHIP-1 or their phosphorylated forms and determine their relative levels in the same cluster. The timing and dynamics of Syk and SHIP-1 recruitment to individual BCR clusters and the direct relationship between Syk and SHIP-1 association and disassociation with BCR clusters and their phosphorylation remain to be further investigated.</p><p>How the molecular density within BCR clusters promotes disassociation of signaling molecules is unknown. We speculate that molecular crowding may displace signaling molecules out of BCR clusters. Supporting this possibility, disassociation of the 145 kDa SHIP-1 is likely to be more sensitive to changes in the molecular density of BCR clusters, compared to disassociation of the 72 kDa Syk. However, these hypotheses need to be further examined. An interesting finding of this study is that the pCD79a and pSyk levels were higher in individual BCR clusters of cNKO B-cells than those of flox control B-cells, even when BCR clusters had similar molecular densities. These data suggest additional mechanisms for B-cell contraction to promote BCR signaling attenuation. In addition to increasing molecular density within BCR clusters, the contractile forces generated by actomyosin rings on the B-cell membrane and BCR clusters may cause changes to the conformations of both BCRs and associated signaling molecules and their lateral interactions in the membrane. These changes may favor the disassociation rather than the association of signaling molecules with BCR clusters. Recently solved molecular assembly structures of both human and mouse BCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dong et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Su et al., 2022</xref>) support conformational and lateral molecular interaction changes as possible mechanisms for BCR signaling regulation. Similar to the differential impact of the molecular density on the disassociation of Syk and SHIP-1 from BCR clusters, B-cell contraction may differentially affect the interaction of surface BCRs with cytoplasmic and membrane-anchored signaling molecules, such as the lipidated and lipid raft-resident Src kinase Lyn that is responsible for phosphorylating both the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) of CD79a and the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) that SHIP-1 binds to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Franks and Cambier, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Following antigen-induced BCR signaling at immunological synapses, B-cells internalize BCR-captured antigen for processing and presentation. Actomyosin is required for BCR-mediated endocytosis of antigens, particularly surface- and membrane-associated antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Natkanski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hoogeboom et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maeda et al., 2021</xref>). NMII-mediated traction forces pull BCR-bound antigen off presenting surfaces for endocytosis in an affinity-dependent manner. We have previously shown that when antigens are tightly attached to a surface, high-affinity binding of the BCR to antigens tears the B-cell membrane in an NMII-dependent manner, which triggers lysosome exocytosis and lysosomal enzyme-mediated cleavages of antigen from the associated surface, allowing antigen endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maeda et al., 2021</xref>). While actomyosin plays essential roles in both B-cell contraction and the subsequent antigen endocytosis, whether the actomyosin structure responsible for B-cell contraction also mediates BCR endocytosis remains an interesting and open question. Our early finding that N-WASP is required for BCR endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2013a</xref>) supports this notion. BCR endocytosis can reduce B-cell surface signaling by removing the BCR from the cell surface, transitioning the BCR into an intracellular signaling state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chaturvedi et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The results presented here have revealed novel insights into the mechanisms underlying actin-facilitated signaling attenuation of the BCR. Taking the previous and current data of our and other labs together, we propose a new working model for such actin-mediated signaling downregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Upon encountering membrane-associated antigens, such as antigen presented by follicular dendritic cells and on the surfaces of pathogens, mature follicular B-cells undergo rapid spreading, primarily driven by WASP-mediated branched actin polymerization, which maximizes B-cell contact with antigen-presenting surfaces and BCR-antigen engagement, amplifying signaling. Following maximal spreading, N-WASP distal to lamellipodial networks activates Arp2/3-mediated branched actin polymerization, which initiates the formation of inner F-actin foci from lamellipodia towards the center of the B-cell contact zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). NMII is then preferentially recruited to these relatively stable inner foci, which promotes the centripetal movement of inner F-actin foci and the maturation of ring-like actomyosin structures, enabling B-cell contraction. B-cell contraction pushes the BCR microclusters formed during B-cell spreading to the center of the contact zone, increasing their molecular density. Increased molecular density promotes the disassociation of signaling molecules from BCR clusters, probably due to crowding and conformational changes, leading to signal downregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Inhibitory signaling molecules likely activate the actin reorganization that drives B-cell contraction by promoting the activation and recruitment of NMII to the B-cell contact zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Seeley-Fallen et al., 2022</xref>) by hitherto unknown mechanisms. The actomyosin structures responsible for B-cell contraction may further drive B-cells to internalize engaged antigen, further downregulating signaling at the B-cell surface and initiating antigen processing and presentation. Thus, actin reorganization downstream of inhibitory phosphatases reinforces signaling attenuation by driving B-cell contraction.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>A working model for cell contraction-mediated B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling attenuation.</title><p>When encountering membrane-associated antigen, mature follicular B-cells undergo rapid spreading, primarily driven by WASP-mediated branched actin polymerization, which maximizes B-cell contact with antigen-presenting surface and BCR-antigen engagement, amplifying signaling.

Splenic B-cells were pretreated with Bleb for 20 min before and during incubation with Fab’-PLB.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Analysis of the actin cytoskeleton</title><p>F-actin was visualized by phalloidin staining in fixed cells and by LifeAct-GFP or LifeAct-RFP expressed by primary B-cells from transgenic mice in live cells. Inner F-actin foci, visualized by both phalloidin staining and LifeAct-GFP, were identified using Fiji ImageJ based on the following three criteria: (1) ≥250 nm in diameter, (2) peak FI ≥twofold higher than the FI of a nearby area containing no foci, and (3) ≥1 µm away from the outer edge of the B-cell contact zone. The horizontal or vertical length of a focus was measured, and the lesser of the two values was used as its diameter. To analyze the spatiotemporal relationship between inner F-actin foci and the lamellipodial F-actin network, we generated 8 radially and equally spaced kymographs from each cell using time-lapse images and MATLAB [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode9">Source code 9</xref>]. Each kymograph was either classified as contracting or not contracting based on the movement of the leading edge of the B-cell contact zone. The percentage of eight kymographs from each cell exhibiting inner F-actin foci that could be traced back to lamellipodial F-actin when the B-cell switched from spreading to contraction was determined.</p><p>The relative speeds and lifetimes of F-actin foci were determined using three kymographs from each B-cell (positioned to track as many inner F-actin foci as possible) and F-actin foci emerging during a 60 s window right after B-cell maximal spreading. Only those remaining visible in individual kymographs for at least 4 s were analyzed. The time duration of each F-actin focus detected in a kymograph was used to determine the relative lifetime. The distances individual F-actin foci moved during their lifetimes were used to determine the relative speed. The term ‘relative’ has been used because the disappearance of an F-actin focus could be due to its movement away from the region used for the kymograph or vertically from the TIRF evanescent field of excitation.</p><p>To determine the rate of myosin recruitment, GFP-NMIIA MFI in the B-cell contact zone was plotted over time, and the slope for the initial segment of the MFI versus the time plot was determined using linear regression. The percentage of B-cells with the NMIIA ring was determined by visual inspection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Analysis of BCR-Fab’ clusters</title><p>BCR clusters were identified by clustering of AF546-Fab’ on PLBs using custom code by MATLAB [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode10">Source code 10</xref>]. We utilized the median FI of the Fab’-PLB within the same area outside but near the B-cell contact zone as the background. The median, but not the mean FI value, was used for background FI calculations to minimize fluctuations due to debris. To ensure that individual clusters with varying FI were detected as distinct objects, we used 16 graded thresholds from 1.1 to 4.1 fold of the background (0.2 fold apart) to acquire 16 sets of binary masks for each frame of time-lapse images from each cell. When clusters were detected by multiple thresholds at the same location, only the one identified by the highest threshold was retained. Objects that were smaller than 250 nm in diameter or could not be tracked for at least 20 s were eliminated. This allowed us to detect the position of BCR-Fab’ clusters and track them over time until they merged with other clusters. The horizontal or vertical length of a focus was measured, and the lesser of the two values was used as its diameter. We chose the peak FI as a metric for the extent of Fab’ clustering by the BCR, because it does not rely on the area occupied by each cluster. The rate of peak FI increase was determined by linear regression of peak FI versus time curves for each cluster for a given window of time.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>BCR signaling</title><p>Splenic B-cells were incubated with AF546-Fab’-PLB at 37 °C and fixed at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 min. After fixation, cells were stained for phosphorylated CD79a (pCD79a, Y182) (Cell Signaling Technology), Syk (pSyk, Y519/520) (Cell Signaling Technology), SHIP-1 (pSHIP-1, Y1020) (Cell Signaling Technology), or total Syk or SHIP-1 proteins (Thermo Fisher Scientific). We identified BCR-Fab’ clusters as described. We determined the peak FI of AF546-Fab’ and the MFI of AF546-Fab’, pCD79a, pSyk, pSHIP-1, Syk, or SHIP-1 within each cluster. The ratio of pCD79a MFI to AF546-Fab’ MFI in the same cluster was used to estimate the relative phosphorylation level of BCRs in that cluster. This MFI ratio was plotted against AF546-Fab’ peak FI to analyze the relationship between BCR phosphorylation and BCR density of individual clusters. We calculated the MFI ratio of Syk to Fab’ or SHIP-1 to Fab’ in individual clusters to estimate the relative recruitment level of Syk or SHIP-1 to BCR clusters. We plotted these MFI ratios against Fab’ peak FI to determine the relationship between Syk and SHIP-1 recruitment levels and BCR density in individual clusters. We calculated the MFI ratio of pSyk to Fab’ or pSHIP-1 to Fab’ to estimate the amount of pSyk or pSHIP-1 relative to BCR in individual clusters. We plotted these MFI ratios against Fab’ peak FI to determine the relationship between Syk or SHIP-1 phosphorylation and BCR density in individual clusters. We identified pSyk or pSHIP-1 puncta using the criteria: ≥1.3 fold of the background staining outside the B-cell contact zone and ≥250 nm in diameter. We calculated the MFI ratio of pSyk to Fab’ or pSHIP-1 to Fab’ in individual puncta to estimate the amount of pSyk or pSHIP-1 relative to BCR in individual puncta. We plotted these MFI ratios against Fab’ peak FI to determine the relationship between Syk or SHIP-1 phosphorylation and BCR density in individual puncta. We determined the fraction of clusters with graded increases in Fab’ peak FI (every 20 FI units) out of the total to analyze the distribution of clusters with different Fab’ peak FI. We also determine the average MFI ratios of pCD79a, Syk, pSyk, SHIP-1, and pSHIP-1 relative to Fab’ in each graded cluster population. We further divided AF546-Fab’ clusters into three populations based on their peak AF546-Fab’ FI, relatively low (&lt;190), medium (190-280), and high (&gt;280, detected only in contracted cells) and compared the MFI ratios of pCD79a, pSyk, pSHIP-1, Syk, and SHIP-1 relatively to AF546-Fab’ among the three populations using statistical analysis described below. The data were generated from three independent experiments with 20~23 (60~69 total) cells and 125~140 individual clusters (1500~1680 total) per condition, per time point, and per experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney U non-parametric test for unpaired groups having different sample sizes or the Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test for paired groups with the same sample size. To compare curves, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used. Statistical analyses were performed in Microsoft Excel, GraphPad Prism, and MATLAB. All data are presented as mean ± SEM (standard error of the mean). When testing multiple hypotheses, p-values acquired using t-tests were corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg/Yekutieli method for false discovery rate control.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>MATLAB scripts</title><p>All MATLAB scripts used for this study are available as Source code files in the supplemental materials.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All animals were handled according to approved institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) protocols (R-JUL-22-34) of the University of Maryland, College Park.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-87833-mdarchecklist1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="scode1"><label>Source code 1.</label><caption><title>Acquiring masks of B-cell contact zones from IRM images.</title><p>This MATLAB script inputs raw 16-bit .nd2 images and outputs a binary mask of all detected contact zones for further analysis.</p></caption><media xlink:href="elife-87833-code1-v2.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="scode2"><label>Source code 2.</label><caption><title>Acquiring a mask of a B-cell contact zone from an IRM time-lapse image.</title><p>This MATLAB script tracks the contact zone of a B-cell from time-lapse images and outputs a time-lapse mask file.</p></caption><media xlink:href="elife-87833-code2-v2.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="scode3"><label>Source code 3.</label><caption><title>Analyzing time-lapse images frame-by-frame for each B-cell.</title><p>This MATLAB liveScript comprises several sections, including Source codes 5-8.

The formation and centripetally migration of F-actin foci is a significant finding of this MS for the promotion of B cells to switch from spreading to contraction response. Thus, I may suggest to recommend the authors to conduct one more rigorous fluorescent molecular tracking experiment to confirm this phenomenon. Molecular tracking usually requires low labeling density, and the lifeact-GFP labeling here do not meet this requirement which may cause misidentification of the moving molecules. Permeable dye-based fluorescent speckle microscopy is recommended here to track the actin foci if applicable (P. Risteski, Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol., 2023, DOI: 10.1038/s41580-023-00588w &amp; K. Hu, et al, Science, 2007, 315, 111-115).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We conducted the suggested experiment using membrane-permeable SiR-actin to track B-cell actin dynamics. Unfortunately, two significant issues prevented us from confirming the LifeAct-GFP results using fluorescent speckle microscopy. First, the concentration of SiR-actin required to visualize F-actin in the contact zone of mouse primary B-cells was relatively high due to their smaller sizes (~6 µm diameter) and non-adherent nature. With such a relatively high concentration of SiR-actin, we could not perform fluorescent speckle microscopy. Second, we observed that SiR-actin appeared to stabilize actin structures and reduce actin dynamics, further limiting its use in studying actin dynamics in B-cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, kymograph is used for foci tracking in figure3 and figure4. Kymograph is indeed a powerful tool for tracking cell protrusion and retraction but is not fairly suitable here, since a Factin focus is a concentrated point which may not move strictly along the selected eight lines generating kymograph. Other imaging processing method should be used to track the foci, for example, time series max projection is recommended if applicable.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion and have tried the time series max projection. Unfortunately, it did not provide the resolution to identify individual actin foci, again probably due to the small size of primary mouse B-cells. While kymographs may not track the entire paths of these moving foci, we believe that the conclusions drawn from the kymography analysis in Figure 3 and 4 are reasonable. We generated eight kymographs for each cell in Figure 3 and three kymographs for each cell in Figure 4 to follow as many actin foci as possible within the spreading to contraction transition time window. Our analysis in Figure 3 identifies the fraction of actin foci originating from lamellipodia. In Figure 4, we used the kymographs to trace the path of putative clusters and used these to calculate their relative lifetimes and speed. While this is not what was suggested by the reviewer, our analysis provides qualitatively similar information to the time series max projection and reasonable comparisons between contracted and noncontracted cells, inhibitor-treated and untreated cells, and wild-type and WASP KO cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The second major issue is about the relationship between actin foci formation and NMII recruitment in figure 5. The author concludes that 'N-WASP and Arp2/3 mediated branched actin polymerization promotes the recruitment and the reorganization of NMII ring-like structures by generating inner F-actin foci in the contact zone'. However, there is a lack of strong evidence to directly show the mechanism by which myosin is recruited and the up and down stream relationship between actin foci migration and myosin recruitment. Since myosin-induced actin retrograde flow is a classical model in adherent cells, is it possible that, here also in activated B cells, the recruited myosin driven the formation and migration of actin foci? This reviewer may recommend the author to investigate whether Myosin blocking (e.g., using Y27632) can eliminate the F-actin foci formation and migration.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent suggestion! In the revised manuscript, we have included new data showing that treatment with the non-muscle myosin II motor inhibitor blebbistatin, which is known to inhibit B-cell contraction but not spreading on Fab’-PLB (Seeley-Fallen et al. 2022. Frontiers in Immunology), interferes with the formation of inner actin foci ring-like structures, which are associated with B-cell contraction. These results together suggest that the generation of inner actin foci ring-like structure depends on the coordination between N-WASP-mediated actin polymerization and myosin contractile activity. We chose to use blebbistatin rather than Y27632 to inhibit non-muscle myosin II because in addition to the ROCK pathway, myosin light chain kinase can also activate myosin II, and Y27632 may have additional effects besides inhibiting myosin activity. The new data are shown in Figure 5G and H and discussed in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Weaknesses: Minor as listed below.

Another possibility is that BCR dense foci formation is an indirect consequence of lamellipodia retraction. Future works should define the specific role of N-WASP, Arp2/3 and actin in the process to form BCR dense foci, especially as the BCR continue to signal in the cytoplasm.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comments. We have included the possibility that lamellipodial retraction may be involved in increasing the molecular density of BCR clusters and suggested future studies on the potential roles of N-WASP-dependent inner actin foci and actomyosin structures in BCR internalization and intracellular signaling in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The author prove their claims by mean of thorough image analysis, mainly observing and quantifying the fluorescence and the dynamics of single clusters of antigen and actin foci and analyzing two-colors dynamical images.

The work is sound and complete, the experiments technically excellent and well explained. Some experiments and discussions are objectively harder to describe, and given the length of the work, the reader might find itself lost some times. A graphical abstract/summary of the main way N-WASP ultimately control signal attenuation would solve this minor point.</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate the reviewer’s confirmation of our data quality and are delighted to accept the reviewer’s suggestion. In the revised manuscript, we have included a new figure (Figure 10) in the Discussion section, summarizing the results presented in the manuscript as a working model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Some minor points:Figure 1C, E, G and I shows three individual symbols, indicating three independent experiments described in legend. Please double check for accuracy.</p><p>It is better to show statistical data with representative repeat, not the merged means of independent experiments. For example, figure 1C even indicates three &quot;0&quot; data in CK-666 treated cells, meaning no contracting cell was found in ~75 cells, while there are other repeats showing 45% - 50% contracting cells. This applies to all figures involving individual cell imaging data, such as figure 2D, in which 30 cells from three independent experiments were pooled. The authors shall clearly state that those independent experiments are statistically indistinguishable before pooling the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s comments that these data have variability from individual mice, the quality of isolated primary B-cells, and the lateral mobility of planar lipid bilayers. To show the variability, we displayed the data from each experiment as individual data points. In the revised manuscript, we have utilized three colors of dots to represent three independent experiments in Figure 1C, E, G, and I, Figure 2B-G, and new Figure 5H, which show that the data from the three experiments have the same trend despite the variability.</p><p>In figure 7B-C, figure 8 and figure 9. The significant test results were hard to understand in which groups they compared. Please describe it in more detail in the figure legend or the method section.</p><p>In the legend, the authors claimed blue points in Figure 7B represented individual pCD79a clusters within an equal number of BCR clusters from each time points. The authors used means to qualify the change of blue points distribution. These shall be clearly stated in the Methods. Total BCR cluster numbers shall be shown also. This applies to Figure 7B, 7C, 7D and all figures in figure 8 and figure 9.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing it out. We have revised Figures 7-9, where we utilized square braces to indicate groups of clusters (blue points) being compared. We have also provided additional information in the figure legend and Method sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>199-200: What is the consequence of increased WASP activation in N-WASP knockout B cells? Is this evaluated as increased pWASP activity and/or increased actin polymerization of WASP knockout B cells. Does WASP and N-WASP have an additive or counteractive effect on each other during spreading and contraction?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the relationship between WASP and N-WASP, which are co-expressed in B-cells and other immune cells, is fascinating. Our previous studies, using WASP germline knockout, B-cellspecific N-WASP knockout, WASP and N-WASP double knockout mice, showed that WASP and N-WASP have both additive and counteractive effects during B-cell spreading, but B-cell contraction only depends on N-WASP (Liu et al. 2013. PLoS Biol). Double knockout B-cells fail to spread, and WASP knockout B-cells show reduced spreading but still contract, showing their additive effects. However, WASP and N-WASP suppress each other for activation, as detected by their phosphorylation. Phosphorylated WASP increases in the B-cell contact zone first, and phosphorylated N-WASP increases later when the phosphorylated WASP level decreases. Knocking out one of them enhances the phosphorylation of the other. Consequently, N-WASP knockout B-cells show increased spreading, probably due to enhanced activation of WASP, but exhibit delayed contraction.

In several paragraphs of the revised Discussion section, we have brought up the limitations of the study and how these limitations affect the data interpretation. In addition, we have added Figure 10 and the associated text to present our working model, which explains how our findings reveal the cellular mechanism by which BCR surface signaling amplification transitions into attenuation, likely occurring in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2: Add an example of the image analysis for foci determination.

The conclusion is that WKO have similar &quot;relative speed&quot; as &quot;WT&quot; cells, but in fact the &quot;WT&quot; cells may have responded poorly in this experiment. What is the author's experience and explanation?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the relative speeds of inner actin foci in the contact zone of WT and WKO B-cells are relatively low compared to DMSO and CK-689. Based on our experience, this parameter is very sensitive to the lateral mobility of planar lipid bilayers. We could only perform one pair of conditions using live cell images each time. The WT and WKO experiments were done at the end and might use relatively aged liposomes. However, it did not affect the number of inner actin foci formed and their relative lifetime, consistent with their similar relative speeds. Unfortunately, we lost the LifeAct-GFP-expressing WKO mouse colony and cannot redo this experiment using freshly made liposomes within a reasonable time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 7B-D: Add a more detailed legend for the black and brown lines in the dot plots.</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded the legend for Figure 7B-D to provide additional details.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 8-9: Show representative images for SYK, pSYK, SHIP-1 and pSHIP-1.

Could the authors better elucidate this point? What happen at the peak of NMII recruitment? Could this be a mechanism used by the cell to end the contact and detach (which probably cannot be observed in this experimental setup)?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent comment! We have recently shown that NMIIA recruitment peaks right before B-cell contraction occurs, and inhibition of NMII by inhibitors or B-cell conditional knockout blocks B-cell contraction and enhances signaling (Seeley-Fallen et al. 2022. Frontiers in Immunology). In the revised manuscript, we have included new data showing that treatment with the NMII motor inhibitor blebbistatin, which is known to inhibit B-cell contraction but not spreading on Fab’-PLB (Seeley-Fallen et al. 2022. Frontiers in Immunology), interferes with the formation of inner actin foci associated with B-cell contraction. These results together suggest that the generation of inner actin foci depends on the coordination between N-WASP-activated actin polymerization and myosin contractile activity, supporting the reviewer’s comment. The new data are shown in Figure 5G and H and discussed in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Whether the recruited NMII pulls B-cells away from antigen-presenting surfaces remains an interesting question. We have previously shown that high-affinity interaction of surface BCRswith membrane-anchored antigen can cause NMII-dependent B-cell membrane permeabilization, which triggers lysosome exocytosis and lysosomal enzyme-mediated antigen cleavage, allowing antigen internalization and presentation to T-cells (Maeda et al. 2021. eLife). Furthermore, NMII is required for B cells to internalize surface antigens (Natkanski et al. 2013. Science). These results support the possibility that actomyosin structures formed during B-cell contraction may further drive B-cells to internalize antigen. We have discussed this interesting point in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some experiments/quantification are a bit more complex than others and a reader might find hard to follow them (in particular figs 7,8 and 9). The comprehension could be improved by providing a guide to read them. E.g. it is not clear what the population distribution represents and it is not particularly affected by any manipulation. How were the group for test chosen? It seems they are based on intensity categories taken every 100 units: is it the case? even if arbitrary, this should be stated it in the legend.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for understanding the complexity of image analysis and pointing out the unclear points. Based on the reviewer’s comments, we have revised Figures 7-9 and the figure legend. We utilized square brackets to indicate groups of clusters (blue points) being compared. The comparison groups were chosen arbitrarily based on Fab’ peak fluorescence intensity every 90 units for Figure 7 and 8 and every 100 units for Figure 9.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can the author speculate on how the actin organization passes from actin foci to recruitment of NMII and arc formation? Is it a rearrangement of the actin network (percolation) or simply recruitment of monomers?</p></disp-quote><p>Our previous and new results show that both N-WASP-activated Arp2/3 and NMII are required to form inner F-actin foci. Based on these results, we speculate that N-WASP and Arp2/3mediated actin polymerization may initiate the process and recruit NMII, and recruited NMII coordinates with actin polymerization to reorganize actin structures, promoting inner actin foci maturation and arc formation. We have included these possibilities in the revised discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The role of SHIP recruitment as way to inhibit the signal downstream of the BCR is an interesting finding. Is this related to the termination of the synapse? Could we relate the time scales (accurately measured in this work) to contact times observed in vivo?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an interesting question. In the discussion section, we have speculated that the actomyosin structures responsible for B-cell contraction are potentially the precursor cytoskeleton structures for antigen internalization. However, the relationship of B-cell contraction and signaling attenuation with the termination of the synapse remains unclear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The BCR has been shown to be internalised mechanically: do these new data suggest a mechanisms for force generation in antigen internalization at the actin foci? Related to that, how do the dynamics of N-WASP recruitment relate to the force measurement highlighted in TractionForce Microscopy experiments (see for example Wang Sci.Signal. 2018, Kumari Nat.Comm.2019)? What happens in situation when the actin foci are unable to get transported, e.g. as on the more classical antigen on coverslip configuration?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, our results allow us to speculate that the actomyosin structures responsible for B-cell contraction potentially contribute to antigen internalization by mechanical forces. We previously showed that the B-cell-specific N-WASP knockout drastically reduced BCR internalization of soluble antigen (Liu et al. 2013. PLoS Biol), and that NMII is required for BCR internalization of membrane-associated antigen (Maeda et al. 2021. eLife and Natkanski et al. 2013. Science). The effect of N-WASP knockout on the internalization of membrane-associated antigen and traction forces generated at the contact membrane and whether traction forces are generated from the inner F-actin foci have not been determined but will be pursued in the future.</p><p>Our previous publication compared the BCR and actin dynamics of B-cells interacting with Fab’ tethered to planer lipid bilayers (Fab’-PLB) and cover glass (Fab’-G) (Ketchum et al. 2014. Biophys J). B-cells interacting with Fab’-G do not contract and generate inner F-actin foci and exhibit less dynamic BCR clusters and actin cytoskeleton than B-cells interacting with Fab’-PLB. Actin foci remain coincident with Fab’ clusters on glass rather than being positioned behind Fab’ clusters on PLB, thus driving their centripetal movement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor remarks:When several experiments (mice) are presented in dot plots (e.g. fig 2D-G 4J-M), color dot plot (so called &quot;smart plot&quot;) where each experiment is identified by a color, could be used to highlight the sample-to-sample variability.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent suggestion. In the revised manuscript, we have utilized three shades of dots to represent the data points from three independent experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig 6A: the fluorophore should be indicated in the picture (Fab'-AF546)</p></disp-quote><p>The suggested correction has been made.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig 6D: how is the contraction phase (purple rectangle) determined?
