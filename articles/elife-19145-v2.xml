fundamental role in the spatial coordination of animal cells. The standard model of aster growth assumes a fixed number of microtubules originating from the centrosomes. However, aster morphology in this model does not scale with cell size, and we recently found evidence for non-centrosomal microtubule nucleation. Here, we combine autocatalytic nucleation and polymerization dynamics to develop a biophysical model of aster growth. Our model predicts that asters expand as traveling waves and recapitulates all major aspects of aster growth. With increasing nucleation rate, the model predicts an explosive transition from stationary to growing asters with a discontinuous jump of the aster velocity to a nonzero value. Experiments in frog egg extract confirm the main theoretical predictions. Our results suggest that asters observed in large fish and amphibian eggs are a meshwork of short, unstable microtubules maintained by autocatalytic nucleation and provide a paradigm for the assembly of robust and evolvable polymer networks.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19145.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19145.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19145.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells must carefully organize their contents in order to work effectively. Protein filaments called microtubules often play important roles in this organization, as well as giving structure to the cell. Many cells contain structures called asters that are formed of microtubules that radiate out from a central point (much like a star shape). Textbooks generally state that all microtubules in the aster grow outward from its center. If this was the case, the microtubules at the edge of large asters – such as those found in frog egg cells and other extremely large cells – would be spread relatively far apart from each other. However, even at the edges of large asters, the microtubules are quite densely packed.</p><p>In 2014, a group of researchers proposed that new microtubules could form throughout the aster instead of all originating from the center. This model had not been tested; it was also unclear under what conditions an aster would be able to grow to fill a large cell.</p><p>Ishihara et al. – including some of the researchers involved in the 2014 work – have now developed a mathematical theory of aster growth that is based on the assumption that microtubules stimulate the generation of new microtubules. The theory reproduces the key features seen during the growth of asters in large cells, and predicts that the asters may stay at a constant size or grow continuously. The condition required for the aster to grow is simple: each microtubule in it has to trigger the generation of at least one new microtubule during its lifetime. Ishihara et al. have named this process “collective growth”.</p><p>Experiments performed using microtubules taken from crushed frog eggs and assembled under a cover slip provided further evidence that asters grow via a collective growth process. Future studies could now investigate whether collective growth also underlies the formation of other cellular structures.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19145.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19145.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>aster</kwd><kwd>microtubules</kwd><kwd>nucleation</kwd><kwd>reaction-diffusion</kwd><kwd>polymer networks</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM39565</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ishihara</surname><given-names>Keisuke</given-names></name><name><surname>Mitchison</surname><given-names>Timothy J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006049</institution-id><institution>Marine Biological Laboratory</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Whitman Center Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mitchison</surname><given-names>Timothy J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005951</institution-id><institution>Honjo International Scholarship Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ishihara</surname><given-names>Keisuke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007161</institution-id><institution>Boston University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Start up fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Korolev</surname><given-names>Kirill S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000893</institution-id><institution>Simons Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#409704</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Korolev</surname><given-names>Kirill S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Autocatalytic growth of a microtubule polymer network allows extremely large egg cells to self-organize and divide rapidly.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Animal cells use asters, radial arrays of microtubules, to spatially organize their cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wilson, 1896</xref>). Specifically, astral microtubules transport organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grigoriev et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Waterman-Storer and Salmon, 1998</xref>), support cell motility by mediating mechanical and biochemical signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Etienne-Manneville, 2013</xref>), and are required for proper positioning of the nucleus, the mitotic spindle, and the cleavage furrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Field et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grill and Hyman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Neumüller and Knoblich, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tanimoto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wilson, 1896</xref>). Within asters, individual microtubules undergo dynamic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mitchison and Kirschner, 1984</xref>): They either grow (polymerize) or shrink (depolymerize) at their plus ends and stochastically transition between these two states. The collective behavior of microtubules is less well understood, and it is not clear how dynamic instability of individual microtubules controls aster growth and function.</p><p>The standard model of aster growth posits that centrosomes nucleate and anchor all microtubules at their minus ends while the plus ends polymerize outward via dynamic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brinkley, 1985</xref>). As a result, aster growth is completely determined by the dynamics of individual microtubules averaged over the growing and shrinking phases. In particular, the aster either expands at a velocity given by the net growth rate of microtubules or remains stationary if microtubules are unstable and tend to depolymerize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belmont et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dogterom and Leibler, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Verde et al., 1992</xref>).</p><p>The standard model of aster growth is being increasingly challenged by reports of microtubules with their minus ends located far away from centrosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akhmanova and Steinmetz, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Keating and Borisy, 1999</xref>). Some of these microtubules may arise simply by detachment from centrosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Keating et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Waterman-Storer et al., 2000</xref>) or severing of pre-existing microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Roll-Mecak and McNally, 2010</xref>). However, new microtubules could also arise due to a nucleation process independent of centrosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clausen and Ribbeck, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Efimov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Petry et al., 2013</xref>) and contribute to both aster growth and its mechanical properties. Indeed, we recently observed that centrosomal nucleation is insufficient to explain the large number of growing plus ends found in asters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ishihara et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, the standard model demands a decrease in microtubule density at aster periphery, which is inconsistent with aster morphology in frog and fish embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wühr et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">2010</xref>). To resolve these inconsistencies, we proposed an autocatalytic nucleation model, where microtubules or microtubule plus ends stimulate the nucleation of new microtubules at the aster periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ishihara et al., 2014a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wühr et al., 2009</xref>). This mechanism generates new microtubules necessary to maintain a constant density as the aster expands. We also hypothesized that autocatalytic nucleation could effectively overcome extinction of individual microtubules, and allow rapid growth of large asters made of short, unstable microtubules. However, we did not provide a quantitative model that can be compared to the experiments or even show that the proposed mechanism is feasible.</p><p>Here, we develop a quantitative biophysical model of aster growth with autocatalytic nucleation. It predicts that asters can indeed expand even when individual microtubules turn over and disappear by depolymerization. In this regime, aster expansion is driven by the increase in the total number of microtubules, and the resulting aster is a network of short interconnected microtubules. The transition from stationary to growing asters depends on the balance between polymerization dynamics and nucleation. At this transition, our theory predicts a minimum rate at which asters grow, which we define as the gap velocity. This gap velocity arises due to the dynamic instability of microtubule polymerization and excludes a wide class of alternative models. More importantly, this mode of aster growth allows the cell to assemble asters with varying polymer densities at consistently large speeds. Using a cell-free reconstitution approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Field et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nguyen et al., 2014</xref>), we perform biochemical perturbations and observe the slowing down and eventual arrest of aster growth with a substantial gap velocity at the transition. By combining theory and experiments, we provide a quantitative framework for how the cell cycle may regulate the balance between polymerization dynamics and nucleation to control aster growth. We propose that the growth of large interphase asters is an emergent property of short microtubules that constantly turnover and self-amplify.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Conceptual model for aster growth based on polymerization dynamics and autocatalytic nucleation</title><p>Asters are large structures comprised of thousands of microtubules.

In this regime, asters grow (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf56"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>) although individual microtubules are bounded (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf57"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>J</mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>) and are, therefore, destined to shrink and disappear. The growth occurs because more microtubules are nucleated than lost, and new microtubules are typically nucleated further along the expansion direction. Indeed, when a new microtubule is nucleated, it is in a growing state and starts expanding outward before its inevitable collapse. During its lifetime, this microtubule can nucleate a few more microtubules all of which are located further along the expansion direction. As we show below, this self-amplifying propagation of microtubules is possible only for sufficiently high nucleation rates necessary to overcome microtubule loss and sustain collective growth.</p><p>Specifically, we assume that new microtubules nucleate at locations away from centrosomes at rate <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf58"><mml:mi>Q</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>. This rate could depend on the local density of growing plus ends if they serve as nucleation sites or the local polymer density if nucleation occurs throughout a microtubule. The new microtubules have zero length and tend to grow radially due to mechanical interactions with the existing microtubule network. These non-centrosomal microtubules disappear when they shrink back to their minus ends. Our assumptions are broadly consistent with known microtubule physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clausen and Ribbeck, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Petry et al., 2013</xref>), and we found strong evidence for nucleation away from centrosomes in egg extract by microtubule counting in growing asters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ishihara et al., 2014a</xref>). Below, we consider plus-end-stimulated nucleation and the analysis for the polymer-stimulated nucleation is summarized in the SI.</p><p>Without negative feedback, autocatalytic processes lead to exponential growth, but there are several lines of evidence for an apparent ‘carrying capacity’ of microtubules in a given cytoplasmic volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clausen and Ribbeck, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ishihara et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Petry et al., 2013</xref>). Saturation is inevitable since the building blocks of microtubules are present at a fixed concentration. In our model, we impose a carrying capacity by expressing autocatalytic nucleation as a logistic function of the local density of growing plus ends, which is qualitatively consistent with local depletion of nucleation factors such as the gamma-tubulin ring complex. Other forms of negative feedback (e.g. at the level of polymerization dynamics) are possible as well. In SI, we show that the type of negative feedback does not affect the rate of aster growth, which is determined entirely by the dynamics at the leading edge of a growing aster where the microtubule density is small and negative feedback can be neglected.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Mathematical model of autocatalytic growth of asters</title><p>Assuming a large number of microtubules, we focus on the mean-field or deterministic dynamics (SI) and formalize our model as a set of partial differential equations.

In our model, microtubules originating from centrosomes rapidly switch from shrinking to growth (i.e. re-nucleate), while non-centrosomal microtubules disappears completely (i.e. no re-nucleation occurs). We further assume that mother and daughter microtubules disappear without affecting each other. Indeed, if the collapse of the mother microtubule triggered the collapse of the daughter microtubule (or vice versa), then no net increase in the number of microtubules would be possible in the bounded regime. One consequence of this assumption is that the minus end of a daughter microtubule becomes detached from any other microtubules in the aster following the collapse of the mother microtubule. As a result, minus ends need to be stabilized after nucleation possibly by some additional factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhmanova and Hoogenraad, 2015</xref>) and mechanical integrity of the aster should rely on microtubule bundling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ishihara et al., 2014a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Asters can grow as spatially propagating waves with constant bulk density</title><p>To check if our model can describe aster growth, we solved <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation (3)</xref> numerically using finite difference methods in an 1D planar geometry.

During this collective growth, the aster expands radially because more microtubules are nucleated than lost at the front. In the aster bulk, nucleation is reduced from the carrying capacity, and the aster exists in the dynamic balance between microtubule gain due to nucleation and loss due to depolymerization. Since microtubules are in the bounded regime, their lifetime is short, and they disappear before reaching an appreciable length. In sharp contrast to the standard model, we predict that asters are a dynamic network of short microtubules with properties independent from the distance to the centrosome. Thus, nucleation not only increases the number of microtubules, but also controls the growth rate and spatial organization of asters enabling them to span length scales far exceeding the length of an individual microtubule.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19145.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Explosive transition from stationary to growing asters and other theoretical predictions.</title><p>Analytical solution (lines) and numerical simulations (dots) predict that asters either remain stationary or expand at a constant velocity, which increases with the net polymerization rate <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf98"><mml:mi>J</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> (<bold>A</bold>) and nucleation rate <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf99"><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> (<bold>B</bold>).

We found pellicle initiated asters to exhibit a similar critical concentration of MCAK-Q710 compared to Aurora A bead asters.

Both models of nucleation have qualitatively similar behavior including the gap velocity and recapitulate experimental observations of asters growing as traveling waves. Thus, in our case, the qualitative conclusions do not depend on the precise molecular mechanism of autocatalytic nucleation. In particular, the explosive transition characterized by the gap velocity is a general prediction of modeling microtubules as self-amplifying elements whose lifetime depends on their length.</p><p>By carefully defining and quantifying autocatalytic nucleation, future studies may be able to distinguish its precise mechanism.

We call this the ‘collective growth’ regime because individual microtubules are much shorter (estimated mean length of 16 μm ± 2 μm, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) than the aster radius (hundreds of microns). Predictions of this model are fully confirmed by the biochemical perturbation via MCAK-Q710. The finite jump in the aster velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) is in sharp contrast to the prediction of the standard models of spatial growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fisher, 1937</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kolmogorov and Petrovskii, 1937</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Skellam, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">van Saarloos, 2003</xref>). Spatial growth is typically modeled by reaction-diffusion processes that account for birth events and random motion, which, in the context of microtubules, correspond to the nucleation and dynamic instability of plus ends. Reaction-diffusion models, however, neglect internal dynamics of the agents such as the length of a microtubule. As a result, such models inevitably predict a continuous, gradual increase in the aster velocity as the model parameters are varied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang and Ferrell, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hallatschek and Korolev, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Méndez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">van Saarloos, 2003</xref>). The observation of finite velocity jump provides a strong support for our model and rules out a very wide class of models that reproduce the overall phenomenology of aster growth including the constant velocity and profile shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

Our intuition is that microtubule nucleation will produce microtubules at distances far from the origin, and that with high enough nucleation, the population of microtubules will start to move away from the origin as a self-propagating wave. Waves with growth terms that monotonically decline with density are called pulled fronts, and can be analyzed through linearization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">van Saarloos, 2003</xref>). This is the case for the microtubule nucleation specified by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ8">Equation (A2)</xref>, and the full analytical solution for the spatiotemporal evolution can be obtained. In particular, we find the asymptotic front velocity of microtubules as a function of model parameters. This leads us to the concept of the critical nucleation rate, which summarizes the condition that determines aster growth (linear increase in radius) vs. no growth (constant radius).

The bulk state of the aster could, however, be affected by the sign of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf367"><mml:mi>J</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, depending on the mode of negative feedback (see Appendix 6 for detailed discussion). When negative feedback promotes depolymerization at high microtubule density, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf368"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>J</mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> in the bulk and asters are composed of short microtubules that are created through nucleation and lost through depolymerization.

When negative feedback simply arrests nucleation in the bulk, individual microtubules begin to span the entire aster as in the standard model.

We feel this new model for growth of large microtubule asters is a major advance for the microtubule field. It also will have an important impact on conceptual thinking about polymer dynamics in the cytoskeletal field. Both reviewers, who although making different points, reach the same overall conclusion, which is that many of the assumptions are not sufficiently explored or described so as to be able to constrain your model. While the prediction from the model is straightforward (<italic>V<sub>gap</sub></italic>), the experimental validation is often not sufficient to test the predictions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The applicability of the Equation for <italic>J</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> for nucleated microtubule dynamics needs to be better clarified early in the Results. In a number of places in the manuscript, it is stated that on average the microtubules are &quot;shrinking&quot;. Yet, collectively the aster is growing enormously by the mechanism modeled here. So how can microtubules be on average shrinking while the aster is growing? By the Equation of <italic>J</italic> they are on average &quot;shrinking&quot;, but since all microtubules within the expanded aster are nucleated, why is the Equation for <italic>J</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> applicable to this analysis?

How does this relate to aster growth velocity <italic>V</italic>?</p><p>3) What happens when microtubules depolymerize completely and does this impose a geometric constraint?</p><p>We had, to some extent, addressed these questions in the original submission, but it was clear from this set of reviewer comments that we had not done a good enough job in explaining our terms, assumptions and reasoning. We address these comments below first highlighting the general picture and then answering specific comments. We have added significantly more explanatory text in the revised submission. We thank the reviewer for asking these questions, since our revisions in response have clearly improved the manuscript.</p><p>1) How do asters grow when <italic>J</italic>&lt;0 and microtubules tend to depolymerize on average?</p><p>We had not defined the difference between microtubule growth and aster growth in the previous version. We now define, early in the results, aster growth rate as <italic>V</italic>, which is a collective property of all the microtubules, and average growth rate of individual microtubules, <italic>J</italic>, which we define the same way as Dogterom and Leibler and subsequent authors.</p><p>Whether or not asters can grow (<italic>V</italic>&gt;0) when individual microtubules are unstable (<italic>J</italic>&lt;0) was the single most important question we sought to address in our study. We suspected they could, and our theory work confirms this surprising idea. We evidently failed to adequately explain our conclusions, and have made significant text changes to do a better job.</p><p>First, we added the following sentence at the beginning of the Results section to clearly state the motivations for the theory:</p><p>“Asters are large structures comprised of thousands of microtubules. How do the microscopic dynamics of individual microtubules determine the collective properties of asters such as their morphology and growth rate? […] Polymerization dynamics of plus ends is an individual property of microtubules.”</p><p>Next, we provide an intuitive picture of aster growth by use of analogy. In some ways, aster growth resembles the growth of the population size of a species. Each individual is mortal and destined to die, yet the population size grows because reproduction outweighs death. Similarly, the aster will grow, if, on average, a single microtubule nucleates more than one microtubule before it shrinks to the nucleation site, an event that removes both the microtubule and the nucleation site from the system. Due to the geometry of the aster, and birth of new microtubule near the periphery, this increase will cause the aster radius to grow even if individual microtubules are unstable.</p><p>Below is the text that we added to provide an intuitive picture of the collective growth regime:</p><p>“In this regime, asters grow (<italic>V</italic>&gt;0) although individual microtubules are bounded (<italic>J</italic>&lt;0) and are, therefore, destined to shrink and disappear. […] As we show below, this self-amplifying propagation of microtubules is possible only for sufficiently high nucleation rates necessary to overcome microtubule loss and sustain collective growth.”</p><p>We also modified the figure legend for the phase diagram of aster growth in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> to better integrate how <italic>J</italic> and <italic>V</italic> relate to each other when nucleation is considered.</p><p>2) What is the definition and meaning of <italic>J</italic>? How does this relate to aster growth velocity <italic>V</italic>?</p><p>First, let us point out that the definition and meaning of <italic>J</italic> are the same with and without nucleation because <italic>J</italic> describes the dynamics of individual microtubules. In particular, <italic>J</italic> is not the velocity of aster expansion in general. <italic>V</italic> and <italic>J</italic> are quite different, and the point of our model is to examine the relationship between them.</p><p>We define <italic>J</italic> following Dogterom and Leibler (1993), PRL and Verde et al. (1992), JCB: J<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf494"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo> </mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> both for r=0 and r&gt;0. We now introduce this equation as an equation in the main text.</p><p>One useful interpretation of this mathematical construct is the following. Consider an ensemble of very, very long microtubules, <italic>f<sub>res</sub>/(f<sub>res</sub></italic> +<italic>f<sub>cat</sub></italic>) of which are in the growing state and <italic>f<sub>cat</sub>/(f<sub>res</sub></italic>+<italic>f<sub>cat</sub></italic>) of which are in the shrinking state. Then, the mean length of microtubules in this ensemble changes with a rate equal <italic>J</italic>. Two things are important for this interpretation. First, we assumed very long microtubules so that we can neglect the effects of disappearance and re-nucleation upon shrinking. Second, we assumed that the fraction of growing and shrinking microtubules are given by their steady state fractions (<italic>f<sub>res</sub>/(f<sub>res</sub></italic>+<italic>f<sub>cat</sub></italic>) and <italic>f<sub>cat</sub>/(f<sub>res</sub></italic>+<italic>f<sub>cat</sub></italic>)). These assumptions do not hold during aster growth and care needs to taken when interpreting <italic>J</italic> intuitively. A very similar interpretation of <italic>J</italic> appears when one attempts to describe the dynamics of microtubule length as a random walk. In this case, <italic>J</italic> is the mean velocity, or bias, of the random walk.</p><p>Without an explaining the assumptions as mentioned above, referring to <italic>J</italic> as the mean polymerization rate may cause confusion. Indeed, each microtubule eventually disappears, which implies that the mean increase in length is exactly zero. To understand the apparent paradox, note that each new microtubule is nucleated in growing state; therefore, its polymerization rate is positive at early times even when <italic>J</italic>&lt;0. The value of <italic>J</italic> then quantifies the bias towards polymerization vs. depolymerization rather the change is the mean aster length. In particular, for <italic>J</italic>&lt;0, microtubules collapse faster and remain shorter the greater the magnitude of this negative bias. Thus, when we said “microtubules shrink on average,” we meant that there is a bias towards depolymerization. We removed this language from the manuscript and replaced it with “unstable microtubules”, “bounded microtubules”, or simply “<italic>J</italic>&lt;0”.</p><p>Further, we substantially modified the paragraph describing “<italic>J</italic>&gt;0” and “<italic>J</italic>&lt;0” to better explain our definition of <italic>J</italic> and also describe how <italic>J</italic> and <italic>V</italic> are related in the standard model:</p><p>“Plus end dynamics can be conveniently summarized by the time-weighted average of the polymerization and depolymerization rates (Dogterom and Leibler, 1993; Verde et al., 1992):</p><p>J<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf495"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo> </mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula></p><p>[…] With unbounded dynamics <italic>J</italic>&gt;0, the standard model predicts an aster that has a constant number of microtubules and increases its radius at a rate equal to the elongation rate of microtubules (i.e. <italic>V</italic>=<italic>J</italic>).”</p><p>We also concluded that the presentation of our model, a coupled partial differentiation equation, was not accessible to the general audience. We added the following sentence to supplement our equations to emphasize that our mathematical model incorporates the established concept of microtubule dynamics described above:</p><p>“To understand this system of equations, consider the limit of no nucleation (<italic>r</italic>=0). Then, the equations at different <italic>x</italic> become independent and we recover the standard model that reduces aster growth to the growth of individual microtubules (Dogterom and Leibler, 1993; Verde et al., 1992). With nucleation, aster growth is a collective phenomenon because microtubules…”</p><p>Finally, to highlight that the aster growth velocity <italic>V</italic> is a collective property resulting from the interplay of polymerization dynamics and nucleation, we now feature the analytical solution for <italic>V</italic> in the Results section (formerly in Methods).</p><p>3) How do nucleation sites affect microtubule dynamics?</p><p>In our analysis there are two types of nucleation events: one from centrosomes and the other in the cytoplasm stimulated by microtubules. In simulations, we treat them differently. For centrosomal microtubules, we assume immediate re-nucleation because centrosomes serve as potent nucleating centers. For the microtubules nucleated elsewhere in the cytoplasm, we assume that the microtubule collapses and disappears. Thus, the only geometric constraint is at the centrosome. In the mathematical analysis, we ignore centrosomal microtubules since they do not extend far into the aster, and the aster growth is driven exclusively by non-centrosomal nucleation. We have now added a paragraph to the main text explicitly discussing this assumption:</p><p>“Finally, we need to specify what happens when microtubules shrink to zero length. In our model, microtubules originating from centrosomes rapidly switch from shrinking to growth (i.e. re-nucleate), while non-centrosomal microtubules disappears completely (i.e. no re-nucleation occurs). […] As a result, minus ends need to be stabilized after nucleation possibly by some additional factors (Akhmanova and Hoogenraad, 2015) and mechanical integrity of the aster should rely on microtubule bundling (Ishihara et al., 2014a).”</p><p>Finally, we want to further clarify our response to the following comment by the reviewer:</p><p><italic>&quot;Here is an example of my confusion. Suppose there is nucleated microtubule growth, no spontaneous rescue and rescue occurs only by depolymerization to the initial nucleation site. Say V<sub>g</sub> = 20 um/min, t<sub>g</sub> = 1 min, and V<sub>s</sub> = 200 um/min. So the plot of MT dynamic instability is almost saw-toothed because V<sub>s</sub> &gt;&gt; V<sub>g</sub>. So, on a time average, the microtubules are mainly growing, because shortening is so fast. However, the value of J = 0, because length gained in growth is always lost in shortening. If the constraints from nucleation are neglected, with no spontaneous rescue, the value of J from the equation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> is &lt;&lt;0, which is of course a lot of shrinking&quot;.</italic> </p><p>All of the reviewer’s predictions are correct. There are indeed several nonequivalent ways to characterize the tendency to shrink: time spent shrinking, total change in distance, bias towards shrinking <italic>J</italic>, etc. We also point out that the example given above equally applies to the standard theory with only centrosomal nucleation, where the concept of <italic>J</italic> was first introduced. Our motivation for using <italic>J</italic> rather than any other quantity is that <italic>J</italic>=0 marks an important transition. For <italic>J</italic>&gt;0, microtubules expand forever upon nucleation, while, for <italic>J</italic>&lt;0, microtubules eventually shrink and need to be re-nucleated. The comment of the reviewer also highlights the dynamic complexity of aster growth and the need for rigorous mathematical analysis to supplement one’s intuition. The exact solution presented in our manuscript addresses precisely this problem.</p><p><italic>Also with respect to nucleation, it is represented by the term Q, which depends on the nucleation rate r, the carrying capacity K and the local density of growing microtubule plus ends C<sub>g</sub>. There are several problems with this definition:</italic> </p><p><italic>r is not measured / cannot be measured, but interfered with the aster growth velocity equation.</italic> </p><p>We think that introducing nucleation rate in the term describing nucleation is unavoidable and any definition must have this problem. By including terms in the model that we know exist but cannot yet quantify or define precisely, we made novel predictions that one would not expect if not for the model. Importantly, our main predictions require hypothesizing only a single parameter <italic>r</italic> for the autocatalytic nucleation, and is fairly robust to the exact form of the autocatalytic nucleation term (SI) and exclude alternative.</p><p>Theory is valuable precisely because there are no direct methods to measure nucleation rate or even observe nucleation.</p><p>As described in our response below, we found that neither <italic>V<sub>g</sub></italic> nor <italic>f<sub>cat</sub></italic> changed with increasing MCAK-Q710 concentrations, which transformed growing asters to stationary ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This is consistent with the perturbation altering <italic>V<sub>s</sub>, f<sub>res</sub></italic>, and/or <italic>r</italic>. Given these possibilities, we now provide a dedicated explanation in the Discussion for how our equations for aster growth velocity <italic>V</italic> and gap velocity were combined with experimental measurements to infer the rescue rate and nucleation rate:</p><p>“Our biophysical model offers a biologically appealing explanation to aster growth and allows us to estimate parameters that are not directly accessible: the rescue and autocatalytic nucleation rates. […] Thus, our model recapitulates aster growth with reasonable parameter values and offers a new understanding for how asters grow to span large cytoplasms even when individual microtubules are unstable.”</p><p>We have greatly re-organized and re-evaluated the parameter estimation for the updated <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. Further, we provide the new Appendix 8 and Appendix 8—table 2, which compares the alternative scenarios for how MCAK-Q710 could have arrested aster growth.</p><p>We hope we have conveyed the value of combining theory and measurement. We also thank the reviewers for suggesting additional measurements in MCAK-Q710 condition.</p><p><italic>K is estimated by comparing</italic> <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf496"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> <italic>from experiments to predicted values.</italic> </p><p>This seems to be the most direct measurement of this model parameter other than directly observing how the nucleation rate changes with microtubule density. The asters have much lower microtubule density compared to structures such as the mitotic spindle and the low signal to noise of the tubulin fluorescence intensity is unreliable to estimate the microtubule polymer density. In contrast, EB1 counting provides absolute numbers of growing plus ends with considerable sensitivity. We tried quite hard to use electron microscopy to count MTs, but were unsuccessful at fixing the asters while maintaining their structure.</p><p><italic>C<sub>g</sub> and</italic> <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf497"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> <italic>are both derived from EB1 tracks, which are growing microtubule ends. This term should be changed to the local density of all microtubules rather than growing microtubule plus ends. Or is there any evidence that microtubule-dependent microtubule nucleation exclusively happens on growing microtubules?</italic> </p><p>The reviewer raises an important issue about autocatalytic microtubule nucleation: plus end stimulated vs. polymer stimulated. Based on the literature, we think that both mechanisms are equally appealing and speculative at this point. There are many proteins that bind laterally to microtubules which may target and activate a nucleation complex (e.g. the Augmin complex, which we have depleted in this system and found normal aster growth). The polymerizing plus end (with its GTP cap) is also known to specifically recruit special proteins. Both scenarios currently lack definite molecular or structural evidence. In our original manuscript, we focused on the scenario of plus-end-stimulated nucleation from numerical simulations and analytical solutions.</p><p>Encouraged by the reviewer’s comment, we explored the alternative scenario of polymer-stimulated nucleation. Numerical simulations and our newly obtained analytical solution for the critical nucleation rate together confirm that this scenario recapitulates the qualitative features of the aster growth transition similar to the plus-end-stimulated scenario, including the finite jump in aster growth velocity before arrest. We present these results in a dedicated section in the Appendix (Appendix 9) and provide <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p>To refer to these results, we use Discussion section to consider the two different scenarios for autocatalytic nucleation. We add the following:</p><p>“To date, few studies have rigorously compared the mechanistic consequences of plus-end-stimulated vs. polymer-stimulated nucleation. Above, we presented the theoretical predictions for aster growth by plus-end stimulated nucleation. […] This difference has important implications for the structural mechanism of microtubule nucleation and for the prediction of cell-scale phenomena. For the issue of large aster growth, we propose specific experiments that might be able distinguish these scenarios (Appendix).”</p><p>By responding to the reviewer comment and analyzing the alternative scenario of polymer-stimulated nucleation, we feel that we have made an advance in our understanding in the intricacies of autocatalytic nucleation, which remains an unsolved question for the field.</p><p><italic>The reviewers feel that there is not sufficient discussion of parameters that have not been measured. For instance, &quot;We explored perturbation of various dynamics regulators, seeking one whose effect was restricted to influencing a single parameter in our model. This was challenging since proteins that regulate polymerization dynamics tend to also regulate nucleation…&quot;.</italic> </p><p>We apologize for not providing sufficient discussion of the model parameters. In particular, we failed to emphasize that we had measured (1) <italic>V<sub>g</sub></italic> and <italic>V<sub>s</sub></italic> via direct imaging of microtubules in our previous paper (Ishihara et al., PNAS 2014) and (2) <italic>V<sub>g</sub></italic> and <italic>f<sub>cat</sub></italic> via EB1 comet tracking in the current report. This left us with <italic>f<sub>res</sub></italic> and <italic>r</italic> as two unknown parameters which we estimated by combining our theoretical results and experimental measurements aster growth velocity <italic>V</italic> and <italic>V<sub>gap</sub></italic>. Please also refer to our third response above and the revised <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> which summarizes the parameter values.</p><p><italic>In the paper, you state that the only dynamic parameter that has been actually quantified is f<sub>cat</sub>. This seems a bit misleading, as f<sub>cat</sub> was not measured directly. We feel that, all dynamic parameters should be measured to be sure that treatment with MCAK-Q710 indeed only changes f<sub>cat</sub>, or if not, an explanation as to why not.</italic> </p><p><italic>f<sub>cat</sub> is the predominant dynamic parameter of microtubules that has the power to dramatically change microtubule behavior. Therefore, the authors need to reliably quantify f<sub>cat</sub> by an appropriate method (e.g. speckle microscopy) and in addition measure all other dynamic parameters.</italic> </p><p>The main point we wanted to test with the MCAK-Q710 experiment was qualitative. Our theory predicts that any combination of changes in parameters can transform the growing aster to a stationary one and that this transition is marked by a finite jump in the aster growth velocity (i.e. gap velocity). We modified the main text to better convey the intent of this experiment with less focus on the need to change a single parameter. Our MCAK-Q710 experiments confirmed the expected qualitative behavior. We added the following sentence to relate the theory and experimental observation:</p><p>“In our model, this behavior is consistent with any change of parameter(s) that reduces the aster growth velocity (Eq. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>)) and arrests growth.”</p><p>In the literature, wild type MCAK is characterized as positive regulator of catastrophe events. Further, as the reviewer pointed out, <italic>f<sub>cat</sub></italic> is a critical parameter for microtubule dynamics. However, it was unclear which parameter(s) were actually affected by MCAK-Q710 during the transition.</p><p>We performed additional EB1 tracking experiments in the growing aster to measure <italic>V<sub>g</sub></italic> and <italic>f<sub>cat</sub></italic> as a function of MCAK-Q710 concentration. The results are presented as a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we found that neither <italic>V<sub>g</sub></italic> or <italic>f<sub>cat</sub></italic> were significantly altered with increasing MCAK-Q710. This was a rather surprising result, considering the wild type protein’s documented role in promoting catastrophe events. At this point, we can only speculate that MCAK-Q710 altered <italic>f<sub>res</sub></italic>, <italic>V<sub>s</sub></italic>, and/or the nucleation rate r to arrest aster growth in our experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Our speculation is consistent with the previous report that overexpression of MCAK-Q710 in cell lines found a significant reduction of tubulin polymer level (Ayana &amp; Wordeman, Biochem. J. 2004). To incorporate these new findings in the manuscript, we add the following paragraph to end our Results section:</p><p>“Finally, we asked which parameters in our model were altered in the MCAK-Q710 perturbation. […] Our data is consistent with the following three scenarios for how MCAK-Q710 antagonizes microtubule assembly: (i) increased depolymerization rate, (ii) decreased rescue rate, and/or (iii) decreased nucleation rate.”</p><p>Finally, we respond to the reviewer’s suggestion of speckle microscopy. Although single molecule lifetime imaging (via speckle microscopy) offers a timescale of tubulin turnover, it gives only one value and requires additional measurements or assumptions to constrain any of the four parameters in the two state model.</p><p>Even if we could measure all four parameters, it does not significantly add to our main observation of gap velocity. Thus, we chose to focus on the EB1-based analysis to directly address if and how <italic>V<sub>g</sub></italic> and <italic>f<sub>cat</sub></italic> changes in the MCAK-Q710 perturbation. We hope that our experiments and reasoning addressed the reviewers’ concerns with the MCAK-Q710 experiment.</p><p><italic>In addition, the reference given is misleading: In &quot;Tirnauer, J.
