Here, we tested the effect of a 6 week high-intensity training (HIT) regimen on measures of cognitive control and working memory in a multicenter, randomized (1:1 allocation), placebo-controlled trial. Methods: 318 children aged 7-13 years were randomly assigned to a HIT or an active control group matched for enjoyment and motivation. In the primary analysis, we compared improvements on six cognitive tasks representing two cognitive constructs (<italic>N</italic> = 305). Secondary outcomes included genetic data and physiological measurements. Results: The 6-week HIT regimen resulted in improvements on measures of cognitive control [BF<sub>M</sub> = 3.38, <italic>g</italic> = 0.31 (0.09, 0.54)] and working memory [BF<sub>M</sub> = 5233.68, <italic>g</italic> = 0.54 (0.31, 0.77)], moderated by <italic>BDNF</italic> genotype, with met<sup>66</sup> carriers showing larger gains post-exercise than val<sup>66</sup> homozygotes. Conclusion: This study suggests a promising alternative to enhance cognition, via short and potent exercise regimens. Clinical Trial Registration: Protocol #015078, University of Auckland.

People who perform well on tests of cardiovascular fitness also do well on tests of learning, memory and other cognitive skills. So far, studies have suggested that moderate intensity aerobic exercise that lasts for 30 to 40 minutes produces the greatest improvements in these brain abilities.</p><p>Recently, short high-intensity workouts that combine cardiovascular exercise and strength training have become popular. Studies have shown that these brief bouts of strenuous exercise improve physical health, but do these benefits extend to the brain? It would also be helpful to know if the effect that exercise has on the brain depends on an individual’s genetic makeup or physical health. This might help to match people to the type of exercise that will work best for them.</p><p>Now, Moreau et al. show that just 10 minutes of high-intensity exercise a day over six weeks can boost the cognitive abilities of children. In the experiments, over 300 children between 7 and 13 years of age were randomly assigned to one of two groups: one that performed the high-intensity exercises, or a ‘control’ group that took part in less active activities – such as quizzes and playing computer games – over the same time period. The children who took part in the high-intensity training showed greater improvements in cognitive skills than the children in the control group. Specifically, the high-intensity exercise boosted working memory and left the children better able to focus on specific tasks, two skills that are important for academic success.</p><p>Moreau et al. further found that the high-intensity exercises had the most benefit for the children who needed it most – those with poor cardiovascular health and those with gene variants that are linked to poorer cognitive skills. This suggests that genetic differences do alter the effects of exercise on the brain, but also shows that targeted exercise programs can offer everyone a chance to thrive.</p><p>Moreau et al. suggest that exercise need not be time consuming to boost brain health; the key is to pack more intense exercise in shorter time periods. Further work could build on these findings to produce effective exercise routines that could ultimately form part of school curriculums, as well as proving useful to anyone who wishes to improve their cognitive skills.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25062.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25062.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>cognitive enhancement</kwd><kwd>cognitive training</kwd><kwd>physical exercise</kwd><kwd>high-intensity training</kwd><kwd>neurogenetics</kwd><kwd>BDNF</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Centre for Brain Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>9133-3706255</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moreau</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Waldie</surname><given-names>Karen E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Short bursts of high-intensity exercise elicit robust improvements in core cognitive abilities, especially in individuals whose genotype is associated with lower cognitive performance.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Possibly the most reliable means to induce cognitive improvements behaviorally, physical exercise has become known for its effects on the brain in addition to its well-documented impact on the body (see for a review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Moreau and Conway, 2013</xref>). Individuals with higher cardiovascular fitness typically show higher performance on a wide range of cognitive measures, from cognitive control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Pontifex et al., 2011</xref>) to working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Erickson et al., 2013</xref>) and executive functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Colcombe and Kramer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hillman et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, long-term sport practice is associated with higher working memory capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Moreau, 2013</xref>), spatial ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Moreau, 2012</xref>), and more efficient visual processing of movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Güldenpenning et al., 2011</xref>). In neuroimaging studies, greater fitness indices have also been linked to differences in white matter integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chaddock-Heyman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Voss et al., 2013</xref>), as well as with larger hippocampal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Weinstein et al., 2012</xref>) and cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Erickson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Makizako et al., 2015</xref>). These results are corroborated by increased long-term potentiation (LTP) in the visual system of physically fit individuals compared to the non-fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Smallwood et al., 2015</xref>), a key finding given the primary role of LTP in major cognitive processes such as learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bliss and Collingridge, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">1973</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, these correlational findings are further supported by longitudinal designs. Exercise interventions can elicit cognitive improvements in diverse populations ranging from children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Davis et al., 2011</xref>) to the elderly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fabre et al., 2002</xref>), as well as in individuals with various clinical conditions such as developmental coordination disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Tsai et al., 2012</xref>) and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Pajonk et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, improvements appear to be dose-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Davis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Vidoni et al., 2015</xref>), and are not restricted to atypical or clinical populations—adults at their cognitive peak show similar benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Gomez-Pinilla and Hillman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Moreau and Conway, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Voss et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In school settings, exercise interventions have shown to be associated with higher levels of academic achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coe et al., 2006</xref>), and exercise regimens in children typically lead to improvements in various aspects of cognition, including executive function, cognitive control and memory (see for a review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Tomporowski et al., 2015a</xref>). Interventions implemented in early stages of life allow capitalizing on higher cortical plasticity, potentially maximizing their impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cotman and Berchtold, 2002</xref>). The appeal of early interventions has motivated a whole line of research exploring the effect of physical exercise regimens on behavior, cognitive function, and scholastic performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Castelli et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Davis et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Davis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Donnelly et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jackson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Pontifex et al., 2013</xref>). Consistent with these findings, Sibley et al. found a robust effect of physical exercise on cognitive function in children, in a meta-analytic assessment of the literature at the time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sibley and Etnier, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Most studies in this line of research have evaluated the impact of a rather specific type of regimen, based on aerobic exercise. Usually defined as a sustained regimen performed at moderate intensity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">McArdle et al., 2006</xref>), aerobic exercise has come to be accepted as the form of exercise typically associated with neural changes and cognitive enhancement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hillman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Thomas et al., 2012</xref>), for at least two reasons. First, current interventions are rooted in early findings in the animal literature, which typically investigated the effects of physical exercise in rodents—animals who naturally favor aerobic forms of exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Gould et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Shors et al., 2001</xref>). Second, the most dramatic gains in cognition have been observed in the elderly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Erickson et al., 2015</xref>; but see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Etnier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Young et al., 2015</xref>, for a more nuanced view), a population for which moderate-intensity exercise is seemingly most adequate. Subsequent studies have stemmed from this line of research, therefore expanding the initial paradigm to a wider range of populations.</p><p>Yet current trends of research suggest other promising directions. For example, regimens based on resistance training have shown sizeable effects on cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Best et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Liu-Ambrose et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">van Uffelen et al., 2007</xref>), despite underlying mechanisms of improvements being potentially different from those elicited by aerobic exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Goekint et al., 2010</xref>). More complex forms of motor training that combine high physical and cognitive demands also appear encouraging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Moreau et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Tomporowski et al., 2015b</xref>). Moreover, a compelling body of research in the field of exercise physiology indicates that interventions based on short, intense bursts of exercise can induce physiological changes that mirror those following aerobic exercise on a wide variety of outcomes. These include measures of cardiovascular function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chrysohoou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gayda et al., 2016</xref>), overall fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benda et al., 2015</xref>), and general health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Milanović et al., 2015</xref>). In some cases, physiological improvements following high-intensity training (HIT) can even go beyond those typically following aerobic regimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Rognmo et al., 2004</xref>). For example, HIT appears to be particularly effective to increase the release of neurotrophic factors essential to neuronal transmission, modulation and plasticity—potentially surpassing aerobic exercise regimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ferris et al., 2007</xref>). This body of research is promising, as it suggests a plausible mechanism by which intense bursts of exercise could meaningfully influence cognitive function and behavior.</p><p>A few studies have partially tested this idea. Short bouts of exercise have been shown to alleviate some of the difficulties typically associated with Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Piepmeier et al., 2015</xref>), demonstrating the potential of this type of intervention to enhance cognitive abilities. The benefits reported in this study were not limited to children diagnosed with ADHD, however—typical children also exhibited cognitive improvements. More strikingly perhaps, Pontifex and colleagues found that a single 20 min bout of exercise was sufficient to improve cognitive function and scholastic performance in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Pontifex et al., 2013</xref>). This is an impressive finding, given that exercise-induced cognitive improvements typically occur after longer training periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Etnier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sibley and Etnier, 2003</xref>). Importantly, these effects should be distinguished from short-term improvements immediately following acute bouts of exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Tomporowski, 2003</xref>), which typically dissipate after a few hours. The two types of outcomes (short-term consequences of single acute sessions vs. more durable benefits) are sometimes conflated, resulting in misleading conclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jackson et al., 2016</xref>). The hypothesized mechanisms are, however, different—heightened state of alertness induced by neurotransmitter increases for the former (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Tomporowski, 2003</xref>), and slower but more durable neurophysiological adaptations in the case of the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Erickson et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Erickson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Moreau and Conway, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Voss et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>One aspect that remains to be formerly investigated relates to the specific influence of exercise intensity. Although focused on short sessions, the aforementioned studies utilized regimens of moderate intensity—a reported 62–72% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Piepmeier et al., 2015</xref>) and 65–75% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Pontifex et al., 2013</xref>) of individual maximum heart rate, respectively. Yet based on findings from the physiological literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Rognmo et al., 2004</xref>), there are clear mechanisms via which exercising at a high intensity could influence cognition in a meaningful manner. Arguably, HIT could elicit improvements above and beyond those typically following short sessions of moderate intensity, and provide a legitimate, time-efficient alternative to longer aerobic exercise regimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Costigan et al., 2015</xref>). Together, the conjunction of promising early findings and clear mechanisms of action has prompted discussions to implement HIT interventions more systematically within the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Gray et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In an effort to better understand and predict individual responses to physical exercise interventions, several studies have investigated the role of specific genetic polymorphisms on the magnitude of exercise-induced improvements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Erickson et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Erickson et al., 2013</xref>). Among these, many have focused on the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (<italic>BDNF</italic>) val<sup>66</sup>met polymorphism, given its direct influence on serum <italic>BDNF</italic> concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lang et al., 2009</xref>). <italic>BDNF</italic> is known to support neuronal growth and has been shown to facilitate learning, a process that in turn induces <italic>BDNF</italic> production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berchtold et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cotman and Berchtold, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kesslak et al., 1998</xref>). This dynamic coupling makes <italic>BDNF</italic> an important underlying factor of exercise-induced cognitive improvements. Consistent with this idea, it has been proposed that individuals whose particular <italic>BDNF</italic> polymorphism is associated with lower activity-dependent <italic>BDNF</italic> levels (met<sup>66</sup> carriers) might benefit from exercise interventions to a greater extent than individuals whose activity-dependent <italic>BDNF</italic> levels are higher (val<sup>66</sup> homozygotes).</p><p>Similarly, a few studies have shown that individuals with lower cardiovascular function might maximize benefits from physical exercise interventions designed to improve cognitive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Sofi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Strong et al., 2005</xref>). The implicit assumption is that although lack of physical exercise might be a limiting factor for individuals whose fitness level is low, more active individuals might be less impacted by an exercise intervention program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Heyn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lautenschlager et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Sniehotta et al., 2006</xref>). Despite the intuitive appeal of this assumption, several studies, including one from our group, have failed to find a positive correlation between exercise-induced cognitive improvements and the associated physiological changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Moreau et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Tsai et al., 2014</xref>). Arguably, the absence of a clear link between the hypothesized physiological mechanisms of improvements and tangible cognitive gains might stem from the plurality and complexity of variables underlying these changes, rendering coherent associations elusive.</p><p>Despite similarities in the physiological mechanisms linking aerobic exercise and HIT on cognition, the precise impact of the latter on cognitive performance remains to be confirmed experimentally. In the present study, we tested the viability of HIT as a substitute for aerobic exercise to induce cognitive improvements in school populations. In particular, we postulated that HIT would result in improvements in measures of cognitive control and working memory, as both constructs have been linked to fitness levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Pontifex et al., 2011</xref>) and appear to be malleable via aerobic regimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Erickson et al., 2013</xref>). The choice of these constructs was also motivated by previous research showing the malleability of both cognitive control and working memory in training studies, thus providing theoretical and empirical support for the plausibility of expected improvements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hampshire et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mishra et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with recent efforts to better model and understand the mechanisms of cognitive improvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Young et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Moreau and Waldie, 2015</xref>), the present study also intended to address interindividual variability so as to isolate the underlying factors of improvement. Based on previous literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Erickson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Moreau et al., 2015</xref>), we hypothesized that exercise training would elicit substantially larger cognitive benefits in individuals whose cardiovascular fitness is low, and in <italic>BDNF</italic> met<sup>66</sup> carriers, whose activity-dependent <italic>BDNF</italic> levels are naturally limited. Finally, we expected physiological improvements with exercise, as typically induced from aerobic interventions (see for a review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Gomez-Pinilla and Hillman, 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed in R (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001905">SCR_001905</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Core Team R, 2016</xref>).

We defined outliers as values more than 3/2 times the upper quartile or less than 3/2 times the lower quartile of a given distribution, and systematically checked consistency of our results with and without inclusion.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Physiological improvements</title><p>Participants in the exercise group saw a greater decrease in resting heart rate than controls, as demonstrated by a Bayesian ANCOVA with <italic>Condition</italic> (HIT vs. Control) as a fixed factor and baseline heart rate as a covariate.

We confirmed the main hypothesis that exercise could induce gains in both cognitive control and working memory, as assessed from multiple measures. This finding is particularly promising given that the two constructs are reliable predictors of success in many domains, including professional and academic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Deary et al., 2007</xref>); in the classroom, cognitive control and working memory have been associated with effective learning and overall achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Rohde and Thompson, 2007</xref>). Importantly, these effects are also meaningful at the level of single tasks. Our main findings thus emphasize the potency of short but intense exercise interventions to enhance cognition, and suggests that aerobic exercise is not the sole means to elicit cognitive gains, in line with a growing body of research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Liu-Ambrose et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Moreau et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Pesce et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Tomporowski et al., 2015b</xref>).

As the substitution from valine to methionine at codon 66 typically results in decreases of activity-dependent secretion of <italic>BDNF</italic> at the synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Egan et al., 2003</xref>), <italic>BDNF</italic> met<sup>66</sup> carriers are thought to be particularly impacted by post-exercise <italic>BDNF</italic> increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Nascimento et al., 2015</xref>). Conversely, val<sup>66</sup> homozygotes might benefit less from <italic>BDNF</italic> increases given above-average baseline levels. This finding is interesting because of its predictive power−controlling for <italic>BDNF</italic> polymorphism can allow more accurate forecasting of individual training responses, and better estimates of effect size. Given the current trend toward more personalized interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Medalia and Richardson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Moreau and Waldie, 2015</xref>), factoring in genetic information has the potential to refine and improve regimens, for each individual.</p><p>Importantly, the main effect of exercise on cognitive function is unlikely to be explained by the placebo effect. Self-reported measures of enjoyment and motivation did not differ between groups, supporting the notion that both types of intervention were equally appealing to children, or at least not fundamentally different with respect to intrinsic motivating factors. In addition, we also controlled for mindset—the degree to which individuals believe their cognitive abilities can change over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dweck et al., 1995</xref>). Previous research suggests that individual mindsets may be of influence in cognitive growths: individuals with a more ‘malleable’ mindset are thought to be more likely to improve in cognitive and academic domains than individuals with a ‘fixed’ mindset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Paunesku et al., 2015</xref>). Although we did find a difference between conditions, it was to the advantage of children in the control group, who held a more malleable view about the dynamic properties of cognitive function than did the HIT group. This finding was reported as an additional analysis in the Results section, rather than in the main section, because the effect was not hypothesized <italic>a priori</italic>. In any case, and with warranted caution regarding <italic>post hoc</italic> interpretation, this effect would suggest that controls were <italic>more</italic> likely to improve over time, an assumption that was not corroborated by our main finding. If anything, this strengthens our main claim—greater improvements in the HIT condition are inconsistent with a differential placebo effect, a critical point in light of recent findings in the field of cognitive training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Foroughi et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Effort-dependent variables provided additional insight about the mechanism underlying improvements. Consistent with previous interventional studies that have investigated the influence of exercise on cognition, we actively monitored several variables throughout the intervention. We could thus ensure that training was adequate, performed at a suitable intensity, and could test directly the dynamic coupling of these variables and their effects on cognitive outcomes. Indeed, we found that almost all participants stayed within the overall targeted range of effort required by the design of the workout and by initial individual measurements. This indicates a high degree of agreement, or fidelity, to the intended protocol—an essential component of the intervention given the underlying assumption that participants would exercise at a high intensity. Performed at a more moderate intensity, the same regimen becomes an aerobic training program, for which substantially longer time commitment might be required to elicit improvements. In addition, it is important to note that participants incrementally increased workout load, thus maintaining appropriate intensity throughout the intervention. Arguably, this adaptive property emerged from the design of the intervention, whereby participants were encouraged to exercise at maximum intensity at the time of the workout—an intrinsically individual and dynamic variable by definition.</p><p>In the present study, the effect of exercise could also be appreciated on changes in resting heart rate from pretest to posttest, a finding that confirms previous research in the field (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Moreau et al., 2015</xref>). More specifically, exercise appears to be a valuable regulating mechanism, with elevated resting heart rate values likely to normalize as a result of HIT. This effect could not be attributed to regression toward the mean, as it was not found in controls, thus suggesting that the intervention is especially beneficial to individuals who need it most. Together with the finding that HIT benefited more individuals with a genetic polymorphism (<italic>BDNF</italic> met<sup>66</sup> carriers) that was associated with lower cognitive performance, this idea emphasizes the relevance of exercise interventions to individuals with specific genetic or physiological attributes to reduce interindividual differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Gómez-Pinilla et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Leckie et al., 2014</xref>). Disparities are genuine, yet targeted interventions allow low-performing individuals to improve dramatically.</p><p>Our design allowed delving deeper into the relationship between exercise and cognitive improvements. In particular, we found that change in resting heart rate was predictive of cognitive control, but not working memory, gains. This finding is of interest because we postulated that the mechanisms of improvement were physiological, given that HIT has been shown to elicit neurophysiological changes similar to those following aerobic exercise regimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ferris et al., 2007</xref>). However, we should point out that baseline resting heart rate did not predict gains in cognitive control or working memory in the HIT group, emphasizing the inherent noise associated with the relationship between physiological and cognitive measures. This lack of clear association between both types of variables is fairly common in the literature, suggesting that the hypothesized mechanisms of improvements are difficult to elucidate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Moreau et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Tsai et al., 2014</xref>). Potentially, this also suggests that other variables may be of importance, a question we attempted to address with additional measurements, in an exploratory manner (see Additional Analyses in the Results section).</p><p>Regardless of the strength of the evidence reported in the present study, one might question the genuine impact of such a short training regimen. Although perhaps counterintuitive, the extreme potency of short, intense bursts of exercise has come to light in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lucas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Rognmo et al., 2004</xref>). In a review of the impact of HIT on public health, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Biddle and Batterham, 2015</xref> go as far as to premise their entire argument on the idea that the cardio-metabolic health outcomes are not to be questioned—rather, their only concern was about whether or not such regimens can be widely implemented and sustained over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Biddle and Batterham, 2015</xref>). In a similar vein, Costigan and colleagues concluded that HIT is a time-efficient approach for improving cardiorespiratory fitness in adolescent populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Costigan et al., 2015</xref>). These are strong, unequivocal statements, which reflect current views in exercise physiology—HIT has tremendous health benefits, with little, if any, disadvantages.</p><p>More direct evidence for the impact of HIT on brain function comes from neurophysiological studies. In an experiment that directly assessed the impact of short bursts of exercise on BDNF levels, Ferris et al. found that exercise leads to BDNF increases, and that the magnitude of the increase is intensity-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ferris et al., 2007</xref>). This result emphasizes the importance of controlling exercise intensity in HIT studies, given that the main determinant of improvement appears to be the intensity of the workout. Indeed, previous studies have looked at the effect of short, but not intense, bursts of exercise on cognition, and found no clear evidence of improvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Craft, 1983</xref>). The high-intensity component of this type of exercise regimen is intended to allow for higher workout intensity than traditional workouts, despite shorter overall volume. The brevity of exercise, on the other hand, is simply a byproduct of intensity—one cannot maintain a near-maximal exercise intensity for long periods of time, given that this type of regimen depletes energetic resources rapidly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Parolin et al., 1999</xref>). In terms of practical implications, this aspect is critical, as it allows designing shorter, more potent workouts.</p><p>Despite our findings being in line with previous literature showing that short bursts of exercise can elicit potent cognitive improvements in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Piepmeier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Pontifex et al., 2013</xref>), and, more generally, with a wider, more general literature linking physical exercise and cognition in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jackson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sibley and Etnier, 2003</xref>), we should also point out a few limitations of the present study. These open up interesting avenues and directions for future research. First, the duration of training was not experimentally manipulated, and therefore the specific question of dose-dependence was not directly assessed. Therefore, we cannot claim that a 6 week regimen is optimal—larger cognitive improvements could possibly be elicited with longer durations, or, alternatively, similar improvements could be induced with a shorter intervention. Similarly, no follow-up tests were performed to assess durability of improvements post-training; although it should be noted that maintaining benefits is arguably less important with short, potent interventions such as the HIT regimen we proposed. In addition, both the duration of the intervention and the specific experimental protocol were constrained by external factors (e.g. feasibility, academic schedule). With respect to the potency of the intervention, however, this is also promising—as little as six weeks of training can induce noticeable improvements, with possible larger effects if physical exercise is sustained.</p><p>Related to this idea, we had to work around constraints typically imposed by interventional studies; namely, the necessity to keep testing sessions time-efficient. Beyond logistic considerations, this was also intended to minimize the influence of cognitive fatigue on our results. Despite time constraints, we aimed to preserve testing diversity (i.e., number of tasks per construct) for a few reasons. First, we strived to provide estimates of constructs that minimize task-specific components and extract meaningful domain-general scores. In psychometric testing of working memory capacity, Foster and colleagues demonstrated that the majority of the variance explained by a single WM task is accounted for in the first few blocks, and that the predictive nature of the task remains largely unchanged for practical purposes when tasks are shortened (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Foster et al., 2015</xref>). Second, simulation studies have shown that incorporating more tasks within constructs leads to a better signal-to-noise ratio, resulting in more meaningful measures of an underlying ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Moreau et al., 2016</xref>). To further validate this approach, we piloted different versions of our testing tasks and determined that the validity of the versions we retained for the present study was acceptable, given appropriate reliability across task lengths.</p><p>Second, because training occurred in schools, the environment was possibly less standardized and controlled than laboratory settings, highlighting typical tradeoffs between impoverished but highly reliable environments and ecological but less controlled settings. Our view remains that ecological validity is of primary importance when training cognitive abilities, because of the wide range of applications stemming from this line of research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Moreau and Conway, 2014</xref>). Accordingly, fixed, predictable training regimens are unlikely to favor durable improvements of cognitive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Moreau and Conway, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Moreau et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Posner et al., 2015</xref>). We have previously stressed the importance of novelty and variety in cognitive training interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Moreau and Conway, 2014</xref>), and this limitation applies to exercise regimens as well. Importantly, this echoes similar views across research groups worldwide, which suggest that training-induced cognitive improvements are often restricted to specific activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Harrison et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Tomporowski et al., 2012</xref>), and are best nurtured within complex, dynamic environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Diamond and Lee, 2011</xref>). Therefore, the regimen we have presented in this paper constitutes a potent short-term intervention, but more variety might be required to elicit long-lasting improvements. In a field that has suffered from setbacks such as lack of replication (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Redick et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Thompson et al., 2013</xref>) or common methodological flaws (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Moreau et al., 2016</xref>), it is wise to remain cautious about preliminary studies and emphasize the need for replication.</p><p>Despite these limitations, the present findings represent a promising first step toward reliable and affordable exercise-based cognitive interventions, highlighting effective alternatives to aerobic exercise. Together with complementary findings (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Moreau et al., 2015</xref>), the type of physical exercise regimen we described in this paper could pave the way for novel exercise interventions particularly suited to school environments, which are often constrained by time and equipment. The high-intensity workout we designed did not require any special equipment or any instructors training, and each 10 min session was all-inclusive with warm-up and stretching. Therefore, this type of regimen could also be generalized to other populations; for instance, individuals whose schedule allows little time for exercise, or those who do not intrinsically enjoy exercising, could appreciate opportunities to shorten workouts while preserving the typical benefits of exercise. Adaptations to older populations also represent interesting opportunities considering the benefits typically associated with exercise regimens in these communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Colcombe and Kramer, 2003</xref>). The present regimen might require adjustments, given that practicality in a specific context (e.g. managing time constraints in school or professional schedules) potentially differs from practical considerations in another (e.g. mitigating risks of injury in older populations). In any case, generalization is of the rationale, not necessarily of the specific workout that was designed for this intervention.</p><p>Finally, it is important to acknowledge that physical exercise, regardless of the specific training regimens considered, is not a panacea when it comes to addressing cognitive deficits−in some cases, especially in the presence of specific conditions or disorders, more targeted or individualized interventions might be required (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Moreau and Waldie, 2015</xref>), and the ability for exercise regimens to remediate core cognitive deficits might appear inherently limited. However, it remains that physical exercise is one of the most potent and wide-ranging means currently available to enhance cognition non-invasively, with a myriad of positive side effects.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>We report here a multicenter, randomized (1:1 allocation), placebo-controlled trial.

All cognitive assessments were computer-based, administered in groups of a maximum of 15 students. This limit on the number of participants tested at a given time was implemented to minimize potential averse effects of group testing. These assessments have shown to be adequate measures of both cognitive control and working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson-Hanley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aron and Poldrack, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kane et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Nee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Pajonk et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Rudebeck et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Unsworth and Engle, 2007</xref>).

The video-based workout did not require previous experience or knowledge, as it included basic fitness movements. All movements were designed so that participants could maintain their gaze fixed on the screen at all times. All instructions were provided both verbally (audio recording) and visually (on-screen captions). Complete details and script can be found in the online repository. A complete session lasted 10 min, and was scheduled every morning on weekdays. The control condition consisted of a blend of board games, computer games, and trivia quizzes, consistent with current recommendations regarding active control groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boot et al., 2013</xref>) and findings showing that aerobic exercise interventions typically do not differ from other regimens with respect to participants’ expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Stothart et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with this assumption, self-reported feedback indicated no difference in enjoyment or motivation between conditions, and no difference in mindsets regarding cognitive malleability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Paunesku et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Frequency and duration were matched between conditions. The intervention was 6 weeks long, with five sessions per week, for a total of 30 sessions. This translates to 300 min of actual exercise. There was no difference between groups regarding the number of sessions completed (<italic>M</italic> = 29.05, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.63, overall). Due to the nature of the intervention, class size was limited to 20 participants in both conditions. Participants were supervised at all times, to ensure a high degree of fidelity to the intended protocol. Participants did not differ between groups in any of the self-reported measures described previously, which include physical exercise habits. Note that participants did not exercise on the days of pretest and posttest, to prevent acute effects of physical exercise on cognitive performance (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Tomporowski, 2003</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>DM and KEW are supported by philanthropic donations from the Campus Link Foundation, the Kelliher Trust and Perpetual Guardian (as trustee of the Lady Alport Barker Trust).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Ivry (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Heidi Johansen-Berg (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Phillip Tomporowski (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers found the topic interesting, found much value in the study and found the paper to be well written. They were impressed by the large sample and thorough statistical treatment of the data. However, some key methodological details were missing, making it impossible to judge the paper in its current form. Given the importance of the topic, the reviewers agreed to invite a revision to clarify these issues so that they could then take a decision on whether the study meets the standards required for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The study design lacks details. Details are needed on how many schools were involved, how many children per school, how children/schools were randomised by condition and whether the statistical analyses take clustering effects (of school) into account.</p><p>2) The methods employed to measure children's cognitive performance lack sufficient detail. How were the tests administered; individually or group?</p><p>What was the testing environment?</p><p>Were the tests administered in the same order?</p><p>Could the authors comment on the role of proactive and retroactive interference?</p><p>There were a number of tests. What was the over-all duration of testing?</p><p>Could the authors comment on the possibility of changes in level of children's motivation? While an activity-control group was employed in this experiment, it clearly does not mean that the children are blinded to conditions, raising the possibility of expectancy effects altering children's motivation to perform during post testing. The authors attempt to address this issue (subsection “Intervention”). However, their assumptions concerning the motivational effects of exercise vs. non-exercise conditions were drawn from studies conducted with adults (Stothardt et al., 2014) or high school students (Paunesku, et al., 2015). There are clear developmental differences between the expectancies of 9-year old children's and those of adults.</p><p>Please justify the use of different number of trials based on individual asymptotes during each task, given that this approach is rarely used in the field.</p><p>Also, could the small number of trials (i.e. only 20 trials for flanker task, a minimum 12 trials for go/no go and working memory tasks) generate valid measure of cognitive control and working memory? Did each individual participant perform the same number of trials at pre- and post-test? If different numbers of trials were used, does such difference correlate with the performance change?</p><p>3) The exercise intervention lacks detail. Given the focus of the research is an implicit comparison between aerobic and HIT, it would seem important to detail the exercise regimen. Who instructed the children?</p><p>What was the average class size?</p><p>What instruction was provided?</p><p>What are &quot;core&quot; exercises?</p><p>Is practice required to perform these core exercises?</p><p>How were exercises timed?</p><p>What type of feedback was provided by instructors?</p><p>Were fidelity measures included in the training protocol? Without this information, it would be very difficult to replicate this experiment.</p><p>Also, the study used 80% of heart rate reserve (HRR) as the target HR during HIT workout. As far as we can tell, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> shows that the maximum HR during each workout appears to be approximately 140-150 in BPM, which is less likely to be equal to exercise intensity at 80% HRR. Instead, the HR data would suggest exercise intensity at light-to-moderate intensity in this age group according to the classification of physical activity intensity (ACSM, 2014). Please explain. Details of the HIT workout may also help explain why HR during the HIT workout did not meet the desired intensity.</p><p>4) As all data presented graphically are change scores it would be helpful to include summary scores on cognitive tests and fitness measures at for each timepoint so the reader can get a feel for how the children are performing on these tasks and what the differences translate to in terms of the raw scores.</p><p>5) Despite the significant findings, some readers may find it implausible that such a small amount of additional activity over a few weeks results in changes in cognitive performance. It would be helpful for the authors to say more about why this might be expected. Is there a threshold effect, for example, such that a small amount of additional activity may reach threshold for cognitive benefits?</p><p>It would also be helpful if they could provide data to support how much more daily/weekly energy expenditure the HIT intervention would deliver compared to the control activities. Such information regarding actual exercise volume/time (i.e. calories or 300 minutes) achieved over 6 weeks may be added to the limitation section, but meanwhile this information could also be used to suggest how much physical activity this intervention could contribute to the minimum daily/weekly recommendation for health benefit.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;High-intensity Training Enhances Executive Function in Children&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor and three reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>We are sorry for that it has taken some time to review the manuscript. In addition to consulting with the original reviewers we also sought input from a statistical reviewer to assess specifically the degree to which the study complies with the CONSORT guidelines for reporting of randomised controlled trials. Some changes are required to meet those guidelines:</p><p>In general, the reviewers agreed that transparency for this study is good, all the analysis scripts are made available through GitHUB. The randomisation procedure is clear and blinding has been considered.</p><p>Though the CONSORT checklist is reported, the paper has not been written in the spirit of the guidelines. This is a randomised trial where the effect of an intervention was compared to a control intervention for cognitive improvement in children. While the trial design is mentioned on the first page, CONSORT requires the trial be identified as randomised in the title. The Abstract should then focus on the design of the trial rather than be written in a narrative style.</p><p>Also the key result with point estimate and confidence interval needs to be presented in the Abstract. I realise that this is not the usual style for <italic>eLife</italic> but some concession should be made so that the CONSORT requirements are met.</p><p>CONSORT requires the primary and secondary outcomes to be specified. This report does not state which outcome is the primary outcome (usually this is the measurement that the sample size calculation was calculated for). The sample size statement in the protocol states 129 per group are required to detect an effect size of 0.35 with power of 80% at 5% significance level. This suggests that the study is powered for a single primary research question, but a primary outcome is not listed instead there are many outcomes listed under several sections. So it is not clear which outcome the difference of 0.35 relates to. While the statistical analysis proposed is Bayesian the arguments over repeated testing still hold if you want to present evidence that the intervention does improve outcomes. Results are frequently presented with statistical hypothesis tests and p-values, but the term 'statistically significant' is often abbreviated to 'significant' which is to be avoided. The authors need to be careful to always present the weight of the evidence in a p-value <italic>and</italic> also report a corresponding effect size with 95% confidence interval.</p><p>As a single primary outcome was not specified a priori it would be helpful if the Abstract communicated the size of the trial and the number of outcomes that were considered in the full protocol, so the statistical significance can be put in context.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25062.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The study design lacks details. Details are needed on how many schools were involved, how many children per school, how children/schools were randomised by condition and whether the statistical analyses take clustering effects (of school) into account.</italic> </p><p>More information about the number of schools involved and characteristics of the participants have been added in the Participants section. Of particular relevance here:</p><p>“They were recruited from six schools across New Zealand, providing a sample of various socioeconomic deciles (three public institutions, three private), locations (three urban institutions, three rural), and ethnic backgrounds representative for the country (70% New Zealand European, 20% Pacific, 7% Asian, 3% Other). The number of students involved per school ranged from 5 to 83 (<italic>M</italic> = 50.8, <italic>SD</italic> = 31).”</p><p>Concerning randomization, we have added the sentence: “Group allocation was performed at the individual level”, to make it explicit that this was not a cluster randomized trial, but a trial in which every child was assigned to a group randomly.</p><p>More generally, details about the intervention have been added to the Materials and methods section and can be found with the source code we have provided (especially HIT_workout_script.txt). We discuss these thoroughly hereafter.</p><p><italic>2) The methods employed to measure children's cognitive performance lack sufficient detail. How were the tests administered; individually or group?</italic> </p><p><italic>What was the testing environment?</italic> </p><p>This information has been added to the Cognitive Assessments section:</p><p>“Testing was conducted on school premises. All cognitive assessments were computer-based, administered in groups of a maximum of 15 students. This limit on the number of participants tested at a given time was implemented to minimize potential averse effects of group testing.”</p><p><italic>Were the tests administered in the same order?</italic> </p><p>In the original manuscript, we stated: “The order below was the order of presentation for every participant at both pretest and posttest. Both testing sessions were scheduled at the same time of the day.” To ensure that this is explicit, we have added the order of presentation in parentheses. This passage now reads: “The order below was the order of presentation for every participant at both pretest and posttest (i.e., Flanker – Go/no-go – Stroop – Backward digit span – Backward Corsi blocks – Visual 2-back).”</p><p><italic>Could the authors comment on the role of proactive and retroactive interference?</italic> </p><p>Because this comment comes immediately after the question about the order of tasks, we assumed that it was in relation to proactive and retroactive interference between tasks. The design was fixed with regard to tasks order, as it was more suitable to the hypotheses of the study. More specifically, we opted for a fixed order for the following reasons:</p><p>1) The main problem related to order effects is that it can confound treatment effects if the treatment and control conditions present problems in different orders. A fixed order solves most of the related problems;</p><p>2) Couterbalancing is important to establish the separate validity of each of the tasks, whereas we were interested in generating constructs to be compared across time, rather than comparing tasks with each other within a time point. In addition, counterbalancing is critical when a limited number of version for a given test exist a priori; in contrast, all our tasks when randomly generated;</p><p>3) Finally, with six tasks the number of permutations is 6! = 720. Even Latin Square designs fail to provide appropriate solutions, and introduce additional confounds.</p><p>For the reasons stated above, we opted for a fixed-order design, consistent with traditional methods in psychometric testing.</p><p><italic>There were a number of tests. What was the over-all duration of testing?</italic> </p><p>We have added an estimate of duration for the cognitive testing session in the Materials and methods section: “Both testing sessions were scheduled at the same time of the day, and lasted approximately one hour.” As an aside, cognitive testing was reduced to the minimum possible without threatening tests validity (see our comment on the number of trials below).</p><p><italic>Could the authors comment on the possibility of changes in level of children's motivation? While an activity-control group was employed in this experiment, it clearly does not mean that the children are blinded to conditions, raising the possibility of expectancy effects altering children's motivation to perform during post testing. The authors attempt to address this issue (subsection “Intervention”). However, their assumptions concerning the motivational effects of exercise vs. non-exercise conditions were drawn from studies conducted with adults (Stothardt et al., 2014) or high school students (Paunesku, et al., 2015). There are clear developmental differences between the expectancies of 9-year old children's and those of adults.</italic> </p><p>This is an excellent point, one that needs to be accounted for in any training design. We measured self-reported enjoyment and motivation after the intervention, and compared these between groups. This was initially reported in the Intervention section, but this is technically a finding that better belongs to the Results section, where it has now been edited:</p><p>“There was no difference between groups regarding self-reported enjoyment or motivation (<italic>W</italic> = 12058, <italic>p</italic> =.54 and <italic>W</italic> = 11497, <italic>p</italic> =.86, respectively). This finding allows controlling for expectation effects, and thus stronger causal claims (Boot, Simons, Stothart, and Stutts, 2013; Stothart, Simons, Boot, and Kramer, 2014)</p><p>This is in addition to the significant difference in terms of malleability <italic>in favor of the Control group,</italic> which suggests a potential for greater improvements in Controls:</p><p>“In addition, participants’ self-reported belief about cognitive malleability (i.e., mindset) indicated a significant difference (p &lt;.03) in favor of the control group (<italic>M</italic> = 7.11, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.65 and <italic>M</italic> = 6.42, SD = 2.74, respectively).”</p><p>This further strengthens our main claim, namely that HIT elicits greater cognitive improvements than the control intervention, despite a more fixed mindset. We do not speculate on this effect in the main text of the paper, however, given that we did not hypothesize the effect a priori.</p><p><italic>Please justify the use of different number of trials based on individual asymptotes during each task, given that this approach is rarely used in the field.</italic></p><p><italic>Also, could the small number of trials (i.e. only 20 trials for flanker task, a minimum 12 trials for go/no go and working memory tasks) generate valid measure of cognitive control and working memory? Did each individual participant perform the same number of trials at pre- and post-test? If different numbers of trials were used, does such difference correlate with the performance change?</italic> </p><p>We made sure that reliability was adequate for the versions we proposed in the present experiment, via validation on an independent data set (Spearman-Brown prophecy formula). Trial length did not correlate with performance; information about reliability has been added to the Materials and methods section, to justify using the cognitive tasks in this manner:</p><p>“Unless specified otherwise, the number of trials varied based on individual performance to allow reaching asymptotes, with a minimum and a maximum specified for each task. […] Specifically, reliability was calculated by comparing test scores on the asymptotic version vs., the maximal-length version, for each task (see trial length details below and online repository for source code data).”</p><p>We corroborate this view with additional literature in the Discussion section:</p><p>“Despite time constraints, we aimed to preserve testing diversity (i.e., number of tasks per construct) for a few reasons. First, we strived to provide estimates of constructs that minimize task-specific components and extract meaningful domain-general scores. […] To further validate this approach, we piloted different versions of our testing tasks and determined that the validity of the versions we retained for the present study was acceptable, given appropriate reliability across task lengths.”</p><p>Finally, we included to the linked online repository the file Reliability_indices.csv, which contains all indices across tasks (subsection “Cognitive Assessments”).</p><p><italic>3) The exercise intervention lacks detail. Given the focus of the research is an implicit comparison between aerobic and HIT, it would seem important to detail the exercise regimen. Who instructed the children?</italic> </p><p>This information has been added to the Intervention section:</p><p>“All instructions were provided both verbally (audio recording) and visually (on-screen captions). Complete details and script can be found in the online repository.”</p><p><italic>What was the average class size?</italic> </p><p>This information has been added to the Intervention section:</p><p>“Due to the nature of the intervention, class size was limited to 20 participants in both conditions.”</p><p><italic>What instruction was provided?</italic> </p><p>The complete script of the HIT workout is freely available online (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/davidmoreau">https://github.com/davidmoreau</ext-link>/HIT). The file HIT_workout_script.txt includes all instructions and triggers of the video.</p><p><italic>What are &quot;core&quot; exercises?</italic> </p><p>In the initial version of the manuscript, we used the terminology “core” of the session to describe the high-intensity part of the training. For clarity, this term has now been replaced by the more explicit “short bursts”, which we believe describes more accurately this part of the protocol.</p><p><italic>Is practice required to perform these core exercises?</italic> </p><p>This is an important aspect of the workout that was not emphasized enough in the initial version of the manuscript. We have now added:</p><p>“The video-based workout did not require previous experience or knowledge, as it included basic fitness movements. […] All instructions were provided both verbally and on-screen. Complete details and script can be found in the online repository.”</p><p>For the interested reader, and for the purpose of replicability, all instructions and second-by-second details of the workout can be found in the online repository, as mentioned:</p><p>“R code and data are freely available on GitHub (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/davidmoreau">https://github.com/davidmoreau</ext-link>). The repository includes data sets, R scripts, details and script of the HIT workout, the CONSORT flow diagram and the CONSORT checklist.”</p><p><italic>How were exercises timed?</italic> </p><p>Timing was maintained via screen-based instructions, and ensured by adult supervision. We made this explicit in the manuscript with the following: “Participants were supervised at all times, to ensure a high degree of fidelity to the intended protocol”. Adequate fidelity to the protocol was also ensured post-session with the minutes of activity measure provided by activity trackers.</p><p><italic>What type of feedback was provided by instructors?</italic> </p><p>No feedback was provided by the instructors, to avoid introducing confounds in the intervention. This was meant to allow more rigorous matching between conditions (HIT vs. control).</p><p><italic>Were fidelity measures included in the training protocol? Without this information, it would be very difficult to replicate this experiment.</italic> </p><p>Fidelity to the intended protocol was fundamental to the present experiment, given that the rationale is about intensity of physical exercise. We reiterate this point in the Discussion:</p><p>“This indicates a high degree of agreement, or fidelity, to the intended protocol—an essential component of the intervention given the underlying assumption that participants would exercise at a high intensity. […] Arguably, this adaptive property emerged from the design of the intervention, whereby participants were encouraged to exercise at maximum intensity at the time of the workout—an intrinsically individual and dynamic variable by definition.”</p><p>More specifically, this was the rationale for monitoring exercise via activity trackers, and for presenting the accuracy ratio, a measure of fidelity to the protocol (see figure below). To make sure that this is further emphasized in the paper, we have added the following to the Discussion:</p><p>“We could thus ensure that training was adequate, performed at a suitable intensity, and could test directly the dynamic coupling of these variables and their effects on cognitive outcomes. Indeed, we found that almost all participants stayed within the overall targeted range of effort required by the design of the workout and by initial individual measurements.”</p><p>We further detail the importance of controlling for the intensity of exercise in this type of design:</p><p>“This result emphasizes the importance of controlling exercise intensity in HIT studies, given that the main determinant of improvement appears to be the intensity of the workout. […] The high-intensity component of this type of exercise regimen is intended to allow for higher workout intensity than traditional workouts, despite shorter overall volume.”</p><p><italic>Also, the study used 80% of heart rate reserve (HRR) as the target HR during HIT workout. As far as we can tell, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> shows that the maximum HR during each workout appears to be approximately 140-150 in BPM, which is less likely to be equal to exercise intensity at 80% HRR. Instead, the HR data would suggest exercise intensity at light-to-moderate intensity in this age group according to the classification of physical activity intensity (ACSM, 2014). Please explain. Details of the HIT workout may also help explain why HR during the HIT workout did not meet the desired intensity.</italic> </p><p>In the initial version of the manuscript, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> showed<italic>δ</italic> HR<sub>Max</sub> averaged over all participants for a given session, as a function of session. This was thought to better convey both HR<sub>Max</sub> and <italic>δ</italic> in a single graph (HR<sub>Target</sub> = HR<sub>Rest</sub> + <italic>δ</italic> HR<sub>Max</sub> – <italic>δ</italic> HR<sub>Rest</sub>). However, we acknowledge that this may be confusing for the reader, for the reasons outlined by the reviewers. Therefore, we have now rescaled the ordinate to show uncorrected HR<sub>Max</sub> (i.e. measured HR<sub>Max</sub>) values across sessions. Combined with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> shows the adaptive property of the workout – namely, maximum heart rate is maintained over time, despite decreasing resting heart rate, to accommodate increasing workout volume. The complete script of the HIT workout is freely available online (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/davidmoreau">https://github.com/davidmoreau</ext-link>/HIT). The file HIT_workout_script.txt includes all instructions and triggers of the video.</p><p><italic>4) As all data presented graphically are change scores it would be helpful to include summary scores on cognitive tests and fitness measures at for each timepoint so the reader can get a feel for how the children are performing on these tasks and what the differences translate to in terms of the raw scores.</italic> </p><p>This is an excellent point—we have added a new table that presents descriptive for each task and measurement (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl6">Table 6</xref>).</p><p><italic>5) Despite the significant findings, some readers may find it implausible that such a small amount of additional activity over a few weeks results in changes in cognitive performance. It would be helpful for the authors to say more about why this might be expected. Is there a threshold effect, for example, such that a small amount of additional activity may reach threshold for cognitive benefits?</italic> </p><p>We appreciate the opportunity to clarify our contribution. We have further described the hypothesized mechanisms of improvements in the Introduction and the Discussion.</p><p>The Introduction now states:</p><p>“In some cases, physiological improvements following high-intensity training (HIT) can even go beyond those typically following aerobic regimens (Rognmo, Hetland, Helgerud, Hoff, and Siørdahl, 2004). […] Together, the conjunction of promising findings and clear mechanisms of action has prompted discussions to implement HIT interventions more systematically within the community (Gray, Ferguson, Birch, Forrest, and Gill, 2016).”</p><p>The Discussion details further the postulated mechanisms of improvement:</p><p>“Regardless of the strength of the evidence reported in the present study, one might question the genuine impact of such a short training regimen. […] In terms of practical implications, this aspect is critical, as it allows designing shorter, more potent workouts.”</p><p><italic>It would also be helpful if they could provide data to support how much more daily/weekly energy expenditure the HIT intervention would deliver compared to the control activities. Such information regarding actual exercise volume/time (i.e. calories or 300 minutes) achieved over 6 weeks may be added to the limitation section, but meanwhile this information could also be used to suggest how much physical activity this intervention could contribute to the minimum daily/weekly recommendation for health benefit.</italic> </p><p>We have added this information to the Materials and methods section:</p><p>“Frequency and duration were matched between conditions. The intervention was 6-weeks long, with five sessions per week, for a total of 30 sessions. This translates to 300 min of actual exercise.”</p><p>The Discussion section provides more details about the cardio-metabolic outcomes of HIT interventions, and therefore puts in context the overall low volume of exercise in the intervention:</p><p>“In a review of the impact of HIT on public health, Biddle and Batterham (2015) go as far as to premise their entire argument on the idea that the cardio-metabolic health outcomes are not to be questioned – rather, their only concern was about whether or not such regimens can be widely implemented and sustained over time (Biddle &amp; Batterham, 2015). In a similar vein, Costigan and colleagues concluded that HIT is a time-efficient approach for improving cardiorespiratory fitness in adolescent populations (Costigan, Eather, Plotnikoff, Taaffe, and Lubans, 2015).</p><p>However, it is important to note that exercise recommendations are often expressed in terms of time commitment rather than workout intensities, and that these figures are typically framed in the context of aerobic exercise activities (e.g., Manore et al., 2014). Therefore, estimates based on these figures and applied to non-aerobic interventions may be fundamentally inaccurate.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>We are sorry for that it has taken some time to review the manuscript. In addition to consulting with the original reviewers we also sought input from a statistical reviewer to assess specifically the degree to which the study complies with the CONSORT guidelines for reporting of randomised controlled trials. Some changes are required to meet those guidelines:</italic> </p><p><italic>In general, the reviewers agreed that transparency for this study is good, all the analysis scripts are made available through GitHUB. The randomisation procedure is clear and blinding has been considered.</italic> </p><p><italic>Though the CONSORT checklist is reported, the paper has not been written in the spirit of the guidelines. This is a randomised trial where the effect of an intervention was compared to a control intervention for cognitive improvement in children. While the trial design is mentioned on the first page, CONSORT requires the trial be identified as randomised in the title.</italic> </p><p>The title has been edited to:</p><p>“High-intensity Training Enhances Executive Function in Children in a Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trial”.</p><p><italic>The Abstract should then focus on the design of the trial rather than be written in a narrative style.</italic> </p><p><italic>Also the key result with point estimate and confidence interval needs to be presented in the Abstract. I realise that this is not the usual style for eLife but some concession should be made so that the CONSORT requirements are met.</italic> </p><p>The Abstract has been edited to meet the CONSORT requirements, while ensuring it remains within the 150-word limit. In particular, primary and secondary outcomes are now explicit:</p><p>“318 children aged 7-13 years were randomly assigned to a HIT or an active control group matched for enjoyment and motivation. In the primary analysis, we compared improvements on six cognitive tasks representing two cognitive constructs (<italic>N</italic> = 305). Secondary outcomes included genetic data and physiological measurements.”</p><p>In addition, the main result is now presented in the Abstract, in the “Results” subsection:</p><p>“The 6-week HIT regimen resulted in improvements on measures of cognitive control [BF<sub>M</sub> = 3.38, g = 0.31 (0.09, 0.54)] and working memory [BF<sub>M</sub> = 5233.68, <italic>g</italic> = 0.54 (0.31, 0.77)], moderated by BDNF genotype, with met<sup>66<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71"/></sup>carriers showing larger gains post-exercise than val<sup>66</sup> homozygotes.”</p><p><italic>CONSORT requires the primary and secondary outcomes to be specified. This report does not state which outcome is the primary outcome (usually this is the measurement that the sample size calculation was calculated for). The sample size statement in the protocol states 129 per group are required to detect an effect size of 0.35 with power of 80% at 5% significance level. This suggests that the study is powered for a single primary research question, but a primary outcome is not listed instead there are many outcomes listed under several sections. So it is not clear which outcome the difference of 0.35 relates to. While the statistical analysis proposed is Bayesian the arguments over repeated testing still hold if you want to present evidence that the intervention does improve outcomes.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for pointing this out. The primary and secondary outcomes are now clearly labeled in the Abstract and in text (subsection “Cognitive Improvements”). In addition, the power analysis now explicitly refers to the primary outcome measures:</p><p>“Note that an a priori power analysis based on previous studies (Erickson et al., 2013; Moreau et al., 2015) indicated the need for a minimum <italic>N</italic> of 129 participants per group to detect an effect of <italic>d</italic> = 0.35 on the primary outcome measures, with 1 – <italic>β</italic> =.80 and <italic>α</italic> =.05.” This allowed us to define our sample size based on the effects observed in Erickson et al., 2013 and Moreau et al., 2015. In addition to focusing on well-defined constructs, rather than multiple single measures, we also used Bayesian methods (both hypothesis testing and parameter estimation) that are robust to typical problems associated with multiple comparisons (Dienes, 2008; Gelman, 2008). Of course, this argument falls short when presenting the frequentist analyses, but those are reported for transparency and to reach a wider audience, and therefore are “equivalent” in the sense of being the typical alternative tests, yet not necessarily in the exact interpretation of the results. With this in mind, the interaction effects for Cognitive Control and Working Memory (<italic>p</italic> =.008 and <italic>p</italic> &lt;.001, respectively) still remain largely significant after a Bonferroni correction.</p><p><italic>Results are frequently presented with statistical hypothesis tests and p-values, but the term 'statistically significant' is often abbreviated to 'significant' which is to be avoided. The authors need to be careful to always present the weight of the evidence in a p-value and also report a corresponding effect size with 95% confidence interval.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for pointing out this oversight. The term ‘significant’, when referring to statistical significance, has now been systematically replaced with the latter (see “Frequentist Analyses” section). In addition, all effect sizes (<italic>g, η</italic><sup>2</sup>) are now accompanied by 95% confidence intervals (we have replaced Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> with Hedges’ <italic>g</italic>, to correct for bias when sample sizes are unequal between groups). RMSE have also been added to all <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> values. Finally, the error term in Bayesian analyses, expressed in percentage, is also a measure of uncertainty (about the model, in this case). These are included in all tables for model comparison (2, 3, and 4).</p><p><italic>As a single primary outcome was not specified a priori it would be helpful if the Abstract communicated the size of the trial and the number of outcomes that were considered in the full protocol, so the statistical significance can be put in context.</italic> </p><p>This information has been added to the Abstract in its new format:</p><p>“318 children aged 7-13 years were randomly assigned to a HIT or an active control group matched for enjoyment and motivation. In the primary analysis, we compared improvements on six cognitive tasks representing two cognitive constructs (<italic>N</italic> = 305). Secondary outcomes included genetic data and physiological measurements.”</p><p>Word space (150) limits our ability to provide details in the Abstract, but all the outcomes measured are listed in the main manuscript (Materials and methods) and in the Statistical Analysis Plan.</p></body></sub-article></article>
