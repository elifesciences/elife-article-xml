A promising approach to non-viral vectors makes use of DNA/cationic liposome complexes (lipoplexes) to deliver the genetic material. Here we use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying efficient DNA transfer from lipoplexes. Our computational fusion experiments of lipoplexes with endosomal membrane models show two distinct modes of transfection: parallel and perpendicular. In the parallel fusion pathway, DNA aligns with the membrane surface, showing very quick release of genetic material shortly after the initial fusion pore is formed. The perpendicular pathway also leads to transfection, but release is slower. We further show that the composition and size of the lipoplex, as well as the lipid composition of the endosomal membrane, have a significant impact on fusion efficiency in our models.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>non-viral vector</kwd><kwd>transfection</kwd><kwd>lipoplex</kwd><kwd>molecular dynamics</kwd><kwd>martini</kwd><kwd>dotap</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>COMP-MICR-CROW-MEM</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marrink</surname><given-names>Siewert-Jan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The molecular insight in lipoplex transfection mechanisms helps in the development of efficient and affordable gene delivery systems.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gene therapy is a promising technique with a wide applicability. The first clinical trials with gene therapy started in the early 90’s, and the first approved therapy being introduced in Europe in 2012 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cressey, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blaese et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hanna et al., 2017</xref>). Even though the concept of gene therapy has been around for a while, the problem remains to target and enter the right cells, without being toxic to the rest of the organism.</p><p>Most higher organisms have evolved quite stringent measures to block uptake of DNA from their surroundings, preventing excessive genetic instability. Naked DNA gets quickly degraded in our body by exonucleases, whereas using viruses as vectors can lead to a strong acquired immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nayak and Herzog, 2010</xref>). Therefore, ‘new’ non-viral based vectors are being developed. Non-viral vectors have two advantages, first, they do not trigger a specific immune response, and second, they are potentially much cheaper than viral vectors. Most non-viral vectors use cationic lipids or polymers for complexation with the negatively charged DNA, concealing the genetic material from degradation. The major downside to many of these non-viral based methods, is that their transfection rates in vivo are rather low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tros de Ilarduya et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rezaee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nayerossadat et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, lipoplexes are potentially toxic especially if they are highly positively charged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang and Li, 1997</xref>).</p><p>In this work we focus on cationic lipid-DNA based vectors, called lipoplexes. Lipoplexes consist of (cationic) lipids whose role is twofold. One, they shield the genetic material from degradation, and two, the lipids support transfection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ciani et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Felgner et al., 1987</xref>). Upon exposure of the vector to cells, the cells incorporate the lipoplex by means of endocytosis, causing the complex to subsequently reside in the early and late endosome, and finally to be degraded in the lysosome. It is therefore important for the genetic material to escape the endosome before it gets degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">ur Rehman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rejman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zuhorn et al., 2007</xref>). This escape from the endosome is one of the least understood and inefficient steps in current lipoplex or polymer mediated gene therapy and improving endosomal escape might improve transfection efficiency drastically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Degors et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Due to the microscopic scale and dynamic nature of lipoplex-membrane fusion, it has proven very difficult by experimental means to relate physico-chemical properties of the vector to transfection efficiency. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide an alternative tool to study molecular processes in atomic, or near atomic detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marrink et al., 2019</xref>). In particular coarse-grained (CG) models such as Martini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marrink et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Uusitalo et al., 2015</xref>) have proven popular, trading some of the atomic detail for a computational speedup and enabling direct simulation of membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Markvoort and Marrink, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Smirnova et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pannuzzo et al., 2014</xref>). Here we use the Martini model to simulate the fusion between nanoscale lipoplexes and endosomal model membranes and vesicles. We are able to resolve the molecular details of the fusion process, including the full release of the lipoplex cargo, short fragments of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), across the endosomal membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Construction and validation of the lipoplex model</title><p>To investigate the escape of genetic material from a lipoplex inside a model endosome, we first constructed and validated a small lipoplex (~18 nm in diameter, 4 fragments of 24 bp dsDNA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Our lipoplex formulation consists of 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP) as the cationic lipid to bind the dsDNA, and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3- phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) as the helper lipid, at a 1:4 DOTAP/DOPE ratio. This complex is known to form the inverted hexagonal phase (H<sub>II</sub>) in complex with dsDNA at this ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Corsi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koltover et al., 1998</xref>). Starting from a multilamellar initial configuration, with the dsDNA sandwiched in between the lamella, we observe spontaneous formation of the inverted hexagonal phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), consistent with the experimental behavior. After removing periodic boundary conditions and coating the aggregate with an additional layer of DOTAP and DOPE, we arrive at our small lipoplex model which proves stable during a 10 μs simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>). To validate our model, we compared the dsDNA spacing inside the solvated lipoplex with the available SAXS data from literature. This showed that the liquid crystal lattice of the inverted hexagonal phase in our solvated CG lipoplex was very close to the experimental data (6.0 ± 0.1 nm compared to 6.1 nm for SAXS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Corsi et al., 2010</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic view of the lipoplex-membrane transfection pathways.</title><p>Unadhered lipoplex containing four dsDNAs sits above the endosomal bilayer (I).

The water contacts (&lt;1.5 nm) with the lipoplex were calculated using the inhouse VMD counting script. The solvation of the lipoplex shows the same trend as the radius of gyration also confirming that the lipoplex is stable and can be used for transfection.

Clearly, real endosomal membranes are much more complex concerning lipid composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van Meer et al., 2008</xref>). However, to a large extent, the exact composition is unknown (especially concerning asymmetry) and varies between endosomal stage and cell type. Given the large complexity of the simulated systems, we decided to keep the endosomal membrane composition as simple as possible, with PC as main phospholipid. PS was added as it was hypothesized before that anionic lipids could play an important role in the transfection mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tarahovsky et al., 2004</xref>). Both PC and PS lipids had a mixture of diC14:0 (dimyristoyl), diC14:1,9 c (dimyristoleoyl) and C14:0-C14:1,9 c (myristoyl-myristoleoyl) tails at a 1:1:2 ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The relatively short lipid tails were chosen because pore formation for longer tailed lipids have been shown to be too energetically unfavourable for the CG Martini lipids compared to their all-atom counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cohen and Melikyan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bennett and Tieleman, 2011</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Membrane and lipoplex compositions.</title><p>The membrane compositions for the fusion experiments, and the lipoplex formulations are indicated in molar ratios.

To monitor fusion we used: (i) lipid mixing, (ii) DNA-water contacts, and (iii) visual inspection. At the 10 µs time scale using unbiased simulations, we did not obtain sufficient dehydration of the lipoplex membrane interface for fusion to proceed (data not shown). Dehydration of the membrane-membrane interface is a known kinetic barrier for membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leikin et al., 1987</xref>), therefore we changed the initial set-up of the fusion experiment and started from a dehydrated state, with one of the corners of the lipoplex pointing toward the endosomal membrane. The dehydrated systems either remained in their dehydrated state, resulting eventually in the formation of a fusion stalk, or the membrane would rehydrate – from which dehydration was never observed. Since the formation of the fusion stalk has been described at many levels of detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Knecht and Marrink, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aeffner, 2012</xref>), and is widely accepted as an essential step in any fusion pathway, we decided to start our further transfection experiments from the stalk state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1II</xref>), allowing for a more systematic approach.</p><p>We then performed five replica simulations, each ten microseconds long, starting from the stalk state. In each case, the system evolved to fusion of the lipoplex with the endosomal membrane, with the cargo being delivered across the target membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). The initial stalk rapidly decays (on a time scale of 10–100 ns), expanding radially, leading to a so-called hemifusion diaphragm (HD) state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kozlovsky et al., 2002</xref>) in which the inner lipoplex coat and the external endosomal membrane are in direct contact, exchanging lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1III</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">5</xref>). Transfection subsequently proceeds via two different pathways, depending on the orientation of dsDNA either parallel or perpendicular with respect to the membrane normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1IV</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">5</xref>). For perpendicular transfection to the bilayer normal, an initial pore is formed at the rim of the hemifusion diaphragm, this causes rapid unzipping of lipids away from one dsDNA fragment. This unzipping results in a pore as large as the dsDNA fragment effectively transfecting the DNA by moving the lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1IVa</xref>), indicated by a rapid increase in hydration of the dsDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">5</xref>). For parallel transfection, a pore is formed at the place where the nearest dsDNA fragment is pointing at the HD. Pore formation is then followed by ‘ejection’ of this dsDNA fragment, resembling the unloading of a syringe, by moving both the dsDNA and lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1IVb</xref>). Visual inspection of the unloading process (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>) reveals that the dsDNA moves out of the channel concomitantly to the merging of the surrounding lipids with the endosomal membrane. This suggests that the release of curvature stress of the lipoplex (as the lipoplex channel lipid composition gets mixed with the endosomal lipids, the H<sub>II</sub> phase becomes destabilized) acts as the driving force pushing the DNA into the cytosol.</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-52012-video1.mp4"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Small lipoplex-bilayer transfection.</title><p>Fusion of a small lipoplex containing 4 fragments of dsDNA.

Yellow and pink are used for subsequently the bases and backbone of the dsDNA. No bias was applied during this simulation.</p></caption></media><p>In both pathways, after transfection of one dsDNA fragment, fusion can continue with another pore formation step to release the next fragment. At this point, either the lipoplex is already fully destabilized and the remaining cargo gets quickly transfected as well, or fusion halts in a prolonged hemifused state and some of the dsDNA remains trapped. In total 16 of the possible 20 dsDNA fragments (four fragments, five replicates) were successfully transfected in this setup. If complete fusion was achieved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1V</xref>), all dsDNA were at the opposing side of the bilayer. No leakage of dsDNA at the endosomal lumen was ever observed. Once transfected, although most of the dsDNA fragments still associated with the membrane (potentially stabilized by some of the cationic lipids from the lipoplex that come along), they were no longer enveloped by lipoplex components. The decomplexation of the dsDNA correlates well with the behaviour of lipoplex fusion in vitro by Rehman et al., where they describe that the DNA after transfection is no longer associated with lipoplex components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">ur Rehman et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>To quantify the overall transfection events further, we monitored the relative angle of the dsDNA fragments with respect to the membrane normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">5</xref>). In all cases, the first transfected fragment of dsDNA was either perpendicular to the bilayer normal, or close to the starting orientation (90° and 45° respectively). Remarkably, in some of the simulations the lipoplex reoriented itself such that the following transfection event(s) took place with the dsDNA in the parallel orientation, that is switching between the perpendicular and parallel pathway. This remarkable rearrangement might find its origin in the fact that the lipoplex core is suspended similar to a ball bearing, characterized by a low friction of the DNA/lipid core with respect to the coating layer. The removal of lipoplex material during fusion, which typically takes place on one side of the hemifusion diaphragm, might result in a torque causing the observed reorientation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>DxTAP unsaturation is mandatory for efficient transfection</title><p>Having established two major fusion pathways leading to successful DNA transfection, next we consider the role of lipid composition in this process. Experimental studies reveal that lipid tail saturation and length, as well as the chemical composition of the headgroup of the lipoplex play an important role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koynova et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ma et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fletcher et al., 2006</xref>). In this paragraph we aim to unravel the molecular influence of lipid tail saturation on lipoplex fusion and transfection efficiency. To this end, we constructed two additional versions of our lipoplex, replacing the mono-unsaturated DOTAP either by its fully saturated counterpart DPTAP (i.e., replacing the oleoyl tails by palmitoyl tails), or by a double unsaturated analogue DLiTAP (linoleoyl tails), whilst maintaining the same 1:4 DxTAP:DOPE ratio and target endosomal membrane composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, short lipids). The fusion experiments were set up in the same manner as before with five repeats per condition, each spanning ten microseconds.</p><p>For the DPTAP based lipoplex we never observed transfection, even though the stalk was maintained. The internal structure of the lipoplex was found to be somewhat unstable, with some of the channels fusing with each other and losing their classical H<sub>II</sub> hexagonal packing. Nevertheless, no DNA was lost from the complex. The orientation of the dsDNA was mainly parallel with respect to the bilayer, except for short periods of internal reconfiguration upon loss of the hexagonal unit cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">5</xref>). The DLiTAP lipoplex, on the other hand, underwent fusion and showed cargo transfection in four out of five replicate simulations. The total amount of dsDNA fragments translocated amounted to 10 out of 20, somewhat less compared to the DOTAP lipoplex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Similar to DOTAP, both parallel and perpendicular fusion pathways were observed, as quantified by the dsDNA orientation analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">5</xref>). Based on these results, it appears that unsaturated lipids complexing the dsDNA are required for successful fusion and transfection. This agrees with fusion experiments between bilayers/vesicles, from which it has been suggested that more negatively curved lipids and or lipids with a decreased bending modulus favor formation of the fusion stalk and subsequent hemifusion diaphragm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Markvoort and Marrink, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Teague et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aeffner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Smirnova et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fan et al., 2016</xref>). Since the bending modulus tends to decrease with the amount of unsaturations in the tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levine et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pan et al., 2015</xref>), one could naively anticipate an even further increased fusion efficiency for DLiTAP compared to DOTAP, contrary to our findings. In our understanding, this can be explained by the fact that unsaturation in the lipid tails does not only stabilize the stalk and other fusion intermediates, but also the H<sub>II</sub> phase itself (i.e. stabilize the lipoplex, preventing the release of cargo).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Effect of lipid composition on transfection efficiency.</title><p>The number of successful transfections and amount of transfected DNA considering different lipid compositions.

To this end, we investigated the role of lipid composition of the endosomal membrane on the fusion efficiency of our lipoplex models. The precise lipid composition of the endosomal membrane is not known, and varies between cell types and level of maturation. Focusing on the role of lipid tails, we considered two additional endosomal membrane models, including some longer tailed lipids (diC16:0, dipalmitoyl, DP) and lipids with an increasing amount of unsaturation (diC18:2, dilinoleoyl, DLi and diC20:4, diarachidonyl, DA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We selected the most fusogenic lipoplex containing the DOTAP lipids, and performed again five repeats lasting ten microseconds each. Compared to the endosomal membrane model consisting of shorter lipids, described above, the fusion efficiency drops. In case of the endosomal membrane containing DLi lipids, no fusion events were observed at all, and the initial stalk state remained stable. For the endosomal membrane containing DA lipids, successful fusion and translocation of dsDNA was observed, but at a lower efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). When transfection occured, the mechanism was similar as described before as judged from the analysis of lipid mixing and dsDNA orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">5</xref>). A possible explanation for the reduced fusion rates with the alternative endosomal membrane models is the increased stability of the bilayer by the longer lipid tails.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Larger lipoplexes are more stable</title><p>After performing the fusion experiments with the small lipoplex (4 × 24 bp) and membrane, we expanded to a larger lipoplex (12 × 48 bp) and target membrane to investigate the effect of size on the fusion process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). For the membrane conditions we selected the most reactive lipoplex formulation (DOTAP) and membrane composition (short lipids; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The large solvated lipoplex was, like the smaller lipoplex, stable over a period of 10 μs and adopted an H<sub>II</sub> crystal lattice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). A difference compared to the smaller lipoplex, is that the large lipoplex contained a mixture of open and closed channels, with two of the twelve channels being continuous with the solvent on one end and one of them being open on both ends. The large lipoplex also contained additional channels connecting the H<sub>II</sub>-channels, somewhat resembling a cubic phase. These connecting channels were large enough for ions, water and lipids to flow through, but the dsDNA remained strictly in the H<sub>II</sub> packing. We found that these connecting channels can have different origins. Some channels can occur when the equilibration of the H<sub>II</sub> phase is too short (50 ns); slightly elongating the preparation time removed such channels in the final periodic lipoplex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). However, increasing lipoplex hydration (lipids:waters<sub>AA</sub> 1:12) resulted in stabilization of the connecting channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In addition, connecting channels in the coated lipoplex appeared to be stable for at least 10 µs, and the coating process itself introduced new channels. Therefore our data suggest that these channels could be kinetically trapped structures, but also represent thermodynamic equilibrium structures depending on the exact state conditions. This is not unexpected if you consider the phase diagrams of lipid mixtures, which show a rich variety of inverted, cubic, and sponge phases that can interconvert as a function of temperature, hydration and other conditions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Transfection of large lipoplexes.</title><p>The large lipoplex (A) showed the same stable H<sub>II</sub> structure as the small lipoplex with dsDNA inside the aqueous channels.

In contrast to the transfection behaviour on small scale, the larger lipoplex did not show any transfection events during this time period. We did observe a reorientation of the lipoplex from an initial parallel state to a state in which the dsDNA is oriented perpendicular to the membrane surface, whilst increasing the contact area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). The lack of transfection for large lipoplexes raised the question whether this inhibition was of thermodynamic or kinetic nature. Therefore we performed five extra repeats of 10 µs, adding another biasing potential after formation of the stable hemifused complex to initiate the release of the first dsDNA fragment (see Materials and methods). The biasing potential was released after the first fusion event, that is opening of the channel. This resulted in transfection of the dsDNA inside the channel which was opened and all the dsDNA fragments in channels which shared a connection with it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In total, 15 fragments were transfected (3 DNA fragments for each of the five repeats). In general, decomplexation of the dsDNA was much slower compared to the small lipoplex case, and mainly proceeded by the unzipping pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1IVa</xref>). Thus it appears that cargo delivery can also take place with larger lipoplexes, but that kinetic trapping is more likely to occur in either a surface contact or hemifused state.</p><p>To explain the difference in reactivity of the large lipoplex with respect to the smaller one, it seems plausible that the curvature of the lipoplex plays an important role in fusion efficiency. The same is observed in case of fusion between small liposomes and membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kawamoto et al., 2015</xref>). However, there is a second issue that should be considered, namely the overall stability of the lipoplex. This stability is affected by the geometric discrepancy between the optimal configuration for the lipoplex coating and the inner core. Whereas the optimal configuration of the coating would be a sphere, satisfying minimal curvature constraints, the optimal configuration of the core is an H<sub>II</sub> phase which does not have uniform curvature on its circumference. From these two requirements it follows that there will be an interfacial tension between the coating and the core, in addition to the interfacial tension of the coating with the surrounding solvent. If we compare the geometry of the small lipoplex to that of the large one there is a clear difference in the outer angles of the core. Considering a 2D projection along the channel axis, the small lipoplex has two 60° and two 120° angles. The large lipoplex has six 120° angles. The bimodal angle distribution of the small lipoplex is further away from the preferred constant curvature of the coating than the larger one, resulting in a higher interfacial tension per lipid. Together, the lipoplex curvature stress and the interfacial tension between the core and coating layer explain the observed trend in reduced fusion efficiency upon increase in lipoplex size.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Escape from the endosome</title><p>Finally, to study lipoplex fusion with endosomal membranes in a more realistic setting, we embedded a large lipoplex inside a small vesicle representing the endosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In principle, the curvature present in the endosomal membrane could further modulate the fusion pathway and efficiency. The lipid composition of the vesicular endosome consisted again of the short lipid variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The vesicle measured 50 nm in diameter and the total system size exceeded 3 million CG beads (representing roughly 30 million atoms). To allow simulation of this large system size, the duration of the production run was reduced to 5 µs and only a single simulation was performed. As for the large bilayer system, no spontaneous fusion occurred, and a dsDNA fragment was pulled for initiation of transfection. Once the channel opened, dsDNA was transfected, followed by another two fragments that shared the same aqueous space via the connecting channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Opposed to the zipper-like fusion observed in the large bilayer experiment, this time fusion occurred in a mixed manner, combining the vertical alignment with the unzipping between neighbouring channels, resulting in a slow release (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Videos 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">3</xref>). Although we can not extract generic behavior from this single experiment, the observed pathway points to a possible role of curvature on the preferred orientation of the lipoplex with respect to the endosomal membrane, with possible consequences for transfection efficiency.</p><media id="video2" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-52012-video2.mp4"><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>Large lipoplex-vesicle transfection.</title><p>Fusion of the large lipoplex from inside the endosomal vesicle.

Release of the dsDNA by rapid unzipping of the H<sub>II</sub> phase occurs when the dsDNA lies perpendicular to the membrane normal, whilst an ejection-like or slow unzipping release of dsDNA is observed when the dsDNA is oriented parallel to the bilayer normal. Transitions between these states are also possible along the entire fusion pathway. Interestingly, our results for the small lipoplex indicate that transfection of the first dsDNA fragment triggers the release of a substantial amount, if not all, of the remaining genetic material likely caused by further destabilization of the lipoplex once cargo gets released.</p><p>Considering that the lipid composition of the endosomal membrane is not up for control, the differences between the lipoplex formulations appear to be most interesting from a rational design point of view. However, the endosomal bilayer composition varies per species and cell type, therefore understanding lipoplex-endosome interactions are of equal importance. We found that the transfection efficiency is sensitive to minor changes in both lipoplex and endosomal membrane composition, which is in line with experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang and Li, 1997</xref>). The highest amount of transfection was observed for the DOTAP:DOPE lipoplex. No transfection was observed for the DPTAP:DOPE complex, and DLiTAP:DOPE showed intermediate fusogenicity. Interestingly, the same lipid type modifications (e.g., presence of poly-unsaturated tails) can have both stabilizing and destabilizing effects on fusion efficiency, making rational predictions for optimal delivery vehicles difficult. Moreover, our results point to an important role of lipoplex size, with the larger lipoplex being less fusogenic. This we attribute to an increase of lipoplex stability causing slower lipid mixing of the lipoplex and the target membrane. In addition, the size and shape of the lipoplex affect the way the complex orients itself and interacts with the (curved) endosomal membrane. In this study we focused our efforts on exploring the effect of varying lipid tails, keeping many other parameters of the lipoplex constant. Future endeavors could investigate the role of lipid headgroups and charge ratios, which are known to affect transfection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eastman et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ma et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, the DNA/lipid ratio and size of the DNA fragments could play a role. It would be interesting to see to what extent changing such parameters alters the observed fusion pathways and kinetics. To provide further insights into the process, the observed mechanisms need to be cast into a continuum type of description (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">May and Ben-Shaul, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hamm and Kozlov, 2000</xref>) from which the competing energetic driving forces can be more straightforwardly extracted.</p><p>Eventually, our in-silico predictions need experimental validation, although resolving fusion pathways at the molecular level remains highly challenging. Time resolved SAXS in combination with single-molecule fluorescence microscopy could be used to probe the relative orientation of the lipoplex and embedded genetic material during the transfection process. Furthermore, leakiness assays could be used to test whether or not endosomal material leaks out concomitantly, for example via transient pore formation. Although the lipoplex fusion process described here does not involve such transient pores, we note that the presence of open channels in the lipoplex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) implies that endosomal material can become transfected along with the dsDNA even if the fusion itself is non-leaky. Besides, leaky fusion pathways have been observed in previous simulation studies between lipid membranes, and appear highly dependent on both lipid compositions and local stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Markvoort and Marrink, 2011</xref>). Therefore, it seems plausible that such transient pores could also form during lipoplex fusion.</p><p>To conclude, we demonstrated that detailed computer simulations of the fusion between a lipoplex and model endosomal membranes is nowadays possible, opening the way for systematic studies using the more advanced lipoplex formulations currently available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barrán-Berdón et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Al-Dulaymi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Severino et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leite Nascimento et al., 2016</xref>).

Within 50 ns the system changed from a stacked bilayer assembly into a stable inverted hexagonal phase (H<sub>II</sub>). This general procedure was used for all lipoplex formulations. However, in the presence of a stable lamellar bilayer the pressure coupling was set to semi-isotropic, and in the case of a free particle in solution the pressure coupling was handled isotropically.

A detailed description including a step by step tutorial is described in our own chapter in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bonomi and Camilloni (2019)</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Building the large lipoplex</title><p>The same procedure to build the small lipoplexes was used to construct the large lipoplex. However, instead of four dsDNA fragments these lipoplexes contained twelve dsDNAs which had a length of 48 base pairs ([<named-content content-type="sequence">CGCGAATTCGCG</named-content>]<sub>4</sub>) each. The final lipoplex had a diameter of ~30 nm.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Building the lipoplex-bilayer system (small)</title><p>To investigate the fusion behaviour of lipoplexes with membranes, we built several lipoplexes with varying composition. We prepared a system which has long polyunsaturated tails (DAPC), medium unsaturated tails (DLiPC) and short single unsaturated tails (DYPC) in the bilayer as its unsaturated component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In the case of the short lipid bilayer, all the lipids were shorter. The solvated lipoplex was placed on top of the appropriate bilayer using <italic>insane</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wassenaar et al., 2015</xref>). The systems were solvated and salinized, energy minimized and equilibrated as before, but the pressure coupling was set to semi-isotropic in the <italic>xy</italic> and <italic>z</italic> dimensions (with the membrane normal in <italic>z</italic>). After the system was equilibrated and the lipoplex adhered to the membrane, a pulling potential was added between ~10 lipids of the outer leaflet of the lipoplex in the proximity of the bilayer and vice versa. The initial center of geometry distance between the pulling groups was less than 3 nm and the pulling lasted for less than five ns (harmonic biasing force; constant velocity −1 m/s). After the initial stalk was formed, the biasing potential was removed. The system was equilibrated and a 10 µs transfection experiment was performed five times with random starting velocities for each membrane and lipoplex formulation. Again the pressure coupling was set to semi-isotropic. The small lipoplex bilayer box dimensions were 27.5 27.2 31.6 nm in xyz respectively with a total of 193,083 beads. A detailed description including a step by step tutorial is described in our own chapter in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bonomi and Camilloni (2019)</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Building the lipoplex-bilayer system (large)</title><p>Using the optimal performing bilayer and lipoplex from the small lipoplex-bilayer experiments, we set up a system with a large lipoplex (DOPE:DOTAP; 12*48 bp) and the short lipids bilayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Adhesion and stalk formation was performed identical to the small version of the experiment. However, after stalk formation two flavors of the experiment were conducted. In the first variant the experiment was left untouched after stalk formation for 10 μs. In the second variant of the experiment, we simulated until a stable fusion intermediate (no transfection) was obtained and then we initiated another pull. However, this time not pulling the tails of lipids in opposing leaflets together, but the heads of the lipids directly above and under the stalk/diaphragm. Thus pulling headgroups of lipids from inside one of the channels in the lipoplex, towards the headgroups of the opposing side of the bilayer. The initial centre of geometry distance between the two pulling groups was ~5 nm and lasted up to five ns (harmonic biasing force; constant velocity −1 m/s). This initiated a fusion pore from which transfection followed. After instantiation of the fusion pore the biasing potential was removed, allowing for unbiased transfection of the following fusion and transfection events. After the biasing potential was released five simulations were started from this point with random initial velocities, each running for 10 μs. The large lipoplex-bilayer box dimensions were 45.8 45.8 44.5 nm in xyz respectively, with a total of 749,538 beads.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Building the lipolex-vesicle system (large)</title><p>As for the large lipolex-bilayer system, the best performing lipoplex and bilayer composition in the small experiments were used. The initial state of the vesicle was constructed using an in-house Python three script based on a spherical fibonacci spiral (available on request). The amount of lipids placed on the inside was corrected for the area difference between the inner and outer leaflet, and the APL of DLPC was used to calculate the amount of lipids needed. After placement of the DLPC, the system was solvated and salted using <italic>insane</italic> and the appropriate lipid force fields we added in the topology file. The same protocol used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Qi et al. (2015)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Risselada et al. (2008)</xref> to equilibrate a vesicle was used, relaxing the leaflet asymmetry through pores. After equilibration of the inter-leaflet tension (100 ns; production-md-settings with isotropic pressure coupling) the vesicle was dehydrated and desalted. The lipoplex plus its surrounding ions, waters and DNA were placed at the center of the porated vesicle and the system was rehydrated and salted using <italic>insane</italic>. This system was equilibrated for 800 ns, allowing for the ion content to equilibrate as well, tension release due to leaflet asymmetry occured in a few ns. The biasing potential for the pore was removed, which rapidly caused closing of the pores (&lt;10 ns). The whole complex was then simulated for 1 µs during which the lipoplex adhered to the inside of the vesicle. From here the stalk was initiated as before for the small and large lipolex bilayer simulations. As for the large lipoplex-bilayer simulations, the experiment was split in two, one being the unbiased simulation of the stalk and possible transfection (1 μs). The second experiment included another biasing potential to initiate channel-vesicle fusion. The pulling procedures used were exactly the same as for the large lipolex-bilayer systems and after release the unbiased lipoplex-vesicle simulation spanned 5 μs. The large lipoplex-vesicle box dimensions were 72.8 72.8 72.8 nm in xyz respectively, with a total of 2,994,561 beads.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Analysis</title><p>The dsDNA spacing in the small solvated lipoplex was calculated using the center of mass (COM) distance between the first neighbours of each dsDNA over the last 2 μs of the solvated lipoplex (n = 5). We made a Python three script to analyze the angle of the dsDNA with respect to the <italic>z</italic> unit vector (normal to the average bilayer plane), using the COM of the first and last base pairs to construct the dsDNA orientational vector. The script treats the dsDNA termini as equals, therefore no higher angle with the membrane normal than 90° can be obtained. The same VMD based counting script used for the calculation of hydration was used to calculate the lipid contacts and dsDNA-water contacts (cutoff 1.2 nm). The dsDNA-water contacts were used for the automated transfection detection script, which reported a transfection event whenever dsDNA hydration rapidly increased (more than 200 CG waters in less than 400 ns). The automated transfection detection was manually checked on five simulations, both with and without fusion, and was always correct. We used all the information above to investigate the angle with respect to transfection, as well as the importance of lipid mixing. VMD 1.9.3 was used to render the images and videos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Humphrey et al., 1996</xref>). The Tcl script used in combination with VMD to perform fast selection counting, and the Python script to perform the angle analysis and fusion detection are available in the repository. In general Python three and MDAnalysis were used extensively in the analysis and visualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gowers et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Michaud-Agrawal et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Prof. dr.

eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>The work by Marrink's group proposes a molecular mechanism of the endosomal release of genetic material from a non-viral vector. This mechanism is novel and will help design non-viral vectors stimulating gene therapy research. The work, based on the state-of-the-art large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, captures the entire fusion pathway of a non- viral vector with the endosomal membrane up to the point where the genetic material escapes from the endosome. Systematic variation of the lipid composition of both the non-viral vector and the endosomal membrane reveals the molecular factors that play a key role during gene transfection. The work is not only of interest to researchers working in the field of gene delivery but also to those working on nanoparticle uptake in a broader sense including drug delivery. Furthermore, the work is also highly innovative from the modeling perspective, which includes building and validation of the non-viral vectors as well as the large system complexity.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A molecular perspective on lipoplex mediated genetic outbreak from the endosome&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Olga Boudker as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Nejat Duzgunes (Reviewer #2); Sylvio May (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The work represents an outstanding effort to use Molecular Dynamics to get insight into the mechanisms of DNA delivery to cells. The authors perform coarse-grained MD simulations to study the interaction between a lipoplex and an extended lipid bilayer or a small enveloping vesicle. In computational experiments using a pre-formed stalk structure as the starting state, fusion and subsequent release of short dsDNA segments are observed for certain combinations of lipids in the lipoplex and the interacting membrane. Release events are interpreted in terms of achieving transfection following the endosomal escape of DNA.</p><p>Having an overall positive opinion on the study, the reviewers formulated several concerns about the presentation of the results. The three major requests, which, according to the reviewer comments and my own impression have to be addressed are: (i) the physical mechanisms underlying the observed and described events have to be discussed, (ii) a discussion of predictions, which can be made, based on the computational results, on the behavior of real membranes differing from the modelled ones in composition and physical properties (ii) the title and the introducing sections of the article somewhat overemphasize the generality of the content, which should be downplayed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Most specifically, the reviewers requested to addresses the following issues:</p><p>1) The study represents a description of simulation results, which raises questions about the physical mechanisms behind the observed events. Since this is not an experimental but rather a computational study based on modelling the inter- and intra- molecular physical interactions, the physical forces behind the observations should be explicitly discussed. Particularly, the end of paragraph two in subsection &quot;Two distinct mechanisms leading to gene transfection&quot; states that DNA fragments are ejected like the unloading of a syringe. Why are they ejected? What causes the DNA to move away from the cationic lipids in the tube? Another example, larger lipoplexes appear to have small additional connecting channels (Figure 3). Why do they appear? Do they represent thermal equilibrium with defects or are these kinetically trapped nonequilibrium structures due to the lipoplex preparation protocol? Do they disappear if the final wrapping layer is supplemented by a few lipids? Yet another example, why is the lipoplex reorienting itself to ensure parallel or perpendicular orientation of the DNA? What is the origin of the torque that acts of the lipoplex?</p><p>The computational results demonstrate that initiating DNA release takes longer for larger lipoplexes. What is the physical reason for this effect? Could it be that the fusion rate is set by the curvature of the lipoplex lipid shell, which is quite high even the large 30-nm lipoplex analyzed in this study? If this is the case, could it be that for realistically large lipoplexes fusion events must be expected to take much longer or not happen at all?</p><p>2) In the computational model, the structure of lipoplexes is characterized by three parameters: the amounts of the cationic lipids, the helper lipids, and DNA. The authors calculations have been performed for two particular sets of these values (small and large lipoplexes, both charge compensating), but there are many other choices that may be relevant for real systems (if, for example, the lipoplex is prepared in the presence of excess DNA or excess cationic lipid). The resulting lipoplex may become positively or negatively overcharged in these cases, with possible implications on the fusion pathways. In addition, slightly adjusting the number of lipids at fixed DNA may create frustration and/or tension of the outer wrapping layer, this may also modify the pathway and kinetics of fusion. The discussion of these issues will be beneficial for the impact of the work.</p><p>3) Presenting the results of the study in the title as &quot;perspective on gene therapy&quot; sounds somewhat too ambitious since the work addresses only one, albeit important, aspect of the pathway toward transfection for one specific type of non-viral vector. In addition, the relation of the expression &quot;Genetic outbreak from the endosome&quot; to the content remains unclear.</p><p>Along the same lines, the sentences in the Abstract and throughout the paper concerning the proposed mechanism should be reformulated in a more suggestive rather than confirmative way since the simulated system, obviously, differs in their composition and other details from real intracellular membranes.</p><p>4) Finally, several introductory statements need to the formulated in a more accurate way:</p><p>– Lipoplexes can trigger a non-specific immune response; so, this sentence should be changed and a reference should be given.</p><p>– Another major downside of lipoplexes is their potential toxicity, especially if they are highly positively charged.</p><p>– DOTAP is not 1,2-dipalmitic...</p><p>– The van Meer et al. paper shows mostly PC, PE and SM. Moreover, their Figure 3 shows that the lumen-exposed lipids are primarily PC, SM and glycosphingolipids. How will this change the conclusions of the paper?</p><p>– The authors should discuss how their observations relate to the transfection of a much larger DNA molecule.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52012.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Most specifically, the reviewers requested to addresses the following issues:</p><p>1) The study represents a description of simulation results, which raises questions about the physical mechanisms behind the observed events.

However, we would like to stress that this is far from trivial, despite the fact that we have access to all inter and intramolecular interactions. In the end, the physical mechanisms or driving forces are the result of all these complex interactions. Ideally, one would extract the potentials of mean force (PMF) along some chosen reaction coordinate. However, this is complicated as the fusion of the lipoplex and subsequent release of DNA are both highly non-linear events for which a simple reaction coordinate is not easily defined. Defining suitable reaction coordinates (and subsequent PMF computation) between simple planar membranes or liposomes has already been proven to be a big challenge in the field of computer simulations (see for instance Markvoort and Marrink, but I know the reviewers are well aware of such issues). Even if a meaningful reaction coordinate could be found, to compute a converged PMF for a system of this size and complexity is out of reach even for a CG model like Martini.</p><p>Alternatively, one could simply look at the temporal evolution of the interaction energies (e.g., lipid or DNA solvation, lipid-lipid interaction) to extract certain trends. We did, but found that this can be easily misleading due to the fact that many processes occur at the same time. What, in our view is needed but outside the scope of our work, is to cast the observed mechanisms into a continuum type of description (our hope is that the reviewers might jump on this, given their expertise in this area!) from which the competing energetic driving forces can be more straightforwardly extracted. In the revised manuscript, we did try to at least supply some additional reasoning about potential driving forces.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Particularly, the end of paragraph two in subsection &quot;Two distinct mechanisms leading to gene transfection&quot; states that DNA fragments are ejected like the unloading of a syringe. Why are they ejected? What causes the DNA to move away from the cationic lipids in the tube?</p></disp-quote><p>Visual inspection of the unloading process (shown in the Video 1) reveals that the dsDNA is moving out of the channel at the same time of the merging of the lipids that line the channel with the endosomal membrane. This suggests that the release of curvature stress of the lipoplex (through fusing with the endosomal membrane) is the driving force, and that the DNA is simply pushed away during this process resulting in its ejection. Note that the dsDNA, after being transfected, does have a tendency to stay adsorbed to the endosomal membrane, likely stabilized by some of the cationic lipids that come along. Eventually, all dsDNAs are expected to desorb and escape into the cytosol (as the cationic lipids will dilute across the endosomal membrane, as well as just for entropic reasons). We added our reasoning on the release of the dsDNA to the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another example, larger lipoplexes appear to have small additional connecting channels (Figure 3). Why do they appear? Do they represent thermal equilibrium with defects or are these kinetically trapped nonequilibrium structures due to the lipoplex preparation protocol? Do they disappear if the final wrapping layer is supplemented by a few lipids?</p></disp-quote><p>To be able to answer this question we performed additional simulations of the large periodic lipoplex to obtain a better understanding of the origin and behaviour of such channels. We found that, by elongating the equilibration simulation for the formation of the inverted hexagonal phase, we could completely remove the connective channels under the original conditions, suggesting they are kinetically trapped non-equilibrium structures. However, the channels could be stabilized by adding only slightly more water (15% extra), suggesting that these channels could also represent thermodynamic equilibrium structures depending on the exact state conditions. This is not unexpected if you consider the phase diagrams of lipid mixtures, which show a rich variety of inverted, cubic, and sponge phases that can interconvert as a function of temperature, hydration and other conditions.</p><p>Furthermore, we took a closer look at the internal channel dynamics in the simulations of the solvated lipoplex. We found that indeed during the coating process new channels were formed which were not directly inherited from the periodic stage. These channels were very stable on the accessed timescale of 10 Âµs. Thus it appears that the coating process itself can also affect the internal stability of the DNA/lipid phase. Given the long time it takes to setup and equilibrate the lipoplexes, we did not investigate the role of the coating layer in more detail, but this is surely a factor that could play a role in the overall transfection efficiency. We think this is also worth further exploration in wet-lab experiments. The new insights on the stability of the connecting channels are discussed in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Yet another example, why is the lipoplex reorienting itself to ensure parallel or perpendicular orientation of the DNA? What is the origin of the torque that acts of the lipoplex?</p></disp-quote><p>Sadly enough the problem with answering this question is the same as for finding the exact reason for the dsDNA ejection. Our current sampling and lack of understanding of the phenomena does not allow us to give an experiment based explanation. However, we think it might find its origin in the fact that the lipoplex core is suspended in a fashion very similar to ball bearings. This could make the rotational friction of the DNA/lipid core with respect to the coating layer extremely low. The removal of lipoplex material during fusion, which typically takes place on one side of the hemifusion diaphragm, might be enough to result in a torque causing the observed reorientation. We discuss this in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The computational results demonstrate that initiating DNA release takes longer for larger lipoplexes.

If this is the case, could it be that for realistically large lipoplexes fusion events must be expected to take much longer or not happen at all?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed it seems plausible that the curvature of the lipoplex shell plays an important role in fusion efficiency. The same is observed in case of fusion between small liposomes and membranes (Kawamoto et al., 2015). However, there is a second issue that should be considered, which is the overall stability of the lipoplex. This stability is affected by the geometric discrepancy between the optimal configuration for the lipoplex coating and the inner core. Whereas the optimal configuration of the coating would be a sphere, satisfying minimal curvature constraints, the optimal configuration of the core is an H<sub>II</sub> phase which does not have uniform curvature on its circumference. From these two requirements it follows that there will be an interfacial tension between the coating and the core, in addition to the interfacial tension of the coating with the surrounding solvent. If we compare the geometry of the small lipoplex to that of the large one there is a clear difference in the outer angles of the core. Considering a 2D projection along the channel axis, the small lipoplex has two 60Ëš and two 120 ÌŠ angles. The large lipoplex has six 120Ëš angles. The bimodal angle distribution of the small lipoplex is further away from the preferred constant curvature of the coating than the larger one, resulting in a higher interfacial tension per lipid. Considering even bigger lipoplexes, the amount of curvature mismatch per lipid would decrease even more resulting in a lower reactivity per lipid/dsDNA. Together, the lipoplex curvature stress and the interfacial tension between the core and coating layer explain the observed trend in reduced fusion efficiency upon increase in lipoplex size. We added an extra paragraph to explain lipoplex stability with respect to size, based on our current understanding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In the computational model, the structure of lipoplexes is characterized by three parameters: the amounts of the cationic lipids, the helper lipids, and DNA.

In addition, slightly adjusting the number of lipids at fixed DNA may create frustration and/or tension of the outer wrapping layer, this may also modify the pathway and kinetics of fusion. The discussion of these issues will be beneficial for the impact of the work.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree that many additional factors come into play, and added a short discussion on this topic in the conclusion, pointing out that we focused on the nature of the lipid tails, but future investigation of the effects of charge compensation and different lipid/DNA ratio could be extremely beneficial to our understanding of transfection of these complexes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Presenting the results of the study in the title as &quot;perspective on gene therapy&quot; sounds somewhat too ambitious since the work addresses only one, albeit important, aspect of the pathway toward transfection for one specific type of non-viral vector. In addition, the relation of the expression &quot;Genetic outbreak from the endosome&quot; to the content remains unclear.</p><p>Along the same lines, the sentences in the Abstract and throughout the paper concerning the proposed mechanism should be reformulated in a more suggestive rather than confirmative way since the simulated system, obviously, differs in their composition and other details from real intracellular membranes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, and made changes throughout the text to solve this issue. We hope the article no longer reads to be more general than it is and tried to make it clear that all are conclusions based on the models that we made. We also focused more on the transfection and less on the gene therapy. This is also reflected in the revised title, which now reads: Escape of lipoplexed DNA from the endosome: a molecular perspective on transfection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Finally, several introductory statements need to the formulated in a more accurate way:</p><p>- Lipoplexes can trigger a non-specific immune response; so, this sentence should be changed and a reference should be given.</p><p>- Another major downside of lipoplexes is their potential toxicity, especially if they are highly positively charged.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a reference and point out the issue of toxicity and non-specific immune responses in the Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- DOTAP is not 1,2-dipalmitic...</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks, changed to dioleoyl.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The van Meer et al. paper shows mostly PC, PE and SM. Moreover, their Figure 3 shows that the lumen-exposed lipids are primarily PC, SM and glycosphingolipids. How will this change the conclusions of the paper?</p></disp-quote><p>Given the large complexity of the simulated systems, we decided to keep the endosomal membrane composition as simple as possible, with PC as main phospholipid. PS was added as it was hypothesized before that anionic lipids could play an important role in the transfection mechanism (Tarahovsky, Koynova and MacDonald, 2004). Clearly, real endosomal membranes are much more complex concerning lipid composition, and, to a large extent, the exact composition is unknown (especially concerning asymmetry) and varying between endosomal stage and cell type. To what extent these lipids could affect the potential fusion pathways is difficult to say, and needs to be addressed in follow up studies. We emphasized this aspect in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors should discuss how their observations relate to the transfection of a much larger DNA molecule.</p></disp-quote><p>We touch the topic slightly when we discuss the connective channels. However, the manner in which large strands of dsDNA are condensed in such a lipid complex are far from trivial. Therefore simply extending our findings to the transfection of plasmid sized complexes is something we do not feel comfortable doing.</p></body></sub-article></article>
