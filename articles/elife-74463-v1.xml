interactions among multiple brain systems, but it remains unclear how functional brain networks are reconfigured over time while experiencing pain. Here, we investigated the time-varying changes in the functional brain networks during 20 min capsaicin-induced sustained orofacial pain. In the early stage, the orofacial areas of the primary somatomotor cortex were separated from other areas of the somatosensory cortex and integrated with subcortical and frontoparietal regions, constituting an extended brain network of sustained pain. As pain decreased over time, the subcortical and frontoparietal regions were separated from this brain network and connected to multiple cerebellar regions. Machine-learning models based on these network features showed significant predictions of changes in pain experience across two independent datasets (<italic>n</italic> = 48 and 74). This study provides new insights into how multiple brain systems dynamically interact to construct and modulate pain experience, advancing our mechanistic understanding of sustained pain.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Pain</kwd><kwd>fMRI</kwd><kwd>functional connectivity</kwd><kwd>network community</kwd><kwd>predictive modeling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010446</institution-id><institution>Institute for Basic Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IBS-R015-D1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Woo</surname><given-names>Choong-Wan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019R1C1C1004512</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Woo</surname><given-names>Choong-Wan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021M3E5D2A01022515</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Woo</surname><given-names>Choong-Wan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021M3A9E4080780</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Woo</surname><given-names>Choong-Wan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003693</institution-id><institution>Korea Institute of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2E31511-22-090</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Woo</surname><given-names>Choong-Wan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018H1A2A1059844</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Jae-Joong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Human neuroimaging with time-evolving network analysis reveals dynamic interactions among multiple functional brain networks in response to sustained pain.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The experience of pain unfolds over time and dynamically changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kucyi and Davis, 2015</xref>), and the sustained and spontaneously fluctuating nature is a key characteristic of clinical chronic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Apkarian et al., 2001</xref>). Pain is known to consist of multiple component processes ranging from sensory and affective to cognitive and motivational processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Melzack and Casey, 1968</xref>), and thus the construction and modulation of pain are subserved by distributed brain systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Coghill, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mano and Seymour, 2015</xref>). Importantly, the degree to which each component process contributes to pain experience changes over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hashmi et al., 2013</xref>). For example, fear-avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vlaeyen and Linton, 2012</xref>), maladaptive coping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jensen et al., 1991</xref>), and learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Apkarian et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Phelps et al., 2021</xref>) become more important in explaining pain experience as the pain becomes chronic. Therefore, identifying the whole-brain network features that can explain and predict the natural fluctuations and changes of sustained pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Farmer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kucyi and Davis, 2015</xref>) is crucial to understanding why pain naturally decreases in some cases and individuals but not in others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ploner et al., 2011</xref>). In this study, we examined the reconfiguration of whole-brain functional networks underlying the natural fluctuation in sustained pain to provide a mechanistic understanding of the brain responses to sustained pain. To this end, our key research questions include (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>): How does the brain community structure change (i) for the sustained pain condition compared to the resting condition and (ii) over the course of sustained pain from its initiation to remission? (iii) Can we develop predictive models of sustained pain based on the patterns of brain network changes?</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Study overview and behavioral results.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Three main research questions of the current study. We aimed to answer the research questions by examining the time-varying patterns of functional brain network reconfiguration during 20 min of tonic orofacial pain experience and comparing them to the pain-free resting state. (<bold>B</bold>) Behavioral results. We asked participants to continuously report their pain in the scanner using either a pain avoidance rating scale (‘how much do you want to avoid this experience in the future?’) for Study 1 (‘discovery dataset,’ n = 48) or a pain intensity rating scale (‘how intense is your pain?’) for Study 2 (‘independent test dataset,’ n = 74). The anchors of the scale (the horizontal dashed lines) were based on a modified version of the general labeled magnitude scale (gLMS). The vertical dashed lines show how we define the early, middle, and late periods of sustained pain. The solid lines represent group mean ratings (red for capsaicin, and blue for control), and the shading represents standard errors of the mean (SEM). (<bold>C</bold>) The overview of main analyses. Voxel-level functional connectivity was estimated in the native space using 2 min moving windows and thresholded at 0.05 network density (see ‘Materials and methods’ for details). We identified the time-evolving network community structures from these suprathreshold connectivity matrices using the multilayer community detection method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mucha et al., 2010</xref>), and calculated the module allegiance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bassett et al., 2011</xref>). Using the module allegiance values as input features, we either identified group-level consensus community structures or conducted predictive modeling and tested the models on Study 2 independent test dataset (n = 74). Colored circles in the multilayer community detection and module allegiance analysis represent different community labels. Black- and white-colored boxes in the module allegiance matrices indicate whether or not the two different network nodes have the same community affiliation, respectively.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-74463-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>To answer these questions, we conducted two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments with 48 and 74 healthy participants while they were experiencing 20 and 10min of capsaicin-induced tonic orofacial pain, respectively. Tonic pain has long been used as an experimental model of clinical pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dubuisson and Dennis, 1977</xref>), and our previous study demonstrated that capsaicin-induced tonic orofacial pain shows network-level brain representations similar to clinical pain, suggesting its clinical relevance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lee et al., 2021</xref>). The application of a capsaicin-rich hot sauce on a participant’s tongue can effectively elicit pain sensation for approximately 10 minutes, followed by a slow remission of pain toward the end of the scan. This experimental paradigm is particularly suitable for identifying reliable features of the brain network for different periods of pain (i.e., initiation to remission), which has been challenging in clinical fMRI studies because of the small variance and heterogeneity of clinical pain trajectories within a few sessions of fMRI scans.</p><p>We first identified the time-evolving functional brain network structures using a community detection method for multi-layer networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mucha et al., 2010</xref>) using data from Study 1 (‘discovery dataset,’ <italic>n</italic> = 48). We conducted this network analysis at the voxel level on an individual’s native brain space to fully utilize personalized and fine-grained pattern information. We then compared the group-level representative brain community structures between the sustained pain condition versus the no-pain resting condition (the first research question) and between different phases of pain, including its early, middle, and late periods (the second research question). Finally, we developed machine-learning models based on the brain community patterns using the data from Study 1, either to classify pain versus no-pain conditions or to predict the dynamic changes in pain ratings, and tested the performances of these models on an unseen dataset (Study 2, ‘independent test dataset,’ <italic>n</italic> = 74) (the third research question).</p><p>The results showed that the orofacial areas (i.e., ventral part) of the primary somatomotor regions were separated from the other (i.e., dorsal) primary somatomotor regions and instead integrated with subcortical (e.g., thalamus, basal ganglia) and frontoparietal regions (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) during sustained pain. Interestingly, this pain-induced somatomotor-dominant brain community structure changed over time. The subcortical and frontoparietal regions affiliated with the somatomotor-dominant network in the early period of pain were gradually separated from the somatomotor network and strongly connected to multiple cerebellar regions as pain decreased. Machine-learning models based on these brain network organization patterns could discriminate the sustained pain from the pain-free control condition and predict dynamic changes in pain experience including pain avoidance and pain intensity over time. These models were further generalized to the independent tonic pain dataset (Study 2).</p><p>Overall, this study contributes to the understanding of dynamic interactions among multiple functional brain networks in response to sustained pain, offering new insights into the mechanistic understanding of chronic pain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experimental design and behavioral results</title><p>In Study 1 (‘discovery dataset’), we scanned 48 participants while we delivered the capsaicin-rich hot sauce onto the participants’ tongues (‘capsaicin’ condition) or had the participants rest without stimuli (‘control’ condition). The fMRI scan duration was 20 min for both conditions, which was sufficient to cover the entire period of sustained pain from its initiation to the complete remission. During the scan, we asked participants to report the continuous changes in pain avoidance by asking the following question, “How much do you want to avoid this experience in the future?” (For details of the rating procedure, please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>.) With this question, we aimed to measure the continuous changes in the avoidance motivation induced by sustained pain, which is known as a core component of clinical chronic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vlaeyen and Linton, 2012</xref>). We employed a modified version of the general labeled magnitude scale (gLMS) to better represent pain experience at the super-high pain range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bartoshuk et al., 2004</xref>). The order of the experimental conditions was counterbalanced across participants.</p><p>The pain avoidance ratings for the capsaicin condition were higher than those for the control condition throughout the 20 min of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula> = 0.11 ± 0.01 (mean ± standard error of the mean [SEM]), <italic>z</italic> = 4.25, p=2.10 × 10<sup>–5</sup> (multilevel general linear model with bootstrap tests, 10,000 iterations, two-tailed, gender and the order of experimental conditions were modeled as covariates), indicating that the capsaicin stimulation effectively induced sustained pain experience and avoidance motivation. The pain avoidance ratings during the capsaicin condition exhibit an evident rise and fall. The differences in the pain avoidance between the capsaicin versus control conditions became nonsignificant toward the end of the scan (from 17.3 min to the end, two-tailed ps&gt;0.05, paired <italic>t</italic>-test, BF<sub>01</sub> = 1.01–4.71), suggesting that pain subsided. A similar rise-and-fall pattern of pain ratings was observed in Study 2 with a pain intensity question, “How intense is your pain?”, except the short duration of pain because of the smaller amount of pain stimulus (i.e., hot sauce) compared to Study 1. Note that the overall trend of pain ratings over time was similar across participants because of the characteristics of our experimental design, which has also been observed in the previous studies that used oral capsaicin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Berry and Simons, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ngom et al., 2001</xref>). However, also note that each individual’s time course of pain ratings was not entirely the same (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Community detection of time-evolving brain networks</title><p>To examine the reconfiguration of the whole-brain functional networks over time, we used a multilayer community detection approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mucha et al., 2010</xref>) based on the Louvain community detection algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Blondel et al., 2008</xref>). This approach is designed to find community structures of time-evolving networks by connecting the same nodes across different time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and has been successfully used in previous studies on brain network reconfigurations for learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bassett et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bassett et al., 2015</xref>), working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Braun et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Finc et al., 2020</xref>), planning and reasoning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pedersen et al., 2018</xref>), emotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Betzel et al., 2017</xref>), and pharmacological intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Braun et al., 2016</xref>). In this study, we used this approach to examine the temporal changes of brain network structures during sustained pain, which cannot be done with conventional functional connectivity-based analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lee et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>We first divided the fMRI data into 2 min nonoverlapping time windows (i.e., 10 time-bins) and estimated the functional connectivity for each time window using Pearson’s correlation for each participant and each condition. Although the long duration of the time window without overlaps may obscure the fine-grained temporal dynamics in functional connectivity patterns, we chose to use this long time window to obtain more reliable estimates of network structures and their transitions as previous literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bassett et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Robinson et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, we computed the functional connectivity at the voxel level on each participant’s native brain space to avoid an arbitrary choice of brain parcellation schemes and minimize the potential loss of information due to anatomical normalization. Also, since many of the graph analytics were developed for sparse networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Newman, 2010</xref>) and voxel-level connectivity data were likely to contain many spurious correlations, we applied proportional thresholding to functional connectivity matrices. Because an arbitrary choice of the threshold can have a substantial impact on the results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">van den Heuvel et al., 2017</xref>), we selected the optimal threshold level (0.05; top 5% of connections) that maximized the differences in commonly used network attributes between the capsaicin versus control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figure 4</xref>; for details of how we determined the optimal threshold level, see ‘Materials and methods’). We used this threshold level for the remaining analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Differences in consensus community structure between sustained pain versus no pain (Q1)</title><p>To address the first research question, “How does the brain community structure change for the sustained pain condition compared to the no-pain resting condition?”, we compared the consensus brain community structures for the capsaicin versus control conditions. Here, the consensus community means the group-level representative structures of the distinct community partitions of individuals. To determine the consensus community across different individuals and times, we first obtained the module allegiance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bassett et al., 2011</xref>) from the community assignment of each individual. Module allegiance assesses how much a pair of nodes is likely to be affiliated with the same community label and is defined as a matrix <italic>T</italic> whose element <italic>T<sub>ij</sub></italic> is 1 when nodes <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> are assigned to the same community and 0 when assigned to different communities. This conversion of the categorical community assignments to the continuous module allegiance values allows group-level summarization of different community structures of individuals. We projected the module allegiance values onto the common MNI space and then averaged them across participants and time, which yielded a group-level module allegiance matrix that ranges from 0 to 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Finally, we obtained the consensus community by applying a community detection algorithm to the group-level module allegiance matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bassett et al., 2013</xref>).

The expansion of Community 2 during the capsaicin condition was mainly driven by the frontoparietal network regions from Community 3 (including the dorsolateral prefrontal and inferior parietal regions) and subcortical regions from Community 4 (including the thalamus and basal ganglia regions; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5</xref>). Permutation tests confirmed that the community assignment in the frontoparietal and subcortical regions showed significant changes between the capsaicin versus control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">Appendix 1—figure 6A</xref>). These results suggested that sustained pain induced a global functional reconfiguration of multiple brain networks that included segregation from the default mode network and cerebellar regions and integration with the somatomotor network to form an extended brain system for pain, which is a replication of the previous study that termed this enlarged somatomotor-dominant network as a ‘pain supersystem’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Changes in consensus community structure over the course of sustained pain (Q2)</title><p>Next, to address the second research question, “How does the brain community structure change throughout sustained pain from its initiation to the remission?”, we first divided the capsaicin run into three time periods, ‘early’ (1–3 bins, 0–6 min), ‘middle’ (4–7 bins, 6–14 min), and ‘late’ (8–10 bins, 14–20 min). These three time periods corresponded to (i) initiation and maintenance of pain, (ii) gradual pain decrease, and (iii) full remission of pain, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Patterns of changes in communities 1–4 were similar to those from previous results. For example, Community 2 (somatomotor-dominant) was larger in the early period than in the middle and late periods (i.e., the emergence of the extended somatomotor-dominant community during capsaicin condition), and the frontoparietal network and subcortical regions were the main drivers of this change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">Appendix 1—figure 7A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Reconfiguration of community structure over the time course of sustained pain experience.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Consensus community structures of the early (0–6 min), middle (6–14 min), and late (14–20 min) periods of sustained pain.

The community mainly consisted of the frontoparietal and dorsal attention network regions and gradually increased in size over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). The increase in community size in the later periods was mainly driven by the frontoparietal network regions that were among Community 2 (somatomotor-dominant) during the early period. In the later periods, these frontoparietal regions, including the dorsolateral prefrontal and inferior parietal regions, changed their affiliation to Community 6, forming a separate frontoparietal-dominant community (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">Appendix 1—figure 7C</xref>).</p><p>Community 5 also showed an interesting pattern. Community 5 mainly consisted of the limbic cortices and subcortical and brainstem regions during the early and middle periods.

The composition of Community 5 during the early period suggested that the brainstem regions were closely linked with the limbic brain regions, including the medial temporal lobe structures (e.g., hippocampus, amygdala, and parahippocampal gyrus) and the temporal pole, consistent with recent findings that showed the involvement of the spino-parabrachio-amygdaloid circuit in sustained pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chiang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Huang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rodriguez et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, the reconfiguration of Community 4 showed that the cerebellum-dominant community extended its connections to the brainstem and thalamus during the late period of sustained pain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig8">Appendix 1—figure 8B</xref>), suggesting an important, though less investigated, pain-modulatory role of the cerebellum in pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Claassen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Moulton et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>These results suggested that decrease in sustained pain induced the dissociation of frontoparietal-somatomotor and limbic-subcortical-brainstem coupling, and the emergence of a separate frontoparietal-dominant community and an enlarged cerebellum-dominant community.

To obtain module allegiance matrices on a common feature space and also to reduce the computational burden for model fitting, we projected a whole-brain parcellation comprising 263 regions defined on the MNI space (Schaefer atlas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Schaefer et al., 2018</xref>] with the additional brainstem, cerebellum, and subcortical regions; see ‘Materials and methods’ for details) onto an individual’s native space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Then, we averaged module allegiance for each region, resulting in a 263 × 263 module allegiance matrix for each participant and for each time window. Here, high module allegiance indicates the voxels of two regions are likely to be in the same community affiliation, and vice versa. With the module allegiance matrices, we conducted two different types of predictive modeling: classification (developing a support vector machine [SVM] classifier to discriminate the capsaicin condition from the control condition) and regression (developing a principal component regression [PCR] model to predict the fluctuations in sustained pain ratings). We chose to use the SVM and PCR because they are representative linear algorithms for finding the low-dimensional latent components of highly correlated data such as brain networks.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Module allegiance-based classifier for sustained pain versus resting.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The analysis overview of the module allegiance-based predictive modeling.

We selected the number of PCs that yielded the best predictive performance in leave-one-participant-out cross-validation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig10">Appendix 1—figure 10</xref>).

(vi) The cerebellar connections to the subcortical and frontoparietal regions were predictive of pain decrease.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-74463-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Although researchers have highlighted the importance of understanding the ‘dynamic pain connectome’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kucyi and Davis, 2015</xref>), previous studies were limited mainly to examining summary metrics of dynamic connectivity, such as mean and standard deviation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bosma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Cottam et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, a detailed characterization of how multiple brain networks dynamically interact throughout pain has yet to be conducted. A few studies examined multiple brain states over a period of pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cheng et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Robinson et al., 2015</xref>), but their experimental designs and analyses were not suitable to associate the changes in brain states with different phases of pain, that is, from initiation, peak, and to remission. To better characterize the dynamic changes in functional brain community structures for different phases of pain experience, we used oral delivery of capsaicin to induce sustained and gradually decreasing pain for approximately 20 min. Although future studies need to examine whether our findings can be generalized to other stimulus modalities of sustained pain, this study provides a reliable experimental paradigm to study time-varying network changes during sustained pain and spontaneous pain decrease.</p><p>One of the most critical observations in this study is the emergence of an extended somatomotor-dominant brain community in response to sustained pain. This finding is consistent with a previous study in which subcortical and frontoparietal regions were integrated with the somatomotor network to constitute the ‘pain supersystem’ for a brief phasic heat pain stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>). The integration of the somatomotor and frontoparietal regions also correspond to the global workspace theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baars, 2002</xref>), in which the experience of pain requires frontoparietal involvement to enable recurrent processing of nociceptive information across multiple brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bastuji et al., 2016</xref>). Also, considering that subcortical structures, such as the thalamus, are important for the early processing of nociceptive signals from the peripheral nervous system, our finding suggests that the recruitment of both bottom-up (subcortical) and top-down (frontoparietal) systems and their integration are crucial to the experience of sustained pain. Previous studies that reported modular reorganization of the somatomotor network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mano et al., 2018</xref>) and frontoparietal network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barroso et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mano et al., 2018</xref>) in chronic pain are also in line with our results. Importantly, this systems-level integration occurred in a somatotopy-specific way—the SVM classifier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) showed that the ventral primary somatomotor area, which subserves tongue sensation, was segregated from the other somatomotor regions and integrated with the subcortical regions during the early period of pain. These results are consistent with previous studies of sustained pain, which showed that the functional connectivity of the somatotopic primary somatomotor area was decreased for the other somatomotor areas, while being increased for other networks, such as the salience network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cheng et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee et al., 2019a</xref>).</p><p>In addition, we characterized how the functional brain networks were dynamically reconfigured over the period of sustained pain from the initiation to its resolution and found that the cerebellar regions played an important role in pain decrease. During the early period of pain, the subcortical and frontoparietal regions were integrated with the somatomotor network. However, as pain is resolved, these regions shifted their connections to multiple cerebellar regions. Although pain neuroimaging studies have consistently reported cerebellar activations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Moulton et al., 2010</xref>), its functional role in pain remains unclear. Interestingly, the cerebellum not only projects efferent nociceptive neurons to the thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Liu et al., 1993</xref>), but it also has afferent and efferent interconnections via the thalamus to the dorsolateral prefrontal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Middleton and Strick, 2001</xref>) and inferior parietal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Clower et al., 2001</xref>) cortices, which are the main components of the frontoparietal network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dosenbach et al., 2008</xref>). These neuronal connections implicate the cerebellum’s functional roles in top-down pain regulation. Furthermore, recent studies suggest that cerebellum plays an important role in pain-related prediction and its error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ernst et al., 2019</xref>), which are keys to the fear-avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vlaeyen and Linton, 2012</xref>) and motivation-decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fields, 2018</xref>) model of sustained pain. Therefore, our findings provide additional evidence that the cerebellar regions may be important drivers of endogenous modulation of pain avoidance and spontaneous coping responses to sustained pain. A previous lesion study in which patients with cerebellar damage exhibited increased pain sensitivity and decreased placebo analgesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ruscheweyh et al., 2014</xref>) supports our interpretation.</p><p>The predictive modeling based on individual-level module allegiance values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>) provided novel findings complementary to the group-level consensus community analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). For example, the dissociation between the ventral versus dorsal primary somatomotor regions during sustained pain was not evident in the group-level analysis of the consensus community structure. This finding suggests that group-level averaging could obscure fine-grained information of functional anatomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gordon et al., 2017</xref>) with distinct regions merging together as the same network community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Braga and Buckner, 2017</xref>). In this regard, our multivariate pattern-based predictive modeling approach can provide an alternative way to study dynamic changes in functional network structures while preserving fine-grained information about individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Finn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rosenberg et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, developing models to directly predict the pain ratings is helpful to complement the group-level analysis because the changes in consensus community structure over the early, middle, and late periods only indirectly reflect the different levels of pain. Lastly, the predictive modeling approach can provide information about the robustness and usefulness of the multilayer community detection method by allowing us to test the prediction performance for the discovery dataset and generalizability for the independent test dataset.</p><p>An interesting future direction would be to examine whether the current results can be generalized to clinical pain. Experimental tonic pain has been known to share similar characteristics with clinical pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rainville et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Stohler and Kowalski, 1999</xref>). In addition, in a recent study, we showed that an fMRI connectivity-based signature for capsaicin-induced orofacial tonic pain can be generalized to chronic back pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lee et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, a detailed characterization of the brain responses to tonic pain has the potential to provide useful information about clinical pain. However, there are also differences between the characteristics of capsaicin-induced tonic pain versus clinical pain. For example, clinical pain continuously fluctuates over time in an idiosyncratic pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Apkarian et al., 2001</xref>), whereas capsaicin-induced tonic pain showed a similar time-course pattern across the participants—that is, increasing rapidly and then decreasing gradually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This typical time course of pain ratings has been reported in previous studies that used oral capsaicin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Berry and Simons, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ngom et al., 2001</xref>). Although we would expect our results to reflect the general pattern of brain network changes during the rise and fall of sustained pain, it remains an empirical question how much they will be generalizable across different clinical pain conditions. Interestingly, a recent fMRI study on the temporal summation of pain in fibromyalgia patients reported results similar to ours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cheng et al., 2022</xref>), including the intra-network dissociation within the somatomotor network and the inter-network integration between the somatomotor and other networks during pain. Although we cannot directly examine whether the temporal summation of pain gave rise to these network-level changes due to the limitation of our experimental paradigm, these consistent findings between the two studies may suggest that our findings could be generalized to clinical conditions and that delineating the role of temporal summation of pain would be a promising future direction.</p><p>Note that Study 1 used a pain avoidance measure that is not yet fully validated in healthy participants. However, we chose to use the pain avoidance measure, which can provide integrative information on the multidimensional aspects of pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Melzack, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Waddell et al., 1993</xref>). It also has a clinical implication considering that the maladaptive associations of pain avoidance to innocuous environments have been suggested as a putative mechanism of transition to chronic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vlaeyen and Linton, 2012</xref>). Lastly, the avoidance measure can provide a common scale across different modalities of aversive experience, allowing us to compare their distinct brain representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ceko et al., 2022</xref>) or test the specificity of their predictive models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lee et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig13">Appendix 1—figure 13</xref>). Although the psychometric properties of the pain avoidance measure should be a topic of future investigation, we expect that the pain avoidance measure would have a high level of convergent validity with pain intensity given the observed similarity between pain avoidance (Study 1) and pain intensity (Study 2) in their temporal profiles. The generalizability of our PCR model across studies 1 and 2 also supports this speculation. However, there would also be situations in which pain avoidance is dissociated from pain intensity. For example, capsaicin can be experienced to be intense but less aversive or even appetitive in some contexts, such as cravings for spicy food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Stevenson and Yeomans, 1993</xref>). In addition, the gradual rise in avoidance ratings during the late period of the control condition in Study 1 would not be observed if the intensity measure was used. Future studies need to examine the relationship between pain avoidance and the other pain assessments and the advantage of using the pain avoidance measure.</p><p>This study also had some limitations. First, with the current experimental paradigm, it is difficult to dissociate the pain duration from the level of pain because the delivery of oral capsaicin commonly induces initial bursting and then a gradual decrease of pain over time. Though we aimed to model the effects of pain duration and pain avoidance ratings with our two primary analyses, that is, consensus community detection and predictive modeling, we cannot fully dissociate the impact of time duration versus pain ratings. Second, although the prediction performances of our predictive models were significant, their effect sizes were moderate (SVM model: 81% accuracy; PCR model: mean <italic>r</italic> = 0.32). These moderate levels of model performance may be due to information loss during a few of the multilayer community detection analysis steps, for example, thresholding and binarization of the connectivity matrices. For example, a previous predictive model of sustained pain based on unthresholded functional connectivity values showed better performances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lee et al., 2021</xref>). However, the previous model provides a limited level of mechanistic understanding because of the high dimensionality of the model and its features. In addition, functional connectivity itself provides only limited insight into how functional brain networks are structured and reconfigured over time. Considering that the mechanistic understanding of brain responses to sustained pain is the main focus of this study, our moderate levels of model performance may be acceptable, but future studies can still investigate how to improve the predictive performance of the predictive models based on time-varying network features. Third, the choice of two parameters for the multilayer community detection algorithm (i.e., intra- and inter-layer coupling parameters, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mi>γ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mi>ω</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>) can affect the overall results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mucha et al., 2010</xref>). Here, we followed the conventional choice (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mi>γ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> = 1 and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mi>ω</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> = 1) from a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bassett et al., 2015</xref>), but the effects of these parameters on our results remain unclear. We used the predictive modeling approach and tested the model generalizability on an independent dataset to avoid excessive reverse-inference from these parameter-sensitive results alone. However, future studies will have to assess the effects of parameter choices on the overall results in a systematic way. Lastly, the optimization of the network density threshold to maximize the differences in a priori network attributes between the capsaicin versus control conditions may influence the results comparing the community structures between the two conditions. However, our main results were based on temporal dynamics across all time-bins, whereas the global-level network attributes that we used to determine the level of threshold were based on the averaged data across all time-bins. In addition, our SVM and PCR models were generalized to the independent test dataset, which was not used to determine the threshold level. Therefore, the confounding effect of thresholding on our main results should be minimal.</p><p>Overall, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of how multiple brain systems dynamically interact in response to pain, paving the way for developing novel brain-based interventions for sustained pain. Although further studies are needed to show that our findings can be generalized to clinically relevant sustained pain conditions, we believe that this study provides new insights into the reconfiguration of functional brain networks for pain and a novel framework to investigate the neural mechanisms of sustained pain from a dynamic network perspective.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Study 1 (discovery) dataset included 48 healthy, right-handed participants (age = 22.8 ± 2.4 [mean ± SD], 21 females) after we excluded 4 participants who provided avoidance rating scores higher in the control run than the capsaicin run and 1 participant whose brain coverage of MRI was insufficient. This dataset was included in a previous publication as an independent test dataset (as Study 3 dataset) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lee et al., 2021</xref>). Study 2 (independent test) dataset included 74 healthy, right-handed participants (age = 22.1 ± 2.4 [mean ± SD], 34 females). All participants were recruited from the Suwon area in South Korea. The institutional review board of Sungkyunkwan University approved the study (IRB 2017-05-001). All participants provided written informed consent. The preliminary eligibility of the participants was determined through an online questionnaire. Participants with psychiatric, neurological, or systemic disorders and MRI contraindications were excluded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Capsaicin stimulation</title><p>In Study 1, we applied capsaicin-containing hot sauce (a food ingredient, Capsaicin Hot Sauce from Jinmifood, Inc) to the participants’ tongues to induce tonic pain with minimal risk. We did not include pre-calibration to match the subjective level of pain. To deliver the hot sauce inside the scanner, we dropped a small amount of hot sauce (0.1 ml) onto filter paper (2 cm × 6.5 cm). We spread the hot sauce in a circular format (diameter = 1 cm) on the upper 1/3 of the filter paper. While the participants were lying in the scanner, we handed the filter paper to the participants. The participants carefully placed the capsaicin side of the paper on their tongue (the participants had an opportunity to practice this procedure with a paper without capsaicin inside of the scanner). We then asked them to close their mouths. After 30 s, we asked them to open their mouths and put the paper on the towel on their chest. We then asked participants to keep opening their mouths and breathing only through the mouth for 1 min to prevent the capsaicin liquid from flowing into the throat. In this way, the liquid dried up, and the capsaicin settled down on a specific area of the tongue. After 1 min, we asked the participants to close their mouths (and keep closing their mouths) while starting the fMRI scan. The participants provided their ratings using an MR-compatible trackball device when a rating scale appeared on the screen. We used this particular procedure for the following reasons: (i) it reduces the risk of coughing in the scanner, (ii) can keep the pain within a tolerable range while maximizing the pain intensity, and (iii) simplifies the delivery method without additional equipment.</p><p>In Study 2, we used an almost similar capsaicin delivery procedure, but there were also some differences. First, we used a smaller amount of hot sauce (0.05 ml) because the scan duration of the independent test dataset was shorter (approximately half) than the duration of the discovery dataset. Second, capsaicin was delivered in the middle of the scan. More specifically, participants held the filter paper with their hands for the first 43 s (13 s for additional removal of volumes for image stabilization) since the start of the scan, and then placed the filter paper on their tongue and closed their mouths for 20 s. The participants then removed the filter paper, opened their mouths for 20 s, and then closed their mouths. The total duration of sustained pain was approximately 10 min and 20 s.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Aversive tastant stimulation</title><p>To induce aversive, but not painful, oral sensation for the specificity testing, we used quinine that has a bitter taste in Study 1. A small amount of quinine sulfate (50 mg) was dissolved in distilled water (0.1 ml), which was sufficient to induce aversive and bitter taste. The quinine solution was subsequently dropped onto a filter paper, and the rest of this procedure was same as the ‘Capsaicin stimulation’ above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Aversive odor stimulation</title><p>We used fermented skate as an additional aversive stimulus for specificity testing in Study 1. The fermented skate (Hongeo) is a food in South Korea famous for its bad smell. We chose to use the fermented skate among many other options (including multiple strong-smell cheese, Maroilles Fauquet, Bons Mayennais Lingot, Gorgonzolla Piccante) based on aversiveness ratings in a pilot study (n = 15). We attached a slice of fermented skate, covered with a filter paper, to the interior nasal part of a mask. The mask was designed to cover the nose and the mouth. For the delivery, we first moved the bed out of the scanner and unlocked and lifted the head coil. While the participants were breathing through their mouth, we placed the mask to cover participants’ nose and mouth. After the head coil was installed again, the participants were re-entered into the scanner. We asked the participants to start breathing through the nose after we started the scanning. We instructed the participants to breathe only through the nose until the end of the scan.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Experimental design</title><p>In Study 1, there were four experimental conditions: (i) capsaicin, (ii) bitter taste, (iii) aversive odor, and (iv) control. After a structural scan, we administered the four condition runs, and the order of the conditions was counterbalanced across participants. Each run lasted for 20 min, and participants provided the avoidance ratings continuously throughout the run. We designed the experiment to have long scans to capture the full rise and fall of each sensation. For the rating scale, we used a modified version of the gLMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bartoshuk et al., 2004</xref>): the anchors began with ‘Not at all’ [0] to the far left of the scale and continued to the right in a graded fashion with anchors of ‘A little bit’ [0.061], ‘Moderately’ [0.172], ‘Strongly’ [0.354], and ‘Very strongly’ [0.533], until ‘Most (I never want to experience this again in my life)’ [1] on the far right. To prevent participants from falling asleep and to help maintain a certain level of alertness during the scan, we used an intermittent simple response task, in which the color of the rating bar on the screen was changed from orange to red for 1 s every minute with a jitter, and the participants had to respond to the color change by clicking the button on the trackball device. During the preprocessing of the data, we included additional regressors of the color changes and button clicks to remove confounding effects related to the task. After the scan, we asked the participants multiple post-scan questions regarding their thought contents during the scan, which were not included in this study.</p><p>Study 2 had three experimental conditions: (i) capsaicin, (ii) control, and (iii) phasic heat stimulation. We used only the capsaicin and control runs. The control and capsaicin runs were conducted at the start and the end of the session, respectively. The control run lasted for 6 min and 13 s, and the capsaicin run lasted for 11 min and 43 s. After the first 13 s (13 s data were discarded before further analyses), participants provided intensity ratings continuously throughout the run using a trackball. After the scan, we asked the participants multiple post-scan questions regarding their thought contents during the scan.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>fMRI data acquisition</title><p>Whole-brain fMRI data were acquired using a 3T Siemens Prisma scanner at Sungkyunkwan University.

This is similar to the Human Connectome Project (HCP) preprocessing pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Glasser et al., 2013</xref>). For structural T1-weighted images, magnetic field bias was corrected, and non-brain tissues were removed using Freesurfer. Nonlinear transformation parameters projecting native T1 space to MNI 2 × 2 × 2 mm<sup>3</sup> template space were also calculated using FSL. For functional EPI images, the initial volumes (22 images [10 s] for Study 1, 29 images [13 s] for Study 2) of fMRI images were removed to allow for image intensity stabilization. Then, the images were motion-corrected using AFNI and distortion-corrected using FSL. These EPI images were co-registered to T1-weighted images using the boundary-based registration (BBR) technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Greve and Fischl, 2009</xref>) that used FSL for the first registration and Freesurfer for refinement, similar to the HCP pipeline. We then removed motion-related signals from co-registered EPI images using ICA-AROMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pruim et al., 2015</xref>). Additional preprocessing modules, including (i) removal of nuisance covariates, (ii) linear de-trending, and (iii) low-pass filtering at 0.1 Hz, were combined and conducted in one step using the 3dTproject function in AFNI to avoid introducing unwanted artifacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lindquist et al., 2019</xref>). We included mean BOLD signals from white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pruim et al., 2015</xref>), and timepoints where intermittent arousal maintenance tasks appeared (total of 20 times) as nuisance covariates. For computational efficiency in further analyses, including community detection, these de-noised EPI images were resampled to 4 × 4 × 4 mm<sup>3</sup> spatial resolution and masked with an individually defined gray matter boundary image. This gray matter mask obtained using Freesurfer was dilated and eroded five times to create smooth edges, and then resampled to 4 × 4 × 4 mm<sup>3</sup> spatial resolution to match the spatial dimension of EPI images.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Functional connectivity calculation and proportional thresholding</title><p>Whole-brain voxel-wise functional connectivity was computed using Pearson’s correlation. To determine the optimal threshold level, we tested multiple network density thresholding options (0.01, 0.05, 0.10, 0.20, 0.30, and 0.40) and compared the global-level network characteristics between the capsaicin versus control conditions. Five network attributes, including assortativity, transitivity, characteristic path, global efficiency, and modularity, were used for comparison. We calculated the network attributes using the Brain Connectivity Toolbox (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/">https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rubinov and Sporns, 2010</xref>).</p><p>A brief description of these measures is as follows: (i) <italic>Assortativity:</italic> This attribute is related to how often each node (here, a voxel) is connected to the other nodes that have a similar number of links (here, functional connectivity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Newman, 2002</xref>). It can be measured using Pearson’s correlation between the degrees of every pair of connected nodes. High assortativity means that there are mutual connections between high-degree hub nodes, reflecting the overall resilience of a network. The ‘assortativity_bin’ function of the toolbox was used. (ii) <italic>Transitivity:</italic> This attribute is related to how often the two nodes that are connected to the same node are also connected to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Newman, 2003</xref>) and measured as the ratio of the number of interconnected triplets of nodes to the number of all triplets of nodes. High transitivity indicates that nodes of a network are more likely to be clustered together. The ‘transitivity_bu’ function is used. (iii) <italic>Characteristic path:</italic> This attribute is the average of the shortest path between all pairs of connected nodes (estimated using ‘distance_bin’ function), reflecting the functional dissociation of a network. A high characteristic path length suggests that the network is in a disintegrated state. (iv) <italic>Global efficiency:</italic> This attribute is the average of the inverse of the shortest path between all pairs of connected nodes (estimated from ‘distance_bin’ function), reflecting the functional integration of a network.

First, for each given voxel, we compared the community label of the voxel to the community label of all the voxels, generating a list of voxel-seed module allegiance values that allow quantitative comparison of voxel-level community profile (e.g., [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0,…], whose element is equal to 1 if the seed and target voxels were assigned to the same community and 0 otherwise). Next, a correlation coefficient was calculated between the module allegiance values of the two different brain community structures (i.e., capsaicin versus control, and early versus late). This correlation coefficient is an estimate of the regional similarity of community profiles (here, the correlation coefficient is Phi coefficient because module allegiance is a binary variable). To estimate the statistical significance of the Phi coefficient, we performed permutation tests, in which we randomly shuffled the labels and then obtained the group-level consensus community structures from the shuffled data. Then, the Phi coefficient between the module allegiance values of the two shuffled consensus community structures was calculated. We repeated this procedure 1000 times to generate the null distribution of the Phi coefficient for each voxel. Lastly, we examined the probability to observe a smaller Phi coefficient (i.e., a more dissimilar community profile) than the one from the non-shuffled original data, which corresponds to the p-value of the permutation test. All the p-values were one-tailed as the hypothesis of this permutation test is unidirectional.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Module allegiance-based predictive modeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>)</title><p>To quantify the relative contribution of network communities to sustained pain experience, we conducted predictive modeling using module allegiance values as input features. We first projected the whole-brain atlas onto each individual’s native brain space. The whole-brain atlas originally consisted of 265 regions, but we had to exclude two cerebellar regions (vermis VIIb and X) because these regions had a small number of voxels (23 and 42 in 2 × 2 × 2 mm<sup>3</sup> space, respectively) and thus were not successfully transformed to native space in a few participants, resulting in a total of 263 regions. This atlas included 200 cortical regions from the Schaefer atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Schaefer et al., 2018</xref>), 61 subcortical and cerebellar regions from the Brainnetome atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fan et al., 2016</xref>), and the periaqueductal gray and brainstem regions used in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Beissner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Roy et al., 2014</xref>). Then, voxel-wise module allegiance matrices were obtained from the individual’s consensus community structure and grouped and averaged into 263 × 263 region-wise allegiance matrices.</p><p>For the classification problem, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, we averaged 10 time-varying region-wise module allegiance matrices for each run (capsaicin and control runs). Then we trained an SVM classifier to determine whether a participant was in pain or not (i.e., capsaicin versus control conditions) using region-level allegiance matrices across participants (i.e., 34,453 allegiances × 2 runs × 48 participants). A regularization hyperparameter C was set to 1, which is a conventional choice for SVM. To obtain unbiased estimates of classification performance, we used leave-one-participant-out cross-validation on the training dataset (Study 1) and tested the model on an independent test dataset (Study 2). To quantify the model performance, we conducted a forced two-choice classification test, which directly compared the predicted values (here, distances from the hyperplane) of two conditions for each individual. This test did not require the assumption that all participants’ brain responses to stimuli are on the same scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wager et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>For regression-based modeling, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, we trained a PCR model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hastie et al., 2009</xref>) to predict pain avoidance ratings (10 time-bins × 48 participants) based on concatenated module allegiance matrices of capsaicin run across 10 time-bins and participants (i.e., 34,453 allegiances × 10 time-bins × 48 participants). We selected 14 PCs for the regression modeling because the PC number yielded the best leave-one-participant-out cross-validated predictive performance on the training dataset (Study 1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig10">Appendix 1—figure 10</xref>). To overcome the potential bias in the performance estimation due to the optimal selection of PC number, we additionally conducted nested cross-validation that has double loops of leave-one-participant-out cross-validation; the inner loop where the hyperparameter (i.e., the PC number) was selected, and the outer loop where the actual prediction was done using the hyperparameters chosen from the inner loop. Since the hyperparameter tuning and testing were separated into the inner and outer loops, this procedure provides a less biased estimate of prediction performance even in the training dataset (Study 1). We further tested the prediction model on an independent test dataset (Study 2).</p><p>To identify important features for the classification and prediction models, we used bootstrap tests. We randomly sampled 48 participants 10,000 times with replacement and conducted model training with the resampled data.

whether the predictive models (i.e., SVM and PCR models) were specific to pain and not influenced by confounding noises, we conducted additional specificity analysis assessing the independence of the models from head movement and physiology variables and specificity of our models to pain versus nonpainful aversive conditions (i.e., bitter taste and aversive odor) in Study 1.</p><p>First, we examined the overall changes of framewise displacement (FD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Power et al., 2012</xref>), heart rate (HR), and respiratory rate (RR) in sustained pain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig11">Appendix 1—figure 11</xref>). For the univariate comparison between capsaicin versus control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig11">Appendix 1—figure 11A</xref>), the results showed that, as expected, capsaicin condition caused significant changes in motion and autonomic responses. The mean FD and HR were significantly higher, and the RR was lower in the capsaicin condition compared to the control condition (FD: <italic>t</italic><sub>47</sub> = 5.30, p=2.98 × 10<sup>–6</sup>; HR: <italic>t</italic><sub>43</sub> = 4.98, p=1.10 × 10<sup>–5</sup>; RR: <italic>t</italic><sub>43</sub> = –1.91, p=0.063, paired <italic>t</italic>-test). For the temporal changes of movement and physiology variables (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig11">Appendix 1—figure 11B</xref>), the results showed that the increased motion and autonomic responses are more prominent in the early period of pain. The 10-binned (2 min per time-chunk) FD and HR showed decreasing trend while the RR showed increasing trend over time in capsaicin condition. Additional univariate comparisons between early (1–3 bins, 0–6 min) versus late (8–10 bins, 14–20 min) period of capsaicin condition showed that differences were significant for FD and HR (FD: <italic>t</italic><sub>47</sub> = 6.45, p=8.12 × 10<sup>–8</sup>; HR: <italic>t</italic><sub>43</sub> = 6.52, p=6.41 × 10<sup>–8</sup>; RR: <italic>t</italic><sub>43</sub> = –1.61, p=0.11, paired <italic>t</italic>-test). This suggests that while participants were experiencing tonic pain, particularly in the early period, motion and heart rate was increased but breathing was slowed. Note that we needed to exclude four participants’ data due to technical issues with physiological data acquisition.</p><p>Next, we examined whether the head movement and physiological responses are the main driver of our predictive models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig12">Appendix 1—figure 12</xref>). For all the original model responses from SVM model (2 conditions × 44 participants = 88), we regressed out the mean FD, HR, and RR (concatenated across conditions and participants as the SVM model was trained) and calculated the classification accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig12">Appendix 1—figure 12A</xref>). Although the model responses were controlled for movement and physiology variables, the SVM model still showed a high classification accuracy for the capsaicin versus control conditions in a forced-choice test (n = 44, accuracy = 89%, p=1.41 × 10<sup>–7</sup>, binomial test, two-tailed). Similarly, for all the original model responses from PCR model (10 time-bins × 44 participants = 440), we regressed out the 10-binned FD, HR, and RR (concatenated across time-bins and participants as the PCR model was trained) and calculated the within-individual prediction–outcome correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig12">Appendix 1—figure 12B</xref>). Again, the PCR model showed a significantly high predictive performance (n = 44, mean prediction–outcome correlation <italic>r</italic> = 0.20, p=0.003, bootstrap test, two-tailed, mean squared error = 0.159 ± 0.022 [mean ± SEM]) while controlling for movement and physiology variables. These results suggest that our SVM and PCR models capture unique variance in tonic pain above and beyond the head movement and physiological changes.</p><p>Lastly, we examined the specificity of our predictive models to pain by testing the models onto the nonpainful but tonic aversive conditions including bitter taste (induced by quinine) and aversive odor (induced by fermented skate) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig13">Appendix 1—figure 13</xref>). All the model responses were obtained using leave-one-participant-out cross-validation. The results showed that the overall model responses of SVM model for bitter taste and aversive odor conditions were higher than those for control conditions, but lower than capsaicin condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig13">Appendix 1—figure 13A</xref>).

To quantitatively compare the group-level consensus community structures between the capsaicin versus control conditions and the early versus late periods, we first obtained a seed-based module allegiance map for each voxel (i.e., using each voxel as a seed). Then, we calculated a correlation coefficient of the module allegiance values between two different conditions for each voxel. This correlation coefficient can serve as an estimate of the voxel-level similarity of the consensus community profile. Because module allegiance is a binary variable, these correlation values are Phi coefficients (φ). To calculate the statistical significance of the Phi coefficient, we conducted permutation tests, in which we randomly shuffled the condition labels in each participant and obtained the group-level consensus community structure for each shuffled condition. Then, we calculated the voxel-level correlations of the module allegiance values between the two shuffled conditions. We repeated this procedure 1000 times to generate the null distribution of the Phi coefficients, and calculated the proportion of null samples that have a smaller Phi coefficient (i.e., a more dissimilar regional community structure) than the nonshuffled original data, which is the p-value, one-tailed.

It shows how the connectivity of brain networks associated with sustained pain changes over time.

These important insights advance the understanding of the brain mechanisms of sustained pain, which is the hallmark of chronic pain as a major healthcare problem.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74463.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Ploner</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02kkvpp62</institution-id><institution>Technische Universität München</institution></institution-wrap><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Ploner</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02kkvpp62</institution-id><institution>Technische Universität München</institution></institution-wrap><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Spisak</surname><given-names>Tamas</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02na8dn90</institution-id><institution>Essen University Hospital</institution></institution-wrap><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.10.16.464642">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.16.464642v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Markus Ploner as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Timothy Behrens as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Tamas Spisak (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It remains unclear whether the changes of brain networks over time simply reflect the duration of sustained pain or whether they essentially reflect different levels of pain intensity/avoidance. Therefore, analyzing and/or discussing whether brain network changes reflect pain duration or pain intensity would be crucial for the interpretation of the findings.</p><p>2) Although the manuscript is very well-written it might benefit from an even clearer and simpler explanation of what the consensus community structure and the underlying module allegiance measure assesses.</p><p>3) The added value of the assessment of the dynamics of brain networks remains unclear. Specifically, it is unclear whether the current analysis of brain networks dynamics allows for a clearer distinction between and prediction of pain and no-pain states than other measures of static or dynamic brain activity or static measures of brain connectivity. Therefore, clarifying the added value of the community structure analysis as compared to other more common analyses of brain activity and brain connectivity would significantly strengthen the case.</p><p>4) The Authors do not touch upon the concept of temporal summation of pain, historically associated with tonic pain. Please comment on the relationship of the present study to temporal summation particularly since chronic pain patients often exhibit increased temporal summation of pain.</p><p>5) Please consider a recent related paper by Cheng et al., Arthritis Rheumatol, 2021 that shares most of the methodological pipeline to highlight similarities and novelties and deepen the comparison with the associated literature.</p><p>6) The data analysis is entirely conducted on young healthy subjects. This is not a limitation per se, but the conclusion about offering new insights into understanding mechanisms at the basis of chronic pain is too far from the results. A similar pipeline has been actually applied to chronic pain patients (Cheng et al., Arthritis Rheumatol, 2021, Lee et al., Nat Med. 2021). Discussing the results of the present paper in relationship to those, could offer a more robust way to connect the Authors' results to networks behavior in pathological brains.</p><p>7) The behavioral measure used to assess evoked pain perception (avoidance ratings), has been developed for chronic pain patients and never validated on healthy controls. It might not be an appropriate measure considering the total absence of pain variability in the reported responses over forty-eight subjects. Please discuss this important point. Moreover, please address the following questions:</p><p>• How does the rating scale look like? Is the meaning of the anchors and of the thresholds for weak, moderate, strong, and very strong displayed on a screed during the scan? What are the instructions given to the participants before the start of the experiment? Do they induce any kind of pain expectancy (e.g., &quot;After 6 minutes the pain should start decreasing&quot; or analogous expressions)? A combination of those elements could explain the lack of pain variability.</p><p>• The behavioral outcome is called &quot;pain avoidance&quot; and the Authors hypothesize that it is proportional to the perceived pain. Is there any evidence proving this correlation? The collected ratings are the answer to the question &quot;how much do you want to avoid this experience in the future?&quot;. Is it possible that this question is too generic to be called pain avoidance? Did the Authors quantify in any way the effect of laying down in a scanner for long time? It might play a role in the avoidance index.</p><p>8) The dynamic measure employed by the Authors is better described from the term &quot;windowed functional connectivity&quot;. It is often considered a measure of dynamic functional connectivity and it gives information about fluctuations of the connectivity patterns over time. Nevertheless, the entire focus of the paper, including the title, is on dynamic networks, which inaccurately leads one to think of time-varying measures with higher temporal resolution. This allows one to follow network reorganization over time without averaging 2-min intervals in which several different brain mechanisms might play an important role. In summary, the assumption of constant response throughout 2-min periods of tonic pain and the use of Pearson correlations do not mirror the idea of dynamic analysis expressed by the Authors in title and introduction. Please consider removing &quot;dynamic&quot; from the title, reduce the emphasis on this concept, address possible confounds introduced by the choice of long windows and rephrase the aim of the study in terms of brain network reconfiguration over the main phases of tonic pain experience.</p><p>9) Procedure chosen for evoking sustained pain. The measures in figure 1B suggest that the intensity of the painful stimulation is not constant as expected for sustained pain (probably the effect washes out with the saliva). In this case, the first six-minute interval requires particular attention because it encapsulates the real tonic pain phase, and the following ones require more appropriate labels. Ideally the authors should cite previous studies showing that tongue evoked pain elicits a very specific behavioral response (summation, habituation/decrease of pain, absence of pain perception). Moreover, please address the following points:</p><p>• Does the procedure include a calibration phase? If yes, please add description in the Methods section. If not, how do the Authors explain the relatively small standard error of the mean reported in Figure 1?</p><p>• If possible, add citation proving that there is a very consistent behavioral (pain related) response to the capsaicin: no pain variability against what most of the evoked pain experiments showed.</p><p>• Please report in the supplementary material the dots distribution (box plot with visible dots) of the ratings at minute 0, 6, 14, 20.</p><p>10) Community detection analysis. Please clarify the following issues:</p><p>• The thresholding of the connectivity matrices for the binarization of the networks is certainly a weakness of the study and, more in general, of most of the connectivity analysis (only few estimators have known null distributions). Here, the chosen optimal threshold is the one that maximize the difference between conditions (capsaicin vs controls) in terms of global graph measures, including modularity. I suggest adding a comment on the effect of maximizing a measure depending on the modularity of the networks, on the subsequent community detection algorithm, also based on maximizing modularity (within the network this time). What is the Authors' opinion on this possible confound? Also, what is the rationale/hypothesis behind this procedure for obtaining sparse matrices?</p><p>• Did the Authors consider running the analysis with other resolution parameters (γ and omega)?</p><p>Group-level consensus community detection: I found this section difficult to follow, especially in terms of reasoning for specific choices and steps of the analysis.</p><p>• Step III: the standard definition of allegiance is a binary matrix whose elements are equal to one only when the two correspondent nodes belong to the same community (as the Authors described). After step III, a new index is computed as the mean of allegiance matrices over time and across subjects. Its value indicates the proportion (percentage) of subjects showing the two nodes in the same community at specific time points. Or how many times the two nodes belong to the same community during the early/middle/late stage of the experiment. Using the name allegiance (a binary measure) to indicate those percentages, might be misleading. I suggest using more appropriate names (measures like &quot;agreement&quot;, &quot;dwell time&quot; and similar might be useful) and providing more explanatory examples on how to read the value of the computed measures.</p><p>• Step IV: please specify number of permutations.</p><p>• Step VI: in the same spirit as the two previous comments, I suggest either reconsidering the necessity of this computation, or explaining the reasons for applying a community detection algorithm twice. I believe that additional layers of complexity always require a clear question that they can answer.</p><p>11) It remains unclear, how specific the results are to pain. Differences between the control resting state and the capsaicin trials might be – at least partially – driven by other factors, like motion artifacts, saliency, attention, axiety, etc. Differences between stages over the time-course might, additionally, be driven by scanner drifts (to which the applied approach might be less sensitive, but the possibility is still there ) or other gradual processes, e.g. shifts in arousal, attention shifts, alertness, etc. All the above factors might emerge as confounding bias in both of the predictive models. This problem should be thoroughly discussed, and at least the following extra analyses are recommended, in order to attenuate concerns related to the overall specificity and neurobiological validity of the results:</p><p>• Reporting of, and testing for motion estimates (mean, max, median framewise displacement or anything similar).</p><p>• Examining whether these factors might, at least partially, drive the predictive models.</p><p>• e.g. Applying the PCR model on the resting state data and verifying of the predicted timecourse is flat (no inverse U-shape, that is characteristic to all capsaicin trials).</p><p>12) Statistical inference. An important issue is the (apparent) lack of statistical inference when analyzing the differences in the group-level consensus community structures (both when comparing capsaicin to control and when analysing changes over the time-course of the capsaicin-challenge). Although the observed changes seem biologically plausible and fit very well to previous results, without proper statistical inference we can't determine, how likely such differences are to emerge just by chance. This makes all results on Figures 2 and 3, and points 1, 4 and 5 in the discussion partially or fully speculative or weakly underpinned, comprising a large proportion of the current version of the manuscript. There are two main ways of handling this issue:</p><p>• Enhancing (or clarifying potential misunderstandings regarding) the methodology (see my concrete, and hopefully feasible, suggestions in the &quot;private part&quot; of the review). There are likely many ways to test the significance of these differences. Two permutation testing-based ideas are (i) permuting the labels ctr-capsaicin, or early-mid-late, repeating the analysis, constructing the proper null distribution of e.g. the community size changes and obtain the p-values and (ii) &quot;trace back&quot; communities to the individual level and do (nonparametric) statistical inference there.</p><p>• De-weighting the presentation and the discussion of the related results.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>• The authors emphasize the term &quot;pain supersystem&quot;. This term is not very well-introduced yet and the necessity for such a term is unclear. I recommend that the authors rely less on this term and omit it at least from the abstract.</p><p>• The statement in the abstract &quot;In the early stage, the orofacial areas of the primary somatomotor cortex were separated from the other primary somatomotor cortices and integrated with…&quot; is a bit ambiguous. It might better read &quot;In the early stage, the orofacial areas of the primary somatomotor cortex were separated from other areas of the primary somatomotor cortex and integrated with…&quot;</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>• I suggest reducing the amount of text in the figures. All the information needed to understand the illustrations should be included in the captions. Figure 1 and Figure 7 are the ones that require the most attention in this respect.</p><p>• It might be a good idea to specify when any previous evidence used to justify the current analysis or to make inferences on the obtained results actually come from the Authors' previous publications. Especially if they are extracted from the same dataset, this information is relevant.</p><p>• In their previous paper, the Authors had access to a dataset including the experimental conditions: tonic capsaicin pain, tonic aversive taste, and tonic aversive odor. Did the Authors analyze the communities structure during those controls conditions? Did they consider testing their classifier on them? In my opinion, it would add a lot of robustness to the study findings, and it would make the obtained results reliable and unquestionably pain related (thinking of the more general avoidance ratings).</p><p>• In terms of data availability, the Authors declared that data and codes will be shared upon publication. I would appreciate their availability if there will be a second loop of revisions before potential publication.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– As the authors mention the cross-validated evaluation of the PCR model is biased due to hyperparameter optimization. While the independent evaluation resolves any related concerns, the authors might consider applying a nested cross-validation framework, to have unbiased estimates for the discovery dataset, as well.</p><p>– Optimizing the network density threshold in the same dataset, especially on one of the conditions-of-interest (Q1: capsaicin vs. controls) may be circular (as the optimized global network metrics may well be associated to the community structure). On the other hand, this potential circularity does not affect all he results (e.g definitely not the results based on the independent test dataset) and in general, I don't think this would significantly affect the results. Nevertheless, performing (or reproducing) the optimization on independent data would be reassuring. Alternatively, this issue must be discussed as a potential limitation/bias.</p><p>– While this is not explicitly stated, prediction performance is evaluated only on the within subject-level. For better comparability to other methods, please report and discuss the &quot;between-subject&quot; estimates, too (i.e. how well can we classify/predict from a single session/window of a single subject).</p><p>– Introduction: discussing the possible relation of the present work to chronic pain or other clinical pain conditions is not sufficient.</p><p>– More information is needed about the individual variability of the pain-related behavioral time-courses (maybe in the supplementary info). Was remission complete in all participants?</p><p>– Some participants might be more tolerant for capsaicin than others, due to eating habits. Please discuss whether this could potentially affect the results.</p><p>– At many points, e.g. in paragraph 25 on page x or 5 on page 25, it is mentioned that the models generalized across two datasets. While the terminology is currently heterogenous, I kindly suggest to use the term &quot;generalization&quot; only to the independent test dataset (here the models really had to generalize to scanning parameters, paradigm differences, etc.)</p><p>– it's a bit unclear why the pain avoidance ratings fall. One would, somewhat naively, hypothesize that if the participant once though she would never repeat this experiment again, why would she change her mind a couple of minutes later, when the memories of pain are still vivid. Please comment on this.</p><p>– Please add a short discussion of the differences of the behavioral ratings and how they might affect the findings. (this might be positive thing: a sign of generalization across behavioral assessment protocols).</p><p>– Please clarify why *pain* avoidance (slightly) increased in the control resting state scan.</p><p>– Please provide more rationale for the choice of ML algorithms.</p><p>– How were the hyperparameters set for the SVM? Why were those not optimized, too?</p><p>– Why was only one hub selected for the seed-based analysis in the case of the classifier?</p><p>– While the prediction performances are obviously significant, testing for this with bootstrapping may be suboptimal, as bootstrap samples may inherit non-normality from the parent dataset. Permutation test would be more &quot;elegant&quot; in my opinion.</p><p>– Discussion: relation to consciousness might be somewhat speculative, should be hedged.</p><p>– Will the raw data also be shared?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74463.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It remains unclear whether the changes of brain networks over time simply reflect the duration of sustained pain or whether they essentially reflect different levels of pain intensity/avoidance.

With the current experimental paradigm, it is difficult to dissociate the pain duration from the level of pain because the delivery of oral capsaicin commonly induces initial bursting and then a gradual decrease of pain over time. That is, the pain duration is correlated with the pain intensity in our task.</p><p>However, when we examined the time-course of the ratings at each individual level (as shown in Appendix 1—figure 2 ), the time duration explained 53.7% of the rating variance, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.537 ± 0.315 (mean ± standard deviation). In addition, if we constrain the β coefficient of the time duration to be negative (i.e., ratings should decrease over time), the explained variance decreases to 48.2%, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.482 ± 0.457, leaving us enough variance (i.e., greater than 50%) for examining the distinct effects of time duration and ratings on the patterns of functional brain reorganization.</p><p>Indeed, the two main analyses included in the manuscript—consensus community detection and predictive modeling—were designed to examine those two aspects of the task, i.e., time duration and pain avoidance ratings, respectively. First, through the consensus community detection analysis, we examined the community structure that changes over time, i.e., across the early, middle, and late periods (as shown in Figure 3). We then developed predictive models of pain avoidance ratings in the second main analysis (as shown in Figure 5).</p><p>Though it is still a caveat that we cannot fully dissociate the effects of time duration versus pain ratings, we could interpret the first set of results to be more about time duration, while the second set of results is more about pain ratings.</p><p>We now added a description of the implication of predictive modeling for isolating the effects of pain ratings. In addition, a discussion on the caveat of the current experimental design and relevant future direction.</p><p>Revisions to the main manuscript:</p><p>p. 25:</p><p>“Moreover, developing models to directly predict the pain ratings is helpful to complement the group-level analysis, because the changes in consensus community structure over the early, middle, and late periods only indirectly reflect the different levels of pain.”</p><p>p. 27:</p><p>“This study also had some limitations.

Now we added additional (but simple) descriptions of module allegiance and consensus community detection methods.</p><p>Revisions to the main manuscript:</p><p>pp. 8-9:</p><p>“Here, the consensus community means the group-level representative structures of the distinct community partitions of individuals. To determine the consensus community across different individuals and times, we first obtained the module allegiance (Bassett et al., 2011) from the community assignment of each individual. Module allegiance assesses how much a pair of nodes is likely to be affiliated with the same community label, and is defined as a matrix T whose element T<sub>ij</sub> is 1 when nodes i and j are assigned to the same community and 0 when assigned to different communities. This conversion of the categorical community assignments to the continuous module allegiance values allows group-level summarization of different community structures of individuals.”</p><p>p. 14:</p><p>“Here, high module allegiance indicates the voxels of two regions are likely to be in the same community affiliation, and vice versa.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The added value of the assessment of the dynamics of brain networks remains unclear. Specifically, it is unclear whether the current analysis of brain networks dynamics allows for a clearer distinction between and prediction of pain and no-pain states than other measures of static or dynamic brain activity or static measures of brain connectivity. Therefore, clarifying the added value of the community structure analysis as compared to other more common analyses of brain activity and brain connectivity would significantly strengthen the case.</p></disp-quote><p>The main goal (and thus, the added value) of the current study was to provide a “mechanistic” understanding of the brain processes of sustained pain, rather than the “prediction.” Even though we included the results from the predictive modeling, as in Figures 4-6, our focus was more on the interpretation of the model to quantitatively examine the functional changes in the brain, not on the maximization of the prediction performance.</p><p>Indeed, maximizing the prediction performance was the main goal of our previous study (Lee et al., 2021), in which we developed a predictive model of sustained pain based on the patterns of dynamic functional connectivity. The model showed better prediction performances compared to the current study, but it was challenging to interpret the model because of the high dimensionality of the model and its features. In addition, functional connectivity itself provides only limited insight into how functional brain networks are structured and reconfigured over time.</p><p>In this sense, the multi-layer community detection method has several advantages to achieving our goal. First, the community detection analysis allows us to summarize the complex, high-dimensional whole-brain connectivity patterns into neurobiologically interpretable subsystems. Second, the multi-layer community detection method allows us to study the temporal changes in community structure by connecting the same nodes across different time points.</p><p>Now we added a description of the rationale behind the choice of the multi-layer community detection analysis over the conventional functional connectivity methods, and the added value of our study.</p><p>Revisions to the main manuscript:</p><p>p. 3:</p><p>“In this study, we examined the reconfiguration of whole-brain functional networks underlying the natural fluctuation in sustained pain to provide a mechanistic understanding of the brain responses to sustained pain.”</p><p>p. 7:</p><p>“In this study, we used this approach to examine the temporal changes of brain network structures during sustained pain, which cannot be done with conventional functional connectivity-based analyses (Lee et al., 2021).”</p><p>p. 27:</p><p>“However, the previous model provides a limited level of mechanistic understanding because of the high dimensionality of the model and its features. In addition, functional connectivity itself provides only limited insight into how functional brain networks are structured and reconfigured over time.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The Authors do not touch upon the concept of temporal summation of pain, historically associated with tonic pain. Please comment on the relationship of the present study to temporal summation particularly since chronic pain patients often exhibit increased temporal summation of pain.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer and editor for the comment on this important topic. Temporal summation of pain indicates progressively increased sensation of pain during prolonged noxious stimulation (Price, Hu, Dubner, and Gracely, 1977), and has been suggested as a hallmark of chronic pain disorders including fibromyalgia (Cheng et al., 2022; Price et al., 2002). In a recent study by Cheng et al. (2022), the authors induced tonic pain using constantly high cuff pressure and examined whether the participants experienced increased pain in the late period compared to the early period of pain. On the contrary, in our experimental paradigm, the capsaicin liquid initially delivered into the oral cavity is being cleaned out by saliva, and thus overall pain intensity was decreasing over time, not increasing (Figure 1B). Therefore, the temporal summation of pain may occur in a limited period (e.g., the early period of the run), but it is difficult to examine its effect systematically in our study.</p><p>However, it is notable that Cheng et al.’s results overlap with our findings. For example, Cheng et al. reported the intra-network segregation within the somatomotor network and the inter-network integration between the somatomotor and other networks during the temporal summation of pressure pain in patients with fibromyalgia, which were similar to the findings we reported in Appendix 1—figure 9 and Figure 4. Although it is unclear whether these results reflect the temporal summation of pain, these network-level features shared across the two studies are likely to be an essential component of the sustained pain processes in the brain.</p><p>Now we added a comment on the temporal summation of pain in the main manuscript.</p><p>Revisions to the main manuscript (p. 26):</p><p>“Interestingly, a recent fMRI study on the temporal summation of pain in fibromyalgia patients reported results similar to ours (Cheng et al., 2022), including the intra-network dissociation within the somatomotor network and the inter-network integration between the somatomotor and other networks during pain. Although we cannot directly examine whether the temporal summation of pain gave rise to these network-level changes due to the limitation of our experimental paradigm, these consistent findings between the two studies may suggest that our findings could be generalized to clinical conditions.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Please consider a recent related paper by Cheng et al., Arthritis Rheumatol, 2021 that shares most of the methodological pipeline to highlight similarities and novelties and deepen the comparison with the associated literature.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer and editor for the information about this recent publication. Cheng et al. (2022) was not published at the time we wrote the manuscript, and we were surprised that Cheng et al. shares many aspects with our study, e.g., both used multilayer community detection and also reported similar findings, as described above.</p><p>However, there were some differences between the two studies as well.</p><p>First, the focus of our study was on the brain dynamics during the natural time-course of sustained pain from its initiation to remission in healthy participants, whereas the focus of Cheng et al. was on the temporal summation phenomenon of pain (TSP) and the enhanced TSP in patients with fibromyalgia patients. Because of this difference in the research focuses, our study and Cheng et al. are providing many nonoverlapping results and insights. For example, our study paid particular attention to the coping mechanisms of the brain (e.g., the network-level changes in the subcortical and frontoparietal network regions) and the brain systems that are correlated with the natural decrease of pain (e.g., the cerebellum in Figure 5). In contrast, Cheng et al. (2022) identified the brain connectivity and network features important for the increased TSP in fibromyalgia patients.</p><p>Second, our great interest was in identifying and visualizing the fine-grained spatiotemporal patterns of functional brain network changes over the period of sustained pain. To utilize fine-grained brain activity information, we conducted our main analyses at a voxel-level resolution and on the native brain space, such as in Figures 2-3 and Appendix 1—figures 5, 7, and 8. With this fine-grained spatiotemporal mapping, we were able to identify small, but important voxel-level dynamics.</p><p>We now cited Cheng et al. (2022) in multiple places and revised the manuscript accordingly.</p><p>Revisions to the main manuscript (p. 26):</p><p>“Interestingly, a recent fMRI study on the temporal summation of pain in fibromyalgia patients reported results similar to ours (Cheng et al., 2022), including the intra-network dissociation within the somatomotor network and the inter-network integration between the somatomotor and other networks during pain.

This is not a limitation per se, but the conclusion about offering new insights into understanding mechanisms at the basis of chronic pain is too far from the results. A similar pipeline has been actually applied to chronic pain patients (Cheng et al., Arthritis Rheumatol, 2021, Lee et al., Nat Med. 2021). Discussing the results of the present paper in relationship to those, could offer a more robust way to connect the Authors' results to networks behavior in pathological brains.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for the opportunity to discuss the clinical implication of our study. First of all, we agree with the reviewer and editor that we cannot make a definitive claim about chronic pain with the current study, and thus, we revised the last sentence of the abstract to tone down our claim.</p><p>Revisions to the main manuscript (p. 2, in the abstract):</p><p>“This study provides new insights into how multiple brain systems dynamically interact to construct and modulate pain experience, advancing our mechanistic understanding of sustained pain.”</p><p>However, as we noted above in Essential revisions 4, some of our findings were consistent with the findings from a previous clinical study (Cheng et al., 2022), suggesting the potential to generalize our study to clinical pain conditions. In addition, we previously reported that a predictive model of sustained pain derived from healthy participants performed better at predicting the pain severity of chronic pain patients than the model derived directly from chronic pain patients (Lee et al., 2021), highlighting the advantage of the “component process approach.”</p><p>The component process approach aims to develop brain-based biomarkers for basic component processes first, which can then serve as intermediate features for the modeling of multiple clinical conditions (Woo, Chang, Lindquist, and Wager, 2017). This has been one of the core ideas of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) (Insel et al., 2010) and the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) (Kotov et al., 2017). If the clinical pain of a patient group is modeled as a whole, it becomes unclear what is being modeled because of the multidimensional and heterogeneous nature of clinical pain (Melzack, 1999) as well as other co-occurring health conditions (e.g., mental health issues, medication use, etc.). The component process approach, in contrast, can specify which components are being modeled and are relatively free from heterogeneity and comorbidity issues by experimentally manipulating the specific component of interest in healthy participants.</p><p>The current study was conducted on healthy young adults based on the component process approach. We used oral capsaicin to experimentally induce sustained pain, which unfolds over protracted time periods and has been suggested to reflect some of the essential features of clinical pain (Rainville, Feine, Bushnell, and Duncan, 1992; Stohler and Kowalski, 1999). Therefore, the detailed characterization of the brain processes of sustained pain will be able to serve as an intermediate feature of multiple clinical conditions in future studies.</p><p>Now we added the discussion on the clinical generalizability issue in the Discussion section.</p><p>Revisions to the main manuscript:</p><p>p. 26:</p><p>“An interesting future direction would be to examine whether the current results can be generalized to clinical pain. Experimental tonic pain has been known to share similar characteristics with clinical pain (Rainville et al., 1992; Stohler and Kowalski, 1999). In addition, in a recent study, we showed that an fMRI connectivity-based signature for capsaicin-induced orofacial tonic pain can be generalized to chronic back pain (Lee et al., 2021). Therefore, a detailed characterization of the brain responses to sustained pain has the potential to provide useful information about clinical pain.”</p><p>p. 26:</p><p>“Interestingly, a recent fMRI study on the temporal summation of pain in fibromyalgia patients reported results similar to ours (Cheng et al., 2022), including the intra-network dissociation within the somatomotor network and the inter-network integration between the somatomotor and other networks during pain.

It might not be an appropriate measure considering the total absence of pain variability in the reported responses over forty-eight subjects. Please discuss this important point.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that pain avoidance measures are not fully validated in the healthy population. Nevertheless, we used this measure in this study for the following two main reasons that outweigh the limitations.</p><p>First, a pain avoidance rating provides an integrative measure that can reflect the multi-dimensional aspects of sustained pain. One of the essential functions of pain is to avoid harmful situations and promote survival, and the avoidance motivation induced by pain is composed of not only sensory-discriminative, but also cognitive components including learning, valuation, and contexts (Melzack, 1999). According to the fear-avoidance model (Vlaeyen and Linton, 2012), if the pain-induced avoidance motivation is not resolved for a long time and is maladaptively associated with innocuous environments, chronic pain is likely to develop, suggesting the importance and clinical relevance of pain avoidance measures. In addition, our experimental design is particularly suitable for the use of avoidance rating because the oral capsaicin stimulation is accompanied by the urge to avoid the painful sensation, but it cannot immediately be resolved similar to chronic pain. Moreover, capsaicin is sometimes experienced as intense but less aversive (or even appetitive) in some cases, e.g., spicy food craver (Stevenson and Yeomans, 1993). In this case, avoidance ratings can provide a more reasonable measure of pain compared to the intensity rating.</p><p>Second, the avoidance measure provides a common scale on which we can compare different types of aversive experiences, allowing us to conduct specificity tests for a predictive model of pain. For example, a recent study successfully compared the brain representations of two types of pain and two types of aversive, but non-painful experiences (e.g., aversive auditory and visual experiences) using the same avoidance measure (Ceko, Kragel, Woo, Lopez-Sola, and Wager, 2022). These comparisons were possible because the avoidance measure provided one common scale for all the aversive experiences regardless of their types of stimuli.</p><p>To provide a better justification for the use of the avoidance measure, we now included the specificity test results of our pain predictive models. More specifically, we tested our module allegiance-based SVM and PCR models of pain on the aversive taste and aversive odor conditions (Appendix 1—figure 13 ).</p><p>Despite these advantages, the use of avoidance rating without thorough validation is a limitation of the current study, and thus future studies need to examine the psychometric properties of the avoidance rating, e.g., examining the relationship among pain intensity, unpleasantness, and avoidance measures. However, the current study showed that the predictive models derived with pain avoidance rating (Study 1) could be used to predict the pain intensity rating (Study 2). In addition, the overall time-course of pain avoidance ratings in Study 1 was similar to the time-course of pain intensity ratings in Study 2, providing some supporting evidence for the convergent validity of the pain avoidance measure.</p><p>As to the following comment, <italic>“It might not be an appropriate measure considering the total absence of pain variability in the reported responses over forty-eight subjects,”</italic> there are pieces of evidence supporting that the low between-individual variability of ratings is due to the characteristics of our experimental design, not to the fact that we used the avoidance measure. As we discussed in more detail in our response to Essential revisions 1, our experimental procedure based on capsaicin liquid commonly induces the initial burst of painful sensation and the subsequent gradual relief for most of the participants (Figure 1B, left). A similar time-course pattern of ratings was observed in Study 2 (Figure 1B, right), which used the pain “intensity” rating, not the pain avoidance rating. In addition, previous studies with a similar experimental design (i.e., intra-oral capsaicin application) (Berry and Simons, 2020; Lu, Baad-Hansen, List, Zhang, and Svensson, 2013; Ngom, Dubray, Woda, and Dallel, 2001) also showed a similar time-course of pain ratings with low between-individual variability regardless of the rating types (e.g., VAS or irritation intensity), confirming that this observation is not unique to the pain avoidance rating.</p><p>Now we added descriptions on the small between-individual variability of pain ratings and the use of avoidance ratings.</p><p>Revisions to the main manuscript:</p><p>pp. 5-7:</p><p>“Note that the overall trend of pain ratings over time was similar across participants because of the characteristics of our experimental design, which has also been observed in the previous studies that used oral capsaicin (Berry and Simons, 2020; Lu et al., 2013; Ngom et al., 2001). However, also note that each individual’s time-course of pain ratings were not entirely the same (Appendix 1—figures 2 and 3).”</p><p>p. 26:</p><p>“However, there are also differences between the characteristics of capsaicin-induced tonic pain versus clinical pain. For example, clinical pain continuously fluctuates over time in an idiosyncratic pattern (Apkarian, Krauss, Fredrickson, and Szeverenyi, 2001), whereas capsaicin-induced tonic pain showed a similar time-course pattern across the participants—i.e., increasing rapidly and then decreasing gradually (Figure 1B). This typical time-course of pain ratings has been reported in previous studies that used oral capsaicin (Berry and Simons, 2020; Lu et al., 2013; Ngom et al., 2001).”</p><p>pp. 26-27:</p><p>“Note that Study 1 used a pain avoidance measure that is not yet fully validated in healthy participants. However, we chose to use the pain avoidance measure, which can provide integrative information on the multi-dimensional aspects of pain (Melzack, 1999; Waddell, Newton, Henderson, Somerville, and Main, 1993). It also has a clinical implication considering that the maladaptive associations of pain avoidance to innocuous environments have been suggested as a putative mechanism of transition to chronic pain (Vlaeyen and Linton, 2012). Lastly, the avoidance measure can provide a common scale across different modalities of aversive experience, allowing us to compare their distinct brain representations (Ceko et al., 2022) or test the specificity of their predictive models (Lee et al., 2021) (Appendix 1—figure 13). Although the psychometric properties of the pain avoidance measure should be a topic of future investigation, we expect that the pain avoidance measure would have a high level of convergent validity with pain intensity given the observed similarity between pain avoidance (Study 1) and pain intensity (Study 2) in their temporal profiles. The generalizability of our PCR model across Studies 1 and 2 also supports this speculation. However, there would also be situations in which pain avoidance is dissociated from pain intensity. For example, capsaicin can be experienced to be intense but less aversive or even appetitive in some contexts, such as cravings for spicy food (Stevenson and Yeomans, 1993). In addition, the gradual rise of avoidance ratings during the late period of the control condition in Study 1 would not be observed if the intensity measure was used. Future studies need to examine the relationship between pain avoidance and the other pain assessments and the advantage of using the pain avoidance measure.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Moreover, please address the following questions:</p><p>• How does the rating scale look like? Is the meaning of the anchors and of the thresholds for weak, moderate, strong, and very strong displayed on a screed during the scan? What are the instructions given to the participants before the start of the experiment? Do they induce any kind of pain expectancy (e.g., &quot;After 6 minutes the pain should start decreasing&quot; or analogous expressions)? A combination of those elements could explain the lack of pain variability.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this question. First, we now added the scale and rating instruction that we used in Study 1 to present the experimental procedure more clearly (Appendix 1—figure 1).</p><p>Next, below are the scripts for explaining the instruction of pain avoidance rating translated into English.</p><p>“We will explain the rating scale that you will use with a trackball mouse during the fMRI scan. You will be asked to report ratings during the experiment, so please carefully listen to the following instructions.</p><p>Throughout all sessions except for the structural scan, you will see the following scale on the screen. Use the trackball to move the yellow bar like this to report your ratings.</p><p>You will see the question on the screen, “how much do you want to avoid this experience in the future?”. You will report your ratings using the following anchors, ranging from “Not at all” to “Most.” These anchors will not be shown during the scan, so please remember the location of each indicator. To help understand the rating scale, you can think about “how much money would I be paid to do this experience again?”. “Not at all” is an experience you can have again without any monetary reward, whereas “Most” is an experience you do not want to do again no matter how much money you will be paid. “Moderately” is an experience you want to avoid moderately, and “Very strong” is an experience that you would want to avoid immediately, like grabbing and immediately dropping a cup of coffee that you just bought.</p><p>Please explain how you understood the scale back to me. (Participants explain) In case you intermittently experience very severe pain, you can rate your pain over “Very strongly.” It is totally okay to rate your pain higher than “Very strongly,” but if your ratings are continuously higher than “Very strongly,” we will consider it too much pain for you and immediately stop the experiment.”</p><p>As described above, we did not show anchors and descriptors during scans, and there was no instruction that may induce any kind of pain expectancy. Therefore, these factors are not likely to cause the low variability of pain ratings.</p><p>We also put substantial effort into the design and instruction of the rating scale to reduce between-individual variance potentially coming from the different understanding and different uses across participants. For example, we used the general labeled magnitude scale (gLMS) (Bartoshuk et al., 2004), which features intermediate anchors with quasi-logarithmic spacing to permit valid comparisons of sensory experiences between individuals. We explained the meaning of these anchors to participants in great detail and thoroughly checked whether they understood them correctly before the scan. In addition, we let the participants practice the use of the rating scale in the scanner before we started the experiment. We believe that these efforts helped reduce the unwanted between-subject variance in ratings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The behavioral outcome is called &quot;pain avoidance&quot; and the Authors hypothesize that it is proportional to the perceived pain. Is there any evidence proving this correlation? The collected ratings are the answer to the question &quot;how much do you want to avoid this experience in the future?&quot;. Is it possible that this question is too generic to be called pain avoidance? Did the Authors quantify in any way the effect of laying down in a scanner for long time? It might play a role in the avoidance index.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed in Essential revisions 7 above, the pain avoidance measure is not fully validated in a healthy population, which is a limitation of our study. There is currently no previous literature that proved the correlation between continuous ratings of pain avoidance and those of pain intensity. However, we think that the pain avoidance and intensity are correlated at least within our experimental paradigm, considering the similar patterns over time between pain avoidance ratings in Study 1 and pain intensity ratings in Study 2 (Figure 1B). The two studies used the same experimental procedure for capsaicin delivery, except that Study 2 used half amount of capsaicin compared to Study 1 because of the shorter scan time.</p><p>However, pain avoidance and pain intensity are not identical of course, and there can be some conditions in which the two measures are dissociated (Rainville, Duncan, Price, Carrier, and Bushnell, 1997). Our research group will examine the relationship between pain intensity and avoidance in future studies.</p><p>The instruction for the avoidance rating was “Please continuously report how much you want to avoid this experience in the future” (Appendix 1-figure 1). Indeed, we did not specify “pain” in the instruction and intentionally made it generic to use it across different experimental conditions including the bitter taste and aversive odor conditions. The main reason for this was to compare these multiple conditions on the same scale (Appendix 1-figure 13). For this reason, we also observed a slow increase in the avoidance rating score during the control run (Figure 1B), and this is understandable because lying down in a scanner for a long time could become aversive.</p><p>Although we understand the concern that our rating was too generic to be called ‘pain avoidance,’ we called it ‘pain avoidance’ because the effect of pain on the changes in avoidance ratings was evident in our analyses (e.g., capsaicin vs. control, early vs. middle vs. late, etc.), and thus the use of ‘pain avoidance’ is not a misnomer or overstatement. However, we will be happy to reconsider it and change the term into an alternative name, such as the ‘avoidance rating,’ if the reviewer thinks it is better.</p><p>Now we added a detailed discussion on the use of pain avoidance ratings.</p><p>Revisions to the main manuscript (pp. 26-27):</p><p>“Note that Study 1 used a pain avoidance measure that is not yet fully validated in healthy participants.

It is often considered a measure of dynamic functional connectivity and it gives information about fluctuations of the connectivity patterns over time. Nevertheless, the entire focus of the paper, including the title, is on dynamic networks, which inaccurately leads one to think of time-varying measures with higher temporal resolution. This allows one to follow network reorganization over time without averaging 2-min intervals in which several different brain mechanisms might play an important role. In summary, the assumption of constant response throughout 2-min periods of tonic pain and the use of Pearson correlations do not mirror the idea of dynamic analysis expressed by the Authors in title and introduction. Please consider removing &quot;dynamic&quot; from the title, reduce the emphasis on this concept, address possible confounds introduced by the choice of long windows and rephrase the aim of the study in terms of brain network reconfiguration over the main phases of tonic pain experience.</p></disp-quote><p>Now we removed the word ‘dynamic’ from many places in the manuscript, including the title. In addition, we added a brief discussion on the reason we chose to use the long and non-overlapping windows for connectivity calculation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions to the main manuscript (p. 8):</p></disp-quote><p>“Although the long duration of the time window without overlaps may obscure the fine-grained temporal dynamics in functional connectivity patterns, we chose to use this long time window based on previous literature (Bassett et al., 2011; Robinson, Atlas, and Wager, 2015), which also used long time windows to obtain more reliable estimates of network structures and their transitions.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Procedure chosen for evoking sustained pain. The measures in figure 1B suggest that the intensity of the painful stimulation is not constant as expected for sustained pain (probably the effect washes out with the saliva). In this case, the first six-minute interval requires particular attention because it encapsulates the real tonic pain phase, and the following ones require more appropriate labels. Ideally the authors should cite previous studies showing that tongue evoked pain elicits a very specific behavioral response (summation, habituation/decrease of pain, absence of pain perception).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the important comment and suggestions. We indeed conducted an extensive search to find appropriate labels for the three phases (i.e., early, middle, and late) for orofacial capsaicin pain, but we could not find one that fits our experimental design well. In addition, we have been hesitant about using the suggested terms, such as <italic>habituation</italic> or <italic>summation</italic>. For example, Segerdahl et al. (2015) used the term “habituation” for the late period of the tonic leg pain induced by topical capsaicin cream. This term seems reasonable for the study in which there was a decrease in pain without the removal of topical capsaicin cream. However, in our case, the decrease in pain can be driven by 1) the gradual removal of capsaicin by saliva over time and 2) active top-down pain regulation. These cannot be described with the term, <italic>habituation</italic>. Segerdahl et al. (2015) also used “relief” to describe the remission of pain after the analgesic procedure (e.g., cooling), but our experiment included no analgesic procedure and thus labeling the late period of pain in our study as “relief” may mislead the readers.</p><p>We also had a detailed discussion about the relationship between our study and “temporal summation” in Essential revisions 4. Briefly here, the temporal summation of pain may occur in our experiment, but only in a limited period of time (e.g., the very early period of the run). In addition, it is difficult to systematically investigate the temporal summation effect in our study due to our experimental design. Therefore, it is not clear to us whether the term “summation” can convey the precise meaning of the early period of pain in our study.</p><p>According to our literature search, most of the previous studies on oral capsaicin used simple descriptive terms such as increasing or decreasing, which are similar to our description of the three phases of pain—(1) the initiation and maintenance of pain, (2) gradual decrease of pain, and (3) full remission of pain. Some of the previous studies labeled the late period of capsaicin-induced pain as the “waning” period (Chang, Arendt-Nielsen, Graven-Nielsen, Svensson, and Chen, 2001a, 2001b; Coghill, Sang, Berman, Bennett, and Iadarola, 1998; Iadarola et al., 1998). Although we could not come up with better labels than our current labels at this point, we are open to suggestions and will be happy to change the terms in the next round of revision if possible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Moreover, please address the following points:</p><p>• Does the procedure include a calibration phase? If yes, please add description in the Methods section.

Please clarify the following issues:</p><p>• The thresholding of the connectivity matrices for the binarization of the networks is certainly a weakness of the study and, more in general, of most of the connectivity analysis (only few estimators have known null distributions). Here, the chosen optimal threshold is the one that maximize the difference between conditions (capsaicin vs controls) in terms of global graph measures, including modularity. I suggest adding a comment on the effect of maximizing a measure depending on the modularity of the networks, on the subsequent community detection algorithm, also based on maximizing modularity (within the network this time). What is the Authors' opinion on this possible confound? Also, what is the rationale/hypothesis behind this procedure for obtaining sparse matrices?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the comment and understand the concerns regarding the choice of thresholding parameters. In the following paragraphs, we tried our best to explain the rationale behind our connectivity thresholding and how we mitigated the possible confound from this procedure.</p><p>It is often considered a prerequisite to apply thresholding to functional connectivity matrices for brain network analyses (van den Heuvel et al., 2017) because many of the graph analytics were developed for sparse networks (Newman, 2010) and functional connectivity data were likely to contain many spurious correlations. What remains controversial is how to determine the level of thresholding. In an ideal condition, results for the multiple levels of thresholding can be separately reported and discussed. However, we could not repeat all the main analyses multiple times to test different threshold levels (e.g., 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 as Appendix 1—figure 4), each of which takes approximately a few months because the current study used high-dimensional voxel-level connectome data and also the multiple iterations of community detection processes to obtain robust estimates of community structures. Because of the huge computational burden, we could not try all different options and had to determine the one threshold level among the possible candidate values, which should be based on a priori criteria to avoid an arbitrary decision like picking up a specific level of network density (e.g., 0.05 or 0.1). In the current study, we chose the threshold level that maximizes the contrast between the global-level network measures of the capsaicin and control conditions. The chosen threshold level was 0.05, which is a common value for the thresholding of functional connectivity in network neuroscience studies.</p><p>In addition, there could be a concern that we examined the network-level contrast between the capsaicin vs. control conditions (e.g., Figure 2) using the threshold that maximized the difference between the conditions. However, its confounding effect should be minimal for the following reasons. First, our main analysis (i.e., multi-layer community detection) was based on weighted networks from all ten time-bins, whereas the global-level network attributes that we used to determine the threshold level were obtained by averaging all time-bin network data and binarizing them to make it unweighted networks. Thus, two analyses were based on different data and the confounding effect should be minimal. Second, most of the global-level network measures used for determining the threshold level were not directly relevant to our community detection analyses except for the modularity measure. Even without the modularity measure, the selection of the threshold level is unchanged. Third, the time-varying changes in brain networks within the capsaicin condition (e.g., Figures 3 and 5) are not relevant to the choice of thresholding, which was based on the contrast between the capsaicin vs. control conditions. Lastly, our SVM (Figure 4) and PCR models (Figure 5) were generalized to the independent test dataset (Study 2, <italic>n</italic> = 74) that was not used to determine the threshold level.</p><p>Now we added a discussion on the choice of network density threshold.</p><p>Revisions to the main manuscript (p. 28):</p><p>“Lastly, the optimization of the network density threshold to maximize the differences in a priori network attributes between the capsaicin versus control conditions may influence the results comparing the community structures between the two conditions. However, our main results were based on temporal dynamics across all time bins, whereas the global-level network attributes that we used to determine the level of threshold were based on the averaged data across all time bins. In addition, our SVM and PCR models were generalized to the independent test dataset, which was not used to determine the threshold level. Therefore, the confounding effect of thresholding on our main results should be minimal.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) Did the Authors consider running the analysis with other resolution parameters (γ and omega)?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the important suggestion. However, it is currently not feasible to try different options of parameter sets because of the extremely heavy computational load as described in Essential revisions 15. We followed the conventional choice (γ = 1 and ω = 1) (Bassett, Yang, Wymbs, and Grafton, 2015) similar to many previous studies (Bassett et al., 2011; Bassett, Wymbs, et al., 2013; Bassett et al., 2015; Betzel, Satterthwaite, Gold, and Bassett, 2017; Braun et al., 2016; Braun et al., 2015; Cocuzza, Ito, Schultz, Bassett, and Cole, 2020; Finc et al., 2020; Gifford et al., 2020; Han et al., 2020; Khambhati, Mattar, Wymbs, Grafton, and Bassett, 2018; Lydon-Staley, Ciric, Satterthwaite, and Bassett, 2019; Lydon-Staley, Kuehner, et al., 2019; Pedersen, Zalesky, Omidvarnia, and Jackson, 2018; Shine, Koyejo, and Poldrack, 2016; Telesford et al., 2016). However, we agree that it would be important to test multiple sets of resolution parameters (Betzel and Bassett, 2017) to examine the effects of the parameters. This is a part of the reason that we conducted the predictive modeling, which allows us to avoid excessive reverse-inference from the parameter-sensitive results alone (as described in the Discussion, pp. 27-28).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) Group-level consensus community detection: I found this section difficult to follow, especially in terms of reasoning for specific choices and steps of the analysis.</p><p>• Step III: the standard definition of allegiance is a binary matrix whose elements are equal to one only when the two correspondent nodes belong to the same community (as the Authors described). After step III, a new index is computed as the mean of allegiance matrices over time and across subjects. Its value indicates the proportion (percentage) of subjects showing the two nodes in the same community at specific time points. Or how many times the two nodes belong to the same community during the early/middle/late stage of the experiment. Using the name allegiance (a binary measure) to indicate those percentages, might be misleading. I suggest using more appropriate names (measures like &quot;agreement&quot;, &quot;dwell time&quot; and similar might be useful) and providing more explanatory examples on how to read the value of the computed measures.</p></disp-quote><p>To our best knowledge, the term “allegiance,” “mean allegiance,” or “averaged allegiance” have been used to indicate the time-averaged, subject-averaged, or both time-and subject-averaged module allegiance matrix in previous studies (Bassett et al., 2015; Farahani et al., 2022; Finc et al., 2020; Gifford et al., 2020). Therefore, the use of “allegiance” in our study does not seem to be problematic. However, we also know the term “agreement” has often been used as an alternative to the “allegiance” (Barroso et al., 2021; Baum et al., 2017; Cheng et al., 2022; Mano et al., 2018). Thus, we are willing to revise the term accordingly if the reviewer thinks we should change the term.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18) Step IV: please specify number of permutations.</p></disp-quote><p>Permutation was performed once per each of the original community assignments as in the previous study by Bassett (Bassett et al., 2015). We now specified the number of permutations.</p><p>Revisions to the main manuscript (p. 34):</p><p>“Permutation was performed once per each of the original community assignments.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19) Step VI: in the same spirit as the two previous comments, I suggest either reconsidering the necessity of this computation, or explaining the reasons for applying a community detection algorithm twice. I believe that additional layers of complexity always require a clear question that they can answer.</p></disp-quote><p>Since the multilayer community detection algorithm is non-deterministic and has near-degeneracies, it has been recommended to repeat the community detection multiple times and obtain the consensus partition among the iterations (Bassett, Porter, et al., 2013). In the current study, we followed this recommendation as in many previous studies (Bassett, Porter, et al., 2013; Baum et al., 2017; Braun et al., 2015; Marquez-Legorreta et al., 2022; Mattar, Thompson-Schill, and Bassett, 2018; Petrican and Levine, 2018). Although we understand the considerate comment regarding the complexity of the consensus clustering method, we believe this method provides a reliable and representative community partition that can be replicated over repeated iterations, which is particularly beneficial for the comparison of group-level community structures between different conditions (Figure 2) or time (Figure 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>20) It remains unclear, how specific the results are to pain. Differences between the control resting state and the capsaicin trials might be – at least partially – driven by other factors, like motion artifacts, saliency, attention, anxiety, etc. Differences between stages over the time-course might, additionally, be driven by scanner drifts (to which the applied approach might be less sensitive, but the possibility is still there) or other gradual processes, e.g. shifts in arousal, attention shifts, alertness, etc. All the above factors might emerge as confounding bias in both of the predictive models. This problem should be thoroughly discussed, and at least the following extra analyses are recommended, in order to attenuate concerns related to the overall specificity and neurobiological validity of the results:</p><p>• Reporting of, and testing for motion estimates (mean, max, median framewise displacement or anything similar).</p><p>• Examining whether these factors might, at least partially, drive the predictive models.</p><p>• e.g. Applying the PCR model on the resting state data and verifying of the predicted timecourse is flat (no inverse U-shape, that is characteristic to all capsaicin trials).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment on the important issue regarding the specificity of our results and the potential influences of noise. The effects of head motion and physiological confounds are particularly relevant to pain studies because pain involves substantial physiological changes and often causes head motion. To address the related concerns of specificity, we conducted additional analyses assessing the independence of our predictive models (i.e., SVM and PCR models) from head movement and physiology variables and the specificity of our models to pain versus non-painful aversive conditions (i.e., bitter taste and aversive odor) in Study 1.</p><p>First, we examined the overall changes of framewise displacement (FD) (Power, Barnes, Snyder, Schlaggar, and Petersen, 2012), heart rate (HR), and respiratory rate (RR) in the capsaicin condition (Appendix 1—figure 11 ). For the univariate comparison between the capsaicin vs. control conditions (Appendix 1—figure 11A), the results showed that, as expected, the capsaicin condition caused significant changes in head motion and autonomic responses. The mean FD and HR were significantly higher, and the RR was lower in the capsaicin condition compared to the control condition (FD: t<sub>47</sub> = 5.30, P = 2.98 × 10<sup>-6</sup>; HR: t<sub>43</sub> = 4.98, P = 1.10 × 10<sup>-5</sup>; RR: t<sub>43</sub> = -1.91, P = 0.063, paired t-test). In addition, the increased motion and autonomic responses were more prominent in the early period of pain (Appendix 1—figure 11B). The 10-binned (2 mins per time-bin) FD and HR showed a decreasing trend while the RR showed an increasing trend over time in the capsaicin condition. The comparisons between the early (1-3 bins, 0-6 min) vs. late (8-10 bins, 14-20 min) periods of the capsaicin condition showed significant differences both for FD and HR (FD: t<sub>47</sub> = 6.45, P = 8.12 × 10<sup>-8</sup>; HR: t<sub>43</sub> = 6.52, P = 6.41 × 10<sup>-8</sup>; RR: t<sub>43</sub> = -1.61, P = 0.11, paired t-test). These results suggest that while participants were experiencing capsaicin tonic pain, particularly during the early period, head motion and heart rate were increased, while breathing was slowed down. Note that we needed to exclude 4 participants’ data in this analysis due to technical issues with the physiological data acquisition.</p><p>Next, we examined whether the changes in head motion and physiological responses influenced our predictive model performance (Appendix 1—figure 12). We first regressed out the mean FD, HR, and RR (concatenated across conditions and participants as we trained the SVM model) from the predicted values of the SVM model with leave-one-subject-out cross-validation (2 conditions × 44 participants = 88) and then calculated the classification accuracy again (Appendix 1—figure 12A). The results showed that the SVM model showed a reduced, but still significant classification accuracy for the capsaicin versus control conditions in a forced-choice test (n = 44, accuracy = 89%, P = 1.41 × 10<sup>-7</sup>, binomial test, two-tailed). We also did the same analysis for the PCR model (10 time-bins × 44 participants = 440) and the PCR model also showed a significant prediction performance (n = 44, mean prediction-outcome correlation r = 0.20, P = 0.003, bootstrap test, two-tailed, mean squared error = 0.159 ± 0.022 [mean ± s.e.m.]) (Appendix 1—figure 12B). These results suggest that our SVM and PCR models capture unique variance in tonic pain above and beyond the head movement and physiological changes.</p><p>Lastly, we examined the specificity of our predictive models to pain, by testing the models on the non-painful but aversive conditions including the bitter taste (induced by quinine) and aversive odor (induced by fermented skate) conditions (Appendix 1-figure 13, please see Essential revisions 7). All the model responses were obtained using leave-one-participant-out cross-validation. The results showed that the overall model responses of the SVM model for the bitter taste and aversive odor conditions were higher than those for the control condition but lower than the capsaicin condition (Appendix 1-figure 13A). Classification accuracies for comparing capsaicin vs. bitter taste and capsaicin vs. aversive odor were all significant (for capsaicin vs. bitter taste, accuracy = 79%, P = 6.17 × 10<sup>-5</sup>, binomial test, two-tailed, Appendix 1-figure 13C; for capsaicin vs. aversive odor, accuracy = 83%, P = 3.31 × 10<sup>-6</sup>, binomial test, two-tailed, Appendix 1-figure 13E), supporting the specificity of our SVM model of pain. Similarly, the model responses of the PCR model for the bitter taste and aversive odor conditions were lower than the capsaicin condition, and their temporal trajectories were less steep and fluctuating compared to the capsaicin condition (Appendix 1-figure 13B). The time-course of the model responses for the control condition was flatter than all other conditions and did not show the inverted U-shape. Furthermore, the model responses of the bitter taste and aversive odor conditions did not show the significant correlations with the actual avoidance ratings (bitter taste: mean prediction-outcome correlation r = 0.05, P = 0.41, bootstrap test, two-tailed, mean squared error = 0.036 ± 0.006 [mean ± s.e.m.], Appendix 1-figure 13D; aversive odor: mean prediction-outcome correlation r = 0.12, P = 0.06, bootstrap test, two-tailed, mean squared error = 0.044 ± 0.004 [mean ± s.e.m.], Appendix 1-figure 13F), suggesting the specificity of PCR model to pain.</p><p>Overall, we have provided evidence that our models can predict pain ratings above and beyond the head motion and physiological changes and that the models are more responsive to pain compared to non-painful aversive conditions.</p><p>Now we added descriptions on the specificity tests to the main manuscript and also to the Appendix 1.</p><p>Revisions to the main manuscript (p. 20):</p><p>“Specificity of the module allegiance-based predictive models</p><p>To examine whether the predictive models were specific to pain and the prediction performances were not influenced by confounding variables such as head motion and physiological changes, we conducted additional analyses as shown in Appendix 1—figures 11-13.

An important issue is the (apparent) lack of statistical inference when analyzing the differences in the group-level consensus community structures (both when comparing capsaicin to control and when analysing changes over the time-course of the capsaicin-challenge). Although the observed changes seem biologically plausible and fit very well to previous results, without proper statistical inference we can't determine, how likely such differences are to emerge just by chance. This makes all results on Figures 2 and 3, and points 1, 4 and 5 in the discussion partially or fully speculative or weakly underpinned, comprising a large proportion of the current version of the manuscript. There are two main ways of handling this issue:</p><p>• Enhancing (or clarifying potential misunderstandings regarding) the methodology (see my concrete, and hopefully feasible, suggestions in the &quot;private part&quot; of the review). There are likely many ways to test the significance of these differences. Two permutation testing-based ideas are (i) permuting the labels ctr-capsaicin, or early-mid-late, repeating the analysis, constructing the proper null distribution of e.g. the community size changes and obtain the p-values and (ii) &quot;trace back&quot; communities to the individual level and do (nonparametric) statistical inference there.</p><p>• De-weighting the presentation and the discussion of the related results.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this important comment. We did not conduct statistical inference when comparing the group-level consensus community affiliations of the different conditions (Figure 2) or different phases (Figure 3) because of the difficulty in matching the community affiliation values of the networks to be compared.</p><p>For example, let us assume that the 800 out of 1,000 voxels of community #1 and 1,000 out of 4,000 voxels of community #2 in the control condition are commonly affiliated with the same community #3 in the capsaicin condition. To compare the community affiliation between two conditions, we should first match the community label of the capsaicin condition (i.e., #3) to that of the control condition (i.e., #1 or #2), and here a dilemma occurs; if we prioritize the proportion of the overlapping voxels for the matching, the common community should be labeled as #1, whereas if we prioritize the number of the overlapping voxels for the matching, the label of the common community should be #2. Although both choices look reasonable, none of them can be a perfect solution.</p><p>As the example above, it is impossible to exactly match the community affiliation of the different networks. We must choose an imperfect criterion for the matching procedure, which essentially affects the comparison of network structure. This was the main reason that we limited our results of Figures 2-3 to a qualitative description based on visual inspection. Moreover, the group-level consensus community structures in Figures 2-3 are not a simple group statistic like sample mean; they were obtained from multiple steps of analyses including permutation-based thresholding and unsupervised clustering, which could further complicate the interpretation of statistical tests.</p><p>Alternatively, there is a slightly different but more rigorous approach to the comparisons of the community structures, which is the Phi-test (Alexander-Bloch et al., 2012; Lerman-Sink<sub>off</sub> and Barch, 2016). Instead of direct use of the community labels, this method converts the community label of each voxel into a list of module allegiance values between the seed voxel and all the voxels of the brain (i.e., 1 if the seed and target voxels have the same community label and 0 otherwise). This allows quantitative comparisons of voxel-level community profiles between different conditions without an arbitrarily matching of the community labels. We adopted this Phi-test for our analyses to examine whether the regional community affiliation pattern is significantly different between (i) the capsaicin vs. control conditions and (ii) the early vs. late periods of pain (Appendix 1-figure 6), which correspond to the main findings of the Figures 2 and 3 in our manuscript, respectively.</p><p>More specifically, to compare the group-level consensus community structures between the capsaicin vs. control conditions and the early vs. late periods, we first obtained a seed-based module allegiance map for each voxel (i.e., using each voxel as a seed). Then, we calculated a correlation coefficient of the module allegiance values between two different conditions for each voxel. This correlation coefficient can serve as an estimate of the voxel-level similarity of the consensus community profile.</p><p>Because module allegiance is a binary variable, these correlation values are Phi coefficients. A small Phi coefficient means that the spatial pattern of brain regions that have the same community affiliation with the given voxel are different between the two conditions. For example, if a voxel is connected to the somatomotor-dominant community during the capsaicin condition and the default-mode-dominant community during the control condition, the brain regions that have the same community label with the voxel will be very different, and thus the Phi coefficient will become small. Moreover, the Phi coefficient can be small even if a voxel is affiliated as the same (matched) community label for both conditions, when the spatial patterns of the same community is different between conditions.</p><p>To calculate the statistical significance of the Phi coefficient, we conducted permutation tests, in which we randomly shuffled the condition labels in each participant and obtained the group-level consensus community structure for each shuffled condition. Then, we calculated the voxel-level correlations of the module allegiance values between the two shuffled conditions. We repeated this procedure 1,000 times to generate the null distribution of the Phi coefficients, and calculated the proportion of null samples that have a smaller Phi coefficient (i.e., a more dis-similar regional community structure) than the non-shuffled original data.</p><p>Results showed that there are multiple voxels with statistical significance (permutation tests with 1,000 iterations, one-tailed) in the area where the community affiliations of the two contrasting conditions were different (Appendix 1—figure 6). For example, the frontoparietal and subcortical regions for the capsaicin vs. control (c.f., Figure 2), and the frontoparietal, subcortical, brainstem, and cerebellar regions for the early vs. late period of pain (c.f., Figure 3) contain voxels that survived after thresholding with FDR-corrected <italic>q</italic> &lt; 0.05, suggesting the robustness of our main results.</p><p>Particularly, the somatomotor and insular cortices showed statistical significance in the permutation test, and this may reflect the large changes in other areas that are connecting to the somatomotor and insular cortices across different conditions. The statistical significance was also observed in the visual cortex, which was unexpected. We interpret that the spatial distribution of the visual network community is too stable across conditions, and thus the null distribution from permutation formed a very narrow distribution of Phi coefficients. Therefore, a small change in the community structure could achieve statistical significance.</p><p>Now we added descriptions on the permutation tests.</p><p>Revisions to the main manuscript:</p><p>p. 9:</p><p>“Permutation tests confirmed that the community assignment in the frontoparietal and subcortical regions showed significant changes between the capsaicin versus control conditions (Appendix 1—figure 6A).”</p><p>pp. 13-14:</p><p>“Permutation tests further confirmed that the community assignment in the frontoparietal, subcortical, brainstem, and cerebellar regions showed significant changes between the early versus late period of pain (Appendix 1—figure 6B).”</p><p>pp. 36-37:</p><p>“Permutation tests for regional differences in community structures. To test the statistical significance of the voxel-level difference of consensus community structures (Figures 2 and 3), we performed the following Phi-test (Alexander-Bloch et al., 2012; Lerman-Sink<sub>off</sub> and Barch, 2016). First, for each given voxel, we compared the community label of the voxel to the community label of all the voxels, generating a list of voxel-seed module allegiance values that allow quantitative comparison of voxel-level community profile (e.g., [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, …], whose element is equal to 1 if the seed and target voxels were assigned to the same community and 0 otherwise). Next, a correlation coefficient was calculated between the module allegiance values of the two different brain community structures (i.e., capsaicin versus control, and early versus late). This correlation coefficient is an estimate of the regional similarity of community profiles (here, the correlation coefficient is Phi coefficient because module allegiance is a binary variable). To estimate the statistical significance of the Phi coefficient, we performed permutation tests, in which we randomly shuffled the labels and then obtained the group-level consensus community structures from the shuffled data. Then, the Phi coefficient between the module allegiance values of the two shuffled consensus community structures was calculated. We repeated this procedure 1,000 times to generate the null distribution of the Phi coefficient for each voxel. Lastly, we examined the probability to observe a smaller Phi coefficient (i.e., a more dissimilar community profile) than the one from the non-shuffled original data, which corresponds to the P-value of the permutation test. All the P-values were one-tailed as the hypothesis of this permutation test is unidirectional.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>• The authors emphasize the term &quot;pain supersystem&quot;.

We are also happy to revise the current manuscript if more discussion is needed in the other sections including the Introduction.</p><p>Revisions to the main manuscript (p. 26):</p><p>“An interesting future direction would be to examine whether the current results can be generalized to clinical pain. Experimental tonic pain has been known to share similar characteristics with clinical pain (Rainville et al., 1992; Stohler and Kowalski, 1999). In addition, in a recent study, we showed that an fMRI connectivity-based signature for capsaicin-induced orofacial tonic pain can be generalized to chronic back pain (Lee et al., 2021). Therefore, a detailed characterization of the brain responses to sustained pain has the potential to provide useful information about clinical pain. However, there are also differences between the characteristics of capsaicin-induced tonic pain versus clinical pain. For example, clinical pain continuously fluctuates over time in an idiosyncratic pattern (Apkarian et al., 2001), whereas capsaicin-induced tonic pain showed a similar time-course pattern across the participants—i.e., increasing rapidly and then decreasing gradually (Figure 1B). This typical time-course of pain ratings has been reported in previous studies that used oral capsaicin (Berry and Simons, 2020; Lu et al., 2013; Ngom et al., 2001). Although we would expect our results reflect the general pattern of brain network changes during the rise and fall of sustained pain, it remains an empirical question how much they will be generalizable across different clinical pain conditions. Interestingly, a recent fMRI study on the temporal summation of pain in fibromyalgia patients reported results similar to ours (Cheng et al., 2022), including the intra-network dissociation within the somatomotor network and the inter-network integration between the somatomotor and other networks during pain. Although we cannot directly examine whether the temporal summation of pain gave rise to these network-level changes due to the limitation of our experimental paradigm, these consistent findings between the two studies may suggest that our findings could be generalized to clinical conditions.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– More information is needed about the individual variability of the pain-related behavioral time-courses (maybe in the supplementary info).

(this might be positive thing: a sign of generalization across behavioral assessment protocols).</p></disp-quote><p>We think this comment is partially addressed in Essential revisions 7 and Essential revisions 9. We think that the pain avoidance measure would have a high level of convergent validity with pain intensity, considering that the overall time-course of pain avoidance ratings in Study 1 was similar to the time-course of the pain intensity ratings in Study 2, and the predictive models derived with pain avoidance rating (Study 1) could be used to predict the pain intensity rating (Study 2). However, pain avoidance and pain intensity are not identical of course, and there can be some conditions in which the two measures are dissociated. Our research group will examine the relationship between pain intensity and avoidance in future studies.</p><p>We now added descriptions on the difference between pain avoidance and intensity ratings.</p><p>Revisions to the main manuscript (p. 27):</p><p>“Although the psychometric properties of the pain avoidance measure should be a topic of future investigation, we expect that the pain avoidance measure would have a high level of convergent validity with pain intensity given the observed similarity between pain avoidance (Study 1) and pain intensity (Study 2) in their temporal profiles. The generalizability of our PCR model across Studies 1 and 2 also supports this speculation. However, there would also be situations in which pain avoidance is dissociated from pain intensity. For example, capsaicin can be experienced to be intense but less aversive or even appetitive in some contexts, such as cravings for spicy food (Stevenson and Yeomans, 1993). In addition, the gradual rise of avoidance ratings during the late period of the control condition in Study 1 would not be observed if the intensity measure was used. Future studies need to examine the relationship between pain avoidance and the other pain assessments and the advantage of using the pain avoidance measure.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Please clarify why *pain* avoidance (slightly) increased in the control resting state scan.</p></disp-quote><p>We think this comment is partially addressed in Essential revisions 9. We could measure the avoidance rating in the control condition because the question does not contain the term “pain” (please see Essential revisions 8 for details of our rationale behind the rating scale) and thus can provide a generalizable rating scale shared across different conditions. The increase of avoidance rating in the control condition is expected because lying down in a scanner for a long time can cause participants to feel bored and tired, or even induce painful sensations (e.g., back pain). However, we think this effect did not significantly affect the current results including the predictive models, considering that the model responses of the PCR model for the control condition (Appendix 1-figure 13, please see Essential revisions 7) did not show a similar time-course as the avoidance rating of the control condition. Although we understand the concern that our rating was too generic to be called ‘pain avoidance,’ we called it ‘pain avoidance’ because the effect of pain on the changes in avoidance ratings was evident in our analyses (e.g., capsaicin vs. control, early vs. middle vs. late, etc.), and thus the use of ‘pain avoidance’ is not a misnomer or overstatement. However, we will be happy to reconsider it and change the term into an alternative name, such as the ‘avoidance rating,’ if the reviewer thinks it is better.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Please provide more rationale for the choice of ML algorithms.</p></disp-quote><p>The SVM and PCR are widely accepted algorithms for finding the low-dimensional latent components of highly correlated data such as brain networks. Although the other types of algorithms are available for the current study, we think it may hamper the simplicity and interpretability of the predictive modeling if we try many different options of algorithms.

However, to our knowledge, there is no conventional choice of hyperparameter for the PCR algorithm. Sometimes the principal components that explained 90%, 95%, or 99% of the variance were used, but the level of threshold also varies by researchers. Therefore, we had no choice but to conduct an exhaustive search for the number of principal components despite the possibility of overfitting and then tested the chosen PCR model onto the independent dataset to prove its generalizability.</p><p>We now added the descriptions for the choice of hyperparameter of the SVM model.</p><p>Revisions to the main manuscript (p. 37):</p><p>“A regularization hyperparameter C was set to 1, which is a conventional choice for SVM.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Why was only one hub selected for the seed-based analysis in the case of the classifier?</p></disp-quote><p>It was coincidental that the left ventral primary somatomotor region (tongue area) was selected as the common hub region for both positive and negative weights.
