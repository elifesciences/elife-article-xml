information regarding its mechanism of action is available. In this study we provide a detailed characterization of the effects of TMYX on the electrical activity of pacemaker cells and unravel its mechanism of action. Single-cell electrophysiology revealed that TMYX elicits a reversible and dose-dependent (2/6 mg/ml) slowing of spontaneous action potentials rate (−20.8/–50.2%) by a selective reduction of the diastolic phase (−50.1/–76.0%). This action is mediated by a negative shift of the I<sub>f</sub> activation curve (−6.7/–11.9 mV) and is caused by a reduction of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-induced stimulation of pacemaker channels. We provide evidence that TMYX acts by directly antagonizing the cAMP-induced allosteric modulation of the pacemaker channels. Noticeably, this mechanism functionally resembles the pharmacological actions of muscarinic stimulation or β-blockers, but it does not require generalized changes in cytoplasmic cAMP levels thus ensuring a selective action on rate. In agreement with a competitive inhibition mechanism, TMYX exerts its maximal antagonistic action at submaximal cAMP concentrations and then progressively becomes less effective thus ensuring a full contribution of I<sub>f</sub> to pacemaker rate during high metabolic demand and sympathetic stimulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pacemaker current</kwd><kwd>sinoatrial node</kwd><kwd>TMYX</kwd><kwd>pure bradycardic agents</kwd><kwd>cAMP antagonism</kwd><kwd>HCN channels</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Le Ren Tang</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CTE_INT18DDIFR_01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DiFrancesco</surname><given-names>Dario</given-names></name><name><surname>Bucchi</surname><given-names>Annalisa</given-names></name><name><surname>Baruscotti</surname><given-names>Mirko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A Traditional Chinese Medicine botanical drug exerts a competitive antagonism on the cAMP-induced modulation of sinoatrial node pacemaker channels and this functional inhibition reduces the slope of the diastolic depolarization hence spontaneous cell automaticity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), one of the oldest organized healing systems in human history, is based on a holistic view of both the disease state and the associated therapy. For this reason, the perfect synthesis of TCM pharmacology is based on complex drugs composed of a mixture of different elements/herbs whose aim is to target the causes of the disease, modulate other aspects of the body wellness, and contrast toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2006</xref>). Western medicine follows a different perspective since it focuses on the molecular mechanisms and defines this level as its therapeutic target. Despite these differences, both approaches have reached reliable standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tang and Huang, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tu, 2016</xref>). These different views are now converging thanks to modern pharmacological and molecular studies whose approach is to experimentally challenge the efficacy of TCM drugs and to isolate active molecules that could represent novel acquisitions to the western pharmacopeia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burashnikov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Efferth et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tang and Huang, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Based on these premises, we focused our study on Tongmai Yangxin (TMYX), a TCM botanical drug composed by at least 80 single molecular components among which flavonoids, coumarins, iridoid glycosides, saponins, and lignans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tao et al., 2015</xref>). In China, TMYX is used (4–8 g qd, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fan et al., 2021</xref>) to treat several diseases including cardiovascular conditions (such as CAD, palpitation, heart failure, and angina). Interestingly, metabolomics analysis carried out in a registered clinical trial on stable angina patients has highlighted a reduction of serum markers of cardiac metabolic disorders, oxidative stress, and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guo et al., 2020</xref>). In addition to this cardio-protective role, TMYX is also used as an antiarrhythmic agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">National Pharmacopeia Committee, 2015</xref>), but the mechanisms underlying this action are unknown. We therefore carried out <italic>in-vitro</italic> investigations in rabbit sinoatrial node (SAN) cells to verify the hypothesis that TMYX is also able to modulate their spontaneous activity. Our data confirm that TMYX reduces the rate of SAN cells by selectively reducing the slope of the diastolic depolarization. This action is similar to that of ivabradine which is a selective blocker of the pacemaker current (I<sub>f</sub>) and, at present, the only pure heart rate-lowering agent approved for clinical use in several western countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koruth et al., 2017</xref>). We have further discovered that TMYX modulates the whole-cell I<sub>f</sub> current by inducing a cholinergic-like shift of the voltage dependence of channels activation, and the underlying mechanism is a competitive antagonism of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-induced channel activation. Since the I<sub>f</sub> current is a major contributor of the early part of the diastolic depolarization phase of pacemaker cells, its selective block is associated with bradycardia without negative inotropic effects (typical, for example, of β-blocker agents). Despite TMYX and ivabradine inhibit the I<sub>f</sub> current with different molecular mechanisms, both these mechanisms functionally converge to a selective modulation of the early part of the diastolic depolarization of SAN cells and this raises a potential pharmacological interest in the active principle of this TCM drug.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We first investigated whether TMYX could modify the spontaneous electrical activity of rabbit SAN myocytes. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> representative time-courses of action potential (AP) rate (top) and sample AP traces (bottom), recorded in the absence (control) and in the presence of two different concentrations (2 and 6 mg/ml) of TMYX, are shown. TMYX caused a reversible and dose-dependent rate slowing (2 mg/ml: –20.8 ± 1.6%, n = 12 and 6 mg/ml: –50.2 ± 6.5%, n = 8 from mean control values of 3.6 ± 0.1 and 3.9 ± 0.3 Hz, respectively). The analysis was then extended over a wider range of concentrations and the Hill fitting of the experimental dose-response data points distribution yielded a half-inhibitory value (k) of 4.9 mg/ml, a maximal block value (y<sub>max</sub>) of 92.7%, and a Hill coefficient (h) of 1.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). At the highest concentration tested (60 mg/ml), the average rate reduction was 86.7 ± 6.3% (n = 6); in three of these cells the activity was completely abolished. In all experiments, the effect of TMYX on rate was fully reversible after washout.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Tongmai Yangxin (TMYX) reduces the spontaneous rate of rabbit sinoatrial node (SAN) myocytes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative time-courses (top) and sample traces (bottom) of spontaneous action potentials (APs) recorded from rabbit SAN cells in control conditions and in the presence of TMYX (2 and 6 mg/ml).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, the spontaneous rate was significantly reduced at all doses investigated, and this effect was for the largest part caused by a significant decrease of the EDD (rate: –6.3 ± 1.2%, –8.2 ± 0.9%, –20.8 ± 1.6%, –50.2 ± 6.5%; EDD:–9.7 ± 1.5%, –12.8 ± 4.4%, –50.1 ± 3.7%, –76.0 ± 5.7%). A small increase of the APD was observed at doses ≥ 0.6 mg/ml (6.2 ± 0.8%, 8.7 ± 1.1%, 17.1 ± 3.7%); TOP and MDP were not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> provides evidence that TMYX lowers AP rate mainly by affecting the pacemaker mechanisms governing the EDD process. Since the I<sub>f</sub> current is relevant to the generation of this phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bucchi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">DiFrancesco, 1993</xref>), we wondered whether this current could be a target of TMYX. We initially explored the effects of TMYX both on the voltage dependence and on the maximal conductance of I<sub>f</sub>. To this aim we used a double-pulse protocol which allows to observe the effect of a drug on the current both near the half-activation voltage (–65 mV) and at full activation (–125 mV, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Perfusion of SAN cells with TMYX 6 mg/ml modified the current at both voltages, but in opposite directions: in the sample recordings shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, at –65 mV the current was reduced by 40.5%, while at –125 mV was increased by 12.9%. This apparently paradoxical behavior was observed in all cells investigated (n = 6 cells) and a possible explanation requires the combination of two contrasting effects: a negative shift of the activation curve and an increase of the maximal conductance. To evaluate this possibility, we carried out a quantitative characterization of these effects. The activation curves of the I<sub>f</sub> current were measured in n = 7 cells before and during TMYX (6 mg/ml) and mean ± SEM values are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. Boltzmann fitting of experimental data confirmed a significant hyperpolarizing shift of the activation curve (11.9 mV, p &lt; 0.01). If considered alone this effect would tend to decrease the contribution of the current to pacemaker depolarization, hence to rate slowing.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Dual action of Tongmai Yangxin (TMYX) on the voltage dependence and maximal conductance of the I<sub>f</sub> current.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative whole-cell currents elicited by a double-step protocol (–65 mV/1.5 s and –125 mV/0.5 s; holding potential –35 mV) before (control) and during drug (TMYX 6 mg/ml) perfusion.

In the pacemaker range of potentials TMYX has the net effect of reducing the contribution of the I<sub>f</sub> current to the diastolic depolarization.

In this case, the cAMP content of SAN cells was experimentally raised by: (i) inhibiting its degradation using a phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor (IBMX, 100 µM) and (ii) favoring its overproduction using an activator of the adenylyl cyclase (Forskolin, 100 µM). The ability of TMYX (6 mg/ml) to reduce the I<sub>f</sub> current was then quantified in the presence of different combinations of these substances and of cAMP (10 µM). The bar-graphs shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref> confirm the presence of an inverse dependence between cAMP levels and TMYX efficacy. However, these experiments do not provide details on the underlying mechanism.</p><p>We therefore proceeded by taking advantage of the inside-out macropatch configuration since this experimental approach allows testing whether TMYX has a membrane-delimited effect (by directly acting on f-channels) or requires instead the involvement of cytoplasmic elements controlling cAMP production and degradation. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>, the I<sub>f</sub> current was elicited by a train of hyperpolarizing steps to –105 mV to test the effect of TMYX (6 mg/ml) delivered in the absence of cAMP; no modulation of the current was ever observed (n = 4 patches, p = 0.125, Student’s paired t-test). An analysis extended to a wider range of voltages is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B, C</xref> where a slowly activating voltage ramp (−35/–145 mV) was employed to measure the steady-state I/V curves (panel B) and the associated conductance/voltage (g/V) curve (panel C), in the absence (control) and in the presence of TMYX (6 mg/ml). Statistical analysis revealed that neither half-activation (V<sub>½</sub>) nor maximal conductance (g<sub>max</sub>) parameters were affected by the presence of TMYX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This evidence demonstrates that TMYX does not influence the intrinsic properties of f-channels and raises the possibility that its inhibitory effect can only occur in the presence of a concurrent cAMP-dependent modulation of the channels.</p><p>To verify this possibility, we first evaluated the shift of the I<sub>f</sub> voltage dependence induced by cAMP using the ΔV method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Accili and DiFrancesco, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DiFrancesco et al., 1989</xref>) and then the ability of TMYX to reverse this shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Inside-out I<sub>f</sub> currents were elicited by a train of hyperpolarizing steps (–105 mV) while membrane patches were exposed to different cAMP concentrations (1, 10, 100 µM) delivered alone and in the presence of TMYX (6 mg/ml). Representative time-courses, current traces, and the corresponding analysis are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. Exposure to cAMP elicited a dose-dependent increase of the current, which was quantified as the voltage correction necessary to restore steady-state control current levels (ΔV<sub>cAMP/Cont</sub>: 6.1 ± 0.5, 12.8 ± 0.5, and 13.6 ± 0.9 mV for 1, 10, 100 µM cAMP, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, empty triangles). Addition of TMYX (cAMP+ TMYX) resulted in a reversible reduction of cAMP action quantified as the ΔV correction required to compensate for the effect of TMYX (ΔV<sub>TMYX/cAMP</sub>: 3.5 ± 0.4, 4.7 ± 0.6, and 0 mV for 1, 10, 100 µM cAMP, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, empty squares).

To better illustrate the antagonism exerted by TMYX (6 mg/ml) on cAMP, we calculated the TMYX-induced fractional inhibition by normalizing the TMYX-induced inhibition of cAMP action (ΔV<sub>TMYX/cAMP</sub>) to the corresponding full cAMP modulation (ΔV<sub>cAMP/Cont</sub>).

Interestingly, cardiovascular TCM drugs often target ion channels; for example, the antiarrhythmic agent Wenxin Keli binds to atrial Na<sup>+</sup> channels according to a mechanism of potential relevance in the treatment of atrial fibrillation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hu et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In this study we have characterized the effects of TMYX on the properties of pacemaker cells since this drug is used in TCM to treat cardiovascular diseases including cardiac arrhythmias, coronary artery disease (CAD), and angina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fan et al., 2016</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>At low doses TMYX mainly controls the EDD and the I<sub>f</sub> current</title><p>Our study indicates a reversible and dose-dependent depression of SAN cell rate due to a robust reduction of the slope of the EDD and by a limited prolongation of the APD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). These actions are similar to those elicited by the selective I<sub>f</sub> blocker ivabradine, which is the only pure heart rate-reducing drug used in western medicine for the treatment of angina and heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Borer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bucchi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tardif et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thollon et al., 1997</xref>). When tested in SAN cells, TMYX (2 mg/ml, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and ivabradine (3 µM, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bucchi et al., 2007</xref>) slow cell rate by 20.8% and 16.2% and prolong the APD by 8.6% and 9.4%, respectively. Similar effects of ivabradine (3 µM) have also been reported in SAN tissue preparation (rate: −19.6/–23.8%, APD50: + 6.7/ + 8.9%, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thollon et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Thollon et al., 1994</xref>). Since the APD prolongation represents a pro-arrhythmic effect, the evidence that, at least in single SAN cells, ivabradine and TMYX act similarly on this parameter, suggests a dose-dependent safety of the drug in relation to AP prolongation-dependent arrhythmias. This observation correlates with the use of this drug in TCM clinic.</p><p>TMYX exerts a dual action on I<sub>f</sub>: a negative shift of the voltage dependence and an increase of the maximal conductance, and the former action prevails at physiological voltages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Interestingly, a negative shift of the activation curve is also the main mechanism during a moderate muscarinic stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DiFrancesco et al., 1989</xref>) however, this mechanism is not shared with ivabradine. In SAN cells, a moderate cholinergic activation causes a reduction of cell cAMP content, and this associates with a decreased cAMP-dependent modulation of sinoatrial HCN/funny channels; the opposite sequence of events occurs during adrenergic modulation of pacemaker rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">DiFrancesco, 1993</xref>). For this reason, the shift of the I<sub>f</sub> voltage dependence can be considered a readout parameter of the functional interaction between cAMP and HCN/funny channels. cAMP synthesis is operated by the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-insensitive adenylyl cyclase (AC1/8 and AC5/6, respectively), while cAMP conversion to AMP is catalyzed by the action of the PDE. AC and PDE are therefore central elements of a regulatory pathway that controls cell cAMP dynamics at rest and during autonomic stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mika and Fischmeister, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Robinson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sirenko et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yaniv et al., 2015</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">St Clair et al., 2017</xref>, PDE4 is particularly relevant in basal conditions, while PDE3 activity is important during β-adrenergic stimulation. A further level of physiological refinement is provided by the evidence that pacemaker channels are localized in caveolar structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barbuti et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barbuti et al., 2012</xref>), and this compartmentalization ensures the existence of functional microdomains where cAMP oscillations may differ from those occurring in the bulk of the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mika and Fischmeister, 2021</xref>). Taken together these regulatory pathways control cAMP levels, hence SAN rate, in pacemaker cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>TMYX exerts a direct competitive antagonism on the cAMP-induced activation of the I<sub>f</sub> current</title><p>Whole-cell experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> reveal that the shift induced by TMYX (6 mg/ml) is –11.9 mV, a value similar to the maximal shift induced by ACh (1 µM, 12.6 mV, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Accili et al., 1997</xref>). This comparison thus suggests that the voltage-dependent modulation of I<sub>f</sub> induced by 6 mg/ml TMYX should approximate saturation. However, despite a similar effect on the current, 1 µM ACh blocks the spontaneous activity of SAN cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DiFrancesco et al., 1989</xref>), while 6 mg/ml TMYX reduces rate only by ~50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Since TMYX does not act on the muscarinic receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), this difference likely arises from the robust cholinergic activation of IK(ACh). While TMYX does not activate the muscarinic receptor, it is conceivable that it may interfere with the cAMP-dependent modulation of the I<sub>f</sub> current somewhere along the pathway downstream the receptor. This conclusion is further supported by the evidence that TMYX efficacy is independent from the stimulation of the adenosine receptor and basal PKA activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), whose effect on the I<sub>f</sub> current is also mediated by a reduction of the cellular cAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zaza et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>The observation that the inhibitory action of TMYX on the whole-cell I<sub>f</sub> is counteracted by increasing concentrations of intracellular cAMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) suggested a functional competitive antagonism. This hypothesis was further corroborated by the inside-out experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), which revealed that TMYX does not act in the absence of cAMP. Several studies have shown that cAMP binding to the C-terminus of HCN channels initiates domino-like structural rearrangements leading to the removal of the auto-inhibitory condition which is a hallmark of the cAMP-unbound HCN channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wainger et al., 2001</xref>). The functional aspect of these events is an allosteric-driven shift of the open-close equilibrium toward the open state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akimoto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">DiFrancesco, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wainger et al., 2001</xref>). Our data indicate that TMYX exerts its competitive antagonism either by reducing the channel affinity for cAMP or by interrupting the structural relaxation. The competitive antagonism is clearly illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, left where the comparison of the ΔV<sub>cAMP/Cont</sub> and ΔV<sub>(cAMP+TMYX)/Cont</sub> dose-response curves displays the hallmarks of allosteric inhibition according to the concerted-symmetry model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Segel, 1975</xref>): a similar saturating effect (y<sub>max</sub>), a decrease in the half-maximal shifts (k), and a lower Hill coefficient (h). Furthermore, a dissociation constant (k<sub>i</sub>) value of 1.56 mg/ml was obtained for TMYX by applying the Schild equation (k<sub>(cAMP+TMYX)/Cont</sub>/k<sub>cAMP/Cont</sub>=1+[TMYX]/k<sub>i</sub>: where k<sub>(cAMP+TMYX)/Cont</sub> and k<sub>cAMP/Cont</sub> are half-maximal cAMP-induced shifts in the presence/absence of 6 mg/ml TMYX). This dose is compatible both with the half-inhibitory value observed for the TMYX action on rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and with the nearly maximal effect on I<sub>f</sub> reported for the dose of 6 mg/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and previous comments).</p><p>Interestingly, the neuronal accessory protein TRIP8b modulates the cAMP dependence of HCN channels with a mechanism similar to that of TMYX. For this reason, TRIP8b has raised interest since it may represent a therapeutic target for major depressive disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lyman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Saponaro et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>An important parallelism exists between the actions of β-blockers and TMYX since both reduce the cAMP-induced activation of f-channels: TMYX antagonizes the action of cAMP directly at the channel level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), while β-blockers inhibit the β-receptor-cascade and the associated cAMP synthesis.</p><p>Despite these different mechanisms, the common functional outcome is the modulation of the I<sub>f</sub> activation curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). According to the mechanism of action identified in our study, the putative active molecule of TMYX directly regulates the pacemaker f-channel but does not modulate the overall cAMP content of the cell and, for this reason, it is expected to have a selective action on chronotropic control of rate without affecting the inotropism. Multiple effects are instead associated with β-block since a reduction of cell cAMP necessarily affects other processes such as the PKA modulation of other ion channels. For this reason, the identification of novel pure bradycardic agents is an important pharmacological aim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nikolovska Vukadinović et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Although robust experimental data on the effects of the therapeutic use of TMYX are not yet available, the mechanism of action is compatible with its use in the treatment of CAD and irregular heartbeat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fan et al., 2016</xref>). In the inside-out configuration, the maximal antagonistic effect (63.7%) of TMYX at the dose of 6 mg/ml is observed at a cAMP concentration of 0.8 µM and progressively decreases at higher doses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, right). This behavior reveals an additional well-suited physiological and pharmacological feature since it allows recruiting full I<sub>f</sub> current and rate modulation when tachycardic stimuli (cAMP levels) are boosted to the maximum. The rationale behind the clinical use of TMYX in TCM is further supported by the evidence that a synthetic derivative of TRIP8b can prevent the β-adrenergic control of SAN cell rate and of I<sub>f</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Saponaro et al., 2018</xref>) and this effect represents proof of principle for further studies and development in applied pharmacology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Proenza, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Finally, it should be mentioned that TMYX is also used to treat premature ventricular complexes (PVCs; personal communication to MB) and, in some cases, PVCs are associated with adrenergic stimuli, high cAMP cell content, and expression of f-channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cantillon, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oshita et al., 2015</xref>). The evidence that ivabradine may prevent this ectopic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kuwabara et al., 2013</xref>) further supports a causative association and allows to speculate that TMYX could in principle have a therapeutic role.</p><p>In conclusion, TMYX slows the spontaneous rate of SAN cells and the underlying mechanism is a selective depression of the diastolic depolarization operated through an antagonistic action on cAMP-induced pacemaker channel activation. Comparison with other pharmacological chronotropic modulators (ivabradine and β-blockers) reveals that TMYX may have an interesting and safe profile. In addition, as pointed out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akimoto et al., 2018</xref>, targeting the cAMP binding domain may represent an interesting future perspective for selective modulation of HCN channels since it will reduce the possibility of unspecific interference with other channels. Although TMYX is composed by several components, its mechanism is compatible with the action of a single molecule; we therefore believe that future investigations should focus on this search in addition to provide exhaustive clinical data on TCM patients.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Oryctolagus cuniculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">New Zealand rabbit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Charles River</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Female, 35–41 days</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Acetylcholine chloride (ACh)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich (Merck)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">A6625</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate sodium salt monohydrate (cAMP)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich (Merck)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">A6885</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Forskolin</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich (Merck)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">F6886</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1,3-Dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine (DPCPX)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich (Merck)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C101</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">3-Isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich (Merck)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">I5879</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">H-89 dihydrochloride hydrate (H-89)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich (Merck)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">B1427</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pClamp – Clampfit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Molecular Devices</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_011323">SCR_011323</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pClamp – Clampex</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Molecular Devices</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_011323">SCR_011323</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Version 10.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Origin</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Origin Lab</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_014212">SCR_014212</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">OriginPro 2020</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Prism</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GraphPad Software</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_002798">SCR_002798</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Version 5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Tongmai Yangxin</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Le Ren Tang Pharmaceutical Factory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal procedures and cell isolation</title><p>All animal procedures performed in this study were carried out in accordance with the guidelines of the care and use of laboratory animals established by the Italian and UE laws (D.

AP traces were then processed with customized software to calculate the following parameters: rate (Hz), MDP (the most negative potential for each AP), TOP (the voltage at which the voltage derivative overtakes a fixed threshold of 0.5 mV/ms), EDD (defined as the mean slope in the first half of the diastolic depolarization), APD (the time interval between TOP and the following MDP); additional details can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bucchi et al., 2007</xref>.</p><p>Experimental dose-response points presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5B</xref> were fitted to the Hill equation (y = y<sub>max</sub>/(1+(k/x)<sup>h</sup>)), where y<sub>max</sub> is the maximal effect, x is the drug concentration, k is the drug concentration eliciting half-maximal block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) or half maximal shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), and h is the Hill factor.</p><p>The activation curves of the whole-cell I<sub>f</sub> current were obtained by applying a train of two consecutive voltage steps: the ﬁrst pulse was delivered at test potentials (from –20 to –125 mV, increment between steps: –15 mV) to attain steady-state current activation, while the second step was delivered at –125 mV to ensure maximal activation. Normalized tail currents amplitudes at –125 mV represent the activation variable at each test potential. Mean ± SEM fractional activation values, measured in control condition and in the presence of different concentrations of TMYX, were interpolated by the Boltzmann distribution (y = 1/(1+ exp((V−V<sub>½</sub>)/s))), where y is the fractional activation, V is voltage, V<sub>½</sub> is the half-activation voltage, and s is the inverse-slope factor.</p><p>The fully activated I/V relations in whole-cell condition were obtained by applying a voltage protocol consisting of two sequential pulses: the cell was first hyperpolarized to –125 mV and then depolarized to different test potentials in the range –120/+20 mV (increment: 20 mV). After leakage correction the tail currents were normalized and plotted as a function of tail step voltages. Mean ± SEM experimental values were interpolated by a linear fit (I<sub>density</sub>=(a*V + b)) to yield the fully activated (I/V) curves.</p><p>The steady-state I/V curves shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref> were obtained by multiplying the Boltzmann fitting of fractional activation and the linear fitting of the fully activated I/V curve.</p><p>During macropatch inside-out experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> the I<sub>f</sub> current amplitude was elicited by hyperpolarizing steps to –105 mV from a holding potential of –35 mV. Steady-state I-V relations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>) were recorded by means of hyperpolarizing ramps from –35 to –145 mV at a rate of –110 mV/min. Inside-out activation curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>) were derived from the steady-state I-V currents (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bois et al., 1997</xref> for details) and fitted to the Boltzmann equation.</p><p>In some analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>) the effect of TMYX on the I<sub>f</sub> current was assessed by means of the ΔV method. This method quantifies the manual voltage adjustment (ΔV) of the holding potential which is introduced during drug delivery to compensate for the drug-induced current reduction and restore a steady-state current amplitude as the one observed prior to drug delivery (that is in control condition). The ΔV parameter measured in this condition was originally used by several authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Accili and DiFrancesco, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Altomare et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bois et al., 1997</xref>) to evaluate the shift of the activation curve induced by modulatory agents. In whole-cell experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, however, this parameter (see text) is an underestimation of the shift of the activation curve since the ΔV adjustment must also compensate for the TMYX-induced increase of channel conductance. This limitation does not apply to data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> since in the inside-out configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>) we could not measure any increase of the channel conductance.</p><p>Whole-cell and inside-out experiments were carried out at 35°C ± 0.5°C and at room temperature, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size, but our samples sizes are similar to those reported in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Altomare et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bucchi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Milanesi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Thollon et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Van Bogaert and Pittoors, 2003</xref>).</p><p>All data are presented as mean ± SEM values.

however, no information regarding its mechanism of action is available. This study provides mechanistic insight into where TMYX acts to inhibit the pacemaking current called If. In some respects TMYX behaves like a β blocker or muscarinic antagonist, but it works to inhibit the ion channel to maximum effect when cAMP concentrations are low, thus allowing the full effect of sympathetic stimulation to still occur on I<sub>f</sub> when metabolic rate is high.

This paper applies rigorous experimental procedures to reveal the cellular processes by which the 5 herbal mixed medication known as TMYX exerts its potentially beneficial slowing of the heart.

Several studies have demonstrated that TMYX exerts anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor effects and also reduces oxidative stress (Cai et al., 2018, doi: 10.1016/j.jchromb.2018.09.038; Tao et al., 2015; doi: 10.1002/jssc.201401481; Fan et al., 2021, doi: 10.1016/j.jep.2021.114106). Obviously, a match between single active molecules and the corresponding effect represents the aim of the modern approach to TCM, and novel information is starting to emerge. For example, Tao et al., (2015, DOI: 10.1002/jssc.201401481 J) report that six active compounds (gomisin D, schisandrin, glycyrrhizic acid, 2,3,5,4’-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-β-D-glucoside, formononetin, and ononin) exert dose-dependent anti-inflammatory activities.</p><p>Clinical metabolomic analysis have also reported that TMYX exerts therapeutic effects on stable angina and more in general on arrhythmias (Cai et al., 2018, doi: 10.1016/j.jchromb.2018.09.038). In the effort to identify the molecular biological basis of the observed cardiac improvements these authors carried out a clinical trial that led to the conclusion that “TMYX exerts its effects by improving myocardial energy supply disorder and aminoacid dysfunction and attenuating oxidative stress and inflammation” (their figure 3). TMYX also exerts a protective effect on cisplatin-induced cardiotoxicity by regulating the Nrf2 and p38-MAPK pathways (Cui et al., 2018, doi: 10.1016/j.biopha.2018.09.095).</p><p>We believe that our finding adds one important piece of information to this complexity since we conclude that a molecular component of TMYX (or one of its biological metabolites) is able to uncouple the pacemaker f/HCN channels from their cAMP-induced modulation, and this action has the feature of competitive antagonism. As also requested in Point 2 of the “Essential Revisions”, we have now expandend the Material and Methods section to include additional details of each component of TMYX. Page 18, lines 408-416 (in grey).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some discussion about PDEs and their interaction with cAMP is warranted to improve the scholarship of the manuscript. In addition, reference ought to be made microdomain cAMP signalling.</p><p>Probing PDE signalling would certainly enhance the manuscript given the main result. I am left wondering whether the action of TMYX is via PDE2 hydrolysis of cAMP to decrease If.</p><p>Acknowledgement of its action on decreasing cGMP also worth discussing.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now extended the discussion on cAMP formation and degradation and in particularly we mention the fundamental role of the Adenylil Cyclases (both the Ca-sensitive and insensitive isoforms) and of the Phosphodiesterases in cAMP production and degradation; consequently, ACs and PDEs indirectly modulate several ion channels. As suggested by the reviewer, it would be important to verify whether TMYX exerts any effect on PDE and on AC, however, we believe that this approach should be thoroughly explored once the active molecule responsible for the effect on the I<sub>f</sub> current will be isolated. Indeed, we cannot exclude that different molecules may act on these different targets, but our interest is to strictly identify additional and potentially undesired side effects of the molecule specifically targeting the f-channels. Finally, we have now acknowledged that cAMP signaling may also be spatially confined due to the existence of caveolar microdomains. These modifications now appear in the Discussion session. Pages 11/12, lines 289-301(in grey).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>4) Can authors provide the effects of key active components of Tongmai Yangxin (TMYX) on cAMP, if and APs?</p></disp-quote><p>TMYX is composed by a large number of single molecules (see Answer 1 to Reviewer 1), however our study does not identify the active principle that modulates the I<sub>f</sub> current and thus SAN cell rate. We are currently working on this aspect by chemical fractioning of TMYX.</p><p>The experiments presented in this paper demonstrate the following points:</p><p>– TMYX reduces SAN cell rate mainly by a dose-dependent action on the early diastolic depolarization phase;</p><p>– TMYX exerts a dual action on the I<sub>f</sub> current: increases the maximal conductance and decrease the voltage dependence of channel availability; the latter effect prevails at physiological voltages;</p><p>– TMYX does not modulate the intrinsic properties of the channels, as demonstrated by the lack of effect on inside-out condition, but it antagonizes the cAMP-induced activation process. Hence we describe TMYX as a competitive antagonist. Whether this action is exerted at the cAMP binding pocket or elsewhere downstream the functional structural pathways that couples cAMP binding to channel opening is still unclear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Does TMYX modulate PKA activity and its downstream targets?</p></disp-quote><p>The inside-out experiments presented in Figure 5 (and Figure 5-suppement figure 1) clearly show that TMYX antagonizes the direct action of cAMP on f-channels. However, we could not exclude that in the wholecell condition the action of TMYYX could be, either directly or indirectly, influenced by the activity of PKA. As stated in the Answer 2 to Reviewer 1 we believe that a complete study on the action of TMYX on other targets (such as PKA) should be thoroughly explored once the active molecule responsible for the effect on the I<sub>f</sub> current will be isolated. However, since PKA modulates f-currents we followed the reviewer’s suggestion and we tested whether the effect of TMYX on SAN cell rate may also partly depend on an inhibitory action on PKA. We recorded spontaneous action potentials from SAN cells and we compared the effects of TMYX alone and in combination with the PKA inhibitor H-89. We chose to use a concentration of H-89 of 1 µM to avoid the unspecific effects of H-89.

These data are now inserted in the novel Figure 3-supplement figure 2 and discussed in the Result and Discussion sections (Pages 7, lines 168-175 and Page 12/13 lines 314-315) (in grey). This experiment excludes that at rest PKA inhibition influences the inhibitory action of TMYX on rate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) What is dose range of TMYX for in vivo treatment?</p></disp-quote><p>The suggested dose for human in-vivo treatment is generally 4-8 grams qd for 8 weeks. This information was communicated by the Chinese partners and also reported by Fan et al., doi 10.1016/j.jep.2021.114106. This information is now mentioned on Page 3, line 71 (in grey).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The western scientific world is waking up to the therapeutic utility of multi-component medications developed in East Asia over thousands of years. The therapies differ from most western remedies in combining very many chemicals in mixtures that are thought to act in complementary ways, instead of relying on a single chemical to exert the therapeutic effects. This paper applies rigorous experimental procedures to reveal the cellular processes by which the 5 herbal mixed medication known as TMYX exerts its potentially beneficial slowing of the heart. The article is an excellent example of how East Asian traditional medicine can be understood in western scientific terms and so contributes greatly to medical understanding of an important traditional medication.</p><p>The paper is ready for publication.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his kind appreciation of our study. We have now modified the Materials and methods section to provide the latin names (and when possible also the common names), the part of the plants from which the extracts are made, and the relative abundance (%) of each of the 11 components of TMYX. This part now appears in the Materials and methods section. Page 18, lines 408-416 (in grey).</p></body></sub-article></article>
